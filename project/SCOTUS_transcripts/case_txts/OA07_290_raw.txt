 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

 MR. DELLINGER:  Good morning, Mr. Chief
 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Mr. Dellinger.
 

 The Second Amendment was a direct response 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER
 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 

1
2
3
4  argument today in Case 07-290, District of Columbia 
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12  to concern over Article I, Section 8 of the 
13  Constitution, which gave the new national Congress the 
14  surprising, perhaps even the shocking, power to 
organize, arm, and presumably disarm the State militias. 
15
16  What is at issue this morning is the scope and nature of 
17  the individual right protected by the resulting 
18  amendment and the first text to consider is the phrase 
19  protecting a right to keep and bear arms.  In the 
20
21  the phrase "bear arms" used it to refer to the use of 
22  arms in connection with militia service and when Madison 
23  introduced the amendment in the first Congress, he 
24  exactly equated the phrase "bearing arms" with, quote, 
25

debates over the Second Amendment, every person who used 

"rendering military service."  We know this from the 

3
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  inclusion in his draft of a clause exempting those with 
2  religious scruples.  His clause says "The right of the 
3  people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, a 
4  well armed and well regulated militia being the best 
security of a free country, but no person religiously 
5
6  scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render 
7  military service in person." 
 And even if the language of keeping and 
8
9  bearing arms were ambiguous, the amendment's first 
clause confirms that the right is militia-related. 
10
11
12  Mr. Dellinger, it's certainly an odd way in the Second 
13  Amendment to phrase the operative provision.  If it is 
14  limited to State militias, why would they say "the right 
15
16  "state militias have the right to keep arms"? 
17
18  that the phrase "the people" and the phrase "the 
19  militia" were really in -- in sync with each other.  You 
20
21  Farmer uses the phrase "the people are the militia, the 
22  militia are the people." 
23
24  doesn't that cut against you?  If the militia included 
all the people, doesn't the preamble that you rely on 
25

of the people"?  In other words, why wouldn't they say 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if that's right, 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you're right, 

 MR. DELLINGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, I believe 

will see references in the debates of, the Federalist

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One of the concerns, 

provisions, and it seems to me that there is an 

 MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, I do believe it 

Verdugo-Urquidez, all those who are part of the polity. 

interferes with your right to train for or whatever the 
militia has established.  So that --

1  not really restrict the right much at all?  It includes 
2  all the people. 
3
4  includes all the people in the sense of 
5
6  What -- what defines the amendment is the scope and 
7  nature of the right that the people have.  It's, it is a 
8  right to participate in the common defense and you have 
9  a right invocable in court if a Federal regulation 
10
11 
12
13  Mr. Dellinger, of the framers, was not to establish a 
14  practice of amending the Constitution and its important 
15
16  interpretation of the Second Amendment differing from 
17  that of the district court and in Miller and not 
18  advanced particularly in the red brief, but that 
19  conforms the two clauses and in effect delinks them. 
20
21  the purpose I've indicated of simply reaffirming the 
22  existence and the importance of the militia clause. 
23  Those were very important clauses.  As you've indicated, 
24  they're in Article I and Article II.  And so in effect 
25

The first clause I submit can be read consistently with 

the amendment says we reaffirm the right to have a 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Kennedy, I think any 

 MR. DELLINGER:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And this makes, it does --
I think you're write right in the brief to say that the 

1  militia, we've established it, but in addition, there is 
2  a right to bear arms.  Can you comment on that? 
3
4
5
6  preface shouldn't be extraneous.  This means it's not 
7  extraneous.  The Constitution reaffirms the rights, 
8  reaffirm several principles:  The right of the people to 
9  peaceably assemble, the right to be secure in their 
homes, the Tenth Amendment reaffirms the rights, and 
10
11  this is simply a reaffirmation of the militia clause. 
12
13  interpretation that delinks the two clauses as if they 
14  were dealing with related but nonetheless different 
subject matters has that to count against it, and what 
15
16  you don't see in the debates over the Second Amendment 
17  are references to, in those debates, the use of weapons 
18  for personal purposes.  What you see is the clause that, 
19  that literally transposes to this:  "Because a well 
20
21  State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms 
22  shall not be" --
23
24  in both clauses, as I've suggested is the common 
25

regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well the subject is "arms" 

subject, and they're closely related. 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't see how there's 

must be interpreted in light of its obvious purpose to 

1
2  unanimously held in Miller, or at least noted in
 
3  Miller -- I'll leave aside the debate.  The court
 
4  unanimously said in Miller that the Second Amendment
 
5
6  ensure the continuation and render possible the 
7  effectiveness of the military forces. 
8
9  any, any, any contradiction between reading the second 
clause as a -- as a personal guarantee and reading the 
10
11 
first one as assuring the existence of a militia, not 
necessarily a State-managed militia because the militia 
12 
13 
that resisted the British was not State- managed.  But 
why isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to 
14 
assume that since the framers knew that the way militias 
15
were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing 
16 
17 
a law against militias, but by taking away the people's 
weapons -- that was the way militias were destroyed. 
18 
The two clauses go together beautifully:  Since we need 
19 
a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms 
20
21 
shall not be infringed. 
22
23  that the clause is designed to protect the militia, it 
24  -- surely it's the militia that decides whether personal 
25

possession is necessary.  I mean, Miller -- what makes 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 MR. DELLINGER:  I think, as this Court
 

 MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, but once you assume 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

phrase "keep and bear arms," when "bear arms" is 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do you think the 
clause, the second clause, the operative clause, is 

 MR. DELLINGER:  No.  I think --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  Well, then --
 MR. DELLINGER:  -- the second clause, the 

1  no sense is for Miller to require the arm to be 
2  militia-related if the right is not, and the key phrase 
3  is "bear arms."  If people --
4
5
6  related to something other than the militia? 
7
8
9
10
11  referred to -- is referred to in a military context, 
12  that is so that even if you left aside --
13
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It had nothing to do with 
14  the concern of the remote settler to defend himself and 
his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws, 
15
16  wolves and bears and grizzlies and things like that? 
17
 MR. DELLINGER:  That is not the discourse 
18  that is part of the Second Amendment.  And when you read 
19  the debates, the congressional debates, the only use of 
20
21  and --
22
23  important.  Blackstone thought it was important.  He 
24  thought the right of self-defense was inherent, and the 
framers were devoted to Blackstone.  Joseph Story, the 
25

the phrase "keep and bear arms" is a military phrase, 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Blackstone thought it was 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that may be 

use of weapons, a common law right.  And if we're 

reasonableness of the regulation that the District of 
Columbia has.  Now, the --

1  first commentator on the Constitution and a member of 
2  this Court, thought it was a personal guarantee. 
 MR. DELLINGER:  When Blackstone speaks of 
3
4  the personal guarantee, he describes it as one of the 
5
6  constitutionalizing the Blackstonian common law right, 
7  he speaks of a right that is subject to due restrictions 
8  and applies to, quote "such weapons, such as are allowed 
9  by law."  So Blackstone builds in the kind of 
10
11 
12
13  true, but that concedes your main point that there is an 
14  individual right and gets to the separate question of 
whether the regulations at issue here are reasonable. 
15
16
 MR. DELLINGER:  I don't dispute, Mr. Chief 
17  Justice, that the Second Amendment is positive law that 
18  a litigant can invoke in court if a State were to decide 
19  after recent events that it couldn't rely upon the 
Federal Government in natural disasters and wanted to 
20
21  have a State-only militia and wanted to have everybody 
22  trained in the use of a weapon, a Federal law that 
23  interfered with that would be a law that could be 
24  challenged in court by, by an individual.  I mean, I 
25

think the better --

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

militias, on your reading does the Second Amendment have 

 MR. DELLINGER:  It would, Justice Ginsburg, 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it doesn't, as far as 

I know. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dellinger --
 MR. DELLINGER:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- short of that, just to 

1
2
3
4  get your position clear, short of reactivating State 
5
6  any effect today as a restraint on legislation? 
7
8  if the State had a militia and had attributes of the 
9  militia contrary to a Federal law.  And if it didn't --
10
11 
12
 MR. DELLINGER:  As far as I know, today it 
13  doesn't.  And I'm not -- and the Respondents make that, 
14  that argument that the amendment is without a use.  But 
15
16  prohibitions aren't being violated.  I mean --
17
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Your argument is that its 
18  purpose was to prevent the disarming of the organized 
19  militia, isn't that correct?
20
21
22  then how could they -- how could the Framers of the 
23  Second Amendment have thought that it would achieve that 
24  person, because Congress has virtually plenary power 
25

 MR. DELLINGER:  That is correct. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  And if that was the purpose, 

you don't make up a new use for an amendment whose 

over the militia under the militia clauses? 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company

and wanted to maintain national control. 

the Federal Government could, could disband the State 
militias. 

 MR. DELLINGER:  That is because, I think, 
1
2  Justice Alito, that those who wanted to retake State 
3  authority over the militia didn't get everything they 
4  wanted.  Madison actually did this somewhat reluctantly 
5
6
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They got nothing at all, 
7  not everything they wanted.  They got nothing at all. 
8  So long as it was up to the Federal Government to 
9  regulate the militia and to assure that they were armed, 
10
11 
12
13
14  function served by the Second Amendment as far as the 
15
16
 MR. DELLINGER:  It is by no means clear that 
17  the Federal Government could abolish the State militia. 
18  It may be presupposed by the Article I, Section 8, 
19  clauses 15 and 16, and by the Second Amendment that the 
States may have a militia.  That issue has been left 
20
21  open as to whether you could do that, and it can be 
22  called into Federal service but only in particular 
23  circumstances. 
24
25

 MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, but if -- well --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what, what was the 

militia is concerned? 

 Now I think the better argument for the 

other side, if, if there is to be a militia relatedness 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

the case is over. 

1  aspect of the Second Amendment, as we think clear from 
2  all of its terms, then Heller's proposed use of a 
3  handgun has no connection of any kind to the 
4  preservation or efficiency of a militia and therefore 
5
6
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but your 
7  reading of the militia clause, the militia clause 
8  specifically reserves concern rights to the States by 
9  its terms.  And as I understand your reading, you would 
be saying the Second Amendment was designed to take away 
10
11 
or expand upon the rights that are reserved, rather than 
simply guaranteeing what rights were understood to be 
12 
13 
implicit in the Constitution itself. 
14
15
16
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the militia 
17  clause, Article I, Section 8, says certain rights are 
18  reserved to the States with respect to the militia.  And 
19  yet you're telling us now that this was a very important 
right that ensured that they kept arms, but it wasn't 
20
21  listed in the rights that were reserved in the militia 
22  clause. 
 MR. DELLINGER:  The debate over the militia 
23
24  clause -- what is shocking about the militia clauses is 
that this is a, a new national government that for the 
25

 MR. DELLINGER:  I'm not sure I followed the, 

the question exactly, but --

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  first time has the power to create a standing army of 
2  professionals.  The militia were people who came from 
3  the people themselves, put down their weapons of trade. 
4  The States were devoted to the ides of their militia of 
volunteers, and of all the powers granted to the Federal 
5
6  Government one of the most surprising was to say that 
7  Congress shall have the power to organize, arm, and 
8  discipline the militia and to -- even though the 
9  officers could be appointed by the State, the discipline 
had to be according to Congress.  And this was -- this 
10
11  caused a tremendous negative reaction to the proposed 
12  Constitution. 
13
14  Second Amendment doesn't repeal that.  You don't take 
the position that Congress no longer has the power to 
15
16  organize, arm, and discipline the militia, do you? 
17
18
19  it.  And my question is, the question before us, is how 
and to what extent did it supplement it.  And in my view 
20
21  it supplemented it by saying there's a general right to 
22  bear arms quite without reference to the militia either 
23  way. 
24
25

 MR. DELLINGER:  It restricted in our view 
the authority of the Federal Government to interfere 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the Second -- the 

 MR. DELLINGER:  No. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it was supplementing 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

several of you have suggested, and that is that, as the 

1  with the arming of the militia by the States.  And the 
2  word that caused the most focus was to "arm" and that is 
3  to disarm. 
4
different rights are being put together.  One was a 
5
6  textual right to protect the militia.  I think the 
7  better argument for the -- for the other side, for 
8  Mr. Heller, is that the amendment's purpose is militia 
9  protective, but it was overinclusive in the way that 
10
11  court below said, preserving the individual right, 
12  presumably to have guns for personal use, was the best 
13  way to ensure that the militia could serve when called. 
14
15
16  to whatever arm, wherever kept, however you want to 
17  store it, and for the purposes an individual decides, 
18  that is a libertarian ideal.  It's not the text of the 
19  Second Amendment, which is expressly about the security 
20
21  unregulated individual license, as is --
22
23  are saying is that the individual has a right to 
24  challenge a Federal law which in effect would disarm the 
25

liberty, the Blackstonian right, is an unregulated right 

of the State; it's about well-regulated militias, not

7  Mr. Dellinger?  To what extent do you think the similar

17
18  contemporaneous actions of the States, before or at the 
19  time of the adoption of the Second Amendment.
20
21  State amendments are generally written in different --
22  in different terms.  If you're going to protect the kind 
23  of right that is -- that is being spoken of here, 
24  different from the militia right, the plain language to 
do it would be "Congress or the States shall pass no law 
25

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm talking about the 

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm not talking about 

 MR. DELLINGER:  You're talking about at the 

 MR. DELLINGER:  I think that the -- the 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 One of the troublesome aspects of viewing 

1  abridging the right of any person to possess weapons for 
2  personal use."  And that's not the right that is created 
3  here. 
4
this as a right of personal use is that that is the kind 
5
6  of fundamental liberty interest that would create a real 
7  potential for disruption.  Once you unmoor it from -- or 
8  untether it from its connection to the protection of the 
9  State militia, you have the kind of right that could 
easily be restrictions on State and local governments 
10
11  and --
12
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, there's no question 
13  that the English struggled with how to work this.  You 
14  couldn't conceal a gun and you also couldn't carry it, 
15
16
17  Second Amendment is more restrictive or more expansive 
18  of the right than the English Bill of Rights in 1689? 
 MR. DELLINGER:  I think it doesn't address 
19
the same subject matter as the English Bill of Rights. 
20
21  I think it's related to the use of weapons as part of 
22  the civic duty of participating in the common defense, 
23  and it's -- and it's -- it's --
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think that would be more 

but yet you had a right to have it. 

 Let me ask you this:  Do you think the

 MR. DELLINGER:  Parliament could regulate. 

Rights was a guarantee against the crown, and it did not 

 MR. DELLINGER:  Well --
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Here there is some 

1
2  the answer then would be --
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well isn't it -- isn't it 
3
4  more restrictive in the sense that the English Bill of 
5
6  preclude Parliament from passing a statute that would 
7  regulate and perhaps limit --
8
9

11
12  And Blackstone appears to approve of precisely the kinds 
13  of regulations here.  Now --

19  was a group right and much more limited.

 MR. DELLINGER:  That -- that could well --

to keep and bear arms, and they weren't just talking 

17

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 MR. DELLINGER:  Well, the different kind of 

1  about their joining militias; they were talking about 
2  whether they could have arms. 
3
4  right that you're talking about, to take this to the 
question of -- of what the standard ought to be for 
5
6  applying this, even if this extended beyond a 
7  militia-based right, if it did, it sounds more like the 
8  part of an expansive public or personal -- an expansive 
9  personal liberty right, and if it -- if it is, I think 
you ought to consider the effect on the 42 States who 
10
11 
have been getting along fine with State constitutional 
provisions that do expressly protect an individual right 
12 
13 
of -- of weapons for personal use, but in those States, 
they have adopted a reasonableness standard that has 
14 
allowed them to sustain sensible regulation of dangerous 
15
16 
weapons.  And if you --
17
18  reasonable about a total ban on possession? 
 MR. DELLINGER:  What is reasonable about a 
19

4  limit to the public discourse.  If there is an 
individual right to guns for personal use, it's to carry 
5

7  for example, say that no one may have more than 50

States say there are certain kinds of guns that you

say, defense of the home.  And where the government 
here, where the -- where the correct standard has been 
applied, which is where a State or the district has 
carefully balanced the considerations of gun ownership 
and public safety, has eliminated one weapon, the court 
below has an absolutist standard that cannot be 
sustained.  The court below says that once it is 
determined that handguns are, quote, "arms," unquote, 
referred to in the Second Amendment, it is not open to 
the District to ban them.  And that doesn't promote the 
security of a free State.

 If the District passes a ban on machine guns

to raise a militia.  A second possibility is that it 
gives an individual right to a person, but for the 
purpose of allowing people to have guns to form a 
militia.  Assume the second.  If you assume the second, 
I wanted you to respond if you -- unless you have done 
so fully already, to what was the Chief Justice's 
question of why, on the second assumption, this ban on 
handguns, not the other part, of the District of 
Columbia, a total ban, why is that a reasonable 
regulation viewed in terms of the purposes as I 
described them? 

 MR. DELLINGER:  It's a reasonable regulation 

 First, in order -- the amendment speaks of a

12  the State," is something different than a -- a 
13  libertarian right.  Here you have, I think, a fully --
14  on this, particularly on a facial challenge, there is no 
showing that rifles and shotguns are not fully available 
15
16  for all of the purposes of defense. 
17
 There is no indication that the District

19  their own handguns.  You -- you -- there is a step that 
is -- that is missing here.  The well-regulated militia

2
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think that's the better 
3  view, and a number of State courts that have interpreted 
4  analogous provisions have distinguished between the two

 And, obviously, the term "keep" is a word 
7  that I think is something of an embarrassment for an

16  wouldn't say that it has no application there.  As I 
17  say, I think the term "arms," especially if Miller is

19  preamble.  But the way we would look at it --

21 
22

consistent with what you've just said, but it seems to

Article I, Section 8, clauses 15 and 16, the militia

that the parallel provisions in the English Bill of

reference in there to a right to bear as well as to keep

17  would look at it is in order to exercise, for example, 
18  an opportunity to hunt, that you would need to bear the 
19  arms as well.  And I would point you -- I think it's a

22  not saying that if somebody goes hunting deer he is 
23  bearing arms, or are you?

 In one place, although it's not bearing

2
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Somebody going out to -- in 
3  the eighteenth century, someone going out to hunt a deer 
4  would have thought of themselves as bearing arms?  I 
5
6
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I will grant you 
7  this, that "bear arms" in its unmodified form is most 
8  naturally understood to have a military context.  But I 
9  think the burden of the argument on the other side is to 
make it have an exclusively military context.  And as a 
10
11 
number of the briefs have pointed out, that's not borne 
12 
out by the framing sources. 
13
14  arms, it's bearing a gun, I think it's highly relevant 
that Madison and Jefferson with respect to this hunting 
15
16  bill that Jefferson wrote and Madison proposed, 
17  specifically used in the hunting context the phrase 
18  "bear a gun," and so I do think in that context --
19
20
21  would have thought. 
22
23  case that the banning of arms on the part of the 
24  Scottish highlanders and of Catholics in England used 
the term, forbade them to "bear arms"?  It didn't mean 
25

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it's "arms" that has 
the kind of the military -- the martial connotation, I 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wasn't -- wasn't it the

 And then I do think that, even in the
 

1  that could just not join militias; it meant they 
2  couldn't carry arms. 
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  And again, I think various 
3
4  phrases were, were used.  I also think that some of the 
disarmament provisions specifically used the word
 
5
6  "keep."  And so I think there is some independent
 
7  meaning there, which is one point.
 
8
9  context of bearing arms, I will grant you that "arms"
 
has a military connotation and I think Miller would 
10
11 
certainly support that, but I don't think it's an 
12 
exclusively military connotation. 
13
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Not only Miller, but the 
14  Massachusetts declaration.  "The right to keep and bear 
15
16  reading of it. 
17
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Oh, absolutely.  And I 
18  grant you if this, if the Second Amendment said "keep 
19  and bear arms for the common defense" this would be a 
20
21
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  --- the right to keep and 
22  bear -- I'm sorry.  It's one right to keep and bear, not 
23  two rights, to keep and to bear. 
24

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I mean it's -- it's 
my friends from the District that are emphasizing that

different case.  But --

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And you want to talk about 

the standard, and your light's on. 

 I think there are several reasons why a 

1  no word in the Constitution is surplusage.  So I would 
2  say that in a context like this you might want to focus 
3  both on "keep" and on "bear arms." 
4
5
6
 (Laughter.) 
7
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Okay.  I would like to 
8  talk about the standard and my light is indeed on, so 
9  let me do that.
10
11  standard as we suggest in our brief rather than strict 
12  scrutiny is an appropriate standard to be applied in 
13  evaluating these laws.  I think first and foremost, as 
14  our colloquy earlier indicated, there is -- the right to 
bear arms was a preexisting right.  The Second Amendment 
15
16  talks about "the right to bear arms," not just "a right 
17  to bear arms."  And that preexisting always coexisted 
18  with reasonable regulations of firearms. 
19
be sure when you're making the translation from the 
20
21  English Bill of Rights you always have to deal with 
22  parliamentary supremacy.  But it is very striking that, 
23  as Justice Stevens said, the right was conditioned on 
24  the conditions, which I think meant what class you were, 
25

and also subject expressly to the Parliament, the laws 

 And as you pointed out, Justice Souter, to

4  freedom of speech, which referred to the pre-existing

8  because it was pre-existing and that there were some
 
9  regulations upon it, that we would not use strict

14  Amendment context, this Court has recognized -- and I 
point you to the Court's opinion in Robertson against 
15
16  Baldwin, which makes this point as to both the First and 
17  the Second Amendment.  This Court has recognized that 
18  there are certain pre-existing exceptions that are so 
19  well established that you don't really even view them as 
20
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Like libel.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or would you say like

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, that gets to the 

regard it's worth emphasizing that the framers knew 
exactly how to condition a right on militia service, 
because they did it with respect to the grand jury 
clause, and they didn't do it with respect to the Second 
Amendment.

1  protecting yourself against intruders in the home? 
2
3  self-defense component and I don't know that I ever got 
4  a chance to fully answer your question on that, Justice 
Kennedy, which is we would say, notwithstanding the fact 
5
6  that the preamble makes it clear that the preeminent 
7  motive was related to ensuring that the militia remained 
8  a viable option vis-a-vis the standing army, the 
9  operative text is not so limited.  And I think in that 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  at least, in part to protect the right to self-defense 
17  in the home, how could the District code provision 
18  survive under any standard of review where they totally 
19  ban the possession of the type of weapon that's most 
20
21  and shotguns they require, at least what the code says 
22  without adding a supposed gloss that might be produced 
23  in a subsequent case, that even as to long guns and 
24  shotguns they have to be unloaded and disassembled or 
25

commonly used for self-defense, and even as to long guns

well be different than the analysis of the other 

is, that there ought to be an opportunity for the 
District of Columbia to urge its construction, which 
would allow for a relatively robust self-defense 
exception to the trigger lock provision.  And this Court 
could very well, applying Ashwan to prevent --
principles allow for that kind of --

1  breaking into the home?

18  when you hear somebody crawling in your -- your bedroom 
19  window, you can run to your gun, unlock it, load it and 
20
21
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  If that's going to be the 
22  exception, it could clearly be inadequate.  And I think

9
10
11  in my view, it probably wouldn't be. 
12
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There is a lot of talk 
13  about standards and stop words like strict scrutiny. 
14  Does it make a practical difference whether we take your 
standard or the strict scrutiny that was in the D.C. 
15
16  Circuit's opinion?  And specifically there is a whole 
17  panoply of Federal laws restricting gun possession. 
18  Would any of them be jeopardized under your standard? 
19  And the same question with the District scrutiny, does 
20
21
22  world of difference, Justice Ginsburg, because we 
23  certainly take the position, as we have since 
24  consistently since 2001, that the Federal firearm 
25

statutes can be defended as constitutional, and that 

it make any difference? 

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  In our view it makes a 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  would be consistent with this kind of intermediate 
2  scrutiny standard that we propose.  If you apply strict 
3  scrutiny, I think that the result would be quite 
4  different, unfortunately.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, these various 
5
6  phrases under the different standards that are proposed, 
7  "compelling interest," "significant interest," "narrowly 
8  tailored," none of them appear in the Constitution; and 
9  I wonder why in this case we have to articulate an 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
 I'm not sure why we have to articulate some 
18  very intricate standard.  I mean, these standards that 
19  apply in the First Amendment just kind of developed over 
the years as sort of baggage that the First Amendment 
20
21  picked up.  But I don't know why when we are starting 
22  afresh, we would try to articulate a whole standard that 
23  would apply in every case? 
24
25

all-encompassing standard.  Isn't it enough to determine 
the scope of the existing right that the amendment 
refers to, look at the various regulations that were 
available at the time, including you can't take the gun 
to the marketplace and all that, and determine how 
these -- how this restriction and the scope of this 
right looks in relation to those? 

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 
let me say a couple of things about that, which is to 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it did.  It said 

it's just like the First Amendment.  First Amendment has 
exceptions, but strict scrutiny applies.  It says strict 
scrutiny applies here too. 

1  say that if this Court were to decide this case and make 
2  conclusively clear that it really was focused very 
3  narrowly on this case and it was in some respects 
4  applying a sui generis test, we think that would be an 
improvement over the court of appeals opinion, which is 
5
6  subject to more than one reading, but as Justice 
7  Ginsburg's question just said, it's certainly 
8  susceptible to a reading that it embodies strict 
9  scrutiny.  In fact --
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Scalia, I 
23
24  think our principal concern based on the parts of the 
court of appeals opinion that seemed to adopt a very 
25

didn't use the militia prologue to say it's only the 
kind of weapons that would be useful in militia, and 
that are commonly -- commonly held today.  Is there any 
Federal exclusion of weapons that applies to weapons 
that are commonly held today?  I don't know what you're 
worried about.  Machine guns, what else?  Armored 
bullets, what else? 

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that opinion also, it 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But this law didn't 
involve a restriction on machine guns.  It involved an 

1  categorical rule were with respect to machine guns, 
2  because I do think that it is difficult -- I don't want 
3  to foreclose the possibility of the Government, Federal 
4  Government making the argument some day -- but I think 
it is more than a little difficult to say that the one 
5
6  arm that's not protected by the Second Amendment is that 
7  which is the standard issue armament for the National 
8  Guard, and that's what the machine gun is. 
9
10
11  absolute ban.  It involved an absolute carry 
12  prohibition.  Why would you think that the opinion 
13  striking down an absolute ban would also apply to a 
14  narrow one -- narrower one directed solely to machine 
15
16
17  Justice, why one might worry about that is one might 
18  read the language of page 53a of the opinion as 
19  reproduced in the petition appendix that says once it is 
20
21
22  strictly a complete ban because it exempts pre-1976 
23  handguns.  The Federal ban on machine guns is not, 
24  strictly speaking, a ban, because it exempts pre --
pre-law machine guns, and there is something like 
25

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think, Mr. Chief

an arm, then it is not open to the District to ban it. 

 Now, it seems to me that the District is not

1  160,000 of those.
 
2
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that passage doesn't
 
3  mean once it's an arm in the dictionary definition of
 
4  arms.  Once it's an arm in the specialized sense that
 
the opinion referred to it, which is -- which is the 
5
6  type of a weapon that was used in militia, and it is --
7  it is nowadays commonly held. 
8
9
10
11
12  read it that way.  But I would also say that I think 
13  that whatever the definition that the lower court 
14  opinion employed, I do think it's going to be difficult 
over time to sustain the notion -- I mean, the Court of 
15
16  Appeals also talked about lineal descendants.  And it 
17  does seem to me that, you know, just as this Court would 
18  apply the Fourth Amendment to something like heat 
19  imagery, I don't see why this Court wouldn't allow the 
20
21  then I do think that reasonably machine guns come within 
22  the term "arms."

 The Petitioners have had two opportunities

to be too dangerous, and this was a legitimate policy 
choice of the City Council, and they actually prevailed 
in that view. 

1  ban.

9  self-defense in the home with firearms.  They deemed it 
10
11 
12 
13
 The second opportunity that the Petitioners 
14  had to urge this sort of self-defense construction was 
actually in this case in the district court.  We had a

 Certainly the idea that people can guess as 

1
2  to when it is that they might render the firearm 
3  operational is -- is not a one that the Court should 
4  accept, because a person who hears a noise, a person who 
perhaps is living in a neighborhood where there has been 
5
6  a spate of violent crimes, has no idea of when the 
7  District of Columbia would permit her to render the 
8  firearm operational.  And, in fact, there is a 
9  prosecution history not under this specific provision, 
but certainly other under gun prohibition -- laws that 
10
11 
we are challenging here today to prosecute people for 
the possession or for the carrying of a prohibited 
12 
13 
firearm even when the police ruled the shooting has been 
lawful self-defense.

23  a reasonable or a proportionate response on behalf of 
24  the District of Columbia?
25

really good and informative on both sides -- and I'm 
trying to boil down the statistics where there is 
disagreement, and roughly what I get -- and don't 
quarrel with this too much; it's very rough -- that 
80,000 to 100,000 people every year in the United States 
are either killed or wounded in gun-related homicides or 
crimes or accidents or suicides, but suicide is more 
questionable.  That's why I say 80,000 to 100,000. 
 In the District, I guess the number is 

 Now, in light of that, why isn't a ban on

 And so if we assume that the sort of 

preparedness.  Because when people have handguns --

1  reason it was offered by numerous military officers at 
2  the highest levels of the U.S. military in all branches 
3  of service writing in two briefs, they agree with us 
4  that the handgun ban serves to weaken America's military 
5
6  handguns are military arms, they are not just civilian 
7  arms -- they are better prepared and able to use them. 
8  And, certainly, when they join the military forces, they

10
11  military purpose to the Second Amendment is an 
12  individual right, then the handgun ban, as noted by our

11  because there is a big crime problem.  I'm simply

 MR. GURA:  Yes, Your Honor, we must --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So a conscientious 

has no rights under the Second Amendment.  He is not 
going to be part of the militia.  He is not going to be 
part of the common defense, but he still wants to bear 
arms.  You would say that he doesn't have any rights 
under this amendment?

17  It gives us some guidepost as to how we look at the 
18  Second Amendment, but it's not the exclusive purpose of

9  arms are protected or unprotected by the Second

11
12  arms to be appropriate to a militia, why does it not 
13  also limit the kind of people who may have arms? 
14
 MR. GURA:  It does not eliminate the kind of 
people, Your Honor, because the Second Amendment is the 
15
16  right of the people.  And it would certainly be an odd 
17  right that we would have against the Congress, if 
18  Congress could then redefine people out of that right. 
19  Congress could tomorrow declare that nobody is in a

4  subject to militia service, who nevertheless were 
expected to, and oftentimes did, in fact, have guns.

6
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which shows that maybe 
7  you're being unrealistic in thinking that the second 
8  clause is not broader than the first.  It's not at all 
9  uncommon for a legislative provision or a constitutional 
10
11 
12
13  but the -- but the second clause goes beyond the militia 
14  and says the right of the people to keep and bear arms.

17  people.  So why not acknowledge that it's -- it's 
18  broader than the first clause?

4  that and remind us as to the purpose -- one purpose, not 
5
6  the right --
7
8  reaffirm that the provisions in the main text of the 
9  Constitution remain intact?
 MR. GURA:  That's correct, Your Honor.  In 
10
11  fact, that view was taken by William Rawle in his 1828 
12  treatise, view of the Constitution.  Rawle was, of 
13  course, a ratifier of the Second Amendment.  He sat in 
14  the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1790.  And if you look at 
his description of the Second Amendment, he bifurcates 
15
16  it.  First, he discusses the militia clause, and he 
17  lavishes some qualified praise on it.  And then --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you were about to tell 
18
19  us before the course of the questioning began about the 
other purposes that the amendment served.  I'm -- I want 
20
21  to know whether or not, in your view, the operative 
22  clause of the amendment protects, or was designed to 
23  protect in an earlier time, the settler in the 
24  wilderness and his right to have a gun against some 
25

conceivable Federal enactment which would prohibit him

 MR. GURA:  Oh, yes.  Yes, Justice Kennedy. 

common-law English right which the Founders wanted to
 

1  from having any guns? 
2
3  The right of the people to keep and bear arms was 
4  derived from Blackstone.  It was derived from the 
5
6  expand.
 
7
 In fact, the chapter in which Blackstone
 
8  discusses this in his treatise, his fifth auxiliary
 
9  right to arms, is entitled --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21  1790, or whenever, with their rifles, with their 
22  muskets, but only the officers were to bring pistols. 
23  So that, to me, suggests they didn't see pistols as 
24  crucial even then, let alone now.
25

JUSTICE BREYER:  That brings me back to the 
question because Blackstone describes it as a right to 
keep and bear arms "under law."  And since he uses the 
words "under law," he clearly foresees reasonable 
regulation of that right.  And so does the case not 
hinge on, even given all your views, on whether it is or 
is not a reasonable or slightly tougher standard thing 
to do to ban the handgun, while leaving you free to use 
other weapons? 

 I mean, I notice that the militia statute, 

the first one, spoke of people coming to report, in 

 MR. GURA:  Well, certainly they saw --

civilian use.  There is no question of that. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That are not appropriate 

1

 MR. GURA:  Well, my response is that the 
3
4  government can ban arms that are not appropriate for 
5

7  to --
8
9  civilian use.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  For example? 
10
11
 MR. GURA:  For example, I think machine 
12  guns:  It's difficult to imagine a construction of 
13  Miller, or a construction of the lower court's opinion, 
14  that would sanction machine guns or the plastic, 
15
16  of. 
17
18  was the only guidance that we had below, and I think it 
19  was applied faithfully.  Once a weapon is, first of all, 
an "arm" under the dictionary definition -- and Webster 
20
21  has a very useful one -- then you look to see whether 
22  it's an arm that is meant to be protected under the 
23  Second Amendment, and we apply the two-pronged Miller 
24  test.  And usually one would imagine if an arm fails the 
25

undetectable handguns that the Solicitor General spoke 

Miller test because it's not appropriate for common 

 The fact is that this Court's Miller test

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why wouldn't the
 
3  machine gun qualify?  General Clement told us that's
 
4  standard issue in the military.

5
6  that people might be expected to possess commonly in 
7  ordinary use.  That's the other aspect of Miller. 
8  Miller spoke about the militia as encompassing the 
9  notion that people would bring with them arms of the 
10
11
12  parallel --
13
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  At this time -- I would 
14  just like to follow up on what you said, because if you 
were right that it was at that time, yes; but that's not 
15
16  what Miller says.  It says that the gun in question 
17  there was not one that at this time -- this time, the 
18  time of the Miller decision -- has a reasonable 
19  relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a 
well-regulated militia.  So it's talking about this 
20
21  time. 
 MR. GURA:  That's correct.  The time frame 
22
23  that the Court must address is always the present.  The 
24  framers wished to preserve the right to keep and bear 
25

arms.  They wished to preserve the ability of people to

 However, the fact is that Miller spoke very

2  say, a technical obsolescence. 
3
4  strongly about the fact that people were expected to 
bring arms supplied by themselves of the kind in common 
5
6  use at the time.  So if in this time people do not have, 
7  or are not recognized by any court to have, a common 
8  application for, say, a machine gun or a rocket launcher 
9  or some other sort of --

13 
14 
15
16 
17 
 MR. GURA:  At the time that -- even at the 
18
19  time Miller was decided, the civilian arms were pretty 
much the sort that were used in the military.  However, 
20
21  it's hard to imagine how a machine gun could be a 
22  "lineal descendent," to use the D.C. Circuit's wording, 
23  of anything that existed back in 1791, if we want to 
24  look to the framing era.  Machine guns --
25

parallel at the time that the amendment was adopted to 
the machine gun?  In other words, I understand your 
point to be that, although that's useful in modern 
military service, it's not something civilians possess. 
Was there anything like that at the time of the 
adoption, or were the civilian arms exactly the same as 
the ones you'd use in the military? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that 

61
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 MR. GURA:  Your Honor, even within the 

1  Miller, as we're discussing it now, and the whole idea 
2  that the militia clause has a major effect in 
3  interpreting the operative clause is both overinclusive 
4  and underinclusive.  I would have to agree with Justice 
Ginsburg that a machine gun is probably more related to 
5
6  the militia now than a pistol is.  But that -- that 
7  seems to me to be allowing the militia clause to make no 
8  sense out of the operative clause in present-day 
9  circumstances.
10
11  militia understanding, the understanding of the militia 
12  was always that people would bring whatever they had 
13  with them in civilian life.  So if a machine gun, even 
14  though it may be a wonderful --

informing the type of weapon which is protected.

22  faithful to Miller.  I suggest that Miller may be

of any real relevance to the situation that faces the 
homeowner today? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My point is:  Why is that 

 MR. GURA:  It's only of relevance if the 

 MR. GURA:  I agree with Your Honor, and 
certainly in our brief we suggest that the militia 

62
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

duty but is not appropriate for common civilian use,
 

use -- handguns, rifles, and shotguns -- are militarily 
useful weapons. 

1  emphasis of Miller is not useful as a limiting principle 
2  to the type of arms that may be -- that may be 
3  permitted.  Because, on the one hand, there's a great 
4  deal of weaponry that might be wonderful for military 
5
6  which would not be protected even under the Miller
 
7  test's first prong.
 
8
9  civilians today might wish to have in ordinary common
 
10
11 
12
 So we de-emphasize the military aspects of 
13  Miller as being ultimately not very useful guidance for 
14  courts.  And the better guidance would be to emphasize 
15
16  really no trouble applying, and we do this all the time 
17  in constitutional law:  To simply make a decision as to 
18  whether or not whichever arm comes up at issue is an arm 
19  of the kind that you could really reasonably expect 
20
21
22  and "bear," I mean you are -- I think you're on to 
23  something here.  Because you say let's use our common 
24  sense and see what would be the equivalent today.  Fine.

thing, you say:  Fine, just as you could keep pistols 
loaded but not -- not loaded.  You had to keep powder 
upstairs because of the risk of fire.  So today, 
roughly, you can say no handguns in the city because of 
the risk of crime.

1  Massachusetts had a law that said you cannot keep loaded 
2  firearms in the house, right, and you have to keep all 
3  of the bullets and everything and all of the powder

21  about that.  However, I wouldn't draw a complete analogy 
22  between the Boston fire ordinances that Your Honor notes

of leeway in regulating firearms.  There is no dispute

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Not self-defense being the 

analogy, floats up there, but it isn't going to decide 
this case, the Massachusetts statute.  I agree with you 
about that. 

1  "firearm" was not understood to include pistols. 
2  General Gage's inventory of weapons seized from the 
3  Americans in Boston included some 1800 or so firearms 
4  and then 634 pistols.  Nowhere in the Boston code do we 
see a prohibition on keeping loaded pistols in the home. 
5
6  And certainly the idea that -- that self-defense is a 
7  harm is one that is --
8
9  harm.  And I agree with you that this, the firearm

 What you've suddenly given me the idea of 
14  doing, which I'm testing, is to focus not just on what 
don't just look to see whether 
15
16  it's a cannon or a machine gun, but look to see what the 
17  purpose of this regulation is, and does it make sense in 
18  terms of having the possibility of people trained in 
19  firearms?
 Let's look at those military briefs.  Let's 
20
21  say that the generals have it right, there is some kind 
22  of right to keep trained in the use of firearms subject

18  Pennsylvania and Vermont, did refer to self-defense as a

9  self-defense.  The rest refer only to common defense; is 
10
11
 MR. GURA:  On their literal text, yes.  But 
12  judges did not interpret them that way, for example in 
13  North Carolina --
14
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I understand that judicial 
interpretation sometimes is controlling and sometimes is

16  not.  But the text itself does draw a distinction, just 
17  as the Second Amendment does.  It doesn't mention 
18  self-defense.

Virginia's proposals, it's agreed by the Petitioners 
that Virginia was the model for the Bill of Rights and 
specifically, of course, for the Second Amendment.

1  was -- it was one of three States, as I understand, that 
2  did go beyond it.  But the provocation for getting into 
3  the subject, as I understand it, was, in each instance 
4  including Pennsylvania, concern over the national 
government's power over militias under Article 1. 
5

7  the history that way.  Certainly there is agreement that 
8  the militia clauses in the Constitution were 
9  controversial.  And there were separate amendments that 
10

13

19  and then we have the 11th proposed amendment, which 
speaks exactly to the -- reverting control over the

2  for no reason.  The fact is that the militia concerns 
3  were heard and they were voted down, and the Second 
4  Amendment concerns were the ones that the Federalists 
were easily agreeable to because the right to keep and

18  the modern trigger-lock provisions are aimed squarely at

such laws, which is to require safe storage, for 
example, in a safe.  And that is a reasonable 
limitation.  It's a strict scrutiny limitation. 
Whatever standard of view we may wish to apply, I think, 
would encompass a safe storage provision.

1  a firearm stored consistently with the District's law, 
2  that is, a firearm which is disassembled and unloaded, 
3  nothing would prevent a child --
4

6  able to reassemble the pistol.

8  However, better safe storage approach is the one used by 
9  the majority of jurisdictions, I believe, that do have 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
 But this is not a safe storage provision 
15
16  because we have specific exceptions that allow you to 
17  actually use the firearm in recreational shooting and 
18  also in a place of business.  And we have litigation 
19  history from Washington, D.C., that tells us that we are 
not supposed to have an operable firearm for purposes of 
20
21  self-defense because they simply do not trust people to 
22  defend themselves in our home.  And -- and self-defense 
23  is the heart of the Second Amendment right.  That is 
24  what Blackstone was getting at when he spoke of the

12  to mollify the anti-Federalists' concerns.  The Second 
13  Amendment is clearly addressed to Pennsylvania and New 
14  Hampshire and New York and all these other States that 
were demanding a right to keep and bear arms, and there 
15
16  was always understood to be an individual right because 
17  that is the way in which the right that was violated by

I'm finished.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Thinking of your exchange 
22  with the Chief Justice and think of the trigger lock in

you want thousands of judges all over the United States

 MR. GURA:  When a fundamental right is at 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If it's a fundamental 

1  to be deciding that kind of question rather than the 
2  city councils and the legislatures that have decided it 
3  in the context of passing laws?  I mean, isn't there an 
4  issue here and a problem with respect to having courts 
5
6  that trigger-lock argument? 
7
8  stake, there is a role for judicial review, Your Honor. 
9  We are not going to see a thousand judges review such 
laws because Washington, D.C.'s is the only example of 
10
11 
it. 
12
13  right, what about licensing?  One piece -- we've talked 
14  about trigger locks, we've talked about the ban on 
handguns, but there is also a requirement that there be 
15
16  a license for possession of a handgun.  Assuming you're 
17  right on the first question, that you couldn't flatly 
18  ban handguns, what about a requirement that you obtain a 
19  license to carry -- to have a handgun?
 MR. GURA:  Justice Ginsburg, that would 
20
21  depend on the licensing law itself.  We don't have a 
22  problem with the concept of licensing so long as it's 
23  done --

2  22-4504(a).  Wouldn't that be okay -- would that be 
3  okay?  It says that you have to have a license to carry.

Are you, in effect, reading the amendment to say that

every right in the Constitution.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  So we can -- consistent 

 MR. GURA:  Well, yes, Your Honor, to some 
extent, except the word "unreasonable" is the one that 

1
2  with your view, we can simply read this:  "It shall not 
3  be unreasonably infringed"?

7  standard looks like. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You wouldn't put it that 
8

10
11
12  Your Honor.  Certainly --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- you would define 
14  "reasonable" in light of the restrictions that existed

 MR. GURA:  Well, those statistics might be

7  there is a role for judicial review.  And you can't just 
8  grab at statistics -- and some of the statistics that 
9  were used here are very weak, and studies that have been 
rejected by the National Academy of Sciences repeatedly. 
10

I mean, we don't really have -- it's hard to say that 
12 
those laws --

by looking to the statistics, I'm not suggesting that 
15
16  there is only sort of one reasonable response to them. 
17  I want to know whether -- whether the policymakers may 
18  look to them; and I take it your answer is yes? 
 MR. GURA:  To some degree, yes, policymakers 
19
have to be informed by what's going on in order to make 
20
21  policy.  However, there are constitutional limitations 
22  enforced by courts that are going to limit those 
23  policies.  And when you have a ban which bans 40 percent 
24  of all weapons that are the type of weapons used by

 MR. GURA:  No, Your Honor, the fact is that 
10
11  we can always debate these things, but the object of the

2  address first why this law is reasonable and should be

 But here's where I want to address the 
18
19  trigger lock.  Here's why it doesn't matter for the 
20
21  important here is the ban on handguns.  And it also 
22  believes that you're entitled to have a functional, 
23  usable weapon for self-defense in the home, and that's 
24  why this is a very proportionate law.

handgun law.  The District believes that what is 

 The other version is just a loop that goes 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if

sense to say the best self-defense arm is a rifle, as 

 MR. DELLINGER:  It is -- there has been no 

 MR. DELLINGER:  Yes. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it really make 

1  proportionate, in other words you're saying your 
2  interest is allowing self-defense in the home --
3
4
5
6  opposed to a pistol? 
7
8  showing here that a rifle or a shotgun is inadequate for 
9  the purposes of self-defense in this facial challenge.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there anything to show 
10
11  that the District Council ever considered the issue of 
12  self-defense?  That -- because they banned handguns and 
13  they had this provision on the trigger lock which -- and 
14  the issue -- my question with the trigger lock doesn't 
have to do with whether trigger locks are generally a 
15
16  good idea.  It's whether you're ever allowed to take it 
17  off for purposes of defense.  There's no -- is there 
18  anything to show that the -- that the council actually 
19  considered what sort of weapon is appropriate for 
20
21
22  District of Columbia about the right of self-defense 
23  that apply to this.  But here's the most important 
24  point.  It cannot affect the validity of the handgun 
25

law.  If you disagree with us that my statements are not 

self-defense? 

 MR. DELLINGER:  There are decisions in the 

85
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  sufficient to say that we believe that the law should be 
2  read, given the self-defense compulsion, to allow 
3  whatever use makes it functional, if you don't agree 
4  with that and if you think there's a controversy on this 
point, because we believe you should have a functional 
5
6  firearm available in the home of law-abiding citizens 
7  who wish one, if we are wrong about that and the trigger 
8  lock is invalid, that has no effect on the handgun ban. 
9
 That is to say, the trigger lock applies to 
all weapons.  If it's valid and it means what they say 
10
11  it does, none of the weapons would work.  We don't need 
12  a handgun; it's unusable.  If it's invalid or if it has 
13  the construction we believe, it cannot possibly affect 
14  the handgun law.  If you strike down the trigger lock 
15
16  think it's where we're happy to be if all we have to do 
17  is to make clear in the trigger lock law what we have 
18  said here today, that it's, it's available for 
19  self-defense.

7  the D.C. law phrased in those terms?  In other words, if 
8  you can't have a handgun at all, why do you have a 
9  separate provision saying that you can't carry it 
10
11
12  carry provision, you cannot carry unregistered firearms. 
13  That's just a general requirement, that firearms be 
14  registered.  You're not allowed to register handguns is 
15
16
17  about why a ban is unreasonable, the one thing we know 
18  the Second Amendment is not about is it's not about the 
19  interest of collectors.  Some people collect guns the 
20
21  were about then prohibiting someone from having a 
22  particular type of gun would prevent them from 
23  completing the set.  But the notion --

you're eliminating the one type of weapon -- this law is

7  and movable, that can be taken into schools and onto the 
8  Metro, can be easily stolen and transmitted among --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm asking about the 
constitutional standard you apply to a hypothetical 
10
11  statute which would prohibit the guns Justice Scalia 
12  described.  What is your position as to the validity of 
13  such a hypothetical law?

standard.  You would ask whether the ban is one that's 
15
16  carefully balanced considerations of gun ownership and 
17  public safety.  I don't see how, once we are in the land 
18  where you -- where there is a right, there is a far 
19  weaker case if there is any need for public safety to --
to limit the number of guns one has.  Here there is an

1  West, North and South.  Here you have legislation that 
2  is adopted by a group of citizens in the District, 
3  operating under the authority of Congress, but it is 
4  local legislation.  And if it's still good law, that 
States and local governments across the country can 
5
6  strike these balances, as they have, it would be deeply 
7  ironic to preclude the District of Columbia as being the 
8  only place that could enact legislation free of the 
9  strictures of the Second Amendment.
 And when you ask about the statistics, what 
10
11  is critical here is not to apply the kind of categorical 
12  standard the court below did or a kind of strict 
13  scrutiny that would strike this law down.  This is an 
14  area, unlike areas where government regulation is 
presumptively illegitimate, this text contemplates 
15
16  regulation of inherently dangerous weapons.  And where 
17  the battle -- the great battle over methodology, to 
18  which Justice Breyer replied, in these briefs --
19  indicates that this is the kind of right -- where you 
have disputes among experts, it's a kind of right where 
20
21  even if you recognize it, deference needs to be given to 
22  the legislative resolution rather than have courts try 
23  to decide how best to resolve the statistical and 
24  methodological debates.
