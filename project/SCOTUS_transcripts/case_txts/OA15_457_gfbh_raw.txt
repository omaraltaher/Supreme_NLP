CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in case 15-457, Microsoft Corporation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v. Baker. 

 

            

Mr. Fisher. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

Years after Livesay, the rules committee 

 

 

 

 

 

considered what options should be available to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs who find themselves in precisely the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation the plaintiffs here claim to have found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves, having class certification denied in a case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where they claim the individual claims make it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impractical to litigate ahead on an individualized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis.  In the system that the rules committee adopted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that this Court endorsed in Rule 23(f) in the system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary review, the plaintiff's theory here, with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the voluntary dismissal tactic they wish to use, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upend that carefully considered rule. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fisher --

  

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  And it would --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Please.

MR. FISHER:  And it would also contravene 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statutory and case law on which it is based. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And may I ask, a lot of your 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

4 

briefing in this case operates on the premise that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really was -- that this claim will spring back, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was some kind of reservation --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- of rights such that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim would spring back.  And I'm wondering why you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that.  Where do you get that from? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, was this something that the parties, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just a general understanding in this case that they were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissing it, but that it would spring back if they won 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appeal? 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  No.  There's no such 

  

  

 

 

 

understanding, Justice Kagan, and there's two places to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look.  And I can answer your question why we get to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise that we lead off our brief with. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The first is the -- the stipulation and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment itself, which are in the back of the Petition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix, from pages 34a to 39a.  And in 39a, that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order of judgment, and it simply says that the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court grants the motion to dismiss with prejudice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so what the plaintiffs say is because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language in the stipulation -- and here I can only

imagine the language in .4 on Pet. App. 36a where they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say:  After the court has entered final order and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment, plaintiffs intend to appeal the order denying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class certification. 

 

5 

            

Because of that piece of the stipulation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's the plaintiffs who take the position -- and now I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to read to you, sorry, one more page here.  On 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 45 of the red brief, they say it most explicitly, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think:  The Respondents say: Respondents did not abandon 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their rights.  The voluntary dismissal is -- and they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, unequivocal, that:  The dismissal was predicated on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserving the right to challenge the court's ruling and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to revive their claims should they prevail on appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think you have two problems here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan.  The first is the actual order doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly say what they claim it says, but it seems to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the presumption that they are adopting and that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit seemed to have adopted. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I read your brief, 

    

   

 

 

 

so I have largely bought into that assumption.  And if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that were true, it does seem to me like you have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awfully good argument, but it would not be final, then, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under 1291.  And I guess I was just asking why it was 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that your brief essentially, you know, for two-thirds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the brief or more, bought into that assumption, whether

there was something that I didn't see or some general 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

understanding that the parties had that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested that assumption was the right one to make. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  No.  The parties had no such 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

understanding.  All you have is what's in the paper. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We started our brief with that argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that seems to be what the Ninth Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted.  And so we started by accepting the premise of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth Circuit.  But --

  

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You are not --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  -- make no mistake --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You are not embracing 

  

 

 

 

 

that argument. 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  No.  We are arguing in the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

alternative, Justice Ginsburg.  So what we're saying is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they did somehow manage to reserve a right to revive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their claims, what they've really done is dismiss 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without prejudice, and there's no finality. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well --

  

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  But --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Either they were 

  

 

 

 

 

talking about their original claims, which included the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class allegation, and they argued, not only at page 45 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but also at page 49, that if the class certification 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling is overturned, they, then, will have Article III 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

standing, for example, because they do have particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

injury, you know, the spreading of the costs of their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys' fees, incentive payments they -- they might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive. 

            

MR. FISHER:  Let me -- let me be clear, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice.  Two things about that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

The first is their defense to our mootness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument is predicated on the assumption that their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims spring back to life on remanded; they could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves spring them back to life.  And so if that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case, we agree they are not moot, but then we go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to our finality argument. 

 

 

 

 

            

But just to be precise about their argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in defense of mootness, they do not propound any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cost-spreading or attorneys'-fee-spreading argument, 

 

 

 

like the one that was made in Roper.  They do not make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that argument.  The only argument they make is an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that they would have the right to an incentive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award if they -- if they prevailed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And there's two problems with that, 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice.  The first is that only prevailing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs, according to lower courts, get an incentive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award.  And by definition, if they're in the mootness 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument, they will have dismissed their claims and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailed.

And even then, the idea of an incentive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

award, which this Court has never endorsed, of course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but does exist in the lower courts, is based on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notion that plaintiffs shoulder the burden of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  And here, you're talking about plaintiffs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

who filed a complaint and now would be out of the case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and would show no -- no burden whatsoever.  So I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that there can be an argument that they would get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an incentive award, even if this case were somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed to proceed. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

should be something?  The -- the lower courts did not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address that question.  And -- and that question seems, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least in part, dependent on fact, that -- that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you would think the lower courts might have some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better view on than we do. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

question? 

            

Would that suggest a remand on that 

   

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Kagan, if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court held that the plaintiffs' claims cannot be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revived, and so, therefore, the only question is whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a mootness problem, we think the law is clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough -- and the reasons I just described, that it's so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear that they wouldn't be entitled to an incentive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award based on individual claims they brought and

immediately dismissed, but you could hold that the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is flat-out moot. 

 

 

9 

            

            

            

If there were any doubt about that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  There was no discovery here? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  There was no discovery because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what we had is motion practice that was based on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier case where there were 16 months of discovery in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the earlier case.  Remember, the -- the lawyers came in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with new plaintiffs in this case, and the parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stipulated that, because of the 16-month -- month record 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was developed the first time around, we could just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go straight to motions practice about whether class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification was --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fisher, you've been 

  

 

 

 

 

arguing this in the alternative, but what do you think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the critical fact for you?  Is it that they dismissed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their claim voluntarily?  Is it that they dismissed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their claim voluntarily with prejudice?  Is it that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is not moot? 

 

 

 

            

What's your best argument and what's your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best critical fact that defines the outcome in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

MR. FISHER:  I think the easiest way to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

decide the case, Justice Sotomayor, is to say when they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed their claims with prejudice, their claims were

MR. FISHER: -- that's been consistent. 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that there's no -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, I personally don't like absolutes. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so I haven't been 

   

  

 

 

 

able to imagine a situation in which a case is dismissed 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with prejudice, but where there may be some issues that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should survive. 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And I don't -- actually 

   

  

 

 

 

haven't done research on this, so I may be answering --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking a question that's already been answered by our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case law, but let's assume an attorney sanction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something of that nature. 

 

 

 

            

If I don't buy an absolute, how do I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

articulate it? 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You dismiss with 

  

 

 

 

prejudice all your claims, are all appeals are waived, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or all appeals but?  How do -- how do we answer that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  So I think you can answer it in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

two steps.  The first is you can start with the Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Deakins case, which we cite at the beginning of our

mootness section of our brief, which I think says quite 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly that when plaintiffs voluntarily abandon their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

claims, they cannot be revived. 

 

 

 

 

            

And so then the only question is whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's an exception to that rule.  And I think that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there may be an exception for situations where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs dismiss their claims after a ruling from the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial court that decimates their claims on the merits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so as the Court put it in the old Thompson case in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 1800s, when all that was left was just to make the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal more expeditious when the plaintiffs have already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lost on the merits, then a voluntary dismissal does not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily preclude an appeal. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that the --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you give me an example 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of what that would -- you have an antitrust case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the court insist that the market be interpreted so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowly that the case doesn't make much sense, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that work? 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, actually, the 

  

 

 

 

hypothetical you just said, Justice Kennedy, is quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close to the Thompson case itself, which was an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

antitrust case.  And the Court issued a ruling pretrial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that said you're going to have to prove unreasonableness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the restraint of trade.  And the plaintiffs said,

well, all we can prove is a restraint of trade.  And if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

you're going to tell us we have to prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonableness, we can't do that. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How about --

  

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  And so --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  --

  

 

  

evidentiary ruling --

 

 

an adverse evidentiary ruling under Daubert this expert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't testify? 

 

            

            

case. 

            

MR. FISHER:  By and large, that is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it decimates your 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  Well, if it truly decimated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your case, then perhaps, at least according to some of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lower courts, you could take an appeal from a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntary dismissal.  But the garden variety evidentiary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ruling would not allow that tactic.  And that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Evans case, which goes all the way back to shortly after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the founding where the government itself was at trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a district judge precluded one of the government's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses from testifying.  The government then 

  

 

 

 

 

dismissed, tried to take an appeal to this Court, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court dismissed the appeal. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And what you're creating 

  

 

 

 

 

with that is not just -- it's not just a small loophole. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What you're creating is an enormous gap, because any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

13 

interlocutory order could be characterized by the party 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that loses as something that's critical to the case.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any interlocutory order could then -- could then be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appealed. 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Alito, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

you could take an absolutely firm position to preclude 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that possibility.  But I think if you were to approach 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case like Justice Sotomayor does and say, can we at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least leave open for another day the possibility of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretrial ruling that truly decimated the merits allowing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an appeal, I think you could say that too. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what -- what --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  If I could add --

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- would be the definition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of a ruling -- well, what is decimate the merits?  What 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does that mean? 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think that you have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

effectively already lost on the merits.  It's impossible 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to go forward because of a ruling that goes to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substance of your claims. 

 

 

 

            

And I would just hasten to add that whatever 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the rule might be and whether it's absolute or whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's an exception, this is the easiest case possible, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the Court has said over and over again that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class-certification ruling has nothing to do with the

merits.  So that's --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't understand how it 

    

 

 

 

 

14 

normally works, which I'm sure trial judges must face 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this all the time.  The plaintiff has lost a motion.  He 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has nothing left of his case.  He says, Judge, I have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing really left of my case.  They can move for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summary judgment or -- and let them move for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant. You -- I -- it must be weird if the defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't.  I mean, I can't imagine such a case. 

    

   

   

 

 

            

But if he didn't, I guess the trial court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would say, defendant, move for summary judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then if he just refused 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, I don't know what would happen.  I guess the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff could go and ask for a mandamus of the trial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court to insist that they move for summary judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The case is over.  How does it work. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think by and large, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer, in your hypothetical, the defendant, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, would move for summary judgment.  Or if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant didn't, the district judge might bring the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties in for a conference and say, is there anything 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left of this case?  Should we go ahead?  And of course 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's going to get worked out in the ordinary course of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It would be the defendant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

who moves for summary judgment, and then it will be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entered in his favor.  And then the plaintiff, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, will have an appeal. 

 

 

 

 

            

that's --

 

            

MR. FISHER:  That's right.  And -- and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I would think that was the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

normal system. 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Absolutely.  And that's what's 

  

  

 

 

 

so different than this case, is that the plaintiffs even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now don't claim there's anything wrong with the judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against them.  They asked --

  

 

 

 

            

lot --

 

            

them. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  -- for the judgment against 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's a lot left 

   

  

 

 

 

of their case, but just the individual claims, not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class claims; right? 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, there are no class 

  

 

 

 

 

 

claims, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  So what's 

  

  

 

 

 

left of their case are the individual claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, they've given up their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

individual claims.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I know, but --

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that's like any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

appeal.  When you have an issue -- a claim left and you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lose, you appeal.  Now, the only thing that's different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about this case, of course, is that the -- their loss 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- was entered voluntarily, and I think the critical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point you argue, whatever they're appealing, it isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they shouldn't have lost. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's not as if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's nothing left of the case.  What's left of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is their -- their individual claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, their claims have been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

given away, remember, Mr. Chief Justice.  And I -- maybe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if I -- I don't want to miss what you're asking me. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well --

  

 

 

MR. FISHER:  But either they have revived --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

either they've reserved the right to revive their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims, in which case I would agree, their individual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims are still alive, but we don't have a final 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment --

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I --

    

  

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  -- or they've given them away. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Their -- their 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

17 

claims are alive prior to their -- their voluntary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal. 

            

            

            

MR. FISHER:  That's right. 

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 

  

 

 

MR. FISHER:  That's right.  But when they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

ask for that voluntarily -- that voluntary dismissal, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district judge gave them exactly what they wanted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And on appeal, they're not claim anything wrong with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that dismissal.  They're not claiming -- so there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adversity in the way Justice Breyer --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you explain to me just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how does it work in an ordinary case?  A class action is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special in this respect.  I bring a class action. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The defendant, I say, has 

   

  

 

 

 

told the biggest lie anyone has ever told and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates 19 statutes.  Unfortunately, my client is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

damaged only to the extent of 10 cents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I'd like to bring a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

class action.  All right?  Now it's going to be worth 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  And the judge says, no, you can't. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Uh-huh.

judge's ruling is wrong?  He doesn't want to pursue a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim that's only going to be worth 10 cents, because, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that, he's most likely to get no more than two cents

for the lawyer himself. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So -- so what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is supposed to happen? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, that's exactly the 

  

 

 

 

 

problem the rules committee considered, Justice Breyer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And what they held is that in that situation, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs can go to a court of appeals and ask for a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary appeal and say -- they can argue just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly as you did, that our claim isn't worth it on an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized basis and for that reason, you should a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant us a right to an interlocutory appeal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

If that right, however, is -- I'm sorry.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that request is denied by the court of appeals, then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs are in the exact position of the plaintiffs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Livesay --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in -- in --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  -- where the Court unanimously 

  

 

 

 

 

 

held --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In that -- that position, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because this Court rejected the death-knell rule.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

may well be a death-knell, but then this Court said no

MR. FISHER:  Exactly, Justice Ginsburg.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

the Court rejected it unanimously for many good reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Most importantly, it rejected it because of the proper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance between trial courts and courts of appeals.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if the plaintiffs say we have a death-knell 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation and even if it really is, there are very real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs on the judicial system that it would be imposed by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a right to automatic appeal. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

sorry. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So just --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- out of curiosity -- I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have any idea 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the statistics show about how often appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts grant interlocutory appeals under 23(f)? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Yes.  That's in the briefing, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice.  It's in a couple of footnotes.  And 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's around 20 -- a little bit over 20 percent.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it --

 

            

use? 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And what criteria did they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  Well, they're allowed under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rule to use any criteria they like.  One of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leading --

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what did they really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

use?  Did they, you know, basically take a peek at the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

merits?  What did they do? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Yes.  They -- they might take a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

peek under the -- well, you -- if the merits of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class-certification motion, of course.  Sometimes a peek 

   

  

 

 

 

under the rug of the merits of the case itself to see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's worth their time, as the Ninth Circuit may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well have done here. 

 

 

 

            

Also, as I was just saying, the plaintiffs 

   

 

 

 

 

 

can argue that -- that, otherwise, it's the death-knell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their case.  And so the exact argument the plaintiffs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are making here, the exact problem they're presenting to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court is what the rules committee said in its notes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a proper basis for a Rule 23(f) appeals. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And we made one change, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, that would be favorable to the plaintiffs; that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, 1292(b) is double discretion.  You have to get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permission from the district court and then again from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court of appeals.  In 23(f), it's only the court of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals.  You don't need to get permission from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court. 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  That's right, Justice Ginsburg. 

  

 

 

 

 

And so there's actually two things that are important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  One is, yes, plaintiffs are better off in class

actions than in ordinary cases for that reason. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

And on the other hand, the cost to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial system of allowing an automatic right to appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be manufactured the way they would here are higher in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the class action realm.  And that's partly because of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 23(c), which says that denials of class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification or grants, for that matter, are inherently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tentative and even district judge -- district judges can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconsider them. 

 

            

So a plaintiff faced with a genuine 

   

   

 

 

death-knell situation, this Court held in Livesay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should go forward.  If they believe in their case, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should go forward.  The district judge might reconsider 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

his view.  The plaintiffs might want to repackage the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way they're making their arguments, whether it's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification of the class or the particular claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're bringing.  If that fails, they should go ahead, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe motions practice will end the case.  But if they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe in their case, the Court held in Livesay the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs have a remedy to go forward and then take an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal at that point. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but -- but as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a practical matter, that's not going to happen, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, they have just their individual claim.  It's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's worth in Justice Breyer's case 10 cents.  And you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

say, well, you can go forward with the whole litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

that's premised on class allegations and something is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving an enormous amount of discovery like this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  I mean, you know, their point is that you win 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the practical reality is they're not going to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward. 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of all, and maybe a 10-cent hypothetical is rather in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the extreme, but the --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Given the expense --

  

 

 

 

 

 

given the expense of litigation, it can be $10,000 and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's still not going to be worth it to go forward. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, it might well be for a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of reasons, Mr. Chief Justice.  First of all, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is added as an empirical matter that the 1996 study 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's cited in the briefs that led to Rule 23(f) cites 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple instances of plaintiffs going ahead in cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after they've been denied class certification.  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a couple of reasons why they might do that; take 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case as an example. 

 

 

 

 

            

The State laws under which they're trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevail on -- on the merits have fee shifting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions, and so the Court is quite familiar with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scenarios where plaintiffs go ahead with low dollar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases or, indeed, no dollar cases with the prospect of

fee shifting ahead.  And, you know, that should not be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

taken lightly.  That's something the plaintiffs can use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to their advantage. 

 

 

            

Also, the key is whether the plaintiffs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe in their case, I think.  If the plaintiffs 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

believe in their case, I think there's every reason to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go ahead.  The difficulty is, if the plaintiffs don't so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much believe in their case, every incentive is to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have litigation go the way this has, which is ten years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of fighting about class certification with not a single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion yet on the merits.  And that's the difficulty of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a situation like this to the judicial system, not just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the cost of appellate courts, of being forced to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weigh in on potentially very difficult and complex class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification issues that would otherwise wash out of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case, but also defendants being forced to undergo a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tactic that it does not have when the converse is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  In other words, where there's a grant of class 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification, defendants have no way to manufacture an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automatic right to appeal. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is --

  

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  And that was another element --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is a case where 

   

  

 

 

 

there were two Rule 23(f) motions, both denied, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about the same court of appeals. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

Was there any effort when this appeal, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

case that's now before us, to -- to get it to the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

panel?  We had three different panels, didn't we, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the... 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

precise, actually there are two different cases, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a first case where class certification was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied, and then Rule 23(f) was denied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And then you have --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  And that case went away --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 

   

-- two cases here --

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  Right.  And then you had the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

second case, which is the one we have here, and then it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went up to Rule 23(f), to the Ninth Circuit, and a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motions panel looked at that and denied review.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the way the Ninth Circuit procedures work is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motions panels are simply different than case merits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

panels. 

            

Microsoft did ask, upon the filing of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal that is before you right now, that if the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the outset.  But what the Ninth Circuit did was scoot it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over to our regular panel, and that's how we got to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where we are today.

that decided the case, finally decided the case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparently thought that this -- there was a proper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground for this to go forward as a class -- as a class 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action, right? 

 

25 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  No.  No, Justice Alito --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they said the class --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the class allegations were improperly dismissed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Right.  So --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Were they not? 

  

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  Let me say two things.  One is, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be precise about what the Ninth Circuit panel held, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all they held was that the district judge abused his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion by misreading a Ninth Circuit case concerning 

   

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not class certification was appropriate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Ninth Circuit did not consider whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class certification was actually appropriate, or even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the causation argument that is at the center of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Microsoft's objection to class certification was 

 

 

 

 

 

correct. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, okay.  Well, let me --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

let me state it more precisely.  The panel -- the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final decision of the Ninth Circuit was that there had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been an error by the district court regarding --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- class action 

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

certification. 

26 

            

MR. FISHER:  That's correct, and I think it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

goes to the nature and actually the benefit of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 23(f)'s discretionary review system, which is, just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to use this Court as an example, it might deny 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certiorari on a meritorious claim, thinking, though, 

   

 

 

 

 

that the error would be harmless in any event or some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other ground.  So the Ninth Circuit may well have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought that ultimately, even though the district judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might have misread one of its cases, ultimately class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification is going to be denied anyway.  Ultimately 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plaintiffs are going to lose on the merits anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's not worth their time. 

 

 

 

 

            

And so what this plaintiff tactic is about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing, again, is foisting onto courts of appeals, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals that often are actually directly turned down and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring them to expend significant resources --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  That -- I -- I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

understand all that.  But what I'm -- I'm getting at is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if this -- if a 23(f) appeal had been presented to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

panel that decided the case that is now before us, can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say that they would have refused to hear the appeal? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  I might be able to say that.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

will actually tell you that just by happenstance --

MR. FISHER:  -- one of the judges who was on

panel that denied the 23(f) petition was on the merits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

panel that decided the case in front of you today.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that one judge we know, at least, voted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reject the 23(f) appeal, but was forced into taking this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one instead. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how would that be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

consistent with the -- the reasoning of the panel that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided the case that's before us? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Because, remember, go back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the idea why we have discretionary review in the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place, Justice Alito.  It's because courts of appeals, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if they're confronted with a situation where the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court might have made an error in an initial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling on class certification, there's a few things that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

may cause a court of appeals nevertheless to deny 23(f) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal. 

            

The first is the Ninth Circuit may say to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself, this case is just in its infancy.  We'd like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some evidence to be entered and some motions practice to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take place.  Maybe the plaintiffs will reformulate their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims.  Maybe the district judge will reconsider for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

himself his class certification motions.  And maybe the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court proceedings will just take care of this.

Ninth Circuit may also have thought, look: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The claims here, on the merits, look remarkably weak, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so why should we expend our resources answering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult class certification issues against the 

 

 

 

 

 

backdrop of a case that's going to die out anyways on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the merits. 

 

            

And there are any of a number of other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  In fact, the rules committee notes go so far 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to say just simply docket congestion can be a reason 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the court of appeals to say, look:  This looks like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a run-of-the-mill appeal.  We have other -- other more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important items in front of us. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the -- the important point here, though, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the plaintiffs' system would completely upend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that regime.  The rules committee thought very hard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about Rule 23(f), and as I said, and the committee notes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered the exact problem the plaintiffs are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

propounding to you here, and said the best we can do is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary review. 

 

            

Remember, the plaintiffs are actually better 

 

 

 

 

 

off -- and I think this might have been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg's point -- post-1998, than they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for 20 years after Livesay.  Even in the situation that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court faced in Livesay, it unanimously held that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there should be no automatic immediate appeal from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

denials of class certification.  And so even in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

circumstance, the Court was quite firm, and I think for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some very good reasons. 

 

 

 

            

If there are any other questions about what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I've said so far, I'm happy to answer them; otherwise, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll reserve the remainder of my time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Stris. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If a district court commits prejudicial 

   

 

 

 

nonharmless error, our core position is that a plaintiff 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can bet her whole case on its reversal.  And so I'd like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to begin where Justice Kagan began and explain why, as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural matter, the parties have been litigating this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case as if the claims would spring back to life, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then I'd like to explain why I think that's permitted. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So in this case we followed a 20-year-old 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit procedure in seeking a conditional 

   

 

 

 

 

dismissal with prejudice, and I -- I think I need to put 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

some meat on the bones here so we kind of understand the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure. 

            

This date -- and it's not unusual for the

Ninth Circuit.  This dates back to 1995 in a case called 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

Concha that interpreted Rule 41.  And I'm going to quote 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from that case. 

 

 

            

Here's what the Ninth Circuit said:  Quote, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"A voluntary dismissal with prejudice permits the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate court to review the action that caused him to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismiss his case."  In Concha it was the denial of a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand motion. 

 

            

If the plaintiff prevails on appeal and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court ruling is reversed, then the claim is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remanded to the district court for further proceedings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it's not a surprise that most of my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend Mr. Fisher's brief is kind of under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposition that the claims would spring back to life, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that's what everyone assumed in -- in the lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  We followed that procedure and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  For some reason, that 

  

 

 

 

 

wasn't a class action. 

   

 

            

action --

 

            

MR. STRIS:  That -- that was not a class 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- but here you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have -- you -- you have the individual claim.  You may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say it's not worth a candle, but you -- you have the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual claim, and that's what you have relinquished 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in order to take your appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  So I don't agree with that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

31 

characterization, Justice Ginsburg.  I'm going to answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it directly, but what I was saying a moment ago was just 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to explain that procedurally, what we attempted to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was conditionally dismiss so that everything would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spring back to life. 

 

 

 

            

question --

 

            

            

            

Now, I -- I would like to answer your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just before the --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. STRIS:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So there -- there is this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one case that suggested that that is what would happen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, is this a procedure that's used in the Ninth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit?  What is it used for?  Why did people think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this was the governing law? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  So, yes, it's not one case.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you look at pages I think 3 to 4 of our appellate brief 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Ninth Circuit, we cite many cases where this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened in the Ninth Circuit.  And, in fact, I -- I see 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the look of surprise on your face, but this is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure in many circuits. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You didn't do that. 

  

 

 

 

 

You said -- you said you -- a piece of paper I have 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, whether it's a little technical, but it says this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action you moved and would be granted, should be

dismissed with prejudice. 

 

 

32 

            

Then in the next paragraph you say you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend to appeal.  Is that a reservation? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

            

MR. STRIS:  It is, and let me explain. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  How do I know that it's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

reservation?  There's a lot of case law that says you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't just express a future intent, and we're being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

technical.  It says you have to make a conditional 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal.  We dismiss under the condition that we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are -- you know, that we're going to appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  I understand, Justice Breyer. 

    

 

 

 

I'm going to explain why it is a conditional dismissal, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I definitely will get back to your question, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg, about why I think this is permitted in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the class action context. 

 

 

 

            

So here's why, Justice Breyer.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

long -- there's a long line of cases from the Ninth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit about how you enter a conditional dismissal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

You have to make clear that there's no settlement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's a requirement in the Ninth Circuit.  We did that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in paragraph 6.  It's on page 36A of the Petition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix.  And then you have to make clear that after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final judgment, you intend to appeal a prior adverse 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

order.  We did that in paragraph 4.  This is Petition 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix 36A.

And so you don't have to take my word for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

it.  If you look at appellate brief in the Ninth Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages 3 to 4 where we explain what we were doing that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth Circuit accepted, and we cite a number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases where this is used, we followed the procedure in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth Circuit for doing a conditional --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There isn't --

  

 

 

 

MR. STRIS:  -- dismissal with prejudice. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- there isn't --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe now is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

time for you to answer Justice Ginsburg's question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

love to. 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  I -- I -- I would -- I would 

    

   

   

   

 

 

So the reason why I think this is permitted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in the class action context is because there's two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things you need to do in -- in order to have your claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spring back to life.  One, you have to condition your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal, but that is to avoid a waiver argument.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then secondly, you have to show prejudicial error.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let me explain why that applies here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what -- our theory is that what we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are individual claims that we're entitled to litigate on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a class basis -- of course, if we satisfy Rule 23.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so our theory is that when the class allegations were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

stricken, we were deprived of that substantial right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let me ask you, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

34 

you mentioned Rule 23.  The rule makers went through a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of work to figure out what to do with an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interlocutory ruling on class action status.  And it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

came up with 23(f).  And this device seems to be just a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way to get around 23(f). 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and on your theory, would you at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least, before you go to this voluntary dismissal, have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to try the 23(f) route? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  I -- so I think every 

    

   

 

 

 

plaintiffs' lawyer certainly would, and it goes to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

core of why --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But would you have to on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your theory? 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  I don't -- you would not have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, but let me tell you why plaintiffs' lawyers would, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- because it points up why at why this is not an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end run around Rule 23. 

 

 

 

 

            

So there's nothing in the balance struck by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 23(f) that suggests, we submit, any intent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either penalize or prevent plaintiffs from obtaining a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final judgment by betting their case.  And if you look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the Advisory Committee notes -- we cite this in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief -- there -- there was a circuit split at the time

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

as to whether or not this procedure was appropriate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Advisory Committee was aware of that.  They -- they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

cited the Second Circuit case from 1990 that permitted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this. 

            

So Microsoft's position, in essence, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 23(f) rewrote the definition of finality without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioning it.  Now --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they could have.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the rule makers wanted to have these class action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions go up on appeal as of right, they could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made it, or asked Congress to make it, one of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interlocutory orders that is immediately appealable, 

 

 

 

 

 

like a preliminary injunction. 

   

 

            

MR. STRIS:  Certainly.  But then the -- the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff would have been risking nothing.  In other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, to go so far as to say you have an appeal of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right and -- and your case continues is different than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what happened here. 

 

 

            

Let me use Livesay as an example.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

it kind of points up at the point.  So in Livesay, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cecil Livesay -- this -- this is at page 106 of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Joint Appendix in Livesay.  Cecil Livesay told the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth Circuit that even if his certification was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied, he was going to continue litigating his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual claim.

Page 16 of the Joint Appendix in Livesay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cecil Livesay continued litigating his individual claim, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even after it was decertified.  And as a result, that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case continued and it was actually settled for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$1.3 million, even after the Livesays lost in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court.  That's the critical difference between an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interlocutory mechanism and a voluntary conditional 

   

 

 

 

dismissal. 

            

dismissal --

 

            

If you engage in a voluntarily conditional 

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- did -- did it go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back when it went back?  Was it litigated as a class 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action? 

            

            

            

MR. STRIS:  Well, it couldn't be because --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 

  

 

MR. STRIS:  -- but -- but they settled as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class action.  And -- and that points up at the nature 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a true interlocutory appeal.  A true interlocutory 

    

   

 

 

 

appeal is not like a conditional dismissal. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you have just said, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

take it, that, yes, it's the plaintiff's choice.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff can ignore 23(f) and say I'm going to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

myself in a position where I have an appeal of right and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- and not invoke through discretion of the court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals.  So for any time that a corporation -- that a

class action is brought against a corporation, 23(f) is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

out the window. 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  Let me try to answer, I think I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can give, hopefully, a more satisfactory answer in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

following way. 

 

            

Even though 23(f) exists, a plaintiff could 

   

 

 

 

 

choose, after a class allegation is stricken, to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

litigate their individual claims to final judgment and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then appeal.  There's nothing in Rule 23(f) that -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, that's what Microsoft suggests you should do.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's nothing in Rule 23(f) to suggest that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it was an escape hatch, if you were, that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to lock the front door.  So the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They -- well, of course. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23(f) is about a class action.  It's not about an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual action. 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  No, no, no.  I -- perhaps I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

miscommunicated.  What I'm saying is, if you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class that is not certified and you think that's wrong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you eventually litigate the case on the -- on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits through a trial and you win, you can appeal from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that final judgment, and the fact that you could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken an interlocutory appeal earlier under 23(f) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't change that.  If you tried to take interlocutory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal earlier under 23(f), it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the --

  

 

 

 

38 

MR. STRIS:  -- doesn't change that. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- but any final 

  

 

 

 

 

judgment, when it's all over, you can bring up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything. 

            

MR. STRIS:  Right.  And our -- our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

principle, our theory of this case, is that any final 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment means that the case is over and there's nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left for the district court to do.  This is a final 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment.  It may be manufactured, but a manufactured 

   

  

 

 

 

 

final judgment doesn't mean that the case isn't final. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It doesn't --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could --

  

 

 

MR. STRIS:  Underline --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I take you back, 

   

  

 

 

 

sorry, just to this sort of nonreservation reservation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point.  You said there were two things that you did that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fit with the Ninth Circuit's procedure.  You said it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't settled, and you said that you were going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal; is that right? 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  We said we were going to appeal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a prior adverse order. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  So where -- where 

  

  

 

 

 

 

did those requirements come from?  You know, if I looked 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at what cases would I find that that's what you have to

do in order to prejudice -- in order to dismiss 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something with prejudice in such a way that it springs 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to life if you win the appeal? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  So the cases -- the cases you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find on pages 2 to 3 or 3 to 4 of our Ninth Circuit 

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  Concha is the leading case.  There's other Ninth 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit cases.  I think Olmstead is one of them.  It 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cites a First Circuit case called Johns, I think. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, but the problem is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it is a problem for you -- that there are other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits.  And other circuits have a different rule.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

mean, my law clerk has one here.  I guess she got it out 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the brief. 

 

 

            

It says, "A settlement" -- let's see.  Where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are we here?  It's wright.  It's called Wright.  It's 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

from the Eight Circuit, or Fifth, I don't know.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, "An expression of intent is not a reservation of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to appeal." 

 

 

            

So you're in a dilemma.  If you say I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

condition my dismissal upon my later appealing, you run 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the case, which happens to be our case rather than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth Circuit's called Lybrand, which says then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment isn't final.  But if you don't reserve 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something, you're in the box you're in right now and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is over.  And so you think of this thing called

"intent," which is perhaps an unknown creature before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

you thought of it.  I don't know. 

    

 

 

 

 

            

And then you say, aha.  We're not really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditionally dismissing, so we're not out for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason, but we all are reserving an intent, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, we get to say that it's final and can appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the issue.  The Rules Committee, having worried about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

yours and similar problems, says here's what we'll do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for you.  We'll give you that (f) interlocutory appeal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, why should I not think about the case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just that way? 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  So I -- I think even if you do 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think about the case that way, we're right, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer, and -- and here's why.  You certainly need to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismiss with conditional prejudice.  If you think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not happen here, then I think the case comes to you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on those terms.  The Ninth Circuit thought that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But if you dismiss with conditional 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice, what you said is that this runs square up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against Livesay.  That's where I disagree with you.  And 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

the reason I disagree with you is Livesay was a true 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interlocutory appeal.  It was an ongoing case.  And that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not a formalistic distinction with no practical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

significance.  That's the whole enchilada in my view, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and here's why:

41 

            

In an ongoing case, we -- we know that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Stevens and the Court in Livesay didn't think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that people didn't have the right to continue, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they did, why would the various circuits have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed these unbelievably complicated and difficult 

 

 

 

 

 

tests where they were doing evidentiary hearings in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court and then reviewing it on appeal? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In an interlocutory posture, the core 

 

 

 

 

 

problem with the death-knell doctrine was that it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unworkable.  Of course it undermined the final judgment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  But if you have a true final judgment, whether 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's manufactured or not, and this goes back to your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, Justice Ginsburg.  I -- I feel like I haven't 

    

   

   

 

 

 

really, you know, vigorously advocated my position on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this. 

              

I really believe that Rule 23(f) says 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing on this question because it was changing things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was giving people options, but they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interlocutory options.  They were options where the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

presumption was not that the case would be stayed.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption was not that if you lost, you couldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue litigating your individual claim.  And -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the response of my friend, Mr. Fisher, in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs is:  Oh, well.  That argument is too cute by 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half.  Because in reality, in the death-knell setting, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

42 

people weren't doing that. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, what is the 

  

 

 

 

 

circuit split on this? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. STRIS:  On which issue? 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On this very issue of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

these conditional appeals.  I'll call them without 

  

 

 

 

 

 

consent.  Because in the criminal area, I'm aware that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government and the defendant can agree to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserve an appeal on a search issue, for example. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. STRIS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But if there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

agreement, then you plead guilty; you've waived.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to be a separate procedure that you're describing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

What's the circuit split? 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  So I'll -- I'll -- I'm going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer that and I want to say three things. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The first is there's actually a series of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

circuit splits.  There's a circuit split on whether this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

can be done in the multiclaim context where the Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit and Federal Circuit say you can.  They say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they -- they embrace the same theory.  And they say if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have a core claim that you really -- it's your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primary claim and it's dismissed a 12(b)(6) summary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

judgment, but your peripheral claim exists -- persists, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every circuit would say you could dismiss that without

prejudice forever and take your appeal.  But the Second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

Circuit and the Federal Circuit say you can dismiss the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peripheral claim with conditional prejudice. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's a different 

   

  

 

 

question.  But -- and you've spoken a lot about Ninth 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit precedent. 

 

            

But what is your best support in any case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from this Court for the proposition that a voluntary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditional dismissal with prejudice is a final 

   

 

 

 

 

decision? 

            

MR. STRIS:  In -- in Procter & Gamble, Your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  And in Procter & Gamble, you have a discovery 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

order saying that the United States had to turn over a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grand jury transcript.  If you read the briefing, if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at the oral argument, the parties conceded it had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no effect on the -- the -- the plaintiff's case, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's case.  It was a purely --

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that had everything 

  

 

 

 

 

to do with the merits because the argument was secrecy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the government's position was, well, if we turn over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the transcript, we've -- we've lost, the whole thing is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the government secrecy plea.  So they were seeking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially to review a merits ruling that is rejecting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the secrecy plea. 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  Well, I don't think I agree, 

   

   

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

44 

Justice Ginsburg.  It was an antitrust case where the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government had antitrust claims against the soap 

 

 

 

 

 

 

companies.  And --

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they were ordered 

  

 

 

 

 

to -- the government was ordered to turn over a grand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury transcript; right? 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  That's correct.  And the reason 

  

  

 

 

 

 

this is important and it answers Justice Alito's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is, the government -- that was a collateral 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

order that the government felt strongly that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't have to obey.  The -- the -- the Court did not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order them under Rule 37 to turn it over or we're going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to terminate the case. 

 

 

 

            

The government, Justice Alito, went to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court and said:  When you decide what sanction you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want -- because it was likely, as Procter & Gamble 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed out, that they just would have imposed an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary sanction or an adverse-inference sanction. 

 

 

 

 

 

The government said:  Please don't do that.  Please 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

impose a terminating sanction so we can appeal what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would otherwise be an interlocutory ruling. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it's one thing when a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

party who suffered a very serious adverse ruling on an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interlocutory order says:  Okay, we give up; go ahead 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and enter judgment for the other side.  That's one

thing. 

            

It's quite another thing, possibly, when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

party that has suffered this ruling moves for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntary dismissal.  An order cannot be final unless it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defeats every thing that you asked for.  So any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility that you would get attorney's fees or an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive award or anything else, if that -- if you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keeping that still on the table, if that is still on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

table, then the order isn't final --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. STRIS:  Well, I --

   

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- I would say.  And the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

only basis for rejecting everything that you might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibly get was your request -- if you read the order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that way, was your request that it be -- that it be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected with prejudice. 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  But -- but that's precisely what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened in Procter & Gamble and that's precisely the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that Procter & Gamble made.  The United States, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito --

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, tell me what's wrong 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with that as a matter of first principles. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  Well, what's wrong with our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

position, or with rejecting our position? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  With what I just said. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

MR. STRIS:  I think what's wrong with that

is it runs square up against what the long-standing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of finality has always been.  This Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

never held, Justice Alito, that a technical final 

   

 

 

 

 

 

judgment for practical considerations is not final.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, this Court has repeatedly said, and I quote, "a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final judgment always is a final decision." 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And that's true because that -- the point of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the final judgment rule is that if there's nothing left 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the district court to do, you can take an appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The -- the mere possibility of appellate reversal has no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bearing on whether a case is final or not; otherwise, no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment would ever be final. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, no.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you're -- you're -- the reversal that you're looking for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not go to the merits of the judgment that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntarily agreed to have entered against you.  It's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what raises the Article III question.  Nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you're arguing on appeal is going to change the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that you lose. 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  So I was answering a finality 

   

   

  

 

 

question, and I'd like to -- I'd like to explain it and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then pivot back to that. 

 

 

 

 

            

What I'm saying is as a matter of whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this satisfies Rule 1291, the -- the fact that things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could spring back to life if we win on appeal is

irrelevant, because any judgment could spring back to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life if you win on appeal.  Appellate reversal is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant to the question of finality. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, you've asked a slightly different 

   

 

 

 

question, I would submit, Mr. Chief Justice, which is: 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well, don't we have an adverseness problem under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III?  And I think the answer there is no as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well.  Over a hundred years ago in Ketchum, that we cite 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this on page 29 of the red brief, the Court made clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that consent -- and that was a case involving literally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a settlement -- doesn't undermine jurisdiction.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

presents a merit question of waiver. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

Let me read you what --

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's not simply the fact that you consented.  It is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the arguments you're making do not go -- they're not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why you should win, because you've already had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment entered against you.  It's one thing -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like a normal appeal, if you've got a judgment entered 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

against you and you have arguments why it shouldn't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been.  But you told the district court to enter a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment against you, so you can't argue that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't have done that. 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  So I guess there's a few things 

   

   

  

 

 

 

going on there.  The reason I disagree is I think that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

there's a question of jurisdiction, a question of 

   

   

 

 

 

waiver, and then a question of appellate procedure. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

48 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about Procter & 

  

 

 

 

 

Gamble, which you -- you've cited a number of times in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this argument?  But I thought that that decision said a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses a complaint may not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

appeal that decision. 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  Oh, no, no.  So there's a long 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

line of cases that say a voluntary nonsuit, which is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal without prejudice, can appeal.  And that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

obviously right, because the plaintiff could refile that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case at any time. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in Procter & Gamble, 

   

  

 

 

 

the Court was very careful to say when the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed dismissal for failure to obey, it had lost on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the merits. 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  And what --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That is not your case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  Oh, it most certainly is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because what the Court meant there was had lost on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits of the discovery ruling.  If you read it in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, both parties agree -- you can look at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing; you can look at the oral argument -- both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sides concede that the discovery ruling saying you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to turn over the grand jury transcript did not touch on

the claim at all.  It did not make it so the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

couldn't win.  It didn't impair the claim. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

So back to your question, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The three levels of analysis.  For appellate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, there has to be finality and adverseness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I actually think those are easy questions for us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's nothing left for the district court to do.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that -- that it could have something to do if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's an appeal has never made a judgment nonfinal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On adverseness, we didn't consent to this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We -- we -- we asked for a voluntary dismissal, but we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did it with a condition.  It's exactly the same as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Procter & Gamble.  When the Court analyzed the waiver 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question, they said:  Well, you may have consented to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the dismissal, but you did it so you could appeal the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior adverse ruling. 

 

 

            

And in oral arguments, there's an exchange 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between Abe Fortas, who represented Procter & Gamble, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and Justice Frankfurter, where it's clear that that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a waiver case.  And what Justice Frankfurter said was: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well, they may have consented to having the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed, but --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there anything terrible 

  

 

 

 

 

that would happen if, say, the precedent leaves this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open, and looking to try to simplify procedure, we'd

say:  If we take the other side, we leave to people in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your position.  Ask the Court of appeals for permission 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under F. 

 

            

Now, sometimes they'll wrongfully deny it. 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

Well, if they wrongly deny it, here's what you do.  Go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigate your case and lose, or give up and then appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that final judgment for them. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, there could be a few cases where that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't work either.  But they're likely to be so few and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

far between that the simplicity of that and people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowing what to do is better than having 14 different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases in conflict in the different circuits and trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to figure out what we're trying to figure out now. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What's the answer to what I've just said? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  The answer, Justice Breyer, is I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think a number of terrible things happen.  The first one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is you restrict the ability of parties to do this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bilaterally, which happens much more often than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unilaterally.  We went and did research and tried to see 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how often this procedure was used, and it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interesting.  It -- it's used several times a year for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- since Rule 23(f) had been passed, but in many of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those cases, the parties agree, and I'll tell you why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because after class certification is denied, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff decides that she does want to -- she is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

willing to continue litigating her individual claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

She'd prefer to take an appeal, but she can't get one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under 23(f) so she's okay, I'm going to keep litigating, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the defendants realize this plaintiff is going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keep litigating.  And you know what?  It doesn't make 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any sense, as you said earlier, to litigate a 10-cent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim, or as you said, Mr. Chief Justice, even a $10,000 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  So let's agree that this claim can be dismissed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with conditional prejudice and then we'll go up on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue of class certification, which is really what this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case about anyway. 

 

 

            

Under Microsoft's rule, it's not simple, 

 

 

 

 

 

because it's a jurisdictional matter and that would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibited.  That's number one. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose we have a case 

   

  

 

 

 

before the district court and the only issue, disputed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, is a pure question of law and the plaintiff says, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't want to bother with asking a district judge to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve this question of law.  Judge, enter a voluntary 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal of my complaint.  So the tribunal that will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine the question of law is the three-judge panel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the court of appeals and it skipped over the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  Your -- your theory would -- would cover that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  Oh, certainly not.  Certainly 

  

  

 

 

 

not.  The -- the -- the practical backstop is 28 U.S.C.

2111.  There's a reason why this has not been used by 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs frequently, and it won't.  Because you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

to show prejudicial error.  It doesn't matter -- your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example is an extreme one.  Of course you couldn't do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  But in even more run-of-the-mill examples, an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary ruling, a discovery ruling, you wouldn't get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reversal. 

            

But I really want to go back to your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, Justice Breyer, because at the end of the day, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if there's not some serious practical downside, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand the allure of basically saying you shouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be able to manufacture finality.  There are very serious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

downsides and reasons to stick with the long settled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of the term.  There's the bilateral issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I mentioned. 

   

            

There's also the reality of what will happen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in class cases, and here's what I mean.  Under our rule, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you lose the appeal, if we lose the appeal, the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is over.  If we win the appeal, the stakes are better 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

known.  If you reject our rule, if you say that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits that have said this is impermissible, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly as a jurisdictional matter or right, here's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

what's going to happen.  You're going to have small 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollar value individual claims that are abandoned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without regard to merit.  This case is a perfect

example. 

            

You heard my friend Mr. Fisher.  One of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges that was on the 23(f) panel was also on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits panel.  Microsoft responded to our 23(f) petition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by saying there's no death-knell here.  This isn't a --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a case where the plaintiffs are going to stop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigating.  There's five plaintiffs' firms, that's 

  

 

 

 

 

probably why 23(f) was denied, and so the upshot is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many small dollar claims will be abandoned. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, all large claims will be litigated, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's not good either because they'll be litigated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without knowing the stakes, and if some of them actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to trial, we're going to have piecemeal trials. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I would actually suggest that rejecting the 

 

 

 

 

 

rule of the Ninth Circuit here is more inconsistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with this -- the --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask you something 

   

  

 

 

 

--

            

MR. STRIS:  -- on their final judgment rule. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- before your time is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out about the mechanics of this. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the Ninth Circuit didn't say you were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to a class action.  They said district --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

district court, you made this mistake, now you decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question.  District court decides again, no class

action.  Then you can do this again, right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. STRIS:  I -- I --

    

   

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's over 23(f) and go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right back --

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  So that's true as a -- as a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional matter, but not really and here's why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The idea that a -- an issue can come up multiple times 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on appeal, whether it's certification or not, that's an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incident of a district court not deciding -- deciding an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue on fewer than all of the grounds that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible.  That can happen after a trial.  That could 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

happen at any point. 

 

 

 

            

The -- the -- when we talk about piecemeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals, what we're worried about is, is there an issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would have been mooted or revisited later in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  I would submit that precisely that is what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't happen in the 23(b)(3) class context --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where in the briefs can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I find the three splits that you didn't get to?  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talked about the Second and the Federal Circuit.  Where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the brief can I go for the other two? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS:  So I don't think that the splits 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

are addressed in -- in the brief.  I took your question 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to mean this principle of conditional dismissal --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. STRIS.  -- are there splits.  I -- I --

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

55 

we didn't have occasion to -- to brief it because we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were kind of addressing the direct question before the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court.  But I -- I think if you look at -- if you look 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at Gabelli, if you look at Purdy, if you look at Gary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plastic, that sort of the line of Second Circuit cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'll -- you'll see the -- the strong difference of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion between the various courts. 

 

 

 

 

            

Also, if you look at, I think it's footnote 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 of our brief, the one that refers to rulemaking, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traces the history.  The -- this is an issue, this issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not new.  For -- for seven or eight years the rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makers debated as a policy matter which side of this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate was right, and they couldn't come to agreement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And there's six memos, Your Honor, that are cited there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the reporter of the appellate Advisory Committee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrote and it chronicles the circuit splits -- I know 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is a very exciting topic to me, but --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. STRIS:  -- it chronicles the circuit's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

splits in a -- in a lot of detail, and -- and you can 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see the policy arguments on both sides. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I -- I suppose in conclusion, if I could 

   

   

   

 

 

 

leave you with anything, it would be this:  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular issue about conditional prejudice dismissals

and its implications not just in the class setting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

but -- but writ large, is very complicated.  And, again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can look at the -- the debate and the transfer of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the rules committee.  It has significant implications. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

At -- at the end of the day, although it may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

feel counterintuitive, our view is that the policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate is -- the -- the status quo is on our side.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what I mean by that is we have a technical final 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment.  The -- the core of Microsoft's position is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that practical considerations, policy arguments, I don't 

   

 

 

 

 

agree with them.  I'm on the other side, people who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think this is a good practice, but if you believe that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this isn't right for policy reasons, just as this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has expressed in the reverse situation, when you have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nontechnical final judgment, but you're thinking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using practical considerations to make it final through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the collateral order doctrine, et cetera, that that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be done through rulemaking.  We submit that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of change in the other direction should be done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through rulemaking.  Thank you.

four points. 

 

57 

            

First, to address the 23(f) rule and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulemaking that led to it, I'd like to say a couple of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things.  First, my friend says that the committee that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted Rule 23(f) was aware of the circuit split and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some courts having allowed this procedure they'd like to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go forward with, and that's a rather remarkable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statement. 

            

What you find if you look at that footnote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where that case is cited is you find the committee's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

report saying that automatic appeals are not allowed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citing Livesay, and there was a "but see" to the one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stray case that had gone the other way.  And the reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why the committee thought it was in the teeth of Livesay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, of course, because Livesay held that denials of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class certification are inherently interlocutory, and 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- imagine the plaintiff themselves talked a lot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about how Livesay itself played out.  Imagine if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff themselves in Livesay had gone back to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court and said, now that we know from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme Court we're not allowed to take interlocutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal, what we'd like to do is dismiss our claims with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reservation of rights of going forward on them if we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevail in the court of appeals, because otherwise it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the death-knell of our case.  The district judge would

have said that that's just the same thing.  And, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

course, the district judge would have been right and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's exactly what the rules committee thought, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll just read --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's not quite --

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's not quite right.  You deny 23(f) and there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice -- or no choice.  You have to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- you can go ahead with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your individual claim.  They are betting their case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  All right.  So --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If they dismiss the case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and they don't win on the procedural issue, that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end of the case.  You --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  But two responses, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor.  I'm sorry to interrupt. 

  

 

 

 

            

Two responses.  First, remember the 

  

 

 

 

plaintiff in Livesay, under the death-knell doctrine, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can take an appeal only if they represented and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persuaded the district court that otherwise their case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was over.  So in practical terms, it's precisely the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same thing.  And that's what the rules committee 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought.  And I'll just read you one sentence from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committee notes.  They say:  An order denying 

  

  

 

 

 

 

certification may confront the plaintiff with a

situation in which the only sure path to appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59 

review is to by -- proceeding to final judgment on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits of that individual's claim and then taking an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal. 

            

So the rules committee considered this exact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question and thought the only way to get an appeal for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure was to litigate the case ahead.  And my friend said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

--

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FISHER:  -- this is really --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you account for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the circuit split? 

 

 

            

            

MR. FISHER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what -- what -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears, and I've not studied this part of the issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carefully, but that there's a lot of circuits permitting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

these conditional appeals. 

 

 

            

MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

think there's two levels to that question you're asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me.  The first is, on the exact question here as to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class certification decisions, there's an old Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit decision which has been called into doubt many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times and never had anything done with it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then the only other thing you have on my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend's side is the Ninth Circuit case that immediately

preceded ours that brought this issue up to you.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until the Ninth Circuit allowed this a of couple years 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 

ago, no court was allowing it in the class certification 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

realm. 

            

And the important thing to understand about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other split, which he calls the bigger split of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking it outside the class action, is all of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases are predicated on the notion that the plaintiff's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim has been destroyed on the merits.  And that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the Ninth Circuit made a wrong turn here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Even if you accept that, as I think you were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calling, Justice Sotomayor, a more flexible rule, this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

case cannot possibly satisfy it, because what the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit missed is a denial of class certification has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

zero to do with the merits.  And this Court has said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that over and over and over again. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so the phrase my friend used that he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would like to have is something that just doesn't exist: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A right to appeal, reserving the right on a procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim that has nothing to do with the correctness of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment below.  The only counterpart that exists in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law to that is Criminal Rule 11.  And there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil -- there's no civil counterpart. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so when these are complicated questions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as my friend says they are, and perhaps in some ways, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

don't think on the facts of this case it is, but there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are difficult questions about appealability and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like.  What the Court has said time again in Swint and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mohawk, most recently, and going back further in Amcam 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61 

in the class action context, is the Rules Committee is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the place to resolve those questions.  And the Rules 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Committee carefully considered this question and came up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a solution that we simply ask the Court to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faithful to today. 

 

 

            

So two other points, if I have time.  First 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of all, my friend talked a lot about Ninth Circuit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure and Ninth Circuit case law.  But the only case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law from this Court that's relevant is the Deakins case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which holds that if you dismiss a case voluntarily, it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not spring back to life, that is, of course, unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a problem with the entry of judgment that you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove is lack of the ordinary appeal.  But otherwise, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not spring back to life. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that leaves him with Procter & Gamble. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

And I think the Court is exactly right that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government argued Procter & Gamble on the premise, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court accepted the premise that the earlier order in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that case had caused the government to, quote, "lose on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the merits."  And the government did not reserve a right 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to revive its claims or anything like that, because that

was not the argument the government made. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so as my friend describes Procter & 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62 

Gamble, he might have made an argument like that might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been Procter & Gamble's argument, but that was not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the argument that this Court accepted and the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made.  They are trying to make a very different argument 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

than the Court accepted in Procter & Gamble. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And if you have any doubt about that, look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the cases on which Procter & Gamble is based.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thompson case, on the one hand, and what the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called the familiar rule that a plaintiff who cannot --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff cannot appeal after having voluntarily 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed the claims, on the other.  And what the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said is, this case is like Thompson.  This is like the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case where your claim is decimated on the merits.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so Procter & Gamble is not a problem. 

   

   

 

 

 

            

And so let me leave you with one final 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought, which is I agree with my friend that this case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have serious implications.  We think if you rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for Microsoft, all you're doing is leaving a status quo 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in place from Livesay and Rule 23(f) and the like, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their argument would apply outside of class actions to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any pretrial order on which the plaintiff would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willing to bet their case, and that would be a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious incursion on Rule 1291 and all the case law upon
