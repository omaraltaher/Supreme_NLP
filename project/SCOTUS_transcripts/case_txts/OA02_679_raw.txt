CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-679, the Desert Palace, doing business as


Caesars Palace Hotel, v. Costa.


Mr. Ricciardi.  Am I pronouncing your name


correctly?


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. RICCIARDI


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. RICCIARDI:  It's Ricciardi, sir.


QUESTION:  Mr. Ricciardi.


MR. RICCIARDI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case involves the extraordinary situation


in the law where the burden of proof is shifted to a 

defendant.  Courts have recognized this type of burden


shift in certain limited situations, certain torts, and in


1989 this Court recognized that burden shift in Title VII


cases.


We are here today because the court below has


held and the respondent argues that the Civil Rights Act


Amendment of 1991 shifts the burden of proof to the


defendant in virtually all Title VII disparate treatment


cases.  That conclusion does not follow from the text of


the Civil Rights Act, nor does it make sense based on this

Court's history of fashioning the orderly presentation of


proof in Title VII cases.


The Civil Rights Act of 1991 was passed in part


as a response to certain decisions of this Court.  One of


those decisions was Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins where the


Court recognized that in certain limited situations in a


Title VII disparate treatment case, when the plaintiff


presents direct evidence of an unlawful motive that was


actually relied upon in making a decision, the burden of


causation then shifts to the defendant.


The Price Waterhouse mixed-motive framework


applies to a narrow subset of cases.  The Court recognized


early on in Title VII that most of these cases will be


circumstantial evidence cases, and as a way to deal with


that, the McDonnell Douglas case set up a framework for 

considering the vast majority of those cases.  In the few


cases where there is direct evidence of illegal animus


tied to an employment decision, the Court said that the


defendant must now prove that it would have made the same


decision either way.


QUESTION:  And what is your definition of direct


evidence, Mr. Ricciardi?


MR. RICCIARDI:  There's two definitions that


we've briefed, Your Honor.  Both of them I think are


helpful.  The first one is quoted in the SG's brief at


4

page 26, and that's from the EEOC guidance.  And I'll read


that.  Any written or verbal policy or statement made by a


respondent or a respondent official that on its face


demonstrates a bias against a protected group and is


linked to the complained-of adverse action.


We proposed, Your Honor, in our blue brief a


slightly different formulation, but I believe it gets you


to the same place.  On page 41 of our blue brief,


borrowing from the First Circuit Febres case, a three-


part test which we think gets you to the same place.  The


first is there has to be a statement by a decisionmaker;


second, that directly reflects the alleged animus; and


third, that it bears squarely on the contested employment


decision.


QUESTION: 


The first -- the first of those three 

is -- goes beyond what the -- what the Government -- the


EEOC guideline would require, doesn't it?  As I understand


the EEOC guideline, it doesn't require that -- that the


indication come from a decisionmaker.


MR. RICCIARDI:  You're correct, Your Honor.  The


words of the EEOC are the respondent or respondent


official.  Yes, so it does go a bit beyond.  I -- I --


QUESTION:  Although the fact that it has to bear


upon the decision, it's hard to get there without --


MR. RICCIARDI:  Well, I think maybe --

 QUESTION:  -- pinning it on a decisionmaker


somehow.


MR. RICCIARDI:  What could be contemplated I


guess is a respondent official, who's maybe even higher


than the decisionmaker, makes the statement.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. RICCIARDI:  The Civil Rights Act of 1991


sets out a new section, and we've set it out in appendix


A.


QUESTION:  Of your brief?


MR. RICCIARDI:  Of the brief, of the blue brief,


Your Honor.  It sets out 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m), which was


107(a) of the Civil Rights Act.  And that described that


an unlawful employment practice would be established when


the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, 

religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor


for any employment practice.  And then this is the key


language:  even though other factors also motivated the


practice.


This indicates that Congress intended for there


to be the distinction, recognized in Price Waterhouse,


between the standard McDonnell Douglas pretext case, which


you prove under 2000e-2(a), and the mixed-motive case


which was first recognized in Price Waterhouse.


The second part of the text that evidences this

distinction is section 107(b) of the Civil Rights Act


which is codified there in that same place at 2000e-


5(g)(2)(B), and that talks about where an individual


proves a violation under 2(m) that -- and where the


employer does not succeed in proving -- excuse me -- where


the employer does succeed in proving the affirmative


defense, then in that case the plaintiff is entitled only


to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorneys'


fees demonstrated to be directly attributable only to the


pursuit of a claim under section 2000e-2(m).


QUESTION:  Mr. Ricciardi, would that


demonstration by the defendant also have to be made by


direct evidence?  The words Congress used is the same. 


One is respondent demonstrates, and the other is the


plaintiff demonstrates.


MR. RICCIARDI:  The word demonstrate is used


twice, Your Honor, but I do not agree that the respondent


or the defendant or the employer has any heightened


standard.  And the reason I say that is because in order


to interpret the burdens of proof, this Court historically


looks at background principles.  And when we look at this


statute, using the Court's background principles of


McDonnell Douglas for the standard pretext case and Price


Waterhouse for the standard mixed-motive case, there's no


heightened evidentiary standard for the respondent or the

employer.


QUESTION:  Well, the question whether there is,


you would be suggesting a rule that, as far as I know, is


alien to our law, that is, to make a distinction between


direct evidence and circumstantial evidence.  You can have


direct evidence by a liar and you can have highly


convincing circumstantial evidence.  So why would the law


in this one area make a distinction that, as far as I


know, is not made elsewhere?


MR. RICCIARDI:  Your Honor, I believe the


distinction is made because the shifting of the burden to


the defendant in employment cases is an unusual thing.  It


does not happen in other areas of the law.  Courts need a


bright line rule in order to --


QUESTION: 


It is -- it is unquestionably -- it 

was unquestionably made in Price Waterhouse, wasn't it?


MR. RICCIARDI:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  I mean, that's what it said.


MR. RICCIARDI:  Price Waterhouse --


QUESTION:  What -- what was it -- the it that


was said in Price Waterhouse?  Not in the -- not in the


plurality opinion.  The direct evidence rule doesn't come


out of a plurality --


QUESTION:  Concurring opinion.


MR. RICCIARDI:  Well --

 QUESTION:  It came out of a concurring opinion


that bore my name, did it not?


(Laughter.)


MR. RICCIARDI:  That is correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Yes.  And I don't think it appeared


in the plurality opinion, nor in Justice White's


concurring opinion, did it?


MR. RICCIARDI:  No, it did not, Your Honor. 


What I believe the --


QUESTION:  I know a number of courts have


followed it, but I -- it's hard to extract a -- a rule


under those circumstances.


MR. RICCIARDI:  I -- I --


QUESTION:  Congress, in making its amendments in


1991, did not mention anything about direct evidence, did 

it?


MR. RICCIARDI:  No, it did not, Your Honor.


And -- and I think there are two things that --


that we have to look at.  One of them is the plurality


opinion did in -- in note 13 state that -- that its


formulation was not meaningfully different from Justice


O'Connor's concurrence.  For what -- for what that's


worth, that's there.  And another way I think to look at


the direct evidence picture is that six Justices of the


Supreme Court all found that the facts in Price Waterhouse

were sufficient to have a mixed-motive burden shift.


QUESTION:  Fine.  So that's what I took the


statement -- I mean, far be it from me to characterize


somebody else's opinion, but I thought the statement was


simply saying, and here this is an added feature that


shows how right the majority is and that's true in that


case, but what is there that suggests that it's not just


an added feature showing the majority was right in that


case, but that you have to have it and can't have anything


that isn't direct evidence.


MR. RICCIARDI:  Well, Your Honor, I think --


QUESTION:  Where does it say that?


MR. RICCIARDI:  I think we get that from going


back to background principles.  The McDonnell Douglas


decision, which has still been followed and has been 

referred to by this Court, is the rubric that's used for


circumstantial evidence cases.


QUESTION:  But wait I didn't -- then I probably


am unclear about it.  What I thought happened is that


Price -- that McDonnell Douglas governs a circumstance


where a plaintiff puts on a case, however he puts it on. 


Once you show the McDonnell Douglas factors, you can get


to the jury unless, of course, the defendant puts


something on.  And once the defendant puts something on,


McDonnell Douglas bursts and goes away.  Now, am I right

about that or not?


MR. RICCIARDI:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


And the plaintiff --


QUESTION:  All right.  Then -- then I don't see


what McDonnell Douglas has to do with this because I would


think 90 percent of the cases in which there is a mixed


motive are going to come up because the defendant will


say, I did it for a different reason, and the plaintiff


will come back and say, you did it for both reasons.  So I


think in 90 percent of the cases, we're not going to have


any McDonnell Douglas involved.


MR. RICCIARDI:  I -- I --


QUESTION:  It will just be -- am I right or not?


MR. RICCIARDI:  I -- I don't agree with that,


Your Honor. 


The reason is because in -- if you look at 

the facts on the classic mixed-motive cases -- Mt.


Healthy, for example, and -- and that was a case


specifically relied upon in Justice White's concurrence. 


There we had a school district in a written letter making


an admission, yes, we considered the illegal aspect of


your First Amendment rights.  And then we have Price


Waterhouse where, on the facts it's uncontested that the


written evaluations by those partners, which were relied


upon by the policy board, used sexual stereotypes.


QUESTION:  Did -- did the defendants in those

two cases put on any evidence?


MR. RICCIARDI:  I would -- I would imagine they


absolutely did, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Yes, so do I.  So neither of those


cases does McDonnell Douglas have to do with anything,


because they aren't involved in the case I gather, if I'm


right, once the defendant put on some evidence.


MR. RICCIARDI:  That is correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  All right.  So my question really is


since McDonnell Douglas doesn't have much to do with the


cases in which mixed motive comes up, why does -- why are


you talking about McDonnell Douglas?  What has McDonnell


Douglas to do with the background rule?  Why isn't the


background rule just -- well, what your opponents are


saying?


MR. RICCIARDI:  Well, because, Your Honor, the


backgrounds rule enables us to deal with the cases where


there is not direct evidence of the illegal motivation,


and those cases will be rare.  And if you look at Mt.


Healthy and if you look at the facts -- Price Waterhouse


facts, in the concurrence by Justice O'Connor in Price


Waterhouse, it says, the employer has created uncertainty


as to causation by knowingly giving substantial weight to


an impermissible criteria.  I believe these cases will be


few and far between where you --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Ricciardi, can we go back to the


background, which I find very difficult to understand


because if an elevated proof standard is wanted, then


courts not uncommonly will say, we will require you to


prove something by more than a mere preponderance.  We


will require you to prove this by clear and convincing


evidence.  Then I can understand.  But a line between


direct evidence and circumstantial evidence -- is there


any other area where direct evidence counts for more than


substantial evidence just by virtue of being direct?


MR. RICCIARDI:  I have not uncovered ones, Your


Honor.  I think that is what the Court in Price Waterhouse


was faced with, and I think it's a bright line rule that


would give our trial judges the ability --


QUESTION: 


Then how do you get it out of Price 

Waterhouse when it's in the opinion, as Justice O'Connor


said?  Her opinion.  There were four people who didn't say


direct evidence.  There was Justice White who said a


substantial factor, but didn't say direct evidence. 


That's a lot to load on two words in a concurring opinion.


MR. RICCIARDI:  Well, Your Honor, unfortunately


because of the fractured opinions there, we have had to


rely on, besides the actual words on the page, we had to


rely on, what -- the way the circuits have read the case


-- and they have all consistently -- almost all

consistently read it as having a heightened evidentiary


standard and --


QUESTION:  Well, wouldn't heightened ordinarily 


be clear and convincing evidence, whether direct or


circumstantial?


MR. RICCIARDI:  Your Honor, it might ordinarily,


but I believe in employment cases it's very difficult to


do.  In employment cases we have stray remarks, we have


rumors, we have maybe documents that are --


QUESTION:  Sure.  But doesn't -- doesn't a


standard like clear and convincing address that kind of


problem?  If all you have are stray remarks that, you


know, cannot be taken as company policy, et cetera, then


you're going to have a hard time getting to the clear and


convincing standard. 


I don't see why the -- the quality 

of evidence, direct or indirect, is -- is necessary to


address that problem as opposed to the -- to the quantum


of proof, clear and convincing versus preponderance.


MR. RICCIARDI:  Your Honor, I think that you're


putting too much weight on the shoulders of the trial


judges.  In our case, our trial judge was convinced that


there was direct evidence, and he was sifting through what


we believed amounted to nothing more than a pile of


circumstantial evidence.  And I think had he had the


guidance of the bright line rule, it would have been

easier for him.


QUESTION:  Can you explain to me -- and you're


the expert on this, I'm not.  You try a lot of these


cases.  When I look at it, being naive in this area, since


I'm not trying a lot of them, I think, well, this -- this


seems to make perfectly good sense.  A plaintiff comes in


and has to show that the bad motive was a motivating


factor.  Well, once the plaintiff has shown that, why


shouldn't the plaintiff win?  And if, by the way, the


defendant can come in and show that she would have been


fired anyway because she was a bad typist, well, then


maybe he shouldn't have to pay damages.


MR. RICCIARDI:  Your Honor, going back to the


text of the statute, 2(m) defined the plaintiff's duty as


showing that the illegal criteria was a motivating factor. 

But the vast majority of cases fall under 2(a)(1) where


the plaintiff must show that he or she was discriminated


against because of sex, gender, race, whatever.  So that


is a but for standard in 2(a), which means that the


plaintiff has to carry the ball all the way across the


goal line, does not shift the burden of proof to the


defendant.


QUESTION:  But the burden of proof that -- that


you keep referring to, in effect, is the burden of proof


for what under the statutory scheme is -- is a partial

affirmative defense.  What is remarkable about saying if


you -- if you want to claim a partial affirmative defense,


you have the burden of proof on it?  You always have the


burden of proof on an affirmative defense.


MR. RICCIARDI:  Well, what makes this


extraordinary, Your Honor, is that under 2(m), the


plaintiff never has to prove that what this defendant did


caused this injury.  The but for is in 2(a), but in 2(m),


the plaintiff can say --


QUESTION:  2(m) is addressing something else. 


2(m) is -- is addressing what happens if, in fact, a -- a


defendant wants to raise an affirmative defense, a partial


affirmative defense.  That's all it addresses.


MR. RICCIARDI:  Your Honor, I believe --


QUESTION: 


Well, it isn't all it -- I mean, it 

addresses the sufficiency of -- of liability, and then it


goes on to address the -- the affirmative defense.


MR. RICCIARDI:  Well, Your Honor, my response to


that is I believe that the Civil Rights Act incorporated


2(m) as a direct response and a partial codification of


the Price Waterhouse decision because there was no burden


shift under Title VII until Price Waterhouse created it.


QUESTION:  When that was enacted, was there


already a considerable body of court of appeals opinions


which had interpreted Price Waterhouse as establishing the

direct evidence rule, or did they come later?


MR. RICCIARDI:  Your Honor, I believe these are


cited in the -- in the SG's brief, and I believe there


were five circuit courts that had, between Price


Waterhouse and the Civil Rights Act, recognized that.


Your Honor, may I reserve?


QUESTION:  Yes, Mr. Ricciardi.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Since 1964, Title VII's disparate treatment


prohibition has required a finding that a protected 

characteristic such as gender was a but for cause of an


adverse employment decision.  Now, the '91 amendments


create a special rule of liability for mixed-motive cases


where proof of but for cause is not required.  To qualify


for --


QUESTION:  How do we know that those amendments


apply only to mixed-motive cases?  The language in the


statute Congress passed is pretty broad.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It -- the --

MR. GORNSTEIN:  The text that says, even though


other factors also motivated the practice, make clear that


the amendment only applies to mixed-motive cases.  It


doesn't say, even if, which would be regardless of


whether, but it says, even though, which means the factors


were present, but that it doesn't matter.  And so the text


makes clear that it applies only to mixed-motive cases,


but it doesn't address --


QUESTION:  Well, the text makes clear that the


exception does, but why does 2(m) not apply to all cases?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  2(m) says, even though other


factors also motivated the -- the practice.  That's what


2(m) says.  And that -- that limits it to mixed-motive


cases.


QUESTION:  It says whether or not they -- other


factors motivate it.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  If it -- if it was whether


or not, it would be even if.  Even though means the


factors were present.  Other factors were present, but it


doesn't matter under this statute that they were.


Now, the text of the law doesn't address what


kind of evidence is sufficient to make out a mixed-motive


case, and it leaves that to resolution through background


principles as Congress typically does.  Congress typically

does not address what kind of evidence is sufficient.  And


the key and most relevant and pertinent background


principle here was that before the amendment, direct


evidence was required to make out a mixed-motive case.


QUESTION:  Do you say that because that's the


way a lot of court of appeals determined, or do you think


that was a necessity by virtue of the split in the


opinions on this Court?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Two sources for that, Justice


Souter.  One is the court of appeals' decisions, and there


were five between the time of Price Waterhouse and the


time of the '91 amendments, and that formed an important


part of the backdrop against which Congress --


QUESTION:  Were those -- were those opinions


based on the reading of this Court as depending upon 

Justice O'Connor's opinion where those words were used?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I -- I would not --


QUESTION:  Or did the courts independently


create a distinction between direct and substantial


evidence?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  I think that those two -- those


cases, for the most part, were trying to reconcile this


Court's decisions in McDonnell Douglas with Price


Waterhouse, and that's exactly the first source for where


we would get the background rule as well.

 QUESTION:  Well, then would you tell me --


QUESTION:  Why would you have that background?


QUESTION:  -- why would the court -- if that's


what it was trying to do, why would it resort to something


as extraordinary -- now that we no longer have formal


rules of evidence, like you need two witnesses to prove A


and three witnesses to prove B, why would it resort to


that kind of distinction between direct and circumstantial


rather than a heightened burden expressed as clear and


convincing?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Because it was trying to be --


they were trying to be faithful to this Court's decisions


in McDonnell Douglas and Price Waterhouse.  And let me


explain how those two decisions fit together because in --


in Price Waterhouse, there was direct evidence, and six 

Justices said that was sufficient to shift the burden of


proof.  Now, no opinion expressly stated that something


other than that would be sufficient to shift the burden of


proof.


QUESTION:  But only one stated that it was


necessary as well as sufficient.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  So you had five that did not say it


was necessary as well as sufficient.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's correct.  And five did

not say that it would -- that anything less would be


sufficient, however, and that issue is resolved by


McDonnell Douglas and -- and that line of cases.


And what McDonnell Douglas and that line of


cases say is that in a purely circumstantial evident case


-- evidence case -- the plaintiff has a very light burden


at the outset, but that once the employer comes back and


puts on a nondiscriminatory explanation, the plaintiff has


to carry the burden of proof all the way to showing


pretext and but for causation.  The plaintiff under the


McDonnell Douglas line of cases has to show but for


causation.


So when you put the two decisions together,


Price Waterhouse and McDonnell Douglas, the rule that


emerges is in -- to get into the Price Waterhouse box, 

where you get a shift in the burden of proof, you need


direct evidence.


QUESTION:  Are there cases in which a motivating


factor is not but for causation when it's not a mixed-


motive case?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It -- it's a mixed-motive case


where it's not a but for factor.  That's correct.


QUESTION:  No.  I'm asking the other -- the


converse of that.  If there is no second motive, but


merely there's evidence of -- of a motivating factor,

period, isn't that enough?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  If it's -- if it's the sole


motive, then it would be a violation under 2000e-2(a)(1). 


That would be a --


QUESTION:  Would it also not be a violation of


this statute?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No, because 2000e-2(m) is


designed just for cases where there's more than one


motive.


QUESTION:  It's designed to create a special


defense and a special remedy, but it doesn't say anything


about what it takes to prove the case, does it?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It leaves that to background


principles.  And as I was saying, that's the background


principle.


The second point that's very crucial here is


that if there's not a direct evidence requirement, Justice


Stevens, the result would be that you are going to


effectively render superfluous 2000e-2(1) which up until


now has been the principal safeguard against


discrimination, and the reason is that 2000e-2(a)(1)


requires proof of but for cause.  2000e-2(m) requires


proof --


QUESTION:  But I -- I still -- maybe I'm just


stupid, but I don't understand the difference between a

but for cause and a motivating factor that is not part of


a mixed-motive case.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  If it's just --


QUESTION:  If -- if the only motivating -- if


there's a motivating factor and there's nothing else,


isn't that but for causation?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It -- certainly it is --


QUESTION:  And so is it if you have two, isn't


it?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- 2000e-2(a)(1) but not -- it


doesn't apply where cases where it's not a but for cause. 


That's what --


QUESTION:  Why not?  In -- in law school, in my


first year in torts, I learned that there's an odd case


where you have two hunters shooting at the same person. 

Now, in both cases, you know, they're not actually


literally but for conditions, but they fall within the


word because.  My torts teacher used to call them co­


causal conditions.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well --


QUESTION:  So I'm amazed that you're reading


because, contrary to all tort law --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.


QUESTION:  -- to mean that if you have the co­


causal condition, which happens to be two motives here,

not two hunters, that it wouldn't fall within the


beginning.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  That -- that's a special


case, Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  Yes, it is.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  And -- and the ordinary rule is


that you have to show that it's but for cause, and the


Court said as much in --


QUESTION:  All right, but it's a special case


we're dealing with where you have two hunters -- I'm sorry


-- two motives.  And so in that unusual two-hunter/two-


motive case, what the Congress did was write 2(m) to tell


you treat it okay for liability, but don't award damages. 


Now, where am I wrong in that analysis?


MR. GORNSTEIN: 


The -- the key point that you're 

missing there is that if you interpret 2000e-2(m) in that


way, you would be rendering superfluous 2000e-2(a)(1)


which requires but for cause by virtue of the because of


language.  And if -- if under the -- that's because in


order to show a violation, a plaintiff would only have to


show motivating factor, not but for cause.  It would


render -- no plaintiff would ever seek to prove a 2000e-


2(a) case.  They'd always seek to prove a 2000e-2(m) case.


And the result would be that what up until now


has been the principal safeguard in literally thousands of

cases under Title VII would be translated -- transformed


into something that is almost completely obsolete, and


there's just nothing to indicate that Congress intended to


so radically change the fabric of Title VII law.  And what


we have is a much more modest adjustment.


QUESTION:  Would it be a radical change in our


law if we said that instead of direct evidence, it's clear


and convincing evidence?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  That would be a very big change


in this Court's law if -- if this Court said that because


this Court has already said, under Title VII, the


background understanding is more likely than not, and


that's what the plaintiff has to show.  And so the way to


look at this amendment is not as a very fundamental change


in the basic fabric of Title VII law, but a response to a 

particular decision.  That's what Congress was responding


to.


And if you'll recall in that case, there was


direct evidence.  An employer basically admitted that it


had taken gender into account, and then the Court said,


well, the employer can get out from all liability by


showing absence of but -- but for cause.  And Congress


responded to that particular decision in doing that.


But that didn't mean that Congress thereafter


went on to undertake a complete reexamination of the law.

It left it where it was, and where it was is in purely


circumstantial evidence cases, under McDonnell Douglas,


once the employer introduces a nondiscriminatory


explanation, the plaintiff has to carry the burden of


proof of showing pretext and but for cause.


If the Court has nothing further.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.


Mr. Peccole, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. PECCOLE


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. PECCOLE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case, at the very middle of it, when we're


trying to settle instructions, the parties involved agreed


to instructions 1 through 9. 


Instruction number 9 to the 

jury was, in fact, the 107(a) instruction.  It read -- and


this jury instruction is found at the joint appendix 32


and 33.  It read, the plaintiff has the burden of proving


each of the following by a preponderance of the evidence. 


One, Costa suffered adverse work conditions, and two,


Costa's gender was a motivating factor in any such work


conditions imposed upon her.  Gender refers to the quality


of being male or female.


If you find that each of these things has been


proved against a defendant, your verdict should be for the


26

plaintiff and against the defendant.  On the other hand,


if any of these things has not been proved against a


defendant, your verdict should be for the defendant.


What I'm trying to point out is the parties at


that point and at that juncture had agreed that this


definitely was a 107(a) case and it would go to the jury


as such.


The only objection that Caesars had to


instructions was instruction number 10, and instruction


number 10 was the same action defense that aids Caesars in


the fact that it actually cuts down the type of damages


that can be awarded.  In fact, monetary damages cannot be


awarded.  That instruction aided Caesars and in no event


is it easy for them to now come before this Court and say


they were harmed by the fact that that instruction was 

given.


I would point out that this is similar to the


Reeves case, and the reason it is similar is in Reeves,


the parties in that case had basically agreed that the


McDonnell Douglas framework would be used, and this Court


said since that seems to be the position of the parties,


we'll accept that.  Well, I would submit that the same


thing occurred in this case.  The parties agreed that this


is a 107(a) case, and that's -- that's the way it was


presented to the jury.

 Reading 703(m), which is Title VII 200e-2(m) --


and that's found at the respondent's brief, page 9 -- the


section specifically states, except as otherwise provided


in this title, an unlawful employment practice is


established when a complaining party demonstrates a race,


color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating


factor for any employment practice, even though other


factors also motivated the practice.  That's stating any


employment practice that -- that takes into consideration


any of the things listed, and in this case, it was gender. 


So it was a gender-motivated case.


I would point out that when we look at this


statute, it talks in terms of a plaintiff having to


demonstrate, and the plaintiff under that terminology


merely had to show and bear the burden of showing a case 

which actually would indicate that gender was a motivating


factor.


In the case that was presented to the jury,


there was absolutely no question that Ms. Costa showed a


case every bit as strong as the case and the facts that


were found in Price Waterhouse.  Reference does not have


to be made to Price Waterhouse.  The statute itself does


not talk in terms of any heightened burden placed on the


plaintiff, nor does it talk in terms of substantial


evidence.  It goes right to what it says on its face that

a plaintiff merely has to demonstrate.


QUESTION:  And what do you -- what do you


respond to the argument made by the Government if -- that


if that is what it means and if it does not embody the


understood requirement of direct evidence, it effectively


supplants (a)(1).  It -- nobody would -- would try to


prove a case under (a)(1), which is what has been the


traditional approach.


MR. PECCOLE:  In our brief, Your Honor, we -- we


actually took the position that the language in 703(m)


does, in fact, supplant the language in 701(a).


QUESTION:  So you -- you accept that argument.


MR. PECCOLE:  703(a).  Excuse me.  But --


QUESTION:  Well, that's a massive change in --


in --


MR. PECCOLE:  I -- I would like to maybe --


QUESTION:  I mean, it just shifts the burden to


the employer to prove nondiscrimination effectively. 


That's a -- that's a very big change.


MR. PECCOLE:  I would like to backtrack just a


little bit on that.  I think there's an explanation


necessary.  It has to be more detailed.


In the Price Waterhouse case, the plurality


actually had said, first of all, the motivating factor was


the -- the motive involved.

 The plurality also said that the -- the words


because of, in 703(a), really didn't mean because of.  It


said something along the lines that it does not mean


solely because of.  That's how the plurality basically got


to motivating factor.  The language motivating factor of


the plurality ended up in 703(m), and I think you could


also say that it -- the definition given by the plurality,


to because of in 703(a), actually came over into 703(m)


too.


QUESTION:  But they are still contradictory.  I


mean, (a)(1) would require in a mixed-motive case -- okay


-- if -- if you apply (a)(1) to a mixed-motive case, it


would require the plaintiff to show that the -- the


improper motive was an effective cause and that the


employer would not have dismissed this person anyway. 

Whereas, if the new 2(m) governs, it's just the opposite. 


Once you show an improper motive, it is up to the employer


to show that if he wishes to get off, he would have taken


the same action anyway.  So I -- the -- the two are just


not -- not compatible.


MR. PECCOLE:  I think the Ninth Circuit's


approach is the best.  The Ninth Circuit actually said


that if you show a single-motive type case which falls


under 703(a), that it goes to the jury as a because of. 


There is just absolutely no question that is the better

approach.


The other approach is, if there is a mixed


motive -- and these are decisions that have to be made by


the judge before the instructions go to the jury.  If


there are mixed motives, then it goes to the jury as a


703(m).


In this case, the mixed motives were there.  It


did go to the jury as a 703(m), and it also included the


defense that Caesars had available under 706(g)(2)(b).


QUESTION:  And as I understand --


QUESTION:  Am I right --


QUESTION:  -- as I understand (m), it isn't a


question of shifting the burden to the defendant.  The


plaintiff wins at that point.  If the plaintiff


demonstrates sex is a motivating factor, at that point 

plaintiff wins.  The affirmative defense doesn't take away


the plaintiff's victory.  It just limits the remedy.  So


the defendant can't get off the hook.  As (m) is


structured, it's not that you're loading on the defendant


an extraordinary burden of showing nonliability.  If the


plaintiff makes the demonstration that (m) calls for,


plaintiff is the winner, and the only thing that -- the


only function of the defense is to limit the remedy.


That's how I understand --


MR. PECCOLE:  I -- I agree with you

wholeheartedly on that.  In fact -- and that's what


occurred in this case.  If you look at the verdict form,


which is at the joint appendix on page 40, you'll see that


what happened is the jury was instructed exactly the way


you just commented.  If the plaintiff had established by a


preponderance of an evidence that gender was a motivating


factor, then the plaintiff proved its case and should win


right then and there.


And if you see, you will find in number 2 of the


interrogatories, it asks the question, do you find that


the defendant's wrongful treatment of plaintiff was


motivated both by gender and lawful reasons?  And the jury


marked yes.  But had they marked no, if you look down to


the next sentence, it says, if your answer was yes, answer


the next question. 


If your answer was no, proceed to 

question number 4, which was the damage section.

QUESTION:  The -- the one we've been talking


MR. PECCOLE:  The relationship between the two

 QUESTION:  Between the two sections, yes.


MR. PECCOLE:  Okay.  First of all, the


relationship, if we're talking about 703(m), what -- what


happens there is the plaintiff --


QUESTION:  Why don't you refer to the statutory


numbers that -- that are in the -- the appendix.


MR. PECCOLE:  Yes.  That's -- that will be a


little bit easier.


Okay.  703(m) is 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m).


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. PECCOLE:  What -- what that new statute did


is it placed on the burden of the plaintiff to show -- and


I -- and this -- this burden never changes.  It never


changed with McDonnell Douglas.  It does not change here. 


The -- the burden is always on the plaintiff to prove by a 

preponderance of the evidence that gender was a motivating


factor.  So what happens is once the plaintiffs have


proved that, he's proved his case.


The problem now shifts, and it's -- it's an


affirmative defense.  It's not a shifting of burdens.  An


affirmative defense comes into play under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-


5(g)(2)(B) which -- which allows the employer to come in


and show that if they took the same action, even though


there was a gender-motivating factor, then it reduces


their damages or the possibility --

 QUESTION:  Well, are there any -- are there any


cases that are covered by e-2(m) that are not covered by


2(a)(1)?


MR. PECCOLE:  My answer in that case would have


to be that conceivably -- the Ninth Circuit did say this,


that there are those cases.  The cases are when you have a


-- a single-motive case.  They got back into the


distinction between single and mixed-motive.  If you have


a true single-motive case, then it would come under the --


the section 703(a) which is 42 2000-2(a)(1).


QUESTION:  Does it matter?


QUESTION:  In your view, what -- what did


Congress accomplish by 703(m), also known as 2000e-2(m)?


MR. PECCOLE:  I think what they accomplished


was, first of all, they clarified Price Waterhouse from 

the standpoint that there was no heightened burden, no


direct evidence burden, no substantial factor burden.  It


did that for sure.


The next thing that it did is it -- it made it


so a plaintiff would bear the burden of having to


establish that gender played a motivating factor.  And


that is in any employment decision, not just, you know,


the very limited type or anything like that.  It says, any


employment decision.  And that becomes an unlawful


employment action.

 QUESTION:  Is -- is this correct, that McDonnell


Douglas survives on your reading in a case in which the


defendant does not go forward with anything?  The


plaintiff puts in enough to make a prima facie case. 


Defendant sits mute.  McDonnell Douglas controls the


result there.  If the defendant does go forward with


something at that point -- and -- and here I'm not sure of


this, but I think -- by definition, it then becomes a


mixed-motive case, doesn't it?  Under (m)?


MR. PECCOLE:  I believe it does.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. PECCOLE:  I -- I think --


QUESTION:  So McDonnell survives in the case of


the mute defendant.  In the non-mute defendant, (m)


governs everything.


MR. PECCOLE:  Let me see if I can answer. 


McDonnell Douglas, as has been suggested -- it's used at


the very preliminary stage of a -- of a case.  McDonnell


Douglas at some point in that decision then bursts.  It


goes away.  And so what you're left with is the 71 -- or


703(a) and the 703(m).


Now, I'm -- here I'm -- again I'm relying on


what the Ninth Circuit said.  They are still giving


McDonnell Douglas cases some deference, but what they are


saying in fact is yes, once you're past that stage,

basically the 703(m) cases will come into play.  That


will be the instructions to the jury.


QUESTION:  Does it -- does it -- just for


clarifying in my mind, does it matter or doesn't it matter


whether you say (m) governs a separate set of cases?  When


I came in, I thought the answer to that was no, it


doesn't, that (e) governs every case because the cause can


govern the two-motive cases too, and that in (m) Congress


was simply clarifying that there could be such cases, and


then they go on to say what happens.


But the Government made a very good point and


said no, I shouldn't look at it that way and I should look


at it as if (e) governs the single-motive case and then


(m) comes in to govern the dual-motive case.  And that was


a good argument too.


And so what I'm asking you, who understands this


a little better than I do, does it matter?


MR. PECCOLE:  No.


QUESTION:  No, it doesn't matter.  That's it.


QUESTION:  Well, how many -- what percentage of


all these cases, do you think, are single-motive cases?


MR. PECCOLE:  To guess, I would -- I would say


probably a vast majority of the cases are.  They're -- or


not single.  Excuse me.  Those are mixed-motive cases.


QUESTION:  Well, you don't suggest the defendant

always admits liability, do you?


MR. PECCOLE:  No.


QUESTION:  If there's only issue about one


motive, it's always that the defendant has some kind of


defense in every case.


QUESTION:  If he stands mute, he -- he loses.  I


mean, under McDonnell Douglas, if the plaintiff comes in


with -- with a claim that this was the motive and the --


and the defendant doesn't come up with anything, he loses,


doesn't he?


MR. PECCOLE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  So any case that goes forward is a


mixed-motive -- is a mixed-motive case.


MR. PECCOLE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. PECCOLE:  Yes.  And -- and the only thing --


the only time that I could see otherwise would be a -- a


specific instance where, for example, you have working


women in a -- in a department.  The employer comes in and


says we have to make a layoff because we're -- we're in


dire straits.  We can't afford it.  They lay off that


whole division, and then 2 weeks later they hire a whole


male division.  I think that you have the single motive


there and -- and you -- those are the only kind of cases I


can think of.

 QUESTION:  Yes, they settle, don't they?


MR. PECCOLE:  Yes.


(Laughter.)


MR. PECCOLE:  I -- I would entertain any other


further questions.


I think that one -- one other point I would like


to make is that 703(m) and the way the Ninth Circuit has


approached it, has made it simple and easy for the judges


to handle, for the trial attorneys to handle, and for the


jury to handle through instructions.  It's a -- it's a


much easier way of handling these type cases.


It -- it's like any other civil case basically. 


Plaintiff has to come in and show by a preponderance of


the evidence that it's entitled to what it's -- it's


saying it's entitled to, that certain things occurred. 

Then the defense can either sit back and say, well, wait a


second, you didn't prove your case, or the defense can


say, well, maybe there's a motivating factor here.  Even


after I presented valid reasons for the termination, for


example, then what they'll do is they'll say, well, maybe


I want this instruction that limits my damages.  But it --


it's a simple structure, and we have got to get to that. 


I mean, it is --


QUESTION:  But if you -- if you --


MR. PECCOLE:  -- so chaotic out there in the

circuits right now, it's just unbelievable.


QUESTION:  If you were right, Mr. Peccole, about


(m) taking over the field so that every case becomes a


mixed-motive case, why would Congress have added not even


if, but even though other factors also motivated the


practice?


MR. PECCOLE:  I don't think it has anything


actually to do with the mixed-motive.  I think what it is


-- they're saying is even if that -- that kind of evidence


is present.  In any event, you succeed.


QUESTION:  Well, if they said whether or not,


then --


MR. PECCOLE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- I would see your point clearly. 


But they didn't say whether or not. 


They said even 

though, which seems to assume that two -- at least two


motivating factors have been shown:  one, sex; two,


another motive -- another even though another motivating


factor existed.


MR. PECCOLE:  I think if you read the any


employment practice means any.  And I think what it does


is it takes away from that last sentence or phrase.  What


it's done is it's basically said any employment practice


where you can show that gender, for example, is a


motivating factor, you've proven your case.  It doesn't

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Peccole.


Mr. Ricciardi, you have 2 minutes left.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. RICCIARDI


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. RICCIARDI:  I'd like to call the Court's


attention to the joint appendix, page 17, the middle of


the page.  It's the jury instructions colloquy.  The court


says, all right, may I hear from the defense?  And I say,


yes, Your Honor.  We have no objections to the court's


instructions 1 through 9.  I believe this is not a mixed-


motive case, and under Price Waterhouse, direct evidence


is required.


I should have said 1 through 8. 


There's no 

question about that.  I don't think that's fatal to this


appeal for several reasons.


There's no question that the trial judge was on


full notice of my position that it was not a -- it was not


a Price Waterhouse case.


QUESTION:  You also should have said, I believe


this is a mixed-motive case, not I believe this is not,


shouldn't you?  You had a bad morning I think.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Did you think it was a mixed-motive

case or not?


MR. RICCIARDI:  No.  No, Your Honor, it was not. 


It was a McDonnell Douglas case.  We should have gotten --


if you look back to the actual jury instruction that was


given, number 7 on page 32 --


QUESTION:  I see.  Okay.


MR. RICCIARDI:  It was not a Price Waterhouse


case.  That's why I'm here today.  I've been living with


this for many years.


But jury instruction number 7 was the 2(a)(1)


because of language, and the trial judge was on notice


from our colloquy on my motion for judgment as a matter of


law, which starts on page 15, that I was objecting that


the prima facie case hadn't been shown.  There was no jury


issue raised to show pretext.


Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit, both the panel


and the full en banc court, passed on the propriety of the


mixed-motive instruction and never once had any problem


with the way I had preserved the objection.


And then finally, in this Court, in the -- in


the petition for certiorari, we formulated the question,


and in the opposition, which I believe is an optional


filing, the opposition to the petition for certiorari


raises nothing about instruction number 9 or the 2(m)


formulation.  And it was only for the very first time in


41 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

any of these many appeals was it raised in the merits


brief.  So I believe --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Ricciardi.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
