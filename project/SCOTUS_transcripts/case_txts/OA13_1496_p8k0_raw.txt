CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  13­1496,  Dollar  General 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corporation  v.  The  Mississippi  Band  of  Choctaw  Indians. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Goldstein. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  THOMAS  C.  GOLDSTEIN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Our  narrowest  argument  assumes  that,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  like  this  case,  Indian  tribes  do  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative  jurisdiction  to  subject  nonmembers  to  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tort  law  duties. 

 

 

            

Respondents  argue  that  the  same  facts  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  Indian  tribes  the  mandatory  adjudicatory 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  to  decide  private  tort  lawsuits  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­Indians.  Respondents'  theory  is  that,  when  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Tribes  entered  the  United  States  and  were  incorporated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  this  country,  their  power  to  adjudicate  cases  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  fashion  was  understood  to  be  an  element  of  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty.  That  is  not  correct. 

  

 

 

 

            

In  ­­ I  want  to  identify  the  three  separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respects  in  which  the  overriding  sovereignty  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  and  our  Constitution  ­­

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Could  you  ­­ could  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

please  explain  your  opening  statement?  You  ­­ you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  legislative  authority  but  not  judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  I  don't  know  of  any  other  instance  in  which 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  jurisdiction  has  authority  to  legislate,  to  regulate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  conduct  in  question,  but  does  not  have  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  up  that  legislative  authority  by  adjudicatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority. 

            

Can  you  give  me  an  example  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  I  can  give  you  several, 

    

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Yes. 

  

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  The  first  is  removal. 

  

 

 

 

 

Remember,  our  point  is  not  that  the  Tribes  lack  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicatory  jurisdiction.  It  is  that  they  lack 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  adjudicatory  jurisdiction  so  that  we  do  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  access  to  a  neutral  judicial  forum.  A  State  has 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  power  to  pass  State  tort  law,  for  example,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  have  the  sovereign  authority  to  insist  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  be  litigated  in  its  own  courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  It  has  the  authority, 

  

 

 

 

 

but  ­­ but  an  out­of­State  defendant  can  be  moved  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court,  but  it  has  the  adjudicatory  authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Ginsburg,  everyone 

  

 

 

 

agrees  that  the  Tribes  have  a  form  of  adjudicatory

authority  upon  consent.  They  don't  have  it  inherently. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  question  is  going  to  be:  What  qualifies  as  consent? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  point  is  that,  in  three  separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respects,  the  national  tradition  of  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  our  Constitution  does  not  contemplate  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  would  adjudicate  cases  in  this  fashion.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  briefly  identify  the  three,  if  I  could. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  the  Constitution  contemplates  the 

 

 

 

 

availability  of  a  neutral  forum  for  suits  against 

   

 

 

 

 

 

noncitizens,  and  by  analogy,  noncitizens  as  you  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg,  have  always  been  able  to  remove  a  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  State  to  Federal  court. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  United  States  at  the  time  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporation  could  not  have  accepted  that  non­Indians 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  be  able  to  remove  to  a  neutral  forum. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second,  the  Constitution  contemplates  that 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  will  be  the  one  Supreme  Court,  and  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  rulings  on  questions  of  Federal  law  have,  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  always  been  reviewable  in  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  I  ­­ I  don't  ­­ this 

   

   

  

 

 

 

is  an  important  part  of  the  dialogue,  but  let  me  just  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  the  first  part  of  ­­ of  ­­ of  your  response. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  ­­ is  it  black­letter  law  given  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribes  have  complete  legislative  authority  over 

 

 

 

 

 

non­Tribe  members  on  ­­ for  ­­ for  regulatory  purposes?

I  ­­ I  ­­ I  take  it  that  as  a  black­letter  law  given? 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Kennedy,  if  we  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ in  those  terms,  regulatory  authority  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  into  the  question  of  all  forms  of  legislation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  example,  tort  law,  then  the  first  exception  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana  says  that,  although  there  is  a  presumption 

   

 

 

 

 

 

against  jurisdiction,  the  Tribes  do  have  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulatory  authority. 

 

            

We  have  the  argument  that  tort  law,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  so  broad  and  would  swallow  the  rule,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribes  lack  legislative  authority  over  nonmembers.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  argument  that  that  is  not  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative  jurisdiction. 

 

            

            

What  I  had  said  at  the  beginning  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  doesn't  that  clash 

  

 

 

 

 

with  what  the  Court  said  in  Strate?  I  mean,  Strate  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll  read  you  the  sentence.  It  says,  "It's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unremarkable  proposition  that  where  tribes  possess 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  regulate  the  activity  of  nonmembers,  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  disputes  arising  out  of  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activities  presumptively  lies  in  tribal  courts." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Justice  Ginsburg,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

need  to  just  separate  two  questions: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  Kennedy  I  understood  to  be  asking  me 

   

 

 

 

 

 

was:  Do  the  Tribes  have  the  antecedent  legislative

authority?  And  I  was  explaining  that  we  have  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  in  the  tort  context  they  do  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

It  was  a  ­­

   

 

            

You  then  point  out  that  if  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  this  is  a  tort  case. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  then  I  don't  understand 

   

  

 

 

 

why  you  opened  your  ­­ your  ­­ are  ­­ I  ­­ I  thought  you

well,  I  ­­

   

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  We  assumed. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ I  ­­ I  ­­ you 

   

   

  

 

 

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  We  ­­

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ that  this  could  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Well,  Justice  ­­

one.

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.

a  good  argument  in  our  favor.  I  was  just  attempting  to

identify  the  narrowest  ground  for  reversal. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm  very  pleased  to  discuss  the  threshold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  and  that  is  that,  with  respect  to  nonmembers,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribes  do  not  have  the  authority  to  subject  us  to  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sweeping  tort  law  duties.  It's  not  that  there  aren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tort  law  duties.  The  plaintiff  here  is  a  citizen  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  of  Mississippi.  Mississippi's  tort  ­­ State  tort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  does  apply  to  the  case.  And  the  plaintiff  has  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  in  State  court. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  will  you  then  go  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  my  question  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ about  Strate?  Because 

  

  

 

 

 

if  what  you're  arguing  now  is  correct,  Strate  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  a  one­line  decision:  No  tort  jurisdiction  over  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

non­Indian. 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Well,  Justice  Ginsburg,  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

true  that  this  Court's  decisions  can  often  be  resolved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  different  ways.  What  Nevada  v.  Hicks  in  the  footnote 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressing  this  question  explains  is  that  what  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  done  is  narrowly  identify  the  legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  of  the  Tribe  in  the  cases  before  it.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  in  Strate  and  in  other  cases,  it  has  held  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  lacked  that  antecedent  legislative  authority.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on  that  basis,  concluded  that,  well,  then  because  the

adjudicatory  authority  can't  be  broader  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative  authority,  there's  no  adjudicatory  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

either. 

            

So  the  second  point  that  I  was  going  to  make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  it's  true  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  are  ­­ are  you  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  this  sentence  that  I  just  read  to  you  from  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  of  the  Court  was  just  wrong? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Ginsburg,  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Court  has  said  in  Nevada  v.  Hicks,  addressing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various  times  that  there  is  dictum  in  the  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinions  that  has  assumed  the  parallel  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative  and  adjudicatory  jurisdiction  is  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  had  not  been  fully  considered  by  the  Court  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  remained  open.  And  we  assume  that  that's  one  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  the  Court  granted  review  in  this  case.  To 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide,  assuming  that  there  is  legislative  jurisdiction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  there  also  is  adjudicatory  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I'm  pleased  to  explain  why  it  is.  And

the  antecedent  legislative  jurisdiction,  here's  why  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  jurisdiction  to  decide  a  court  case  in  this

moment? 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  I  address  that  for  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

States  appoint  judges.  Sometimes  they're 

  

 

 

 

elected,  but  often  they're  appointed.  We  don't  think  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lacks  being  a  neutral  forum  because  the  State  can  sue  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen  there.  We  think  of  it  as  neutral  because  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges  are  neutral. 

 

 

            

You're  just  assuming  that  these  judges  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  neutral. 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Oh,  Justice  Sotomayor,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

think  actually  that  your  hypothetical  is  a  good  one  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us. 

            

In  Article  III  of  the  Constitution,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplate  the  availability  of  a  neutral  forum  when  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

noncitizen  is  a  defendant  in  the  case,  including  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we,  you  know,  ordinarily  respect  the  neutrality  of  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  judges.  Right?  If  a  noncitizen  is  sued  in  State 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

court,  like  we  are  a  noncitizen  of  the  Tribe,  is  sued  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Tribe  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  that's  out  of  comity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

or  our  sense  of  comity  between  the  States.  But  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  anything  to  do  with  the  fairness  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial  forum.

disagree,  Your  Honor.  My  understanding  of  the  premise 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  removal  jurisdiction  is  that  there  was  a  concern  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  least  a  belief  that  respect  for  rule  of  law  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhanced  by  the  availability  of  a  neutral  forum. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But  I  did  want  ­­

   

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What's  wrong  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

tribal  courts? 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  What's  wrong  with  the  tribal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

courts?  It  depends. 

  

 

            

First  of  all,  let  me  say  that  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modern  tribal  judiciaries  like  this  one  that  deserve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

genuine  respect.  That  are  ­­ have  developed  real 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  in  attempt  to  identify  law  that  can  be  known 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ex  ante  and  the  availability  of  a  neutral  forum. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  are,  however,  many  tribes,  everyone 

 

 

 

 

 

agrees,  that  don't  have  anything  like  that.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead  deserve  respect  in  a  different  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  Fine.  So  ­­ so 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

we've  seen  lots  of  tribal  courts,  which  I  can't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish  them  in  the  fairness  and  procedure  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forth  from  every  other  court  in  the  country,  and  maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  some  where  that  isn't  true. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  what  ­­ what  you  do  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  go  and  complain,  we  didn't  get  due  process  of  law.

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Two  things  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  If  you're  in  one  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ones  that  has  some  unusual  thing  about  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  you're  in  a  normal  thing,  you  say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  normal. 

 

            

            

            

So  what's  wrong  with  saying  just  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Like  a  State  court  which 

   

  

 

 

 

has  terrible  procedures,  terribly  unfair,  or  a  foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

court.  You  complain  you  didn't  get  proper  process. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

But  that  has  nothing  to  do  with  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  All  right.  I  ­­

    

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Or  little. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You  ­­ you  can  remove  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  court,  can't  you? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  That's  right. 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  when  ­­ and  ­­ and  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal  is  asked  for,  we  don't  ask  the  question,  what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  matter  with  State  courts?  Do  we? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  That's  right.  Our 

  

  

 

 

Constitution  ­­

not  going  to  lose  sight  of  your  question,  but  just  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  point,  our  Constitution  says  we  anticipate  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neutral  forum  that  this  Court  will  ­­ the  Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  the  Constitution 

  

 

 

 

says  the  removal  of  statute  is  a  statute.  It's  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional. 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Ginsburg,  I 

  

 

 

 

understand  that.  My  ­­ what  ­­ and,  Justice  Breyer,  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  losing  sight  of  your  question  ­­ what  the  ­­ what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Oliphant  and  other  precedents  of  this  Court  say  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Tribes  have  the  sovereign  authority  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  overriding  sovereignty  of  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States.  And  the  point  I  was  trying  to  make  is  that  our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  tradition  understands  that  there  will  be  certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic  protections. 

 

            

And  remember,  two  of  the  things  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identifying  in  the  Constitution  are  not  specific  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States:  The  supremacy  of  the  Constitution  ­­ but  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  does  not  apply  in  tribal  courts  ­­ and  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  supremacy  of  this  Court  as  the  one  Supreme  Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  not  available. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  Justice  Scalia,  those  are  features  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  national  legal  tradition,  and  those  features  existed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  time  of  incorporation  of  the  Tribes  into  the

United  States.  And  my  point  is  that  Congress  could  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  believed  that,  if  State  courts  couldn't  do  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things,  that  the  tribal  courts  would  be  superior. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  Justice  Breyer,  you  said,  well,  what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong?  Two  things.  I  want  to  say  that  there  are  some 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  wrong  even  in  the  context  of  a  tribe  like  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one. 

            

For  example,  we  have  a  Federal  claim  against 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  due  process  ­­ a  due  process  claim  against  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putative  damage  award  in  ­­ that's  asked  for  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  and  that  would  be  entirely  unreviewable  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

Now,  you  contemplate  the  prospect  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  collaterally  attack  the  judgment.  A  few  things 

    

 

 

 

 

 

about  that. 

 

            

The  first  is,  if  that's  going  to  be  serious, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  we  are  really  going  to  have  a  serious  regime  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral  attacks  where  you  would  just  assess  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not  the  tribal  court  ruling  is  consistent  with  due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process.  That  is  hardly  treating  the  tribal  courts  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereigns.  Imagine  a  Federal  district  court  ruling 

   

  

 

 

 

could  be  overturned  by  a  circuit  court  in  Mississippi. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  wouldn't  say  that  that  was  an  actual  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling. 

            

And  the  second  is  that  that  review  system  is

extremely  rare.  The  Respondents  identify  a  single  case, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

one  Ninth  Circuit  case  in  which  a  tribal  ruling  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overturned. 

            

What  the  Federal  courts  have  done  is  afford 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enormous  respect  and  only  overturned  rulings  of  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  or  foreign  courts  that  are  way  out  of  bounds.  My 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  that  the  rule  that's  contemplated  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  is  not  one  of  being  way  out  of  bounds,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  simply  that  we  have  a  right  to  due  process;  that  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  will  be  the  Supreme  Court,  that  the  Constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  supreme  law  of  the  land.  And  when  that  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  in  the  courts  that  we  are  talking  about,  even  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best­managed,  most  modern  courts,  when  those  rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  don't  apply,  that  is  not  consistent  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  doesn't  the  Indian 

  

 

 

 

 

Civil  Rights  Act  ­­ I  mean,  it's  not  the  Bill  of  Rights, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act  is  pretty  close. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Well,  Justice  Ginsburg,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

rule  of  the  Constitution  is  not  "close  is  good  enough," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  will  say  that  I  think  the  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  point  in  our  favor.  Because  when  you  talk  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  regulatory  matters  discussed  in  the  first  Montana 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  like  taxation  and  licensing,  those  are  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  has  left  to  the  Tribes.  But  the  Indian 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Civil  Rights  Act,  like  Public  Law  280,  like  the  Courts

of  Indian  Offenses,  like  the  Indian  deprivation  system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shows  that  the  United  States  has  actually  been  deeply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  in  the  tribal  judiciary.  It  has  not  treated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  adjudication  of  civil  claims  as  something  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belongs  to  the  Tribes.  It's  quite  different. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  United  States  obviously  did  not  regard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Tribes'  judiciary  as  something  that  is  purely  a  part 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  their  government,  because  time  and  again,  it  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

micromanaged  them. 

 

            

And,  Justice  Breyer,  I  do  want  to  point  out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  example  of  that,  and  that  is  the  Violence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Against  Women  Act.  There,  we  see  the  right  way  of  doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  and  that  Congress  has  developed  systems  that  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  this  tribal  judiciary  is  a  good  one  which  affords  due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process,  then  it  has  jurisdiction  over  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  think  that's  the  right  approach  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  the  institutional  capacity  to  develop  rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  one  you  were  talking  about.  It's  a  much 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  can  do  it  both  ways. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  there  are  books,  some  of  which  I  have  at  least 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  through,  and  certainly  articles  that  suggest  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  tribal  courts  function  perfectly  well,  certainly  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  places. 

 

            

Now,  I  take  it  your  argument  is  that  there

are  some  places  they  don't  function  well,  and  in  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  matters  that  are  not  matters  of  Federal  law,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't  be  review  from  those  courts  unless  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collaterally  attack  them.  Is  that  your  point? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Breyer,  as  I 

  

 

 

 

 

mentioned,  we  have  real  concerns,  even  with  respect  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  like  this  one.  For  just  an  example  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  just  want  to  know,  have  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  your  point  right? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  No,  I  ­­ our  point  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

broader.  You  had  suggested,  Justice  Breyer,  that  I  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

concerned  about  another  set  of  tribal  judiciaries.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  don't  want  to  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns,  even  when  you  have  the  most  modern  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judiciary. 

            

An  example  is  that  the  ­­ we  are  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noncitizen,  a  nonmember  of  the  Tribe,  and  the  tribal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  may  be  composed  only  of  members  of  the  Tribe,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  inherent  rule  that  stops  the  jury  members 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  being  people  who  know  the  plaintiff. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  with  respect  to  other  judiciaries,  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  that  we  do  recognize,  and  the  United  States  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized,  a  wide  swath  of  tribes  that  use  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional  dispute­resolution  mechanisms  that  also 

 

 

 

 

deserve  respect  because  that's  the  tribal  tradition.

But  it  is  not  the  tradition  of  due  process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  nontribal  member  goes 

  

 

 

 

 

And  the  question  you've  got  to  figure  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  tribal  land  and  signs  an  agreement  that  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  law  would  apply,  and  then  commits  a  tort  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  lands,  and  even  under  those  circumstances,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  the  court  is  functioning  well,  the  tribal  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  take  jurisdiction  over  his  claim.  That's  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position.  And  then  to  that  I  say,  if  I  haven't  got  it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

already,  why  not? 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Justice  Breyer,  I  do 

   

  

  

 

 

think  your  hypothetical  of  a  contract  is  a  really  good 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

one  for  us,  because  we  do  believe  that  the  Respondents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  most  concerned,  and  their  best  facts  are  a  business 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  this  one,  to  be  honest,  that's  operating  on  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land,  in  the  Reservation  on  an  ongoing  basis,  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  look,  you  have  to  have  anticipated  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicability  of  tribal  tort  law.  We  disagree,  but  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  the  argument. 

 

 

            

My  point  is  that  in  these  circumstances, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  Tribes  do  is,  as  a  condition  of  operating  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Reservation,  they  call  for  not  just  what  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describe,  which  is  the  application  of  tribal  law,  but  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent  to  the  forum.  And  remember,  in  this  case,  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  consent  to  the  forum,  but  the  ­­ which  the  Tribe

wrote,  but  they  limited  it  to  disputes  arising  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lease. 

            

So  we  say,  going  forward,  we  have  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solutions.  One  I've  described:  That's  the  prospect  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  action.  You  say  it  could  work  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way,  and  I'll  come  back  to  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

But  the  second  is  just  the  contract. 

 

 

 

 

Obviously,  in  the  cases  that  they  are  concerned  about, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  tribe  can  do  and  will  do  is  require  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

condition  of  coming  onto  the  Reservation  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accede,  knowingly  and  actually,  to  the  jurisdiction  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  tribal  courts,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  Mr.  Goldstein,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

could  have  done  that,  too.  The  contract  can  go  either 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  The  question  is  what's  the  default  rule  when  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  doesn't  say  anything. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Actually,  it  wouldn't  work 

  

 

 

 

 

the  other  way,  Justice  Kagan,  with  all  due  respect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Remember,  this  is  a  private  tort  suit  by  a  member  of  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  but  remember,  this  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  ­­ this  is  an  exception  for  consent.  The  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company  would  have  ­­ the  store  would  have  an  extremely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  argument  that  it  didn't  consent  if  it  had  signed  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  with  anybody,  with  the  Tribe,  not  just  with  the

individual  person.  If  it  had  signed  a  contract  with  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe,  saying  we  insist  on  a  State  forum,  they  clearly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  consented. 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Well,  Justice  Kagan,  I  just 

   

  

 

 

 

don't  understand  how  it  is  the  case  ­­ I  disagree,  let 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  just  explain  why.  I  understand  that  you  take  the  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  the  opposite  view. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  a  private  person  sues  us,  the  fact  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  a  contract  with  that  ­­ that  individual  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  does  not  strip  a  State  court  of  jurisdiction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  their  private  suit.  So  that's  our  view  of  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  it  does  when  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Montana  exception  relies  upon  a  consensual  relationship. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  But  Justice  Kagan,  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other  side  to  win,  what  they  have  ­­ their  premise  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  consensual  relationship  exists  in  simply  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  with  the  individual  tribal  member,  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract.  Remember,  their  point  is  that  a  contract  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

irrelevant.  So  the  consent  would  exist  simply  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

operating  the  business. 

 

 

            

But  in  all  events,  it  is  the  case  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  insist  on  a  contract;  they  can  insist  on  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract.  My  point  to  Justice  Breyer  was  simply  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  upshot  of  our  position  still  leaves  enormous  room

for  the  exercise  of  tribal  sovereignty.  They  do  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  power.  Remember  that  the  data  before  you  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  indicates  that  this  is  a  very  small 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

proportion  of  cases  that  the  tribal  courts  adjudicate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  data  from  this  Tribe  indicates  that  it's  1  percent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  cases. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  All  of  these  arguments,  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  ­­ let  me  figure  out  whether  this  is  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  arguments  about  it's  ­­ it's  a  nonneutral  forum, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  an  unfair  forum,  we  don't  know  whether  they  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  procedures  that  ­­ that  are  commonly  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commonly  exist  in  Federal  and  State  courts.  Those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  have  nothing  to  do  with  tort  claims  versus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  claims;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  They  do  have  a  lot  to  do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  fact  that  it's  a  private  claim.  Let  me 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish,  importantly,  actions  by  the  Tribe  itself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  analogy  here  is  that  when  a  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sues  a  noncitizen,  that  is  an  act  of  the  sovereign  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  not  removable,  because  what  Montana  is  concerned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with,  what  this  Court's  precedents  are  concerned  with, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  exercise  of  sovereign  authority  in  the  pursuit  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­governance. 

            

This  is  not  a  sovereign  action.  This  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

private  suit  between  two  individuals,  and  so  it  is

important  that  if  the  Tribe  is  exercising  its  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority,  bringing  a  civil  enforcement  action  against 

   

 

 

 

 

us,  for  example,  that  would  have  presented  ­­ present  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  different  question,  because  it  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty.  It  has  never  been  understood  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  if  the  Tribe  brought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  suit,  instead  of  the  parents  of  the  boy  who  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

molested,  if  ­­ if  it  ­­ then  it  would  be  okay? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Well,  we  think  that's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

impossibility.  Remember  that  the  other  side's 

  

 

 

 

 

explanation  ­­ although  there  aren't  any  citations;  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard  to  know  what  the  tort  law  is  ­­ the  other  side's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation  is  that  tort  law  of  the  Tribe  tracks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mississippi  tort  law,  and  there  isn't  a  situation  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  Tribe  could  bring  such  an  action.  And  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  it  was  a  parens  patriae  action,  we  would  still  regard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  as  in  the  interest  of  the  individual. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm  thinking  instead,  Justice  Ginsburg,  of 

 

 

 

 

 

take  the  follow­on  to  what  Montana  describes,  that  is,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

licensing  regulation  or  a  taxation  regulation.  We 

   

  

 

 

 

believe  that  if  the  Tribe  went  into  tribal  court  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  those  measures,  that  would  be  a  sovereign  action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  would  be  susceptible  of  the  Montana  exception. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  difference  is  when  the  Tribe  is  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  here.  We  don't  deny  that  there  is  some  sovereign

interest.  Okay.  There  is  some  sovereign  interest  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  adjudication. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It's  a  bit  of  an  odd 

   

  

 

 

 

 

argument,  isn't  it,  Mr.  Goldstein,  that  there's  less  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  sovereign  interest  in  protecting  your  own  citizens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  in  enforcing  your  licensing  laws? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  If  that  were  our  argument, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  be  an  odd  one.  What  we  say  is  that  you  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  different  regime.  If  you  have  a  legal  regime  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  here  is  a  duty  towards  our  noncitizen,  our  ­­ our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  members  or  just  individuals  on  the  Reservation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  if  you  violate  that,  here  are  a  set  of  fines,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  excluded  from  the  Reservation,  then  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  an  act  of  the  sovereign. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  our  point  isn't  just  it's  the  nature  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ you  know,  this  is  a  very  serious  allegation  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  take  very  seriously  about  a  minor  child,  a  member  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Tribe.  I  am  not  demeaning  that  in  any  way  and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  well,  that's  less  important  than  taxation  or  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hunting  license.  Not  at  all. 

  

 

 

 

            

My  point  is  that  you  are  being  asked  that  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  the  Tribes  came  into  the  United  States,  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  suit  against  a  nonmember  regarded  as  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

incidence  of  sovereignty,  could  the  Congress  of  the

consistently,  let  me  say,  suggests  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ that  Congress  could 

  

 

 

 

 

authorize  this  jurisdiction. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Could  Congress  pass  a  law 

   

  

 

 

 

saying  that  all  500­plus  Indian  Tribes  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  have  unlimited  criminal  authority,  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose  life  sentences  on  nontribal  members,  American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens? 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  We  think  not,  and  let  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  the  reason.  That  would  be  State  action.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  the  Federal  government  would  be  passing  a  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  shunting  the  jurisdiction  over  an 

 

 

 

 

 

individual's  matter  into  another  adjudicative  system. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  why  can  they  do  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  there's  a  limit  on  that,  why  isn't  is  there  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit  on  what  Congress  could  do  with  reference  to  tort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law?  Because  you  get  unlimited  power  ­­ 500  tribes  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlimited  power  to  impose  punitive  damages  for  civil

we've  switched  to  the  civil  context  now  in  your  newest

If  the  Tribe's  judgment  would  presumably  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable  in  the  courts  of  the  United  States  or  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State,  there  would  be  State  action  then,  and  it  would

nothing.

because  Congress  is  subject  to  the  Constitution.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  violate  the  Supremacy  Clause;  it  would  violate

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Kennedy,  we  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

with  you  that  there's  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  We  could  say  ­­

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ the  Montana  First 

  

 

 

 

 

exception.  We  could  say  the  Montana  First  exception 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  apply  to  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  We  do  ­­ okay.  Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Kennedy,  we  do  make  the  argument  you're  describing.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apologize.  I  misunderstood  your  point.  It's  my  fault. 

    

  

 

 

 

 

            

We  say  that  there  is  a  significant 

   

 

 

 

 

constitutional  avoidance  argument  ­­ that's  how  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describe  it  ­­ in  concluding  to  ­­ for  concluding  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana  does  not  apply  here  because  of  the  very  serious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prospects  that  there  would  be  a  loss  of  property  without

what  you've  described. 

 

 

            

This  plaintiff  has  sued  us  for  multiple

that  is  this  is  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  land. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Supremacy  Clause  says  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  will  be  the  supreme  law  throughout  the

jurisdiction  over  disputes  arising  from  the  lease. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  is  when  the  Tribe  itself,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  of  its  sovereign  authority,  brings  the  action,

licensing  rule.  Also  importantly,  the  Tribe  has  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­help  remedy  of  exclusion  from  the  Reservation.

court  ­­ court  jurisdiction  over  a  nonmember,  have  we? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  I  think  that  you  haven't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

applied  the  rule.  But  as  Justice  Ginsburg  was  saying, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  unanimously,  in  Strate,  said  that  when  tribes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possess  authority  to  regulate  activities  of  nonmembers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil  jurisdiction  over  disputes  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right.  Right.  But 

  

  

  

 

 

I  guess  I  want  to  make  sure  I  understand  what's  at  issue 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

There  has  never  been  a  case  in  which  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonmember  has  been  haled  into  Indian  tribal  court  for  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  basis  of  tort,  has  there? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  I  think  that  there  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

been  many  cases,  Your  Honor.  Four  of  them  have  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  this  Court  in  which  they  have  been  haled  before. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  Strate  is  an  example.  Iowa  Mutual  is  an  example.

questions  on  antecedent  grounds  ­­

little  odd  to  say  this  is  in  the  heartland  of  Indian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  don't  think  it's  odd  at  all. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  rule  that  this  Court  laid  down.  That's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  in  Strate.  And  my  friend,  Mr.  Goldstein's,

in  this  area,  which  are  all  tort  cases,  lead  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion. 

            

Mr.  Goldstein's  best  argument  is  Hicks.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

remember  in  Hicks,  the  Court  went  out  of  its  way  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  claims  in  El  Paso,  which  were  very  similar  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  claims  here  ­­ it  was  a  nonmember  business  doing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  on  tribal  land.  It  was  a  tort  lawsuit  ­­ what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  this  Court  say,  citing  to  footnote  4  of  El  Paso? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  is  little  doubt  there  was  jurisdiction  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

So  yes,  I  understand  that  they  are  dicta, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

but  it  is  dicta  of  the  most  persuasive  sort.  It  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unbroken  rule  of  this  Court,  frankly,  that  in  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  cases,  this  Court  has  said  there  is  presumptively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

And  indeed,  the  exhaustion  cases  would  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  sense  otherwise  because  twice  this  Court  said,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tort  cases,  in  Iowa  Mutual  and  National  Farmers  Union, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  said  you've  got  to  go  to  tribal  court  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaust  your  remedies. 

 

 

            

And  Justice  Scalia,  if  the  rule  in  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  was,  hey,  tribal  courts  don't  have  jurisdiction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  would  have  done  what  you  did  in  your  opinion  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hicks,  because  at  page  369  you  said,  quote,  "Since  it's

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Does  your  argument  apply 

  

 

 

 

 

whenever  a  nonmember  enters  into  a  commercial 

   

   

 

 

transaction  with  a  member? 

   

 

            

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  No,  it  doesn't  apply  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  On  tribal  land? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  on  tribal  land  we  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­ we  don't  think  you  have  to  go  as  far  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor  General  to  say  it's  absolutely  100  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispositive,  but  we  do  think  this  Court  has  recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Merrion  and  El  Paso  that  when  you're  on  tribal  lands, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  tribe's  powers  are  at  their  zenith. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I'm  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

understand  the  limits  of  your  ­­ of  your  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  would  happen  in  this  situation?  A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribe  ­­ a  member  of  the  Tribe  purchases  a  product 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

online  from  a  nonmember  company,  and  the  product  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

delivered  to  the  Tribal  member  on  tribal  land.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delivery  person  gets  involved  in  a  traffic  accident  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  other  dispute  in  the  course  of  delivering  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product,  and  the  product  itself  injures  the  person  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchased  it. 

 

            

So  could  the  ­­ the  person  who  got  into  ­­

Could  the  person  who  ­­ the  tribal  member 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  purchased  the  product  bring  a  products  liability 

   

 

 

 

 

 

action  against  the  manufacturer  in  tribal  court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  It  depends  a  little  bit  more  on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  facts.  In  general,  what  this  Court  has  said  is  that

Tribe  ­­ on  tribal  land.  And  so,  you  know,  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent  that  that  delivery  service  was  operated  by,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  by  the  nonmember  and  that  they're  actually  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  delivery,  absolutely.  There's  a  nexus  between  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

delivery  and  the  injury. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  it  was  some  exotic  tort,  so  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  it's  the  delivery  truck  comes  onto  tribal  land, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  unbeknownst  to  them  there's  some  unusual  tradition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  says  delivery  trucks  have  to  be  painted,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  other  color  or  something  like  that  that  they  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  about,  I  think  this  Court's  decision  in  Plains 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commerce  Bank  says  that's  not  what  you're  reasonably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anticipating. 

            

So  this  is  a  very  limited  rule,  really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

tailored  ­­ it's  circumstances  like  this  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  ­­ the  law  of  every  jurisdiction  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  All  right.  What  about  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

­­ what  about  the  products  liability  action?

MR.  KATYAL:  So  again,  if  ­­ if  a  business 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  sending  ­­ intentionally,  knowingly  sending  goods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

onto  tribal  land,  and  those  turn  out  to  be  defective, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  they're  liable  for  that,  for  that  tort.  That  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that's  a  reasonably  ­­ reasonably  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

anticipated  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  that  could  be  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

punitive  damages,  millions  of  dollars? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  If  ­­ if  that's  what  they  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consented  to.  So  for  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  No.  No.  There's  no 

  

  

  

 

 

consent.  It's  just  what  Justice  Alito  said,  that  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send  their  products  to  50  different  States  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  If  ­­ if  there's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ and  all  of  the  tribes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KATYAL:  If  ­­ if  they  do  so  knowingly, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  there  is  that  kind  of  long­term  relationship,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  unless  they  themselves  disclaim  that  ­­ and  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course  it's  very  easy  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  number  one,  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

not  explicit  consent.  We  can  get  into  that  later. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well  ­­ well,  I  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  don't  know  what 

    

 

 

 

authority  Congress  has  to  subject  citizens  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  to  that  nonconstitutional  forum. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  It's  exactly  what  this  Court  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Justice  Kennedy  joined  this  in  Plains  Commerce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bank  ­­ because  what  this  Court  said  is  that,  yes,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  these  constitutional  concerns  that  ­­ or  that  tribes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ you  know,  tribes  are  outside  the  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  and  so  on. 

 

 

 

            

But  when  someone  consents  through  their 

 

 

 

 

 

words  or  their  actions,  not  express  consent,  then  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

takes  it  out  of  that  circumstance. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  Dollar  General  had  a  remedy  available 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  it  right  away.  It  ­­ it  didn't  have  ­­ nobody  forced

this  country,  Justice  Kennedy,  when  you  do  those  things, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  open  yourselves  up  to  the  reasonable  liability  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follows.  This  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  let  me  give  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

another  ­­ another  hypothetical:  Somebody  goes  to  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian  casino  and  loses  a  lot  of  money,  and  then  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  goes  home,  the  person  goes  online  and  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  they  ­­ they  cheated  me.  The  game  was  rigged. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  ­­ the  Blackjack  dealer  was  doing  something.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ and  so  then  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  Tribe  ­­ could  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  sue  that  person  for  defamation  in  tribal  court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  ­­ I  think 

   

   

   

  

 

 

that  that  that's  not  something  that  would  be  permissible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  this  Court's  Atkinson  Trading  nexus  test.  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  got  to  be  something  that's  got  to  be  reasonably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anticipated,  and  I'm  not  really  sure  that  that  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  is. 

 

            

All  we're  saying  here  is  that  this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance  in  which,  as  the  Solicitor  General's  brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  Page  32  says,  the  law  of  every  jurisdiction  treats

Yes,  there  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  so  how  do  you  deal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  ­­ I  think  it  is  a  stronger  point  on  the  other 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side,  is  the  absence  of  removal,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Yes.  That  ­­ that  ­­ that  I  do 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  something  that  ­­ you  know,  that  my  friend  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  side  has  said.  But  of  course,  as  you  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  Justice  Ginsburg,  removal  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally  compelled.  So  it  would  require  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

Here  the  removal  statute  requires  diversity, 

 

 

 

 

 

full  diversity  between  the  parties,  and  $75,000  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit.  And  I  don't  think  that  we  would  say  anything 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  doesn't  fall  within  that  is  somehow  not  an  incident 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  sovereignty. 

 

            

And  I  also  would  point  to  this  Court's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

language  in  Iowa  Mutual  about  the  diversity  statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  what  this  Court  said  with  respect  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversity  statute  is,  you  know,  it  does  require  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

That  statute  doesn't  really  tell  us 

 

 

 

 

 

anything,  one  way  or  the  other,  about  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  And  what  this  Court  went  on  to  say  is

that  civil  tribal  tort  jurisdiction  is  an  incident  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty.  It's  Williams  v.  Lee.  It's  about  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

right  of  the  people  to  govern  themselves. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  you  know,  to  treat  this, 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy,  like  express  consent  is  to  treat  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribe  the  way  you're  treating  the  American  Arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Association  or  JAMS,  and  that  has  never  been  what  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  said.  When  you're  dealing  with  the  Montana  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception,  which  is  a  limited  exception,  it  requires 

   

 

 

 

 

 

really  ­­ you  know,  it  requires  a  true  relationship,  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open  and  honest  consent  of  the  kind  that  existed  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  they  knew  they  were  coming  onto  tribal  lands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  subjecting  themselves  to  tribal  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Do  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

contractual  provision  acquiescence  in  the  application  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  law  limited  in  the  way  that  it  was  if  they  were, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact,  subjecting  themselves  to  tribal  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across  the  board? 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  don't  think  it  was

premises." 

            

            

That  is  not  limited  language. 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  there  any  reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  issue  that  we're  arguing  about  couldn't  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealt  with  through  particular  contractual  provisions,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  in  some  cases  where  you  either  suggest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yourselves  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  tribal  court  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not? 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Sure.  I  think  that  they  could, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ on  either  side.  I  think  that's  ­­ that's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible.  But  I  think  what  this  Court  has  said,  time 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  again,  is  that  that  is  not  necessary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Your  language,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  in  Plains 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commerce  Bank,  is  that  you  can  consent  by  your  words  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  actions.  This  Court's  earlier  language  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

path­marking  Montana  case  is  not  that  it  requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express  consent,  but  rather  through  commercial  dealing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts,  leases  or  other  arrangements. 

 

 

 

 

            

For  you  to  go  further  than  that  and  adopt  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend's  argument  is  to  radically  depart  from  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

path­marking  decision,  and  change  the  rules  and  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribes  on  no  greater  a  footing  than  the  American 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitration  Association.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  what  ­­ what  would  ­­ do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  to  reach  in  this  case  the  question  of  products, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability  for  products  sent  into  the  tribal  area? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  have  thought  you  could  say  this  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  involve  that,  if  you're  willing  to  read  ­­ and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  if  you  are  ­­ nonmembers  who  enter  into  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  explicit  consensual  relationship  growing  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ in  relation  to  a  contract  to  which  relationship 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  tort  is  directly  related. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  is  there  any  ­­ and  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  what  is  the  word  in  Cherokee?  I  forget.  It's 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"something  dependent  nation."  What  kind  of  ­­ it  was  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  two  words  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Domestic  dependent  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What? 

  

 

MR.  KATYAL:  Domestic  dependent  nation? 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Domestic?  All  right. 

  

  

 

 

So  if,  in  fact,  Tasmania  had  this  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation,  and  an  American  went  to  Tasmania  and  got  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  judgment,  I  take  it  our  courts  would  enforce 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And,  of  course  you're  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  agree  with  this,  but  if  I  ­­ but  if  I  ­­ if  I  want  ­­

the  vast  number  of  tribal  courts  are  indistinguishable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  terms  of  fairness,  et  cetera,  from  the  courts  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  courts  in  the  United  States,  what  would  I  read? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  think,  you 

   

   

   

  

 

 

know,  we've  cited  to,  you  know,  some  large  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Which  of  those  do  you  want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  to  read? 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  that  maybe 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Justice  O'Connor's  article  is  a  good  place  to  start. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  I  ­­ I  think  what  I  would  say  there, 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer,  is  that  fairness  concerns  have  never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  relevant  to  the  jurisdictional  inquiry.  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  this  Court's  decision  in  Iowa  ­­ Iowa  Mutual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said. 

            

With  respect  to  your  product­liability 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical,  we  think  there  are  four  limits  on  the  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have,  which  is  why  ­­ you  know,  look,  this  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  on  for  a  long  time,  tribal  court  jurisdiction. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  hasn't  seen  fit  to  modify  it,  you  know,  if  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  concerned  about  the  concerns  Justice  Kennedy  had. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  reason  is  because  this  is  a  limited 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing.  It  requires  a  very  tight  nexus  ­­ that's,  you

jury  verdict  where  the  jury  consists  solely  of  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members? 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well  ­­ well,  first  of  all,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  that's  not  necessarily  what's  going  on  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  no  jury  trial  in  this  case.  But  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  understand  that. 

    

 

 

 

But  it's  kind  of  a  yes­or­no  question.  Does  it  ­­ does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  violate  due  process  as  a  general  matter  for  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonmember  to  be  subjected  to  a  jury  trial  with  the  jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

composed  solely  of  members  of  the  Tribe? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  ­­ I  could  see  it  violating 

    

   

 

 

 

 

ICRA.  It  wouldn't  violate,  formally,  the  Constitution. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It  would  violate,  you  know,  the  due  ­­ it  arguably  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violate  the  Due  Process  Clauses  incorporated  into  ICRA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  would  be  something  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  because  tribes  are 

  

 

 

 

 

not  governed  by  the  Due  Process  Clause.

MR.  KATYAL:  Yes.  But  they  are  governed  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  They're  nonconstitutional 

  

 

 

MR.  KATYAL:  Correct.  But  Congress  has 

  

  

 

 

 

            

            

entities. 

            

brought  the  Due  Process  Clause  to  tribes  in  the  form  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ICRA.  And  of  course,  Justice  Kennedy,  if  they  were  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned  and  said,  look,  we  don't  even  like  the  way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribes,  you're  interpreting  ICRA  or  something  like  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  courts,  they  could  go  further.  They  could  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  guess  they  could  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

MR.  KATYAL:  They  could  ban  those  juries. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They  have  plenary  jurisdiction  in  this  area.  That's  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ball  game  is  in  Congress's  court,  Congress's  shoes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  in  this  Court's. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  ­­ is  it  right?  I'm

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you  think  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  think  the  concerns  are  on  the  same  level:  Forcing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  in  a  State  court  to  be  subjected  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New  Yorker  to  be  subject  to  jurisdiction  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone's  from  Massachusetts  because  it's  Massachusetts 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  You  think  that's  the  same  as  subjecting  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonmember  accused  of  a  terrible  assault  on  an  Indian  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  before  a  jury  consisting  solely  of  members 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Tribe. 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  don't  think  it's  the  same, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  but  I  think  there  are  two  things 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  make  them  similar.  One  is  that  they  themselves, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  nonmember,  is  consenting  to  that  by  going  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  store  here,  setting  up  shop  and  running  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribal  Opportunities  Program  and  serving  its  members. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  number  two,  the  big  difference  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  full  control  over  there.  If  they  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned  about  all  tribal  member  juries  or  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  that,  they  can  regulate  those. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Civil  jurisdiction  and  tribal  courts  have 

 

 

 

 

 

been  going  on  for  decades,  and  we  haven't  seen  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  that.  And  indeed  much  ­­ and  very  interesting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  you've  got  the  sovereigns  of  every  relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entities,  you've  got  the  United  States,  as  well  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  of  Mississippi  itself,  saying  we're  not  concerned

about  those  things.  Actually,  this  is  an  incident  of  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  The  Constitution  runs  to 

  

 

 

 

 

the  people.  The  people  have  a  right  to  insist  on  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  even  if  Mississippi  or  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  doesn't  care. 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  completely  agree  with  that, 

    

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy.  My  only  point  is  to  say  that,  here, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dollar  General  has  themselves,  by  opening  ­­ they  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  have  the  keys  to  avoiding  this  by  not  showing  up  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Reservation  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  This  ­­ this  gets  into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

implied  consent,  express  consent,  you  know,  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypotheticals.  You  consent  to  have  your  luggage 

  

 

 

 

 

 

searched,  you  go  through  this,  I  don't  consent,  I  don't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

consent  ­­ it's  implied.  Everybody  knows  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  this  is  ­­ this  is  quite  ­­ it  seems  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  that  the  first  exception  in  Montana  is  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  It  talks  about  contracts,  and  the  Tribe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  certainly  have  put  this  in  a  contract  if  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  just  like  an  arbitration  clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  Justice  Kennedy,  we  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­ the  argument  doesn't  depend  on  it,  but  we  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  they  did  put  it  in  the  contract.  That's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  that  I  was  just  reading  to  the  Chief  Justice.

Montana  I  is  broader  than  what  you're  saying  it  is, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  through  commercial  dealing,  contracts,  leases  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  arrangements.  And  my  friend,  Mr.  Goldstein, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

clever  as  he  may  be,  doesn't  have  an  argument  that  this

is  the  heartland  of  what  Montana  I  is  about.  This  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance  in  which  a  tribe  is  entering  into  a  long  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

store  is  entering  into  a  long­term  relationship.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

any  business  in  America  doing  this,  whether  they  ­­ they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  up  shop  in  France  or  in  the  city  of  San  Francisco, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knows  they're  opening  themselves  up  to  a  ­­ to  the  local 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  that  may  follow. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  If  there  were  a  forum 

   

  

 

 

 

selection  clause  in  this  contract  selecting  State  court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  that  bind  Tribe  member  ­­ members? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  do  think  it  would. 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  If  so,  on  what  theory? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KATYAL:  I  think  that  the  Tribe  itself 

    

 

 

 

 

 

has  the  ability  to,  just  as  they  can  decide  to  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American  Arbitration  Association  or  whatever,  they  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy  into  some  other  area  of  law.  I  don't  think  that  my 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend,  Mr.  Goldstein,  is  disagreeing.  He  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  it's  hard  to  do,  in  response  to  Justice  Kagan.

question  is  are  you  reasonably  anticipating  a  certain 

   

 

 

 

 

 

amount  of  jurisdiction,  and  you  are. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  of  course  there's  other  solutions. 

 

 

 

 

 

Indemnity  provisions;  if  you're  worried  about  the  due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  ­­ lack  of  due  process,  you  can  have  indemnity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangements,  as  many  leases  do,  including  Dollar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General's  current  lease.  There's  lots  of  different  ways 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  deal  with  this  concern  about,  you  know,  lack  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  concerns. 

 

            

            

But  this  Court  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Katyal,  so  why  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

these  plaintiffs  want  to  bring  the  case  in  tribal  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  they  can  get,  in  your  argument,  they  can  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dollar  General  but  they  can't  get  Townsend?  If  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued  in  State  court,  they  could  sue  both  defendants. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Mm­hmm.  So  because  going  after 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Dollar  General  effectively  does  provide  them  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  they  need,  that's  why  they  never  appealed  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

piece  ­­ piece  of  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  you  know,  and  the  other  thing  is  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  really  important  as  a  matter  of  tribal  sovereignty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  ­­ Williams  v.  Lee  says  it's  about  the  right  of

brief  gives  other  reasons  why  in  general  people  want  to

familiar  process  and  one  closer,  geographically,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  Many  times  State  courthouses  are  hours  and  hours 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away.  So  that's  ­­ that's  another  reason. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  bottom  line  here  is  this  Court  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Williams  v.  Lee  this  is  about  the  right  of  the  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  govern  themselves.  I  appreciate  the  constitutional 

    

 

 

 

 

concerns,  but  Plains  Commerce  Bank  baked  those  into  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent  rule.  It  said  yes,  there  are  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  concerns.  They  would  apply  to  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wandering  entity  or  something  like  that,  but  not  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  who  consents  either  through  their  words  or  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Just  so  you  know,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

seemed  to  me  a  reading  of  the  first  Montana  exception,

taxation,  licensing,  then  it  talks  about  consensual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationships  and  we  have  this  whole  question:  Is  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicit  or  is  it  implied? 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  it  talks  about  commercial  dealing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts,  leases,  or  other  arrangements.  That  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sound  like  torts  to  me.  And  it  seems  to  me  that  since 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  Reservation  in  mind,  you  might  you  want  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  it. 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Sure.  So  I  think  this  Court  in 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

Regal  already  said  that  torts  are  a  form  of  regulation.

I  think  there's  no  reason  to  think  of  torts  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently  because  they  ­­ they  impact  bodies'  behavior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  precedent,  stare  decisis.  You've  said  this  many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  in  the  cases  I've  mentioned. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Kneedler. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  EDWIN  S.  KNEEDLER 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

I'd  like  at  the  outset  to  respond  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  tribal  court  jurisdiction  over  tort  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  somehow  inconsistent  with  the  superior  sovereignty  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States. 

 

 

            

That  argument  was  flatly  rejected,  I  think, 

   

 

 

 

 

in  both  National  Farmers  Union  and  Iowa  Mutual  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  was  asked  to  apply  the  rule  of  Oliphant  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil  jurisdiction.  And  this  Court,  in  an  unanimous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  joined  by  Justice  Rehnquist,  who  was  the  author 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Oliphant,  said  that  those  principles  do  not  apply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil  jurisdiction.  Iowa  Mutual  and  National  Farmers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Union  enforced  the  rule  of  exhaustion  on  that  premise. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then,  importantly,  not  too  long  after  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  undertook  a  thorough  review  of  tribal  courts  in

connection  with  the  passage  in  1993,  as  we  explain  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  brief,  of  the  Tribal  Justice  Improvements  Act  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribal  Justice  Act.  It  held  hearings,  and  in  that  ­­ in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  statute,  Congress  made  two  specific  findings: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribal  justice  systems  are  an  essential  part  of  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  and  serve  important  forums  for  ensuring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  health  and  safety  and  political  integrity  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe,  and  Congress  in  Federal  courts  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Nobody  denies  that  here. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  Well,  no,  but  if  I  could  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  is  essential  for  ­­ for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputes  between  tribal  members. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  If  I  could  finish,  what 

   

  

 

 

 

Congress's  ­­ Congress's  judgment,  the  next  finding, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  and  Federal  courts  have  repeatedly  recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  justice  systems  as  the  appropriate  forums  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication  of  disputes  affecting  personal  and  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights. 

            

The  committee  reports  on  that  statute  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  they  ­­ that  those  provisions  were  enacted  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light  of  Iowa  Mutual  and  National  Farmers  Union,  and  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  one  of  the  ­­ one  of  the  committee  reports  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  second  provision  was  added  in  recognition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jurisdiction  that  tribal  courts  have  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­Indian  ­­

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  If  it  said  personal  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

property  rights  of  non­Tribal  members. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Or  against  non­Tribal 

  

 

 

 

members.  It  makes  no  reference  to  that  at  all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  No.  The  ­­ what  I'm  saying, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  enacted  in  the  wake  of  National  Farmers  Union  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Iowa  Mutual,  which  both  concerned  tort  claims  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­Indians.  And  the  legislative  history  makes  clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  was  implementing  that,  and  it  provided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funding  for  tribal  courts. 

 

 

 

            

            

Another  point  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Do  you  think  everybody  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

voted  for  that  statute  was  aware  of  that,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  There  were  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  They  were  aware  of  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  I'm  sure.  Everybody  who  voted  for  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  I  ­­ I  ­­

    

   

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ were  aware  that  it  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stemmed  from  those  cases  because  that's  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committee  report  says. 

 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  This  ­­ this  was  a  statute 

   

  

 

 

 

 

against  the  backdrop  of  two  decisions  of  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  the  rule  of  Oliphant  does  not  apply  to  civil

jurisdiction  over  non­Indians  in  tort  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically. 

            

 

And  importantly  also,  in  Iowa  Mutual  the 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  was  made  about,  specifically  in  connection  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  diversity  point,  which  Mr.  Katyal  has  responded  to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  argument  that  the  policies  of  the  deferred  city 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  such  as  concerns  about  perhaps  competence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  courts  or  bias,  that  they  should  at  least  inform 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  analysis.  And  the  Court  said  that  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  ­­ and  this  is  before  the  1993  statute  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  inconsistent  with  Congress's  judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  encouraging  tribal  courts  as  an  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expression  of  tribal  sovereignty. 

 

 

 

            

And  then  Congress  comes  along  and  provides 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funding  and  training,  statutes  that  ­­ that  provide  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

training  of  tribal  judges,  money  to  support  the  payment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  tribal  judges  and  to  support  tribes  in  publication  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  tribal  codes.  Congress  thoroughly  examined  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  again  in  the  year  2000  enacted  a  statute  with  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar  finding. 

 

            

So  what  we  have  here  is  not  congressional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

silence  but  congressional  approval  of  that,  here  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Kneedler,  I  don't

I'm  sort  of  interested  because  I  bet  it  could  be  true 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  president  of  IBM,  for  example,  does  not  himself

every  citizen  the  right  to  have  their  claims  adjudicated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  an  Article  III  Court,  how  does  Congress  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  to  let  ­­ to  place  adjudicatory  powers  over  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonmember,  non­Tribe  member  in  a  tribal  court? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  Congress  ­­ the  answer  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  not  placed  it  as  part  of  the  inherent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty  of  a  ­­ of  a  tribe  that  ­­ that  predates  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  as  ­­ and  was  not  displaced,  as  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  quite  clear  in  the  National  Farmers  Union  decision, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlike  in  criminal  cases  where,  from  the  start,  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1790  ­­ and  this  was  an  important  part  of  the  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  ­­ in  ­­ in  Oliphant. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

From  the  very  beginning,  Congress  placed 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  jurisdiction  over  crimes  by  non­Indians  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indians  in  Federal  courts  in  order  to  assure  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  the  full  protection  of  the  Due  Process  Clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  courts.  Congress  has  never  done  that  with  respect  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil  jurisdiction. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  it's  not  right  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

everybody  has  the  ­­ the  right  to  an  Article  III 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribunal. 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  No.  That  was  going  to  be  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  going  to  be  my  second  point.  State  courts  over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  of  State  law  does  not  have  the  authority  ­­ or  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  the  ability  to  go  to  Federal  court.  And  ­­ and

the  same  thing  with  respect  to  tribal  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  No,  but  out­of­Staters  do, 

  

 

 

 

 

at  least  where  there's  an  adequate  amount  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversy,  right? 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  Right.  The  Constitution  does 

  

  

 

 

 

not  require  that.  It  provides  for  it,  but  does  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  ­­ does  not  require  it.  There's  an

it.

with  your  concept  of  due  process,  as  a  general  matter, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  a  nonmember  tried  by  a  jury  consisting  solely  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  members? 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  I  ­­ I  think  there's  a  very 

    

   

   

 

 

strong  argument  that  it  is  because  the  ­­ the  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  are  the  citizens  of  the  jurisdiction  whose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  are  being  held.  Just  like  when  someone  goes  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alabama  to  Mississippi,  they  may  be  tried  before  a  jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Mississippians  who  are  not  ­­ of  which  that  plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  a  member.  But  if  there  is  a  problem  with  that, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  why  the  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act  is  there.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  a  due  process  problem,  that  is  something  that

can  be  raised. 

 

 

            

And  Justice  Kennedy,  in  response  to  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern,  Congress  has  fulfilled  its  obligation  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  jurisdiction  of  tribal  courts  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonmembers  by  the  Indian  Civil  Rights  Act  to  assure  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  protections  that  are  equivalent  to  the  Due  Process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause  are  ­­ are  afforded  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

There  may  be  ­­ may  be  some  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Do  the  same  thing  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

American  Arbitration  Association? 

 

 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  No,  it  could  not.  The  Tribes 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  inherent  sovereignty;  the  American  Arbitration 

 

 

 

 

 

Association  does  not. 

 

 

            

            

The  last  thing  I  wanted  to  point  out  is  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  ­­ but  I  do  think,  on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

your  earlier  point,  there  ­­ there  was  not  a  general 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  before,  say,  1900  at  least,  of  trying  nontribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  before  Indian  civil  tribal  courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

incorrect? 

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  The  courts  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Or  ­­ or  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KNEEDLER:  But  ­­ but  ­­ no.  There  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  with  the  five  tribes  in  Oklahoma.  The  Tribes  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  developed  judicial  systems,  but  that  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  that  they  weren't  resolving  disputes  in  some

manner,  however  it  may  be.  They  have  now  given 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expression  to  dispute  resolution  through  tribal  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

systems,  for  which  they  should  be  commended,  I  think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  ­­ not  undermined. 

 

 

 

            

And  again,  the  Court  made  that  point  in  Iowa 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mutual,  recognizing  that  tribes  did  not  have  courts  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time,  but  that  did  not  deprive  them  of  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today. 

            

And  with  respect  to  the  consensual 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship,  I  point  out  on  page  372  of  this  Court's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  in  ­­ in  Nevada  v.  Hicks  discussing  the  Montana 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  it  was  referring  to  private  individuals  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntarily  submitted  themselves  to  tribal  regulatory 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  by  ­­ by  arrangements  that  they  or  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employers  entered  into.  That  precisely  describes  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation  where  you  have  consent  hewn.  You  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  operating  on  the  Reservation  pursuant  to  tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license,  a  tribal  lease  agreement,  and  this  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

child  was  working  there  because  of  a  consensual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

agreement. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  so  I  could  say  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

person  was  subject  to  tribal  regulatory  jurisdiction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  can  be  interpreted,  narrowly,  to  mean  the  Tribe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  regulate  that  person's  conduct.  If  he  violates  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct,  the  Tribe,  as  a  tribe,  can  fine  him.  It

doesn't  necessarily  mean  that  the  regulatory 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  includes  the  ­­ the  power  to  impose  tort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  and  adjudicate  tort  law. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KNEEDLER:  May  I  answer? 

   

  

 

This  Court  has  often  said  that  tort  law  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form  of  regulation,  and  again,  that  Iowa  Mutual  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  cases  are  premised  on  the  idea  that  tribal  tort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  governs.  And  this  Court's  observation  in  Nevada  v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hicks  about  El  Paso,  that  the  Navajo  tribal  law  tort

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  THOMAS  C.  GOLDSTEIN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Thank  you.  I  have  three 

    

  

 

 

 

points,  and  they  all  happen  to  relate  to  questions  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia. 

 

            

The  first  deals  with  the  question  of  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  tort  law,  the  last  point  by  my  friend,  is  a  form 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  regulation.  And  we  have  cases  like  Regal,  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  preemption  context  in  which  the  Court  has  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  like  that.  But  the  big  difference  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  about  the  substance  of  the  tort  law,  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forum  where  it  occurs.

Imagine  a  case  like  Regal.  We  would  say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  the  application  of  State  tort  law  was  a  form  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation.  But  if  that  was  heard  in  a  Federal  district 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court,  on  removal,  on  ­­ in  diversity  jurisdiction,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  a  Federal  question,  it  would  still  be  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation. 

            

So  my  point  here  is:  The  most  that  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish  is  that  the  substantive  tort  law's  regulation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  forum.  We  do  not  agree  that  that's  so,  but  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  the  only  thing  that  they  could  get  from  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  What  would  remain  is  the  difference  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication  from  the  substance  of  the  tort  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  point,  as  Justice  Scalia,  I  will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

line  up  my  friend's  committee  reports  against  the  text 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Constitution.  We  do  not  have  an  answer  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  our  constitutional  tradition  has  three  points 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  it  that  are  inconsistent  with  this  form  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication.  And  two  of  them  are  not  specific  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

The  Constitution  is  the  supreme  law  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land  in  the  United  States.  This  Court  is  the  Supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  of  the  United  States.  That's  not  true  just  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  States,  that  is  a  bedrock  ­­ those  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bedrock  principles.  Neither  of  them  are  true  here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  also  think  that  our  tradition  is  that  you

have  access  to  a  neutral  court.  I  understand;  I  accept 

    

   

   

 

 

 

that  Congress  implemented  that  in  a  removal  statute  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  apply  here.  But  my  point  is  that  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  not  have  understood  that  it  was  a  necessary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

incident  of  sovereignty  when  the  States  were  subject  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal  jurisdiction  at  the  time  the  tribes  came  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States. 

 

 

            

It  is  historically  implausible  to  believe 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  all  three  of  these  respects,  when  the  tribes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came  into  the  United  States,  they  were  in  a  superior 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  to  the  States.  And  we  know  that  from  one  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  and  that  is  also  at  the  time  ­­ so  these  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judiciary  acts  of  1789  and  '90,  Congress  made  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments  of  State  courts  enforceable  by  full  faith  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit,  but  not  tribal  courts.  And  it  cannot  be,  then, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  thought  the  tribal  courts  were  better  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  courts. 

 

            

And  it  does  relate,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  point  that  the  Court  has  never  held,  despite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dictum,  that  a  nonmember  is  subject  to  adjudication  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribal  court.  Because  if  you  haven't  done  it  till  now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is,  I  think,  respectfully  implausible  to  believe  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  thought  it  was  true  in  1880,  at  a  time  when  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribes  had  much  less  developed  legal  systems. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

My  final  point  is  ­­ relates  to

administrability.  And  you  have  been  offered  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

alternatives.  The  other  side  says  we  have  a  test  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nexus  and  foreseeability.  I  have  a  standard  that  says, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

write  it  down  in  a  contract. 

   

 

 

 

            

 

My  rule  is  infinitely  more  administrable 

 

 

 

 

because  the  other  side  imagines  that  people  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constantly  be  running  to  State  and  Federal  court  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  nexus  wasn't  strong  enough;  I  didn't  know  when  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mailed  this  to  the  Tribe,  or  this  form  of  tribal  tort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  is  not  quite  foreseeable  enough  for  me  to  know  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rule  is. 

 

 

            

That  is  a  bad  system.  You  have  said,  time 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  again,  that  jurisdictional  rules  need  to  be  known 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ahead  of  time,  and  they  need  to  be  clear.  And  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  the  answer  to  our  point  that  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disrespectful  of  the  sovereignty  that  is  asserted  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  the  Tribal  Supreme  Court  can  constantly  be  overruled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  a  circuit  court  in  Mississippi,  are  we  seriously 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

treating  it  as  an  independent  sovereign?  That  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  let  me  ask  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

something.  What  then  remains  of  the  sovereignty  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indians?  They  can  ­­ they  can  bring  a  tort  suit  against 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you?  The  Tribes  can  bring  a  tort  suit  against  you  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dumping  on  their  ­­ on  their  land?  For  defacing  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

archeological  digs?  I  mean,  why  is  that  okay?

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Justice  Sotomayor,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

do  not  want  to  give  up  on  our  broader  argument  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana's  first  exception  doesn't  apply  here.  But  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  is  consistent  with  the  fact  that  this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  as  my  friends  have  emphasized,  of  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty.  And  when  the  sovereign  brings  an  action, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  much  easier  to  understand  that  that  is  an  exercise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  self  government  and  sovereignty  than  a  private  tort 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit  between  two  people. 

 

 

 

            

            

In  addition,  we  have  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  makes  ­­ you're  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  just  want  to  cherry  pick  what  "sovereignty"  means. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Sotomayor  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Because  if  they're 

  

 

 

 

sovereign,  the  United  States  can  have  treaties  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  that  basically  say  in  your  land,  you  do  what  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want;  I'm  not  going  to  enforce  your  judgment  if  I  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  consistent  with  due  process  here.  But  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  dictate  to  other  sovereigns  what  kind  of  systems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  should  have. 

 

 

            

You're  right  we  have  the  power  to  do  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it's  still  something  that  we  don't  have  to  exercise. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Sotomayor,  because 

  

 

 

 

my  time  has  expired,  I  will  be  brief.  The  difference  is
