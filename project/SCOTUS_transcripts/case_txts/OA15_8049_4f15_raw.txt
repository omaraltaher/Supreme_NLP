ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA A. SWARNS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

please the Court: 

 

 

10 

            

Duane Buck was condemned to death after his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

own court appointed trial attorneys knowingly introduced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an expert opinion that he was more likely to commit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal acts of violence in the future because he is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

black.  This evidence encouraged the sentencing jury to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

make its critical future dangerousness decision which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a prerequisite for a death sentence and the central 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

disputed issue at sentencing based not on the individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts and circumstances of Mr. Buck's crime or his life 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history, but instead based on a false and pernicious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

group-based stereotype. 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Didn't that expert say, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

don't think he's a future -- I don't think he's going to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a future danger? 

   

 

24 

            

MS. SWARNS:  On cross-examination 

  

 

 

25 

Dr. Quijano testified that he did believe that Mr. Buck 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

was likely to commit future crimes of violence.  He said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- at the prosecutor's questioning that Mr. Buck 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was on the low end of the continuum, but that he could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not say that Mr. Buck was not likely to commit criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acts of violence.  But Mr. Buck was, unquestionable --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But more likely than not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

that he wouldn't. 

 

 

8 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Yes.  He was on the low end of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

the spectrum in terms of the risk of violence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But here this expert's evidence not only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudiced Mr. Buck at sentencing, it also put the very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrity of the courts in jeopardy.  For that reason, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas acknowledged that its ordinary interest and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finality does not apply.  It publicly declared that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would waive its procedural defenses and allow new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing hearings in six capital cases, including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Buck's, that involved the same expert's race as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal violence opinion.  Texas conceded error in five 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases and then reversed course in Mr. Buck's case alone. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As a result, Mr. Buck is the only Texas 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner to face execution pursuant to a death sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Texas itself has acknowledged is compromised by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial bias that undermines confidence in the criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

justice system. 

 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's a tension in 

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

your -- your briefing over what you're really arguing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for.  In the question presented, you focus on the Fifth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit standard for a COA in saying they're imposing an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

improper and unduly burdensome.  But most of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing, and as you sort of begun today, is really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused on the underlying merits of the case.  And you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of have to make a choice, don't you, because if we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't focus on the merits and rule in your favor, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't get to say too much about the threshold for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Certificate of Appealability.  Well, if we focus on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Certificate of Appealability, all we're saying on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits is there's a substantial showing.  So what do you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want us to do, on the merits or on the Certificate of

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

Appealability? 

15 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Well, in order to determine 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

whether Mr. Buck was expired -- was entitled to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Certificate of Appealability, this Court and the Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit was required to determine whether or not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court decision with respect to both the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional question and the procedural question 

 

 

 

 

 

would be debatable among jurors. 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Right.  So 

  

  

  

 

 

23 

24 

25 

is that what you want us to say, that because the merits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are debatable, he should have gotten a Certificate of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appealability?  Or do you want us to say, well, he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

should have won, and so he obviously should have gotten 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Certificate of Appealability? 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

MS. SWARNS:  We believe that the district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

court's decision is wrong, and, therefore, Mr. Buck was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to a Certificate of Appealability. 

   

 

 

 

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So on the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

merits -- on the merits then, you just want us to say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oh, reasonable jurists could disagree about whether or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not he was unconstitutionally sentenced? 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Or that the -- that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

reasonable jurists would conclude that the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court's decision that Mr. Buck was not prejudiced was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorrect, and, therefore, Mr. Buck was -- was entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a Certificate of Appealability. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, for example, last year 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in a case called Welch, the question came up on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Certificate of Appealability, and we just said, well, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course he should have gotten a Certificate of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Appealability because he's right.  And similarly, we did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same thing, oddly enough, in one of the cases here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We did the same thing in Trevino.  Yes, he should have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gotten a Certificate of Appealability because he has the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits on his side.  That's essentially what you would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want us to do? 

 

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Yes. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

1 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, that does leave on 

    

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

the table -- maybe this is what the Chief Justice was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying -- this question of whether the Fifth Circuit is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just using the wrong approach and the wrong standards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the Certificate of Appealability question. 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Well, in this case the Fifth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

Circuit's analysis completely ignored the heart of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case in making its Certificate of Appealability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

determination, right? 

 

10 

            

The center of Mr. Buck's claim has always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

been the introduction of racial discrimination that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermines the confidence in, not only his own death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence, but the integrity of the court's as well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

In assessing the debatability of the 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

district court's decision, the Fifth Circuit doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engage at all around the central question here about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the critical role of race in Mr. Buck's case, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his sentence, in the integrity of the court's, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately in what Texas did in terms of acknowledging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the absence of finality in its case.  So the Fifth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's conduct in conducting the Certificate of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appealability analysis, you know, ignored critical facts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case.  So that --

  

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

case --

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The centers in this 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

MS. SWARNS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- argue that the Court

2 

            

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

had improperly denied a COA, and that was their basic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position.  They didn't really engage the merits; they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just engaged the standard of issuance of a COA.  We go 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to that.  Are you satisfied if we say they used the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong standard for denying the COA, or will you only be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied if we say you win? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  I think that the Fifth 

    

 

 

 

 

Circuit -- you know, obviously, I would like for this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court to say we win and Mr. Buck is entitled to a new --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a new, fair sentencing hearing.  That would obviously be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

my preference. 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

              

I think in the posture of this case, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court can and should say that Mr. Buck is entitled to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Certificate of Appealability because all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanations and justifications that were presented by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas and the district court are incorrect and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

unsustainable. 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Now let's 

  

  

 

 

 

start with the COA issue.  With respect to the COA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, I read your adversaries who are -- to say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez, Trevino could never constitute an exceptional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance to -- to justify the issuance of a COA. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Basically that's their position, 'cause they weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

1 

made retroactive. 

 

2 

            

3 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So first, what does the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

retroactivity argument have to do with anything?  All 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  What does it apply to?  And aren't you making 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez and -- and Trevino retroactive if we recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it as an exceptional reason to forgive a procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

default. 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

            

And then second, there's a circuit split on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this question, and you recognize it in your brief.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the Third Circuit using a three-part test that says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez and Trevino, under certain circumstances, can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a reason to find exceptional circumstance. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The Ninth Circuit has a six- or seven- or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

eight-part test.  They never make it simple.  And the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth says never. 

 

 

            

Where do you stand on all these tests?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's your position with respect to this -- to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

retroactivity question? 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Well, with respect to 

  

 

 

 

 

retroactivity, Teague governs new rules of 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional law that apply at the trial stage.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is just a rule that doesn't -- has no applicability.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

squarely arises only in the habeas context, so Teague 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just doesn't apply to Martinez and Trevino.

With respect to its applicability to 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

Mr. Buck and to -- to Mr. Buck, this is a circumstance 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where if the 60B was properly granted, Mr. Buck would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back in the same exact position as were the Petitioners 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Martinez and Trevino.  He would be arguing -- seeking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause to excuse the default of his trial counsel in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectiveness claim in the first petition for habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

corpus relief.

21 

unusual case, and what occurred at the penalty phase of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this trial is indefensible.  But what concerns me is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the implications of your argument would be for all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the other prisoners who -- let's say they're not even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capital cases, but they have -- they want now to raise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some kind of ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. 

 

 

 

 

That is procedurally defaulted.  And they say we should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have relief from a prior judgment denying habeas relief. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that -- what would prevent a ruling in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your favor in this case from opening the door to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation of all of those issues so that those --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez and Trevino would effectively be retroactive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Well, I think there are three 

   

  

 

 

 

 

23 

factors, I think, that makes Mr. Buck's case unique. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

First and foremost, it involves an express 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

appeal to racial bias that not only undermined the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11 

1 

2 

integrity of his own death sentence, it undermined the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrity of the court's. 

 

 

 

3 

            

Second, he now faces execution.  This is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

death penalty case.  He now faces execution pursuant to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that death sentence that is unquestionably -- and I will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree with you -- indefensible and uncompromised by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

racial bias. 

 

8 

            

Third, there's no question of Mr. Buck's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

diligence here.  Mr. Buck has consistently and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

unrelentingly, you know, pursued relief on his claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So I think that those factors make Mr. Buck's case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unique from the vast majority --

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the Third Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

test, isn't it? 

 

 

15 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Yes.  It is.  And that makes 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

Mr. Buck unique from the vast majority of noncapital or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other prisoners who are going to bring these cases to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal courts. 

 

 

19 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the -- the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

answer to Justice Alito is that in our opinion, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should say our interpretation of Rule 60B, in case it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't apply unless it's a capital case?  Rule 60B 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't draw that distinction. 

 

 

 

24 

            

MS. SWARNS:  No.  I think in terms of the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

question of the extraordinariness factors, I think this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

Court can and should look to those that we've identified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in our brief. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

First, is there a risk of injustice to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

Petitioner?  Here we unquestionably have that.  We're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

facing an execution. 

 

 

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The risk of 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

injustice, if it was a sentence for ten years, that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

unjust. 

9 

            

10 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Absolutely. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So that 

  

  

 

 

 

11 

doesn't work. 

 

12 

            

13 

            

14 

            

15 

            

MS. SWARNS:  So there are more. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What else? 

  

 

 

 

MS. SWARNS:  There are more. 

  

 

 

 

The risk of injustice and impairing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

integrity of the judicial system more broadly.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

States --

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess the same 

    

 

 

 

 

answer there.  Sentenced to 40 years, that impairs the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrity of the system.  I mean, I know that obviously, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

death is different. 

 

 

22 

            

23 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's hard to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

factor in why it's different in the context of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting particular rules. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

1 

            

MS. SWARNS:  You know, I would say 

   

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

additionally, though, here, Your Honor, particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

unique to Mr. Buck's case, we have the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledging that it has no significant finality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in Mr. Buck's death sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

And when you add to that the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

Mr. Buck's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is, you know, to be mildly meritorious, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have a group of factors which I think can -- this 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court should provide guidance around --

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The State did change its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

mind with respect to Mr. Buck's case, and I assume 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they'll tell us that there's a reason for that.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not just because his defense counsel introduced it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that -- that was true in some other cases as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

well. 

17 

            

But if -- if we rely on that too much, won't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

this discourage prosecutors from offering discretionary 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

concessions? 

20 

            

MS. SWARNS:  You know, this is a unique 

   

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

circumstance.  I think that -- I don't believe it would 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

discourage prosecutors, because Texas doesn't actually 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree with -- and cannot disagree with -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental problem in this case, which is that it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compromised by racial bias that undermines the integrity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

1 

of the courts. 

 

 

2 

            

Texas has certainly taken a different

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11

20

22 

23 

24 

25 

position about what it should do about it, but it cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get away from those -- those core facts that establish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, like no State has an interest in a death sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is undermined by racial bias. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  To the -- to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent it is a unique case, it really doesn't provide a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis for us to say anything at all about how the Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit approaches Certificates of Appealability, does 

 

 

 

 

 

it?  It's a unique case, so this would be an odd 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

platform to issue general rules. 

 

 

 

 

            

But in the brief you say, well, the Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit grants these in a very small percentage of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  The other circuits are much higher. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

But if it is so unique, I don't know how we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can use it to articulate general rules. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Well, it's certainly an 

  

 

 

 

 

extraordinary case.  And I think that because it is so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary, and because the lower courts failed to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, acknowledge that and -- and reach that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion, that this case sort of underscores the deep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need for guidance to the lower courts on the evaluation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and assessment and what factors should be considered in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining when 60B is or is not appropriate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Was it wrong?  Was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

it wrong for the court of appeals to conduct the merits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry in this case?  I mean, they went to considerable 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

length in trying to determine whether or not the claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

were valid. 

 

6 

            

Was that an error?  Should they have just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

said, well, you know, the -- the test is what, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial -- showing a substantial -- a substantial 

   

   

 

 

 

showing of denial?  They should have just done, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, kind of a sort of quick-and-dirty peek at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits and say, yeah, there might be something there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So did they err in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

looking at it more closely? 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Certainly this Court has made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

clear time and again the COA analysis is a threshold 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review of the merits. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So should our 

  

 

 

 

 

decision be just that, they erred in looking at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits?  They should have just issued a Certificate of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Appealability and sent it back?  That's not what you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want, is it? 

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  I -- no, no, it's not.  Again, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

I believe that this Court, because we do have the Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit and the district court going past the threshold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

analysis and speaking substantively to the merits, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court can and should explain that those reasons that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been offered by those courts are incorrect.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the COA standard, if this Court -- a COA should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue if the district court's decision was debatable or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

wrong. 

7 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

to me we're well beyond a COA should issue.  You don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want us to say that.  You want us to say that there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a constitutional violation in this case and the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of appeals was wrong in determining that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

wasn't. 

13 

            

MS. SWARNS:  I would like for this Court to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

say that there was a constitutional violation in this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

case --

 

16 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Swarns, I would have 

   

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

thought that your answer would be that, you know, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think this is so -- such an extraordinary case, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Fifth Circuit got this so wrong, that it's the best 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proof that there is that the Court is -- is approaching 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the COA inquiry in the wrong way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

23 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If they reached the wrong 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

result in this case --

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Right. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

1 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- it's because they are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

just not understanding what the COA inquiry is all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

about. 

4 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Right.  I mean, I agree, 

    

   

  

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

absolutely.  I mean, just the fact that this Court 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

found -- was unable to find these facts and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances debatable shows the -- the fact that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth Circuit is applying the standard incorrectly for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

sure. 

10 

            

And it goes also to the need for guidance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

right, to the Fifth Circuit not only on the COA point, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but again, on the 60(b) point, because there really is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial lack of information available to the lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts with respect to the evaluation of what is or is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

not extraordinary. 

 

16 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what is the test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

you -- should we say the Fifth Circuit should apply in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering whether to issue Certificates of 

 

 

 

 

 

Appealability?  Do you have anything to add to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

statutory language? 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. SWARNS:  You know, I don't think -- I --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

I don't have additional language.  I think this Court 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

has made quite clear that it's a threshold application. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

What this case demonstrates is that the Fifth Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has not been, and as this Court has noted in previous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

decisions, that the Fifth Circuit has not scrupulously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adhered to the application of the COA standard, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data that we provided to this Court sort of amplifies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and demonstrates that fact. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

So I think that what you can do is use this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

Court, again, as an example of how far the Fifth Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is out of line from the -- the proper application of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

COA standard under these circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Would it be possible to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

defend what the Fifth Circuit did based on the prejudice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prong of Strickland?  There -- there was a lot of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence both relating to the offense that was committed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and to other conduct by Petitioner that would show 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future dangerousness.  It would -- it didn't have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest exclusively on this bizarre expert testimony; isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

that correct? 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

MS. SWARNS:  There is certainly the -- Texas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly presented evidence of future dangerousness in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case.  I think that, however, the heart of those --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that evidence was sort of the facts and circumstances of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the instant crime, Mr. Buck's lack of remorse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately after he was arrested for the instant crime, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the domestic violence incidents and the prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

offenses. 

25 

            

This Court has recognized that aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

19 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

crimes like this, exactly like the kind we are talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about here, can and do trigger a racialized fear of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence that can yield arbitrary death sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions.  That was your holding in Turner v. Murray. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So the fact that we do face a case that does have very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated facts sort of compounds the risk of prejudice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Mr. Buck. 

 

 

8 

            

And what we have here is a circumstance 

   

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

where not only do the terrible facts of the crime 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trigger that real risk of an arbitrary death sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision, you have the expert stepping in and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compounding that risk and putting it -- putting an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert scientific validity to this pernicious idea that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Buck would be more likely to commit criminal acts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence because he's black.  So the risk in Mr. Buck's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is doubled, essentially. 

 

 

 

17 

            

In light of -- in light of those facts, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

light of the aggravating evidence here, and how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr. Quijano's opinion compounded the risk of violence --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, I know that 

   

  

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

there's been a lot of talk about how small the reference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to race was with respect to the questioning at trial on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both sides, but how much was it a part of the actual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

report, because that's what the jury asked for? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And they asked for two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11

20

22

25 

things:  Could they consider life without parole? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So they were obviously 

  

 

 

 

 

considering mercy.  Somebody was. 

  

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know if all of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

them, but someone wanted to talk about it, that's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they told the judge.  Can we talk about life without --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life without parole?  I don't even know what the answer 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that was.  I should have checked that --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but if you do you, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can tell me? 

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Yeah. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But, number two, they 

  

 

 

 

 

asked for the psychiatric report. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does that -- not to have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the testimony reread, but for the report. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So tell me what -- how that changes the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculus, those two things in any way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Sure.  So first the issue of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

life without parole was negotiated in the trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings.  It was absolute -- they were not given any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

information about the feasibility of parole in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, but as Your Honor correctly observes --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They were told that he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

would be eligible for parole after, what was it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

40 years? 

 

6 

            

7 

            

MS. SWARNS:  No, they were not. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They were not given that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

information? 

9 

            

MS. SWARNS:  If that were true -- no, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

were not.  They were not given information.  In fact, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trial prosecutor fought very hard to make sure that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this jury did not receive the information about parole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligibility.  It was one of the issues that she was very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about making sure was redacted from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr. Quijano's report because he, in his report, had a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference to the -- the 40 --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How old was Mr. Buck? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

How old was Mr. Buck at the time? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SWARNS:  I think he was in his 20s.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a.m. not sure at this moment. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So we do know that the jury was considering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the possibility of -- of a life sentence, and then we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have them asking for the psychiatric report, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contains a sentence that says that Mr. Buck is, in fact, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more likely to commit criminal acts of violence because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

he's black.  That evidence, of course, once you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that report, after the jury had heard it on direct and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross-examination from the witness stand, so ultimately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have a situation where the jury is literally making 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the decision about Mr. Buck's life and death -- making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the future-dangerous decision while they have this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprint in their hands. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

And we also know, this is a jury that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

not able to make a quick decision on sentence.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, notwithstanding Texas's claims that its case in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future dangerousness was overwhelming, this jury didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make a quick decision as you would have expected to see 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the case was, in fact, overwhelming.  This jury was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out for two days on the questions that it was presented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with.  And so what this shows is at -- during this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pivotal time when it was obviously struggling to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine an answer to the question of whether or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Buck was or was not likely dangerous, it had in its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hands a piece of paper that validated evidence that came 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from both sides of the aisle in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we know what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

composition of the jury was in this case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MS. SWARNS:  It's not in the records, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

Honor.  Our research that we would -- the only thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've been able to confirm on our own is that ten of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

jurors were white.  I don't know the race of the other 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two, and it's certainly not in the record. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

But ultimately I don't think it matters what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

the race of the jury is.  This is evidence of an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicit appeal to racial bias.  This is the kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that courts for over a hundred years have said, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once it is introduced, even just once, it's impossible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to unring the bell.  And the -- this is because this --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this evidence in this case spoke to the pivotal question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of whether or not Mr. Buck would be executed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

The future dangerousness question in Texas 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

was the prerequisite for a death sentence.  If this jury 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not find a future dangerousness, then Mr. Buck 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't be executed.  This evidence put the thumb 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

heavily on the -- on the death scale, and particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as it fit into the evidence in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

As I said, Texas presented three categories 

   

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

of evidence.  The crime, the lack of remorse, and the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior domestic violence, but nothing that Texas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented spoke to the question of whether or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Buck was likely to commit criminal acts of violence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if he was, in fact, sentenced to life in prison.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just didn't present any evidence on that subject. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Buck, on the other hand, presented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr. Lawrence, and Dr. Lawrence spoke -- you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

powerfully to the question of whether Mr. Buck was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely to commit criminal acts of violence if he were in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison, which was the only alternative to a death 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence that the jury was presented with. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr. Lawrence --

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  He killed people.  You --

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

you said that the evidence of his dangerousness was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited to those with whom he had a romantic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship, but he killed at least two people with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whom he didn't have a -- he killed two people with whom 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he did not have a romantic relationship; isn't that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

right? 

13 

            

14 

            

15 

            

16 

            

MS. SWARNS:  No.  He killed --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  His stepsister? 

  

 

 

MS. SWARNS:  No.  She survived. 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry.  All right. 

  

  

 

 

 

17 

Well, he shot her --

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MS. SWARNS:  Yes, exactly.  And this is all 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

clearly in the context -- absolutely, he did.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no question about the fact that he shot his -- his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sister.  And -- but all of that was in this one sequence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of events where it arises out of the breakdown of his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship with his ex-girlfriend.  And again, 

  

 

 

 

 

however, Dr. Lawrence presents evidence that the record 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that Mr. Buck has a positive institutional adjustment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

history, that when he was previously incarcerated he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held in minimum security, and that all of the crimes of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence that took place in the Texas Department of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corrections in the prior year were committed by people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who were getting involved, and there was no gang 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

involvement here. 

 

7 

            

So Dr. Lawrence's testimony highlights the 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

shortcomings or the limitations in Texas's case for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future dangerousness, right?  They say here we do have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that -- that goes beyond what Texas has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented.  And what fills the gap for Texas, the only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that Texas has that says he will be dangerous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that context is Dr. Quijano's evidence that he has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immutable characteristics which establishes that he will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be dangerous no matter where he is.  And I would like to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MR. KELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

We're here today defending the death 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

sentence because Petitioner murdered a mother in front 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of her children.  He put a gun to the chest of his 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

stepsister and shot her, and he murdered another man. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I assume the 

    

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

facts -- I assume the facts in the other Saldano cases 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are similarly heinous, the ones where the state 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined that nonetheless that there was a risk that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would be sentenced to death because of their race. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I don't understand -- I understand the procedural 

   

   

 

 

 

 

differences in this case, but I don't understand why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that ultimate conclusion doesn't apply here as well.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other words, regardless of whether the evidence was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted by the prosecution or by the defense, it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to me that the same concern would be present. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  There's a key distinction 

   

  

 

 

between when a government, a prosecuting authority, is 

   

   

 

 

 

introducing evidence of racist dangerousness.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

would be the equivalent of using race as an aggravator. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When the defense injects race, although we don't defend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel's actions in injecting race into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

proceeding --

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the prosecutor 

  

 

 

 

21 

revisited it, Mr. Keller, in cross-examination. 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. KELLER:  To put that into context, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

prosecutor did not go beyond the scope of direct.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor saw the expert report for the first time that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day and had just reviewed it over the lunch hour.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27 

is JA154A and 165A.  And the prosecutor is walking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through all of the various factors that Quijano had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered in his testimony, but it did not go beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was elicited on direct. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

And to highlight an example in contrast, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

Alba case, in which we did confess error, there, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor mentioned race four times, and at closing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, quote, "And I went down all the indicators.  They 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't want to talk about those indicators, but I did, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I forced the issue.  He's male, he's Hispanic," etc. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's at Volume 28 of the trial --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Doesn't -- doesn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

fact that Petitioner's own counsel introduced this show 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how abysmal his representation was?  I don't know why it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should make a difference that the Petitioner's counsel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

introduced this evidence.  This evidence, everyone 

  

 

 

 

 

agrees, should not have -- not have come in.  And -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what -- what counsel would put that kind of evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before a jury?  What competent counsel would put that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence before a jury. 

   

 

21 

            

MR. KELLER:  And we are not defending 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

defense counsel's actions.  But the nature of that claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance claim that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the court also reviews for prejudice.  In the context of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a prosecutor offering the testimony and using it as an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

28 

aggravator, that would be an equal protection and due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process violation.  And the nature of the evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming in, in that instance would be significantly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highly prejudicial when the State is putting its in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primata behind it and using it as an aggravator. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2

6 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why does it matter who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

uses race?  I mean, in Batson challenges we don't care 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the person exercising a racial challenge is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor or the defense attorney.  We say neither 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should use race in a negative way against a defendant. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

So why is it different here?  Why is it okay or not okay 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the prosecutor to introduce the greater likelihood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a person being dangerous on the basis of race alone? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Not okay for the prosecutor, but it's less bad for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense attorney to do it? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Yeah.  To be clear, it's not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

okay.  The issue, though, goes to the level of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice.  And when defense counsel --

  

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the level of 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

prejudice is the reasonable possibility that if one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juror, because Texas uses one juror does not agree with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

death, death is not imposed, correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

24 

            

MR. KELLER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if one -- is it a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

reasonable possibility that one juror, even the one who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

sent the note that says is it possible to do parole, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life without parole, could have been convinced to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise mercy if race wasn't used, can you answer that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question "absolutely not"?  When, in at least one of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Saldano cases, a man poured gasoline on a woman and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

watched her die, we had a nation that was mortified, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shocked, and completely traumatized by watching a pilot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

burn to death.  So why is that crime any less heinous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than this one?

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

            

MR. KELLER:  Here, Petitioner executed a 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

mother when she was on her knees in front of her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children with her daughter jumping on her --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't say it's not, 

    

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

but why is that heinousness so much greater that no jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have exercised mercy?  No juror. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  The standard -- the standard in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Strickland second-prong prejudice analysis is 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there is a substantial likelihood of a different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

outcome.  As Juan vs. Valmontez noted, the State doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to rule out --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  "Reasonable probability" 

  

 

 

is the actual language, not "substantial." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  And Harrington v. Richter said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"The likelihood of a different result must be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

substantial, not just conceivable."  It's 562 U.S. at

If I can address the jury deliberation point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

for a moment:  The Petitioner is correct the jury 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

deliberated over the course of two days, but this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only for three hours and 13 minutes.  This is at Record 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1918 to 1919.  On the first day, the jury asked for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police reports and the psychology reports.  On the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

second day, the jury asked to see the crime scene video. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This was JA210A, Record 5956 and Record 6333. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

So insofar as the Court were to look at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

circumstances of the jury's deliberations -- and I'm not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure that that is necessary for the Court to do, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inference to be drawn is in this final 95 minutes before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury returned a verdict to future dangerousness.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

was looking at the crime scene video. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not sure how the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

quickness of the determination helps you at all, when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one response would be, well, they had this evidence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he was, by virtue of his race, likely to be dangerous, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so they didn't spend that much time on it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MR. KELLER:  And the -- and the argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

here is that under these circumstances when they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused on the crime scene video, that would have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the jury --

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We're not in the jury room. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

We do know that the prosecutor asked the expert witness, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is it correct that the race factor, black, increases the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future dangerousness for various complicated reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

And he says, yes. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

So that seems -- I mean, you can't prove it, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

that that was the key factor, but it seems like it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been a substantial factor.  And Texas, in six 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

cases, says this is totally wrong.  And now in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seventh case, you're taking the opposite position.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have to admit, like what the Chief Justice seemed, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't understand the reason.  It seems to me it proves 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the arbitrariness of what's going on. 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

But regardless, the issue here is, is there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

some good reason why this person shouldn't have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to reopen his case?  I mean, that's the question. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What's the reason? 

 

 

              

I mean, after all, we later decided these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other cases, Martinez.  His circumstances seem to fit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez pretty much like a glove.  The State certainly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have a strong interest any more than in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other cases, or at least not obvious to me, some kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliance.  So he has a case where Martinez seems to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply.  He couldn't -- he was diligent -- diligent, not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much -- not too much reliance on the other side, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to meet Martinez's criteria for hearing the issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

1 

            

Why doesn't that make it extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

enough to reopen under Rule 60(b)?  That seems to me the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question in the case. 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. KELLER:  For two reasons, and both are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

controlled by Gonzalez v. Crosby.  The first is that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only changed circumstance in this case since 2006 is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez and Trevino change in the law.  And the second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is there was a lack of diligence in pursuing this claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

An ineffective assistance claim is raised on Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas in the district court.  The COA is not asked for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on that claim.  And the ineffective assistance claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

also is not even raised in the first 60(b) motion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And all this took place 

  

 

 

 

 

 

after this Court decided Martinez and Trevino? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  In the context of the second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

60(b) motion. 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, I mean, you listed a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

whole bunch of things in which he could have done.  Did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those take place or not after we decided our case?  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some of them did, which? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  The Federal habeas petition 

  

 

 

 

 

asking for a COA and the first 60 (b) motion were before 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez.  But in Gonzalez v. Crosby, the Court noted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there the Petitioner was not pursuing the claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with diligence even before the change in the law.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

1 

the court said --

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  He did exactly what you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

would have expected him to do.  Given that Coleman was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still on the books, you would have said it would be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had been improper for him to ask for the relief that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are now suggesting that he should have asked for.  At 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least it would have been futile with Coleman still on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

the books. 

 

9 

            

MR. KELLER:  Yeah.  Although the same would 

  

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

have been said under existing precedent in Gonzalez v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Crosby, there that the statue of limitations would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

run.  And so the essence --

  

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Isn't this substantially 

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

different than Gonzalez?  Wasn't it important in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Gonzalez that the nature -- what the nature of the error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was?  In Gonzalez what the court said, the error is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commonplace to -- lawyers misjudge time limits all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time.  The one thing we know about this error is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not commonplace.  Even the two people who called 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Quijano as defense witnesses never themselves raised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race as a cause -- as a reason for future dangerousness. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Only this attorney who's been disciplined repeatedly for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his malfeasance in representing clients, who one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

newspaper said if you want to ensure a death penalty, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hire this lawyer.  In that situation, isn't this that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

1 

rare case that Gonzalez talked about? 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. KELLER:  This is certainly an unusual

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11

case.  And the standard for extraordinary circumstances 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in this posture, though, is not simply would an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate judge in the first instance conclude that, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did the district court abuse its discretion in declining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to find extraordinary circumstances when Gonzalez v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Crosby is on the books. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Gonzalez v. Crosby, to my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understanding, involved a change in the AEDPA statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations; is that right? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  As soon as I say those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

words, I'm confused. 

 

 

15 

            

(Laughter.) 

16 

17

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, there are all kinds 

    

 

 

 

 

 

of statutes of limitations, and this is one of them that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court said he didn't -- he didn't pursue the change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diligently, and besides, it wasn't that big a deal, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not every interpretation of Federal statute setting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas requirements provides cause for reopening cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long since filed, and the change was not extraordinary, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it was because in part of Petitioner's lack of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diligence in pursuing it.  There's a whole list of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

reasons there.  As I read those reasons, I don't think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

one of them applies here.  So which one applies here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. KELLER:  Well, insofar as the

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

extraordinary circumstances analysis under 60(b) has 

 

 

 

 

 

been performed, I believe the Fifth Circuit was correct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that it has to be an extraordinary circumstance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justifying relief from the judgment.  And when the facts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this case obviously have existed for over 20 years, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's been nothing new about raising that claim in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second rule 60(b) motion to reopen the judgment.  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that sense, this is even further than Gonzalez v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Crosby where that was just a 60(b) motion.  This is the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second 60(b) motion. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand your 

    

 

 

 

arguments on the merits, but do they apply equally to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Certificate of Appealability?  I mean, you argue 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that you should prevail on the merits.  But the question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on a Certificate of Appealability is whether there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

been a substantial showing of denial of a constitutional 

   

   

 

 

 

 

19 

right. 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Assuming you haven't already seen the 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis on the merits and you're looking at this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question for the first time before going through this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis, wouldn't it seem pretty straightforward to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, okay, maybe he's right, maybe he's wrong, but at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least he's made a substantial showing.  Let's give him a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

36 

Certificate of Appealability, and then we'll go through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the normal procedures on the merits? 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

MR. KELLER:  It's clearly a harder standard 

   

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

for us under the Certificate of Appealability standard, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but even then you'd be asking would reasonable jurists 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate whether the district court abused its discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in declining to find extraordinary circumstances.

tougher and tougher.  I mean, you're talking about 

    

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable jurists debate.  Okay.  That's -- that's a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

very low threshold.  But when you say reasonable jurists 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate, whether there's been an abuse of discretion, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, abuse of discretion gives a broad range to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court.  And now you're asking, well, is there a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable person out there who could debate that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ought to have deferred to that exercise of discretion? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It seems to me, yes, it's a different standard, but it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite a different standard. 

   

 

19 

            

And the broader question here is whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

Fifth Circuit applies the wrong standard on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Certificate of Appealability, and it seems to me that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're going to say, particularly when you are reviewing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an abuse of discretion standard, that you're going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to look at and say, no, no, there's nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

substantial here.

difficult case to infer anything widespread from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth Circuit's practice.  Just to put some context into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the substantial practice that was allowed here, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner filed a 70-page opening brief.  The State 

   

  

 

 

 

 

filed a 37-page response brief, and Petitioner filed and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

moved to file a 35-page reply brief.  And so this was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also the third time that the Fifth Circuit had seen this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You know, I guess my 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question kind of cuts the other way.  I'm saying they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't -- yes, and you make the point, there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial amount of process.  There was a long 

   

  

 

 

 

 

consideration.  There was a lot of briefing.  I would 

    

   

  

 

 

 

have thought the purpose of a Certificate of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Appealability would be to make the decision to move 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward without all that elaborate process? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Well, and the Fifth Circuit on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasion hears oral argument in considering whether to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant a COA in the capital posture insofar as the court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would provide or believe that that is not the type of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process that should be afforded at the COA stage, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance with AEDPA --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oral argument -- oral 

  

 

 

 

 

argument on whether to grant the COA? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 

            

MR. KELLER:  Yes.  The Fifth Circuit on 

  

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

occasion -- this is page 50 and 51 of our Respondent's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief -- will hear oral argument --

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Keller, you know, some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

of the statistics that Petitioner have pointed us to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in capital cases, a COA is denied in 60 percent of Fifth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit cases as compared to 6 percent of Eleventh 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit cases, two roughly similar circuits where COA's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are denied in capital cases ten times more in the Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit.  I mean, it does suggest one of these two 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits is doing something wrong. 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. KELLER:  And the court has said that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

COA should serve a gatekeeping function.  The court also 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

noted that death is different.  And at the same time, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Fifth Circuit is provided substantial process.  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

insofar, though, as this Court were to -- if it were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to conclude in this case that a COA should have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued, it -- any such decision, I think, would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited to the unique facts of this case.  And I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think there's anything that could be drawn by the Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's wider practice in denying or granting COAs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly in the capital posture when substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process is being afforded.  This is not a situation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

where the Fifth Circuit is simply ignoring these cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and ignoring these claims.  Quite the opposite. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is your 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

suggestion that they deny more because they've taken up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more search and look at the merits than the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

circuits?

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

            

MR. KELLER:  I think it -- insofar as the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

statistics could be shown that there is, in fact, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different denial and grant rate, I think the level of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process that the Fifth Circuit is receiving and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the quantum of argument may be going to those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statistics, because the Fifth Circuit is not simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignoring these claims.  And even here --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this is the whole point, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really.  They are not supposed to be doing what you do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you decide an appeal.  And they -- and they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually don't have jurisdiction to decide the appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, they are supposed to be performing a gatekeeping 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

function, not deciding the merits of the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  And I don't think what the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Fifth Circuit did here is decide the merits.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correctly articulated the COA standard, and it examined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 11 facts that Petitioner alleged as a basis for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling on the 60(b) motion.  Now, five of those were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially the underlying and effective assistance 

 

 

 

 

 

claim, and if the Fifth Circuit had --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It doesn't say anything 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

to the Fifth Circuit that three State court judges, two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their colleagues on the Fifth Circuit, two justices 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this Court, have said or found Mr. Buck's case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debatable, because that's the standard.  It's debatable. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They don't pause and say, you know, people have some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis for an argument here?  This is not frivolous. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is a serious question. 

   

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

MR. KELLER:  And the Fifth Circuit took 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

these arguments seriously.  And this is our response --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not the issue. 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

They are supposed to decide whether to grant COA or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on whether the questions are serious or not, debatable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not decide the merits.  I know it can appear a fine line 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in some situations, but how do you justify saying that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is not debatable? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Here the issue would be could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable jurists debate whether the district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abused its discretion in finding extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

circumstances? 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

            

And so while the reasonable jurist standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is lower, that's balanced, though, against the more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferential abuse of discretion standard and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heightened extraordinary circumstances standard that 

 

 

 

 

this Court has noted will rarely be met in the habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

context. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

1 

            

In our brief we present a few examples of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

courts finding extraordinary circumstances.  That would 

  

 

 

 

 

be when counsel wholly abandons a Petitioner, or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison guard actively thwarts a Petitioner filing a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

5 

habeas petition. 

 

6 

            

Now, we don't mean to suggest those are the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

only instances in which that can give rise to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There -- there were 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

extraordinary circumstances in the other cases?  In the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other five cases? 

 

 

11 

            

MR. KELLER:  In the other five cases in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

which the State confessed error? 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 

  

 

MR. KELLER:  Well, there we admit that since 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

the prosecution was the one that was eliciting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race-based testimony, that that would go to a -- a due 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

process and equal protection violation, and that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be an extraordinary circumstance --

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if you said that that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

because those -- that's -- it's more prejudicial when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prosecution introduces this?  Is that what you said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

--

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. KELLER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- to Justice Ginsburg? 

  

 

 

 

 

That -- that's your basic theory? 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

MR. KELLER:  The State was using it as an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  But -- and -- and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

aggravator. 

3 

            

4 

that makes it more prejudicial.  That's your basic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

theory? 

6 

            

7 

            

MR. KELLER:  Both points.  The State --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because I don't -- I guess 

   

   

  

 

 

8 

9 

10 

if there's both points, tell me what the other point is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because I guess I just don't understand that point.  But 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

it seems more prejudicial when the defense attorney uses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

it. 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

              

I mean, prosecution, you have a jury sitting 

   

 

 

 

 

there, and it realizes that the prosecutor has an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in convicting a person and in getting a -- a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence that the prosecution wants, so everything is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discounted a little bit.  But when your own -- when the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's own lawyer introduces this, the jury is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to say, well, it must be true.  Even the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's lawyer thinks that this is true.  So, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, who a.m. I to -- to argue with that?  It seems 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wildly more prejudicial to me when the defense attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

introduces it. 

 

23 

            

MR. KELLER:  Except it's not the case here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

that Quijano was only testifying about race.  Quijano 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said that it would be unlikely the Petitioner would be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

future danger.  And so Quijano's ultimate conclusion, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple other aspects of his testimony, was favorable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Petitioner, as Petitioner conceded.  And so in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance, the prejudice would not be nearly as great 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as when the State is injecting race into a proceeding. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I didn't think that your 

    

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

primary argument had to do with the -- the relative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice of having it done by the prosecutor and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense attorney.  I thought your argument was that the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

State of Texas feels a certain -- feels a special 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

responsibility when one of its employees engages in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct.  And when the -- when the evidence is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduced by the defendant's attorney, it's an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance-of-counsel question, and it has 

 

 

 

 

 

to be adjudicated under the Strickland test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. KELLER:  That's absolutely correct.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

then when you look at the aggravating evidence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executing a mother in front of her children and laughing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it, and saying that the mother, quote, "got what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she deserved," unquote, and when we put in evidence from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ex-girlfriend -- this is a JA127A -- of repeatedly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

beating her and threatening her with a gun, all of those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to whether there would in fact be prejudice under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth Amendment, ineffective --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  And the legal question 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

here, right, is whether this ineffective assistance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel claim, which has never been heard by any court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a strong one.  And a strong one including that the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance here is likely to be prejudicial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which it seems as though it's -- it's far more likely to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be prejudicial when the defense counsel does it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

MR. KELLER:  Justice Kagan, when the State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

is the one injecting race into a proceeding, that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

using it as an aggravator.  And if the Court will --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  People expect the State to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

use whatever aggravators it has at hand.  Now, people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't expect the State to do something as improper as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, but the people who understand that not everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the prosecution says about a defendant, you know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that people -- the jurors should -- should think about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those claims seriously because the prosecution has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests of its own.  But the defense counsel's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests are supposed to be with the defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

I'm just repeating myself.  If the defense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

counsel does it, I mean, you know, who is the jury to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

complain? 

22 

            

MR. KELLER:  Well, this Court, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

believe, has ever recognized a situation in which a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense counsel's act could give rise to structural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error or per se prejudice.  And any such rule, I

believe, would invite gamesmanship.  Of course the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice analysis can still be done, but to say whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would be per se prejudicial, I think it would have to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be balanced against the aggravating evidence.  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the context of Quijano testifying helpfully to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner, that there would be an unlikely event of it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being a future danger. 

   

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is the 

  

 

 

 

 

relationship between the ruling on prejudice with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to ineffective assistance and the 60(b) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis?  I mean, do you agree that if we disagree with 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your submission on prejudice under Strickland, that your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60(b) analysis kind of falls apart? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  I --

    

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Clearly the 

  

 

 

 

underlying claim on the merits would be stronger, and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it would be a lot more extraordinary under 60(b). 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  It is a factor that could be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

considered in doing the extraordinary circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis, because if there were extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances that were going to justify, really, from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judgment, that would be a factor in the totality of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the circumstances the Court would be -- it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider in doing that analysis. 

 

 

 

 

            

If you have no further questions, we'd ask

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA A. SWARNS 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MS. SWARNS:  This Court has long recognized 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

that the integrity of the courts requires unceasing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

events to eradicate racial prejudice from our criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justice system.  That commitment is as urgent today as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at any time in our nation's history. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

Duane Buck's case requires meaningful 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

Federal review of his claim that his trial counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowingly introduced an expert opinion that he was more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely to commit criminal acts of violence in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future, a Certificate of Appealability should certainly 

   

 

 

 

 

16 

issue. 

17 

            

With respect to -- to Texas's arguments, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

want to begin by making clear that, first of all, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court in Georgia v. McCollum did make clear, as I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor noted, that the equal protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns that are implicated by the introduction of race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the criminal justice system absolutely are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

triggered by defense counsel's conduct.  And certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that was a situation where defense counsel exercised 

   

 

 

 

 

 

preemptory challenges based on race. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

1 

            

And in that circumstance, that was actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

an exercise of peremptory challenges intended to benefit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the client, right?  They were trying to strategically 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

gain advantage by using a race-based peremptory 

   

 

 

 

 

5 

challenges. 

6 

            

Here, we have trial counsel making an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

inexplicable decision to introduce -- a knowing, 

   

 

 

 

 

inexplicable decision to introduce race.  This is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certainly worse and more aggravating for Mr. Buck. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I would also like to just be clear that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution's reliance on Dr. Quijano's testimony here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was real.  This wasn't a circumstance where the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

prosecutor was required to follow up on Dr. Quijano's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion and -- and reiterate it on cross-examination, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then go further and argue in closing that the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should rely on Dr. Quijano to find Mr. Buck likely to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commit criminal acts of violence, and further argue that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury should disregard the aspects of Dr. Quijano's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion that conflicted with a finding of future 

   

 

 

 

 

 

20 

dangerousness. 

21 

            

When Texas did its -- its review of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

death row after it conceded error in Saldano, it looked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through all of the cases on death row to see what else 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was contaminated by Dr. Quijano's racist criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence opinion.  And one of the other cases it looked

at and ruled out was the Anthony Graves case, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrates the options available to this prosecutor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under these circumstances. 

 

 

            

In the Anthony Graves case, Dr. Quijano was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called as a defense witness, just like he was here.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Anthony Graves case, the defense elicited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr. Quijano's race as criminal violence opinion on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct examination, just as here.  But the difference is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Graves case, the prosecutor did not reiterate it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on direct examination, and -- and then in closing argued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the jury should disregard Dr. Quijano's opinion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The prosecutor here absolutely capitalized 

 

 

 

 

on trial counsel's error.  There is just no question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about that.  They made a choice that, you know, they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have gone the Graves route, but this prosecutor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chose to go through the door that was opened by trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel and rely on Dr. Quijano's race as criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

violence opinion. 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Counsel for Texas also notes that the last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

note that the jury sent out was a request to review the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime scene video, which is absolutely true, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means that the last two notes that this jury looked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at -- the two -- two things that they asked for, right, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the expert's report.  So we now have the race, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then we have the crime.

Court addressed in Turner.  Right?  You have the facts 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the crime that trigger this racialized fear of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence and raised the real risk of an arbitrary death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing decision, and then you have the report which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compounds that risk because it gives a defense expert 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

scientific imprimatur to that pernicious group-based 

 

 

 

 

 

stereotype.  So that is further evidence of prejudice to

Mr. Buck litigated his first 60(b) motion, Coleman, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as -- as Texas has acknowledged, stood as an unqualified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bar.  There was no opportunity, before Martinez was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

announced, for him to argue. 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank you.
