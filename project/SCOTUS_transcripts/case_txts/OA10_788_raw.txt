 Mr. Pincus. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS 

1
2
3
4  first this morning in Case 10-788, Rehberg v. Paulk.
5
6
7
8
9  and may it please the Court:
 This Court has twice held, in Malley and in 
10
11  Kalina, that a complaining witness who sets a criminal 
12  prosecution in motion by submitting a false affidavit is 
13  entitled to qualified immunity, but not absolute 
14  immunity, in an action under section 1983.  The Court 
15
16  complaining witnesses were subject to damages liability 
17  at common law when -- in 1871 when section 1983 was 
18  enacted. 
19
rule of Malley and Kalina also applies to a complaining 
20
21  witness who sets a prosecution in motion by testifying 
22  before a grand jury.  Again, the common law provides the 
23  answer.  The law is clear that in 1871 damages liability 
24  could be based on false grand jury testimony.
25

rested that conclusion on its determination that 

 The question in this case is whether the 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The problem I have with your 

3
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  argument is that I don't really know what a complaining 
2  witness is in the grand jury context.  Let's take the 
3  Federal grand jury as an example.  Do you think there 
4  are complaining witnesses before Federal grand juries?
 MR. PINCUS:  I think there -- there can be. 
5
6  It depends obviously on the -- the circumstances, Your 
7  Honor, but -- but there certainly can be. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  A complaining witness, I 
8
9  would think, is a person who files a complaint, who 
causes -- so, under the Federal system, it would be 
10
11 
someone who files a complaint and attests to it under 
Rule 5.  That person is asking that charges be brought. 
12 
13 
That's what it means to be a complaining witness, filing 
a complaint.
14 
 Nobody -- no witness before a Federal grand 
15
16  jury asks that an indictment be returned.  They provide 
17  testimony, and they may want an indictment to be 
18  returned, but it's the prosecutor who asks for the 
19  indictment to be returned.  So, I don't see how there is 
20
21  grand jury context. 
 MR. PINCUS:  Well, Your Honor, the common 
22
23  law confronted precisely the same situation, and after 
24  public prosecutors came into being and when grand juries 
25

a complaining witness in that sense in the traditional 

were empaneled by them, the common law has concluded 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A person?  What --

1  that, both in 1871 and in the present, that there can be 
2  a person who is the motivating force behind the 
3  prosecution, who --
4
what if you have three elements to a crime, and you have 
5
6  one witness for each one.  You see somebody sees the guy 
7  trying to get into a car.  Well, maybe he left it --
8  maybe he locked his keys in.  Another sees the guy 
9  walking around with a television.  It might be his.  A 
third sees the guy selling the television to somebody 
10
11  else.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Each one 
12  testifies before the grand jury.  Who is the complaining 
13  witness? 
14
law, the complaining witness was more than just someone 
15
16  who gave evidence that was necessary for the warrant or 
17  the indictment to issue.  It was someone who was pushing 
18  for the prosecution to be brought.  All of these 
19  problems, of course, occurred at common law, and they 
20
21  Court addressed in Malley and Kalina. 
22
23  another example that I think happens with some 
24  frequency.  You have a Federal grand jury, and you have 
testimony by an FBI or a DEA case agent, the person who 
25

also occur in connection with the circumstances that the 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, Your Honor, at common 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me give you 

5

and, in exchange for that, is providing a lot of 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, again, Your Honor, there 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Which one is it? 
 MR. PINCUS:  It could be both. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Both? 
 MR. PINCUS:  It could be one or -- it could 

1  has been working on the case, and that witness provides 
2  a lot of information supporting the charges that the 
3  prosecutor wants returned.  You also have a cooperating 
4  witness, someone who has entered into a plea bargain 
5
6  incriminating testimony.  Now, is there a complaining 
7  witness in that situation? 
8
9  can be.  It -- it depends --
10
11
12
13
14  be -- it could be one or the other.  I think these --
15
16  common law in the States.  They --
17
18  think you used the words "the one who motivated the 
19  charge" or something to that effect.  And I'm looking at 
20
21  says -- and this is on page 28 of the joint appendix. 
22  It says Mr. Hodges -- that's the prosecutor -- knew or 
23  should have known there was no probable cause.  "He," 
24  Mr. Hodges, "directed Mr. Paulk to appear before the 
grand jury and attest to the truth of such charges." 
25

the complaint that was filed in this case, and it 

these circumstances, again, are not unknown to the 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Pincus, you said -- I 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 So, if anyone was the instigator, it was the 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if he did it -- if he 

did at the prosecutor's bidding, then he is not the 

1
2  prosecutor, not his aide.  But the prosecutor gets 
3  absolute immunity. 
4
 MR. PINCUS:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't 
think we know, because the complaint also alleges that 
5
6  Mr. Paulk knew that his testimony was false and -- and 
7  made it -- and gave his testimony anyway.  And 
8  certainly, his --
9
10
11  prime mover. 
12
 MR. PINCUS:  Well, the -- the complaint also 
13  alleges that they were conspiring together to bring this 
14  complaint.  And so, again, I think the facts will be 
developed.  But the -- the first indictment in fact 
15
16  listed Mr. Paulk as the complainant.  So, in many 
17  situations, the concerns that Justice Alito was pointing 
18  to won't be present because there will be a clear 
19  complainant, as there was in this case.
20
21
22  witness is reluctant to testify but is issued a subpoena 
23  by the United States attorney to appear before the grand 
24  jury, and then with reluctance he comes forward but, 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But do you --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose an important 

under oath, provides all of the key testimony necessary 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what's the test 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, the -- the test that this 

-- that's the phrase that this Court has used, and 
that's a phrase that's -- that is reflected in the 
common law, based on the common law.  And the lower 
courts have not had a problem applying that case.  There 
are seven circuits that now have adopted the rule 
that --

1  to indict?  Is he a complaining witness? 
2
3  said no, Your Honor.  Some lower courts have said all 
4  that --
5
6  we're supposed to use to decide? 
7
8  Court has set forth is whether the complaining witness 
9  is someone who sets the prosecution in motion.  That's 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  gave, what's the answer? 
18
19  you gave, Your Honor, that that person is not a 
complaining witness, because he did nothing other than 
20
21  come forward when he was subpoenaed.  If someone comes 
22  forward to the prosecutor, urges an indictment, urges a 
23  prosecution, and then subsequently is subpoenaed, that 
24  might be a different case because you have --
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the hypothetical I 

 MR. PINCUS:  I would say in the hypothetical 

Official 

 MR. PINCUS:  I think some lower courts have 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Urges -- urges a 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

complaining witness also has to be --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, he says -- he or 

1  prosecution.  One area that causes me concern here are 
2  the domestic violence cases, where someone may well 
3  report an episode but, by the time it gets to whatever 
4  the indictment procedure is, a grand jury or otherwise, 
is unwilling to -- to testify and pursue it.  And yet, 
5
6  that person may be the one who started the prosecution 
7  in motion.  Is that individual a complaining witness? 
 MR. PINCUS:  That -- that person may be a 
8
9  complaining witness.  You know, at common law, the 
10
11
12  she says at the time, I -- I don't want prosecution to 
13  go forward.  I -- you know, I would prefer that it not 
14  go forward.
 MR. PINCUS:  Then that fact would obviously 
15
16  mitigate against her being a complaining witness.  But 
17  -- but these --
18
19
20
21 
22
23  complaining witness, Your Honor. 
24
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
 MR. PINCUS:  But I -- just to step back --
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mitigating?  Come on. 
 MR. PINCUS:  Yes.  She would not be --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does it make her not a

complaining witness?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The holding that you're 

 MR. PINCUS:  I don't think the mere issuance 

 MR. PINCUS:  I don't think --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  In that situation, then why 

1
2  asking for isn't going to do very much good if the -- if 
3  the mere issuance of the grand jury subpoena renders the 
4  person not a complaining witness.
5
6
7  not subpoena everybody? 
8
9  of the subpoena does negate things that might -- take 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
 But I think in the hypothetical that you 
18
19  propounded, where there's -- the sole fact is someone 
doesn't do anything, they're subpoenaed to come before 
20
21  the grand jury and they give their evidence, that 
22  wouldn't meet the test.  But --
23
24  prosecutor is the prime mover, can there ever be a 
25

the hypothetical where there is someone who goes to the 
prosecutor, says there should be a prosecution here, 
maybe does the things that the hospital is alleged to 
have done in this case, and then subsequently is 
subpoenaed.  I don't think the subpoena negates that 
prior activity.  I don't think you can say, oh, now that 
you're subpoenaed, we wipe away everything that you have 
done to set the prosecution in motion. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  In a case where the 

complaining witness?  Where the prosecutor is making the 

10

Official 

ultimately decides to seek the charge does not negate
 

inspectors, who in that case were alleged to have been 
the motivating force behind the retaliatory prosecution, 
could be held liable if there also was no probable 
cause. 

1  decisions, can there ever be a complaining witness? 
2
 MR. PINCUS:  I think there can be, Your 
3  Honor.  And, in fact, what this Court has indicated in 
4  other cases is that the fact that the prosecutor 
5
6  what's happened before.
 
7
 In the Hartman case, which dealt with a
 
8  retaliatory prosecution under -- a First Amendment
 
9  retaliation prosecution, the Court said the postal
 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16
17  complaining witness because the complaining witness is 
18  the person who provides the impetus to go forward. 
19
20
21
22
23  person who instigates the instigator? 
24
25

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  What about the 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is the prosecutor a 

complaining witness? 

 MR. PINCUS:  The prosecutor can't be a 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who instigates the 

prosecutor. 

 MR. PINCUS:  I'm not -- I'm not sure of 

the --

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, somebody who comes up 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The person who 

 MR. PINCUS:  At common law --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- try to start a 

 MR. PINCUS:  And at common law that person 
could be -- could be liable for malicious prosecution 

1
2  to somebody and says:  You know, you ought to -- you 
3  ought to --
4
5
6  prosecution against this person.  They say:  Yeah, 
7  that's a good idea.  So, that person goes and -- and 
8  gets a prosecution started. 
9
10
11  because --
12
13  instigates the instigator? 
14
 MR. PINCUS:  The person who in testimony --
a complaining witness, as Your Honor pointed out in --
15
16  in your opinion in Kalina, a complaining witness does 
17  not have to actually participate in the judicial 
18  proceedings.  To be a complaining witness at common law, 
19  you could be a person who outside the judicial process 
20
21
22  instigator is -- is a complaining witness or can be? 
23
24
25

 MR. PINCUS:  Can be. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you know what the next 

pushed forward and was the mover behind the --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, the instigator of the 

question's going to be, right? 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. PINCUS:  But tort law -- I mean --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The instigator of the 

dealt and continues to deal with the questions of 
causation and proximate cause and all of the questions 
that arise in these kinds of cases.  So, it's not as if 
the Court here would be writing on a blank slate. 

1
2
3  instigator of the instigator.  I mean, does this go back 
4  forever?
 MR. PINCUS:  I think that's right, Your 
5
6  Honor.  But I don't think the Court is writing on a 
7  blank slate here.  Tort law has addressed these issues. 
8  There has been a malicious prosecution tort for hundreds 
9  of years.  There certainly was in 1871, and tort law has 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
 And I think the critical thing is -- the 
question here is whether or not there was an absolute 
15
16  immunity rule in 1871 for persons in the situation of 
17  the Respondent.  That is the critical question that the 
18  Court has framed. 
19
20
21  been immune if he gave the identical testimony at the 
22  trial itself, right? 
23
24  because -- well, the trial testimony could not be the 
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He -- the instigator, 

what you call the complaining witness, would have 

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes, trial -- because --

basis for finding the person a complaining witness 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's what 

1  because by that point, the prosecution has gotten 
2  rolling.  The question is, what conduct can be used to 
3  prove that this is the person who was the instigator, 
4  the prime mover behind the prosecution?
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's only -- it's only 
5
6  what you call the complaining witness that gets this 
7  special treatment?  All the other witnesses before the 
8  grand jury would be absolutely immune? 
9
the common law rule was, and that's what Congress 
10
11  confronted when it enacted section 1983 in 1871. 
12
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I make sure I 
13  understand what you just said, Mr. Pincus?  When you 
14  said it can't be the testimony alone, is that right, 
15
16  testimony that make somebody a complaining witness? 
17
18  testimony alone.  I didn't mean to say that.  I think 
19  what I meant to say, maybe in response to 
Justice Alito's question, was the fact of testifying 
20
21  under subpoena doesn't negate other evidence that's 
22  there.  But the testimony alone can be enough, and there 
23  certainly are cases, common law cases, from the 1800s in 
24  which courts rely on testimony.
25

that there have to be other acts exclusive of the 

 MR. PINCUS:  No, Your Honor, it could be the 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Rely on testimony, but rely

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, the cases are -- the 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I really don't understand 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand. 
 MR. PINCUS:  But I think, as a matter of 

this.  You have one witness in the grand jury 
proceedings.  That's the only witness.  Can that witness 
fall within your rule and be the complaining witness? 

1  on testimony exclusively; do you have any cases that do 
2  that? 
3
4  cases are a little bit obscure, Your Honor, about what 
the facts are that they are relying on.  So, I don't 
5
6  want to say that absolutely positively there's one --
7
8
9  logic --
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  testimony alone? 
17
18  there could be other evidence as well.  I think --
19
20
21
22
23  haven't -- you don't care whether it comes out that way 
24  or not.  You're subpoenaed, and even though you're 
25

 MR. PINCUS:  Absolutely, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just on the basis of the 

subpoenaed, you're going to hold me as a complaining 

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes.  But there could be --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, it's pretty risky to 

testify in a grand jury proceeding, then, right? 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, the same --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because even though you

witnesses. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the affiants came 

not self-starting.  And you're saying that that person's 
mere presence and the mere fact of that person's 
testifying is enough to hold him to be the complaining 
witness. 

1  witness.
 
2
 MR. PINCUS:  It's the same risk that the
 
3  affiants bore in Kalina and Malley, and it's the same
 
4  risk that the common law imposes on complaining
 
5
6
7  forward.  I mean, that -- that's a different situation, 
8  isn't it?  They, indeed, were self-starting.  But the 
9  person who is subpoenaed to testify at a grand jury is 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  there's someone -- all they've done is they've been 
17  subpoenaed and they've come forward and they've given 
18  their evidence. 
19
20
21  for that person to be labeled a complaining witness. 
22
23
24  person --
25

 MR. PINCUS:  Your Honor, maybe I've confused 
the hypotheticals.  I think we have one situation where 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.
 MR. PINCUS:  I think it would be very hard 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Hard or impossible? 
 MR. PINCUS:  Impossible.  Then you have a 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Hard or impossible? 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. PINCUS:  Compelled testimony alone.  A 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But you said that the 

Official 

 MR. PINCUS:  I think it would be impossible, 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  That's a different 

word.  Thank you.  So, the testimony alone cannot be the 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
 MR. PINCUS:  -- voluntarily before the grand

2  because I don't think there's any evidence that that 
3  person is the motivating force. 
4
5
6  basis? 
7
8  person who testifies --
9
10
11  jury I think is a different situation. 
12
13  issuance of a subpoena in itself is not sufficient to 
14  make somebody not a complaining witness.  So, if you are 
15
16  witness if you really didn't need to get a subpoena.  If 
17  you could have been persuaded to go without a subpoena, 
18  then maybe you're -- you could be a complaining witness. 
 MR. PINCUS:  No, Your Honor.  I think I was 
19
responding to a third -- a third situation.  So, we have 
20
21  one situation where all someone does is testify under 
22  subpoena.  We have another situation where someone 
23  testifies, that person not a complaining witness, 
24  someone who testifies voluntarily; that voluntary 
testimony certainly could be used as evidence that 
25

issued a subpoena, you still might be a complaining 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. PINCUS:  And then the third situation --

excuse me, Your Honor.  I was just -- the third 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, somebody gets 

1  person --
2
3  mugged --
4
5
6  situation is where there's pre-testimony evidence, and 
7  there's also the fact that that person testified under 
8  subpoena.  I don't think the fact that that person 
9  testified under subpoena negates the fact that there is 
other evidence that that person may have been the person 
10
11  who pushed the prosecution forward.  So, that's the 
12  distinction that I was trying to draw. 
13
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But what is the reason why, 
14  if we give absolute immunity to the witness at a trial, 
15
16  government officials at the trial, and a grand jury is 
17  sort of like a trial, at least it's testimony under 
18  oath.  And in addition there's this special thing about 
19  grand juries being secret, which, if you allow people 
who are annoyed -- and they'd be quite rightly angry. 
20
21  They've been acquitted.  They had to go through this 
22  process.  They want to sue somebody.  If we let them 
23  sue, you'll wreck the secrecy in a lot of cases.  So, I 
24  see a reason for treating the grand jury even more 
strictly.  What's the reason for treating it less 
25

read what the situation is today, and it is, I think, as 
I described it.  So, given the situation today, my 
question remains. 

1  strictly? 
2
3  reasons, Your Honor.  The first reason is that what this 
4  Court has said is that immunity decisions are based on 
5
6
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose I don't accept 
7  that.  Suppose I say, yes, I accept that, there's a 
8  relationship, but exactly what happened in 1871 is not 
9  precisely always the convincing feature for me.  So, I 
10
11 
12 
13
14  disagreement with your question, Your Honor.  I think 
15
16
17  question. 
18
19
20
21 
 MR. PINCUS:  The answer is several-fold. 
22
23  The Court has given absolute immunity to witnesses in 
24  Briscoe.  The policy reason -- the principal reason was 
the common law rule.  The policy reasons that the Court 
25

 MR. PINCUS:  But --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I would like an answer to 

the situation today at common law is what it was. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You can't disagree with my 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, one -- one brief 

my question. 

19
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Court in Malley said we want people who are setting the 
prosecution in motion, the special category of 
complaining witnesses -- we want them to think twice. 
That's not a bad thing when they are the motivating 
force behind the prosecution.

1  gave were (a) we don't want to deter people from coming 
2  forward; and (b) the testimony will be put through the 
3  adversary process and is public, and those are 
4  protections against false testimony.
 In the -- in the grand jury situation, those 
5
6  protections are not present, neither transparency nor an 
7  adversary process.  And what the Court said in Malley 
8  about people coming forward I think applies in the grand 
9  jury context as well to complaining witnesses.  The 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  whole point of the grand jury was to protect citizens 
17  from unwarranted prosecutions.  The grand jury initiates 
18  the prosecution.  So, why do we look back beyond that? 
19  That's where the prosecution is initiated.  You're not 
subject to prosecution until the grand jury returns the 
20
21  indictment.  So, why do we talk about complaining 
22  witnesses initiating the prosecution? 
23
24  them, I think, because of the reality that there are 
cases, and the common law recognized that there were 
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought the

not --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, somebody's is 

 MR. PINCUS:  It's true that the grand jury 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, go ahead. 
 MR. PINCUS:  The grand jury's decision is a 
step in the chain, but the Court has not said that, for 

1  cases where the reason the prosecution got rolling was 
2  because either a private person or a government person 
3  was the person who was pushing it along. 
4
5
6
7  -- I'm sorry. 
8

10
11  example, the judge's decision in Kalina and Malley to 
12  issue the warrant broke the causal link between the 
13  false testimony in the affidavits in those case.  Even 
14  though the judge was making an independent decision, the 
15
16  there could be a causal chain back to the false 
17  testimony which essentially tainted the decisionmaker, 
18  the judge's decision, just as it taints the grand jury's 
19  decision.
20
21  that it is only when there is an allegation of false 
22  testimony or other impropriety in the grand jury that 
23  looking back is possible.  But, of course, that's the 
24  very situation in this case.
25

Court recognized, as the common law recognized, that 

 And, in fact, what lower courts have said is 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The question is, where do 

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  you locate the grand jury?  We have on the one side, you 
2  recited Malley.  That was an arrest warrant, testimony 
3  in support of an arrest warrant.  Then we have the 
4  trial, where everybody gets absolute immunity.  And 
grand jury is in between those two.  So, why should we 
5
6  bracket it with the arrest warrant rather than with the 
7  trial?  The -- the arrest warrant is certainly 
8  pre-prosecution. 
 MR. PINCUS:  Well, the first reason, Your 
9
Honor, is because that's what the common law did.  And 
10
11  what the Court's -- the Court's inquiry here is to look 
12  at the common law and decide what Congress, when it 
13  enacted the statute in 1871, confronted.  And when 
14  Congress enacted the statute in 1871, there were -- the 
rule was that complaining witnesses who testified before 
15
16  grand -- that grand jury testimony of people who were 
17  complaining witnesses was not immunized as a basis for 
18  malicious prosecution liability. 
 What the Respondent is seeking here is to 
19
say my grand jury testimony is immunized as a basis of 
20
21  section 1983 liability.  But at common law, that simply 
22  wasn't the rule.  So, the first --
23
24  grand jury witnesses have absolute immunity from a claim 
25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And at common law, did any 

for malicious prosecution? 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, could there be --
 MR. PINCUS:  The only liability was for 

who was not a, quote/unquote, "complaining witness"? 
 MR. PINCUS:  No, and that's the source of 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, the common law -- at
 
1
2  common law -- at common law, it wasn't a question of
 
3  immunity.  There was no defamation liability for any
 
4  witness.

5
6
7  malicious prosecution. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  And could there be malicious 
8
9  prosecution liability for a witness before a grand jury 
10
11
12  the distinction that the Court drew in Malley and 
13  Kalina. 
14
 JUSTICE ALITO:  So, you're not really asking 
us to adopt the common law rule, are you?  You're asking 
15
16  for a variation of the common law rule that's limited to 
17  complaining witnesses.  Or are you going further?  Are 
18  you saying that no witness before a grand jury should 
19  have absolute immunity from a so-called 1983 malicious 
20
21
 MR. PINCUS:  No, Your Honor, we're not. 
22  We're asking for exactly the rule that was at common 
23  law.  What the Court has said in Kalina and Malley is --
24  the rule that the Court adopted there was based on 
25

prosecution claim? 

precisely the same distinction that we rely on here. 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So, if I understand your 

 MR. PINCUS:  No, Your Honor, it's 

1
2  answer, that you're not -- it's -- this whole business 
3  about complaining witness is irrelevant.  It's any -- no 
4  witness before a grand jury has absolute immunity.
5
6  complaining witnesses.  The distinction that the common 
7  law drew -- all witnesses were immune from defamation. 
8  Only -- the only people who could be subject to 
9  liability based on their testimony were people who 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  would satisfy the elements of the malicious prosecution 
20
21
22
23  different, isn't it? 
24
25

qualified as complaining witnesses.  That is why the 
court in Malley and Kalina drew the line it did.  It 
said these people -- you were acting as a complaining 
witness.  The function you're performing by submitting 
this affidavit is being a complaining witness.  At 
common law, that function -- true, it wasn't technically 
immune, but it was subject to liability.  Liability 
could be premised on those statements. 

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  That's a little 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, what the Court has 

said -- it said in Malley and Kalina, and what we're 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Any witness could -- who 

tort could be liable? 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  relying on here -- is that those -- those people also --
2  Congress would have recognized in 1871 that there could 
3  be liability for people who fell into this category, and 
4  so --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you're saying that 
5
6  the only people who would be subject to suit for the 
7  malicious prosecution tort were complaining witnesses? 
 MR. PINCUS:  Yes. 
8
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Pincus, you -- in 
9
answer to one of Justice Kagan's questions, you noted 
10
11  that you really can't find a case where a court relied 
12  exclusively on the grand jury testimony.  In most of the 
13  cases that I've reviewed, there's a discussion that both 
14  non-grand jury and grand jury testimony was being relied 
15
16
17  Honor.  It's awfully hard to tell, but I wouldn't want 
18  to represent there's one. 
19
20
21  and remand on the ground that there might be adequate 
22  independent evidence from the grand jury testimony in 
23  this case to sustain a cause of action.  Do you agree 
24  with their recommendation?  And if you don't agree, 
25

what -- the United States as amica is supporting vacatur 

assume that we were to adopt the United States' 

upon; is that accurate? 

 MR. PINCUS:  I think that's right, Your 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, there -- there is 

independent evidence in this case, Your Honor, of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, the court below 

took that into account and said:  You're only relying on 
the grand jury testimony to prove the conspiracy, and 
that's not enough. 

1  position.  What would be the independent evidence that 
2  you have that would support a malicious prosecution 
3  claim? 
4
5
6  before the Respondent testified before the grand jury 
7  there were -- there are allegations that he conspired 
8  with the district attorney and others to fabricate the 
9  evidence that he gave.  And that obviously --
10
11 
12 
13 
14
 MR. PINCUS:  Well, Your Honor, I think that 
what the Eleventh Circuit said was because this was all 
15
16  directed to the grand jury testimony, we're not going to 
17  separate -- uphold -- hold that there could be liability 
18  based on that alone. 
19
of all, our principal submission, of course, is there 
20
21  can be liability premised on the grand jury testimony 
22  and that there's no basis in the common law for a 
23  different rule. 
24
25

 And our second position would be, even if 
you, the Court, thought that grand jury testimony for 

 I think that's wrong for two reasons.  First 

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 I want to return to Justice Breyer's 

question for 1 minute, because there was the third 

premised when a proceeding is initiated by information, 

1  some reason was off limits but became permissible as a 
2  basis for finding liability if there was other evidence, 
3  then that's true in this case as well. 
4
5
6  policy reason that I wanted to provide, which is, as we 
7  explain in our brief, in the States many prosecutors can 
8  proceed by information or indictment, and we think it 
9  would be a peculiar situation if liability could be 
10
11  which Malley and Kalina make clear, but that if the 
12  proceeding is by grand jury, it would be wholly off 
13  limits.  That doesn't make much sense, and it's totally 
14  inconsistent with the common law rule.
15
16
17
18
19
20
21  please the Court: 
22
23  extension of Briscoe into the absolute immunity for all 
24  witnesses in the grand jury with no distinction with 
25

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 MR. JONES:  If it's outside of the grand

2
 As this Court has said in Briscoe, that the 
3  -- you look at the purpose of protecting the witnesses, 
4  both at the grand jury proceeding and at trial, and you 
5
6  keep the court from harassment --
7
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You would acknowledge that 
8  if someone instigates the grand jury proceeding but does 
9  not testify, that person could be sued if indeed the 
10
11
12  jury -- and I go for the but-for test, unlike the Van de 
13  Kamp --
14
15
16  doubt he instigated the grand jury proceeding.  He got 
17  the -- the U.S. attorney to bring the proceeding, but he 
18  didn't testify.  Could that person be sued? 
19
20
21
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So, all he has to do 
22  to get himself off the hook is, after instigating it, he 
23  should testify, right?  His testimony bathes him clean; 
24  is that it?
25

 MR. JONES:  Yes, that person could be sued 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, now, just answer my 

question.  I've given you a hypothetical.  He -- no 

under the but-for standard. 

 MR. JONES:  No, that isn't, because --

go forward with a 1983 claim. 

 MR. JONES:  That is my point. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay. 
 MR. JONES:  That there has to be some 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.  So, then it --
1
2  so, all you're arguing, then, is that there has to be 
3  some evidence other than the mere testimony; is that 
4  your point?
5
6
7
8  evidence other than the mere testimony.  And if there is 
9  evidence other than the mere testimony, indeed you can 
10
11
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then you agree with the 
12  -- with the position that the United States took, which 
13  is you can -- if there were -- there was evidence 
14  outside the grand jury proceeding that this person was 
15
16  malicious prosecution 1983 claim?  I thought the United 
17  States' position was:  We're not going to use the 
18  testimony before the grand jury, but if this person did 
19  things outside the grand jury to instigate the 
20
21
22  Solicitor General's position was that if the only way 
23  that you could prove the allegation was to use the grand 
24  jury testimony, then indeed you could not bring a suit 
under 1983.  But I think as Justice Scalia's question 
25

the instigator, that that could be the basis for a 

prosecution, that's -- that could --

 MR. JONES:  The way I understand the 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. JONES:  No, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And why is that? 
 MR. JONES:  Well --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it just because of your 

1  was proffered is that it was an independent act that in 
2  and of itself created a constitutional violation, 
3  independent, and actually caused the prosecution.  Then 
4  indeed --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Jones, you --
5
6
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do you agree that we 
7  should vacate and remand according to the suggestion of 
8  the Solicitor General? 
9
10
11
12
13  view of the evidence, that there's no evidence to 
14  justify the remand?
15
16  the issues.  But nothing like this was -- what the 
17  Solicitor General is recommending, none of those issues 
18  were raised below, none of those issues were raised in 
19  the court of appeals in the Eleventh Circuit, and in 
20
21
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you're saying that 
22  this was waived and was just not in the case?  Because 
23  usually if the issue wasn't discussed, that's the reason 
24  we remand.
25

 MR. JONES:  Well, that's certainly one of 

this --

 MR. JONES:  That's correct.  It was waived, 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but if -- if there 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand how it's 

1  and it's -- and it's not before the Court, and that's 
2  not why cert was granted. 
3
4  waived.  I don't understand that.  How was it waived?
 MR. JONES:  It was never presented by any 
5
6  side at any -- to any place in the court below. 
7
8  is -- if there is a theory of liability and we find that 
9  there is -- that that theory is baseless, we don't 
generally dismiss the complaint if there are other 
10
11 
allegations in the complaint that could support 
12 
liability on another theory. 
13
14  case has to be -- it's going back to the district court 
anyway, as Your Honor is well aware.  And perhaps it can 
15
16  be raised again at that time with an amendment.  But at 
17  the present time, it's not in the case. 
18
19  understand your responses to these questions?  Because 
you said to Justice Scalia the fact that there's been 
20
21  testimony at the grand jury does not, if you will, 
22  immunize the person from suit based on other acts.  Can 
23  you go further?  In a suit based on other acts, could 
24  the grand jury testimony come in as evidence?
25

 MR. JONES:  If you look at common law, 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. JONES:  Well, certainly, I mean, this 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Jones, could I 

Official 

1  that's exactly what happened.  At common law, and as 
2  Justice Scalia mentioned in -- in his concurrence in 
3  Kalina, what you had is two separate acts when you had a 
4  malicious prosecution at common law.  The first act was 
actually complaining and making a complaint to -- to get 
5
6  a warrant; in other words, swearing at that point in 
7  time.  But there, again, the person that complained 
8  actually didn't have to be a witness. 
 But when he was a witness or when he or she 
9
became a witness at court, that testimony could then be 
10
11  used to show malice for the prosecution or for actually 
12  bringing the case. 
13
14  that there's absolute immunity for a suit based 
15
16  based on something else, the grand jury testimony can 
17  come in. 
18
19  an independent cause of action outside of the court, 
20
21
22  independent cause of action could be, because it is the 
23  grand jury proceeding that initiates the action.  So, 
24  why would the common law permit it unless it recognized 
25

exclusively on grand jury testimony, and if the suit is 

that a complaining witness has to do something to get 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, all you're saying is 

 MR. JONES:  That is correct, if indeed it's 

yes. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know what an 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

prosecution?  But the point I'm making is I don't see 

1  the grand jury up and running --
 MR. JONES:  Well --
2
3
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and go in and testify 
4  to something false to be liable for malicious 
5
6  how your position differs from the Government's at all, 
7  and I'm not sure what -- how you could have independent 
8  guilt proven that requires anything more than proof, 
9  than the proof they proffered below, which was that this 
police officer issued subpoenas and took other steps to 
10
11 
start the grand jury's process.  And then you use their 
testimony at the grand jury to figure out whether it was 
12 
13 
false or not. 
14
15
16  that issue, I don't see it as any different.  What I was 
17  suggesting, what I understood Justice Scalia to say, is 
18  when you have something independent that forms a cause 
19  of action, for example, if you take and plant evidence 
in of a crime, for example cocaine or something of that 
20
21  nature, that is a separate and distinct cause of action, 
22  and that would cause -- that action by an investigator 
23  might very well cause the -- the prosecution or the 
24  district attorney to act when indeed you would have --
25

 MR. JONES:  First of all, to respond, one, 
our position with respect to the Solicitor General on 

they would find something --

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it different from -- I 

1
2  mean, I find the Solicitor General -- it's my fault, I'm 
3  sure -- I don't understand the position they're taking. 
4  I mean, I think in every case there's some evidence 
about what goes on outside the courtroom or the grand 
5
6  jury room, and then there is some evidence about what 
7  went on inside.  And I don't know when you're supposed 
8  to introduce what. 
 So, I'm guessing that -- that whatever the 
9
rule is about when you can use what parts of what, that 
10
11  if you win, the rule about when you should use or when 
12  you still can use the testimony that's given in the 
13  grand jury room is the same as the rule that says when 
14  you can use the testimony of a witness at trial.
 See, I would have thought that immunity 
15
16  means you can't use that testimony, but I'm told I'm 
17  wrong about that.  You sometimes can use it.  So, then I 
18  don't know when you can use it and when you can't. 
19  Maybe you know.  You've studied this case.  I admit I 
haven't studied it as thoroughly as I hope you have. 
20
21
22
23
24
25

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. JONES:  I hope I have as well. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
 MR. JONES:  At least as I understand with 

respect to -- first of all, if you look at Briscoe, 

34
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  When you say absolutely 

Smith says to his friend:  I hate that rat Jones.  I am 

 Next step, he goes to the grand jury or 

 Third step, he's in the grand jury room 

saying:  Jones stole my horse. 

 Fourth, he's at trial.  Okay? 
 So, what comes in and what doesn't?  And can 

1  everything that's in Briscoe, as you know, is absolutely 
2  immune from civil damage litigation. 
3
4  immune, I'm thinking of a typical case as follows: 
5
6  going to go and lie and say he stole my horse. 
7
8  someone and says:  Jones stole my horse. 
9
10
11
12
13  you bring a case in the first place? 
14
15
16 
17
18  a difficult time.  But the -- when you have a grand 
19  jury, you have something different from just bringing a 
cause of action.  What you have in a grand jury is you 
20
21  have evidence presented to the prosecutor, typically a 
22  district attorney, and then the district attorney makes 
23  an independent evaluation as to what to bring to the 
24  grand jury and who to indict or whether to indict 
25

 MR. JONES:  Well, I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm at sea.  Whatever you 

can help me with, I'd be happy. 

 MR. JONES:  First of all -- and it might be 

anybody whatsoever. 

35
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There's always something 

1
2  bring a cause of action, for example if a cause of 
3  action is brought for malicious prosecution, which 
4  they're trying to do here, what this Court has said in 
the Van de Kamp case is that the only time that you can 
5
6  use that testimony is if there is something else outside 
7  of the grand jury --
8
9  else.  He didn't think of this thing for the first time 
in the grand jury room.  The defendant thought of this 
10
11 
thing outside the grand jury room before he even got to 
the grand jury, and he probably told somebody about it, 
12 
13 
or he could have, or at least there's the evidence he 
walked to the grand jury room.  Okay?  So, there's 
14 
always something outside the grand jury. 
15

3  sufficient to make out a claim of malicious prosecution? 
4  If that situation doesn't exist, then I don't see any 
5
6  position. 
7
8  when you have an investigation in any type of district 
9  attorney's office, what you have is investigators going 
out and investigating a case, bringing the material to 
10
11 
the district attorney, then the district attorney looks 
at the material, and then the district attorney is the 
12 
13 
one that makes an independent decision. 
14
15
16  witness -- and the concern that the affidavit in support 
17  of the warrant is filled with lies.  The affidavit is 
18  presented to a judge.  And I would think that's better 
19  than a prosecutor.  And yet, there is no absolute 
20
21  even though the judge makes the judgment whether the 
22  warrant should issue. 
23
24  is this:  First of all, the -- in Malley and when you go 
apply for a warrant, the -- the -- at that point in time

2  determining, the time, place, and manner in which to go 
3  to the judge, and also possibly he can, he or she can, 
4  select the judge that the person wants to go for.  And 
then what has happened is that person who presents that 
5
6  evidence is presenting the evidence that he or she has 
7  gathered and is going to present it in a light most 
8  favorable to the investigation.  That person won't 
9  necessarily present the bad part.  They might present 
just only the -- exclusively the good part.  And also 
10
11  that person isn't under the subpoena power. 
12
13  had, instead of a grand jury proceeding and an 
14  indictment, an accusation to begin the prosecution and a 
supporting affidavit in connection with the accusation. 
15
16  Would there be -- would there be absolute immunity then 
17  for the affidavit that supports the accusation which 
18  will begin the prosecution? 
 MR. JONES:  If I understand your question, 
19
and I'm not sure I heard it exactly, are you saying if 
20
21  there's an affidavit that went before the grand jury? 
22
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No.  We take the grand 
23  jury out of it.  We're going to begin the case, the 
24  prosecution, by an information, or I think the Georgia 
law refers to something called an accusation.  If -- if

1  we're not before a grand jury and the prosecution is

3  supporting that information, is there absolute immunity 
4  for the false affidavit in support of the information?
 MR. JONES:  Once again, that's a scenario 
5
6  essentially in Malley and Kalina, where you had those 
7  individuals coming before -- they were not subpoenaed. 
8  Those individuals -- whether it's affidavit or 
9  testimony, I think either one is testimony.
10
11  provision of the Georgia Code that seems to equate 
12  what's called an accusation with an indictment.  It's on 
13  the bottom of page 22:  "All legal proceedings by which 
14  a person's liability for a crime is determined, 
15
16  filing of the accusation." 
17
18  the return of the indictment or the filing of the 
19  accusation, why shouldn't the immunity rule be the same 
for the two?  And you told me that Malley would cover 
20
21  the filing of the accusation.  So, why shouldn't it be 
22  the same for the return of the indictment?

4  an independent prosecutor, in the meantime.  Actually, 
5
6  subpoenaing a witness for like a grand jury, that person 
7  is actually -- and what the Court has said is 
8  potentially wasting judicial resources by bringing a 
9  not-so-good case, just like in Malley, to the court.

7  for that testimony or that statements before him, in
 
8  other words, he would not have done anything there,
 
9  like, as I stated earlier, like the planting of the
 
10
11
12  down, told the prosecutor exactly what he was later 
13  going to say in the grand jury.  I rarely called a 
14  witness to a grand jury when I was a prosecutor who I 
hadn't spoken to before.  Occasionally, I had to because 
15
16  of circumstances, but the vast majority you sit down and 
17  talk to and find out what their story is.  Identical 
18  story before and after during the grand jury.  Is the 
19  story before an independent act sufficient to bring a

2  states it's the first stage of the criminal proceeding. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but there's no 
3
4  judge.  And it seems to me odd to say -- there's no 
presiding judge, there's no cross-examination.  And the 
5
6  indictment has the same function as an information.  So, 
7  why should it rank as a judicial proceeding? 
 MR. JONES:  Well, it has many more of the

more akin to a judicial proceeding and a trial than the

subject to compulsory process.  The person is placed 
under oath.  The person may indeed not even want to come

3  I know the prosecutor is not immune or the complaining

5
6  an information or indictment? 
7
 MR. JONES:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  He is immune? 
8
9
 MR. JONES:  Yes.

16  the defendant who is not the prosecutor --
17
18  investigator who's employed by the prosecutor.  And I 
19  think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the prosecutor 
himself in this situation directed the investigator to 
20
21  appear before the grand jury, and directed him as to 
22  what to testify to at the grand jury.  So -- and as Your 
23  Honor pointed out, the -- who is absolutely immune, in 
24  the grand jury setting the prosecutor is immune, the 
grand jurors are immune.  In trial, the prosecutor is

what I'm saying with respect to bringing a malicious

Anderson and the Moulton cases that we cite on page 3 of

the Court is talking about the charge to the jury, and

And then in the Moulton case, the allegations of the 
complaint are set forth in the reporting of the case,

 (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the

2  out.  Is Mr. Paulk the person who set this in motion? 
3  If the testimony is -- may I finish?

6  additional anything, then perhaps he won't be found 
7  liable anyway.
