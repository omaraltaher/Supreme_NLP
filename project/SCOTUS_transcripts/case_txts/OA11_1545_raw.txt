 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

 This case can get complicated, quickly, 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, thank you 

1
2
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
3
4  first this morning in Case 11-1545, City of Arlington, 
Texas v. The Federal Communications Commission and the 
5
6  consolidated case. 
7
8
9
10
11 
12
13  because the word "jurisdiction" means a lot of different 
14  things to a lot of different people, in a lot of 
different contexts, and the parties have advanced both 
15
16  broad and narrow theories for resolving the case.  So 
17  the thing I can do, most helpfully, at the beginning, I 
18  think, is to frame where I believe the real dispute in 
19  the case lies. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

The FCC claims the authority to interpret 
Section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act with the 
force of law.  And my argument today is limited to the 
question -- that threshold jurisdictional question, 
which we call interpretive jurisdiction, Iowa Utilities 
called it underlying jurisdiction, law professors like 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And the Fifth Circuit said that, on that 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Goldstein, this case 

adopted by the Commission, and the Commission's 
rule-making power, as you know, is very broad. 

 They have power to make the rules needed to 

it gets to decide whether it has the authority to 

1  to call it Chevron Step Zero, but that's what I'm 
2  focused on. 
3
4  question, the FCC gets Chevron deference.  And that is 
5
6  interpret the --
7
8  has been presented in a very complicated way, but it 
9  seems to me that what we're dealing with is a rule 
10
11 
12
13  carry out the provisions of the Act.  And 332 is --
14  counts as a provision of the Act.  So why isn't it just 
a proper implementation of that rule-making authority? 
15
16
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 
17  question on which you granted certiorari was how to 
18  decide that question, not what is the answer to that 
19  question. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

What the Fifth Circuit did, acknowledging a 
circuit conflict, was decided that the FCC's assertion 
that you are right is, itself, entitled to Chevron 
deference. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Suppose you win 

on that, okay? 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

discretionary power, but all the arguments that we hear 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

1
2
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Or I -- I grant you, I 

3  don't see any reason for that.  The question is just 

4  whether Congress intended them to have a degree of 

5
6  still count against you.  So -- so if you want to go 
7  into the Chevron Step Zero or Step Minus Alpha 13.6, I 
8  mean, fine. 
9
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21  have wanted the FCC to figure this one out. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  I --
22
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That -- that -- at some 
23
24  point -- you don't have to go into it at all, if you 
25

 (Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  But, I mean, at some point, 
I will hope you -- I hope you will go into what I'd call 
the question of we have a statute, just as 
Justice Ginsburg said, it's an expert statute.  It is a 
statute in an agency that has all kinds of discretionary 
authority.  It includes an important substantive 
question about what the relation is with the cable 
television in this area -- post -- not cable, but -- you 
know, the broadcast posts. 

don't want to, but I just want to put that on the table. 

 And so all these factors here, which 

suggest, of course, Congress, which is not expert, would 

6

about. 

 I am very conscious of the fact, let me say, 

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Breyer, I do want to 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't have to talk 
about it now, but you can talk about it whenever you 

1
2
3  talk about it.  I do hope --
4
5
6  want. 
 (Laughter.) 
7
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I appreciate it.  But I'd 
8
9  like to talk about the things you want to hear me talk 
10
11
12  that the Court limited this grant of certiorari to the 
13  first question presented, which was the abstract Chevron 
14  question, and so I just don't want to jump the gun --
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23
24  and Justice Breyer have both asked me to turn to that 
question, so I'm going to do it.  The only point I'm 
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if the abstract 
question really isn't presented -- I mean, just to 
follow on what I asked you first, here is a phrase, "a 
reasonable time."  And the Commission interprets that 
phrase in a reasonable way. 

Why is this case any more complicated than 

that?  Why doesn't the FCC have the authority to 
interpret that term, within a reasonable time? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, you -- you 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

granted certiorari. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, don't, because I 

is jurisdiction means a lot of things, but what you mean 
by it is real jurisdiction, right? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I mean -- what I mean by 

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Look, what you've told us 

1  making is that all of these questions assume that we are 
2  right on the question presented, which I think we 
3  obviously are.  So I'm happy to move on, but I just did 
4  not want to hurry past the legal question on which you 
5
6
7  don't -- I don't think it's so clear. 
8

19

21
22  jurisdictional question? 
23
24  be --
25

jurisdiction.  That doesn't clarify things very much for 
me.  What if -- what if the statute in this case said, 
the FCC shall have no jurisdiction to establish time 
limits within which the States must act? 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Chevron Step Zero 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay?  Would that be a 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That would.  That would 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  What if the statute 

8

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is a different kind of 

jurisdictional question.  It is a jurisdictional 


 Justice Scalia, so maybe I can help you, 


whether it's just malleable and every court's going to 
get drawn into it, which I suspect you may be concerned 
about.  Okay? 

1  just said, the FCC shall not establish time limits 
2  within which the States must act.  Is that 
3  jurisdictional? 
4
5
6  question. 

7
8  just on the question of what I'm talking about and 

9  whether I can draw -- whether I can draw my line or 

10
11 
12 
13
 The kind of jurisdiction I'm talking about 
14  is what you called, in your Iowa Utilities opinion for 
the Court, "underlying jurisdiction."  And, in Iowa 
15
16  Utilities, in the discussion of the FCC's underlying 
17  jurisdiction, you undertook the judicial task of looking 
18  at the words of the statute and figuring out that 
19  Congress did intend, along the lines of the theory that 
Justice Ginsburg just articulated, that the FCC did have 
20
21  the power to implement those provisions of the '96 Act. 
22
23  honest, every one of your Chevron opinions deals with 
24  this question:  Just did the agency have the power to 
interpret this statutory provision with the force of 
25

 And in -- as we have rehearsed, to be

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I don't think so.  In 

opinions -- and, certainly, I have said in a 

Now, if you -- if you talk -- if you want to 

limit your proposal --

1  law?  You and the -- all of your colleagues on the Court 
2  have always decided that question de novo. 
3
4  fact, I think we have said in -- in a number of 
5
6  concurrence -- that the jurisdictional question, like 
7  any other question -- an alleged jurisdictional 
8  question, like any other one, is to be decided with 
9  deference to the agency. 
10
11 
12
13
14  question --
15
16
17  jurisdiction to administer the Federal 
18  Communications Act, I agree with you.  I will decide 
19  that without listening to the FCC.  But that's -- that's 
a good deal short of whether, given that it does have 
20
21  jurisdiction to administer the Federal Communications 
22  Act, its implementation of this particular provision 
23  goes beyond what its authority is. 
24
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I do. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to the -- to the entry 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I do. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- of whether the FCC has 

 That seems, to me, a question of -- you can 

call everything that's ultra vires in excess of the 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

more narrow question, does the FCC administer this 
statutory provision? 

1  agency's jurisdiction, you can.  But that's not --
2  that's not what we mean by the entry jurisdictional 
3  question, does the agency have authority to administer 
4  this Act. 
MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Justice Scalia, the 
5
6  place where -- I do limit myself to the entry point and 
7  the place where you and I are going to disagree is 
8  whether the entry point is just the generic question, 
9  does the FCC administer the whole Act or the somewhat 
10
11 
12
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there some statutes 
13  where parts of the statute are subject to the agency's 
14  Chevron rule-making authority and its zero plus one 
15
16  mentioned the case by Justice Scalia -- and I'm not sure 
17  that that involved that because it does seem to me, just 
18  reading through, that "reasonable time," that sounds 
19  like something that -- where we can have a specific 
20
21
22  agency or the authority of the agency does not extend to 
23  rules seems a little odd at first.  I recognize the 
24  federalism problems and so forth. 
25

jurisdiction and other parts are not?  You just 

elaboration of what it means. 

 And to say that the jurisdiction of the 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  Okay.  The answer to 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

as we say Section 332(c)(7) does.  We will have to go 
through that and debate that.  But the Communications 
Act is plainly -- and there are other provisions as 
well.  But the best example is the Louisiana PSC case. 

 And so --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your 

 And there was a provision in that statute 

1  your question is yes, and the best example is this 

2  statute.  It is uncontested and incontestable that 

3  the -- the FCC does not administer all of the 

4  Communications Act.  This Court so held, squarely, in 

the Louisiana Public Service Commission case, in which, 
5
6  there, Congress added to the Communications Act Sections 
7  251 and 252. 
8
9  that said -- that limited the scope of the FCC's power, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is correct.  I would 
22
23  only cabinet it in the following way:  And there's --
24  the question on which you granted certiorari is does the 
FCC get Chevron deference in its assertion that it gets 
25

understanding of jurisdiction and what you're arguing 
for today is nothing more or less than this is a 
provision as to which Congress did not give the agency 
law-making authority.  You do not defer to the agency 
with respect to this provision because it's outside its 
jurisdiction in the sense that it gets deference. 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Now, the 


jurisdiction and it's kind of dressed up --

phrased, is this 7(a), which speaks about nothing will 
limit the authority of the States. 

1  to interpret 332(c)(7) with the force of law.  I 

2  think --

3
4  reason -- the reason we are hearing all about 

5
6
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 
7
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- is simply because 
8  the means by which Congress made clear it was not giving 
9  the FCC authority to get deference, however that is 
10
11 
12
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It's that --
13
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If it weren't for 
14  that, if it were some other type of provision, that --
15
16  the FCC doesn't get deference to it. 
17
18  jurisdictional question.  We rely on two provisions of 
19  332(c)(7) to establish the proposition that Congress did 
not intend the general rule-making authority in Section 
20
21  201(b) of the Communications Act to extend to 332(c)(7). 
22  And those are --
23
24  different from our holding in any case that the agency 
25

we wouldn't call it jurisdiction, but we would just say, 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It would be a very easy 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's -- that's no 

has no authority to issue this rule.  It has rule-making 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's -- it's always a 

respect, respectfully, and that is we believe that every 
one of this Court's Chevron precedents has started --
sometimes, only in a sentence, because, often, it's very 
simple -- often, it's uncontestable -- that it's a 
provision of the Communications Act that does fall 
within, for example, the FCC's 201(b) authority. 

1  authority, but this rule goes too far, which is to say 
2  Congress did not give the agency authority to go this 
3  far. 
4
5
6  question of how much authority Congress gave the agency. 
7
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We disagree.  And I 
8  understand that you have a vision of how Chevron 
9  deference operates.  We disagree with it in this 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  approached that question as judges.  First, we decide 
18  does the FCC have the power to implement this statute? 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Goldstein, at one 
19
level, you are right.  It's just a level that doesn't 
20
21  help you very much.  I mean, it's -- it's true that, 
22  always, there is an initial question of whether an 
23  agency is entitled to Chevron deference.  But, usually, 
24  the way we answer that question is just this:  We say is 
25

 But it is always as -- you have always 

this the agency's organic statute?  Yes. 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Does that organic statute provide the agency 

1
2  with lawmaking power?  Yes.  Has the agency acted in 
3  accordance with that lawmaking-- under that lawmaking 
4  power?  Yes.  Well, then, the agency gets deference.  We 
go on to the next thing, which is Step One and Step Two. 
5
6
 So -- you know, we don't -- what we don't do 
7  is this sort of provision by provision, subsection by 
8  subsection, did Congress have a special intent as to 
9  this subject matter or that subject matter or the other 
subject matter?  We've just had some very simple rules 
10
11 
about what gets you into the box where an agency is 
12 
entitled to deference. 
13
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Kagan, I disagree. 
14  I honestly disagree.  I'm going to give you three cases 
15
16  articulation of your -- that approach is not correct. 
17  And I encourage you to ask the Solicitor General what 
18  his best case is.  It may be he thinks American 
19  Hospital, which I'll talk about. 
20
21
22  provision by provision, the Court looked de novo at the 
23  question of whether Sections 251 and 252 of the 
24  Communications Act were subject to the general 
25

Here are my three cases: 
 Louisiana Public Service Commission, 

that I think show that I am right and that your 

rule-making power.  It said no.

 Adams Fruit, another case where the 


authority with the respect to these interpretive rulings? 

question?  Did it say anything like that? 

 And the last one is Meade, where the Customs 

 And so it has always done some --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did -- did it say, in all 

1
2  Secretary of Labor had general rule-making authority 

3  over the agricultural worker protection statute.  And 

4  the Court looked specifically at the private right of 

action and said, your authority doesn't extend here. 
5
6
7  Service has the general authority to administer that 
8  statute.  And, instead, the Court looked at the specific 
9  provision involved, and it said, do you have lawmaking 
10
11
12
13  of those cases, we give no deference to the agency's 
14  contrary determination because this is a jurisdictional 
15
16
17
18
19  you this:  I am not overclaiming the cases.  I am 
describing what happened in them, particularly on the 
20
21  axis of whether the Court went provision by provision. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Very -- very often, I could 
22
23  decide a case -- you know, the lower courts are running 
24  away from the question of deference vel non because 
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It did not.  I have not --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't think so. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Scalia, I will tell 

things have been so confused by Meade.  So they simply 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

of those cases. 

you why --

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Scalia, let me tell 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whether it was or not, it 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Scalia, here's why I 

disagree:  I picked three cases for a very specific 

1  decide the question assuming no deference to the agency. 
2  That doesn't prove that, in that particular case, the 
3  agency wouldn't have been entitled to deference. 
4
5
6
7  would have come out this way.  So those three cases 
8  don't -- don't prove what you say they prove. 
9
10
11  reason, in that each of those three cases rejected the 
12  assertion of jurisdiction.  And so that, if Chevron were 
13  applying, the Court would have had to find that the 
14  statute was unambiguous.  And it didn't do that in any 
15
16
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And could you add that, in 
17  those three cases -- or at least Meade, some respect was 
18  given to the agency's due? 
19
20
21 
22
23
24  sorry.  Did --
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Absolutely, Justice --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But take Meade, Mr. -- I'm 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, absolutely. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It was just not the sort 

of deference that's so wooden under Chevron. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I did.  I agreed with 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And Meade presented --
whatever you think of Meade, it's a very different 

1  Justice Kennedy vociferously.  That was -- that was the 
2  end of my answer. 
3
4
5
6  question from this because what the majority in Meade 
7  said was that the agency wasn't entitled to deference 
8  because it was acting by way of these opinion letters 
9  that weren't -- that didn't have the force of law.  So 
that's the threshold question, is does the agency have 
10
11  power to make rules with the force of law, and is the 
12  agency exercising that power? 
13
14  set by this Court.  It's a very different kind of 
15
16  subsection, did -- did Congress think that the agency 
17  had authority over this particular subject matter or 
18  not. 
19
three answers.  They will be brief.  Louisiana Public 
20
21  Service Commission and Adams Fruit are as I described 
22  them.  The reason that Meade is helpful to me is on a 
23  different axis than you've described.  And that is that 
24  the agency there had a general -- generally applicable 
25

authority in which it could have urged that its 

 That is a threshold question that has been 

question from provision by provision, subsection by 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  I have two -- I have

 But the third thing that I want to say

14  and says, hey, by the way, court -- you know, I think

that I was agreeing with Justice Kennedy was -- is, as

do not have, and among those limitations is that they

 Then, in Subsection (b)(5) --

1  am going to answer your question, but I want to make a 
2  couple of quick points about our offensive argument 
3  about why it is Congress didn't intend the FCC to 
4  implement the statute with the force of law. 
It begins with preservation of local zoning 
5
6  authority.  Subsection (a) says, "Except as provided in 
7  this paragraph, nothing in this Act" -- which includes 
8  Section 201(b) -- "shall limit or affect the authority 
9  of a State or local government with respect to this 
10
11
12  Justice Ginsburg, you said the essence of the statute is 
13  (b).  In subsection (b)(5), Congress located the 
14  enforcement power of this statute in the courts. 
"Any" -- and this is it at the bottom of 2, "Any person 
15
16  adversely affected by any final action or failure to act 
17  by a State or local government or any instrumentality 
18  thereof" --

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I -- I could read the whole 
22
23  thing, Justice Ginsburg.  My point is going to be that 
24  that "reasonable period of time" phrase is enforced 
25

skipping over (2), which is the phrase "reasonable

9
10
11  explained by the conferees in the conference report at 
12  page 209 of the petition appendix.  And what happened 
13  here is that -- that the House version of the bill 
14  instructed the FCC to conduct a rule-making and the 
rule-making would set standards for establishing a 
15
16  reasonable period of time.

19  that, instead, says that nothing else in the Act will 
apply to this question; that you will go to the courts,

22  be canceled, and then explained its intent.  And so if I 
23  could just read that to you, very quickly --

and I'm just looking at the text, okay?

1

3  statutes which, after giving of the agency rule-making 
4  authority, provide judicial -- you know, review under 
this statute shall be held in such-and-such a court. 

5
6
 There is no conflict whatever between a 

7  statement that any person affected can sue in Federal 

8  court and the possession by an agency of rule-making

23  what the FCC you would expect to implement, and that is 
24  a reasonable period of time is a general national 
25

point is that it is a point in our favor, particularly 
when you compare -- (b)(5) has two parts, in addition to 
the statutory history, which was -- told the FCC to 
cancel the rule-making on this point.  Subsection (b)(5) 
says, you go -- on the reasonable period of time 
provision, you go to the courts; and, on questions 
related to radio frequency emissions, which is also 
covered by (c)(7)(A), you go to the FCC. 

 And what the conferees explained, quite 
clearly, Justice Ginsburg, is that you can have two

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

 Chevron does apply to a court's review of an

the agency, generally, the authority to make rules 
carrying the force of law and that the rule in question 
was promulgated in exercise of that authority.

19  Court in Mayo the term before, was is the authority --
20
21  make rules with the force of law. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's right, 
22
23  but your argument it seems, to me, can't be -- let's say 
24  you have a general statute, and you've got a provision 
25

is -- is the agency vested with authority, generally, to 

at the beginning that says this is -- authority to

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I would not, 

not say that the first general one controls the specific 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  You would say 
you don't get deference on 123.  And, as I understand 

1  interpret this is delegated to the agency. 
2
 And you go along, but then, all of a sudden, 
3  in -- you know, Section 123, it says it doesn't get any 
4  deference interpreting this provision.  Now, you would 
5
6  withdrawal of deference, would you? 
7
8  Mr. Chief Justice. 
9
10
11  the case -- and that's why I persist in thinking there's 
12  no great disagreement here, your friend on the other 
13  side is saying that, particularly given 7(a) and some 
14  other things, you should read 7(b)(2) as if Congress had 
15
16
17  7(a) says nothing shall limit what the State can do, 
18  other than what's here in the statute.  And, if you let 
19  the FCC -- if you give them deference, you're letting 
20
21
 So why -- and then you dispute, it seems to 
22  me, just whether that you should call that jurisdiction 
23  or not because people think of jurisdiction as meaning, 
24  oh, you don't get through the door.  But, if what they 
mean by jurisdiction is simply that the agency gets no 
25

said, Agency, you don't get any deference here. 

 You can read it that way, they say, because 

something else limit what the State can do.

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I'm not sure I 

point here is that to the extent -- once you've

2  saying the same thing. 
3
4  agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice, because I think the 
5
6  satisfied that general threshold that I identified, then 
7  to the extent there is ambiguity -- if the statute is 
8  clear -- and in Your Honor's hypothetical I'd submit the 
9  statute is clear at that point, that the agency -- that 
the agency's authority has been carved out with respect 
10
11 
to that particular provision. 
12
 If it's clear, you don't get to the question 
13  of whether there's any deference due.  The issue arises 
14  when there's ambiguity.  And our position is --
15
16 
17 
18
19
20
21  no deference, then it doesn't matter whether there's 
22  ambiguity on the subsidiary one, right? 
23
24
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That -- that's correct. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 
GENERAL VERRILLI:  But if there is ambiguity 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Either one because --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but, if 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ambiguity in the 

provision that says, Agency, you get no deference?  Or 
ambiguity in the substantive provision at issue? 

there's no ambiguity on the provision that says you get 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

you call it substance. 

 And one reason for that, Mr. Chief Justice, 

1  on the first, our position is that Chevron applies and 
2  that the agency gets deference, so long as it's a 
3  permissible construction of the statute.  And that's 
4  true whether you call it jurisdiction and -- or whether 
5
6
7  is that I don't think there is -- I do think this is 
8  really a Pandora's Box situation.  I do not think there 
9  is a clear, neat dividing line between what my friend, 
Mr. Goldstein, describes as a jurisdictional issue, an 
10
11 
issue of interpretive authority, and a question of 
12 
substance. 
13
14  in this case.  Mr. Goldstein has tried to define 
jurisdiction in a particular way; the IMLA has defined 
15
16  it in a very different way.  They say any question that 
17  goes to the who, what, when, or where of an agency's 
18  assertion of authority is a jurisdictional question, as 
19  to which agencies get no Chevron deference in the course 
20
21
22  that position is exactly the same reason that Mr. 
23  Goldstein gives for stating his position, which is that 
24  you're talking about an agency action in excess of the 
25

scope of its delegated authority, and, once you say

of ambiguity.

argument is whether its authority to implement has, with 
5
6  respect to a particular provision, has been carved out, 
7  at that point, Chevron deference is appropriate, and 
8  that is the practice of this Court in repeated numbers 
9  of cases. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15

 And the Court rejected that argument, saying

rule-making authority.  There was a statutory provision

the NLRB in each case.  And the argument was made that

 That seems, to me, had you had run that 

Adams Fruit, the - the Court held 

It then did go on to say, with respect to 
Chevron Step Two, that, even if we were going to think 
about granting the agency deference here, they wouldn't 
get it. 

1  communications, so it was an express carveout. 
2
3  through the Chevron analysis, it'd be a pretty 
4  straightforward Chevron Step One case. 
5
6  specifically in Adams Fruit that the plain meaning of 
7  the statutory provision at issue foreclosed the agency's 
8  interpretation.  And that's at 494 U.S., at page 646. 
9  So that was a Chevron Step One case. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  position and not Mr. Goldstein's.  What the Court said 
17  in Adams Fruit was that the Department of Labor did have 
18  the authority to implement the substantive provisions of 
19  the Agricultural Workers Protection Act, including the 
substantive provisions governing motor vehicle safety. 
20
21
 What it didn't have was the authority to 
22  restrict judicial remedies available for the private 
23  cause of action created under the statute. 
24
25

 Well, if you map that onto here, what the 
FCC has done here with respect to the reasonable time 

 But I think the reasons -- if you map the 

reasoning of Adams Fruit onto this case, it supports our 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what worries me about 

substantive provisions. 

 And so it's -- it totally maps onto -- to 

1  provision in 332(c)(7)(B) of the statute was to provide 
2  a rule of decision for the substantive provision of the 
3  Act, leaving to the courts the decision of what remedy, 
4  if any, there would be for a violation of those 
5
6
7  the FCC's interpretation of the right way to think about 
8  statutory authority in this case.  And if I -- I'm 
9  sorry, Justice Breyer. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
 So, as you know, I've written somewhat a 
18
19  different approach.  And it says, let's not do this. 
20
21  look, what we're interested in is just one question, 
22  whether Congress wanted a court to give, in this kind of 
23  situation, deference to the agency.  And the answer will 
24  be, it depends.  Chevron is a good rule of thumb, but it 
25

it is you -- you and I both have, in our offices, 
thousands of words which are in the U.S. Code, and there 
are hundreds of thousands -- or millions of employees, 
in millions of different kinds of agencies, and, if we 
turn Chevron into the tax code, it's going to be a 
nightmare -- in my opinion, not necessarily in that of 
my colleagues. 

But just so, who would win here?  Suppose you just said, 

isn't a straightjacket. 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

And then, here, it uses the word "reasonable." 

 So where you have a Federal agency with 

with the States when they are citing stuff." 

 So what you'd look at here is it's the FCC 
1
2  that is in charge of national communications, of which 
3  this is part.  There is a specific provision, as your 
4  colleague points out, that says, "but don't interfere 
5
6
 But then there is a limitation to that 
7  specific provision, which consists of six or seven 
8  parts, all of which maintain a lot of authority in the 
9  FCC or rules about what they are not supposed to do. 
10
11
12  expertise that's in charge of this kind of area and they 
13  have rule-making authority, and you have a statute like 
14  this, which is a little bit ambiguous, but not too, in 
15
16  interpretation, you'd add up those factors and make a 
17  decision. 
18
19
simple -- I mean, that's Louis Jaffe.  That -- that's 
20
21  the founders of administrative law.  That's everybody 
22  until we get into a straightjacket.  And it isn't --
23  even Chevron doesn't go against us, if you don't think 
24  of it as a straightjacket. 
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  So --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, that's such a 

respect to the point about whether they do 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Two points.  First, 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Second, I understand that that's Your 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't make it up.  It 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that's no better. 

Louis Jaffe isn't even a member of the Court. 

 (Laughter.) 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  But -- but I think the 

1  applying that approach, I think it's pretty clear that 
2  one would uphold the FCC's judgment here. 
3
4  Honor's approach.  I don't --
5
6  was Louis Jaffe. 
7
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I understand that Your 
8  Honor is the most recent proponent of this approach. 
9
10
11
12
13  Court is in a different place.  And I think the Court is 
14  in a different place for a good reason because I think 
it's our interpretation of Chevron that avoids turning 
15
16  it into the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code 
17  because I think, if you think about what my friends on 
18  the other side are proposing here, what they're 
19  suggesting is that, once you've cleared that initial 
20
21  implement the statute with the force of law and that 
22  this is an exercise of that general authority and, 
23  therefore, not --
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I think you can 
show, which I will spare you at the moment, all the 

hurdle of deciding the agency has general authority to 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company

when they like a result, they say they have deference, 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I guess I would beg to 

development of administrative law. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Justice Breyer would 

1  cases like Meade are consistent with what I said.  And 
2  cases that are not consistent are consistent with what 
3  Judge Friendly said years ago, where he said there is no 
4  coherence to the Supreme Court's cases in this area; 
5
6  and, when they don't like it, they say they don't. 
7
8  differ about that.  I think our -- our view is that 
9  Chevron does provide a stable framework for the 
10
11
12  replace that with a rule, where they like the agency to 
13  have authority, it has it, and, where they don't like it 
14  to have authority, it doesn't.  I'm not sure that's any

know, obviously, the dividing line between State 
authority and Federal authority is a more significant 
one than some of the other questions as to which 
agencies get deference, which is whether rates are 
reasonable or not reasonable.  And this provision is 

with the force of law. 

that is because it concerns the authority, or lack

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  It is definitely a 

1  written in terms of a preservation of State authority. 
2
 And your view would give the Federal agency 
3  deference under Chevron -- very considerable deference 
4  in defining when there should be Federal authority and

6  pertinent consideration? 
7
8  pertinent consideration, Mr. Chief Justice.  And let me 
9  talk about that in general and then move to the 
10
11
 In general, it's a pertinent consideration 
12  that is accommodated within the Chevron framework.  At 
13  Chevron Step One, the Court applies the normal tools of 
14  statutory construction.  The normal tools of statutory 
15
16  include the presumption against preemption.  And this

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Congress has to be clear 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That it intended to

1  analysis.  It applied the Chevron framework. 
2
 And it said it's Step One of Chevron because 
3  the Migratory Bird Rule pushed to the very outer limits 
4  of Congress's commerce clause authority, that the Court 
5
6  situation before assuming that --

22  in.  And with respect to this particular --

left with the States.  It's going to be decided by a

unlike Article III courts, of safeguarding the Federal 
balance.

1  Federal instrumentality, right?  Either by the agency,

3  which perhaps could issue opinions that say, 30 days is 
4  the rule. 
5
6  interesting separation of powers question within the 
7  Federal government, but I don't see how it's a question 
8  of whether it's the States or the Federal government 
9  that's -- that's going to call the tune here.  It's 
10
11
12  to be my specific point in response to your question, 
13  Mr. Chief Justice. 
14
15
16  difference between the Federal judiciary defining the 
17  limits between the State and Federal power and having an 
18  agency of unelected bureaucrats responsible to the 
19  executive saying when the State controls and when the 
20
21  propositions. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, but there is a third 
22
23  variable here, and that's what's key, which is, in this 
24  situation -- in 332(c)(7)(B), the limitations provision, 
25

Congress has spoken, unambiguously, and said that the 

Federal controls, those are vastly different 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That is the -- was going 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, it wasn't going 

to be that.  That -- the idea that there is no 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

unelected bureaucrats might decide to impose, and will 
give them -- and the courts must give them vast 
deference in enforcing those limits. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  And no one has suggested 
that that was at the outer limit of Congress's Commerce 

1  following limitations on local zoning authority must be 
2  respected. 
3
4
5
6  Clause authority or anywhere close to it.  And --
7
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But they have also 
8  said -- they have also said, in (7)(a), that those are 
9  the only limits, not add on to this any limits that 
10
11 
12 
13
14  bureaucrats. 
15
16
17  think -- I do think that what Justice Scalia said is 
18  correct, that the question here is not whether the 
19  States will decide.  The question, at the end of the 
20
21  usual authority to interpret reasonable --
22
23  that the --
24
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- whether Federal courts 

will make those decisions on a case-by-case basis upon 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Unelected Federal

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  But I -- but I do

1  de novo review. 
2
3  think that the issue of whether unelected Federal 
4  bureaucrats should decide it or unelected Federal judges 
should decide it is an issue of separation of powers, 
5
6  rather than an issue of -- of Federal/State relations? 
7
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I do think -- in that --
8  in that respect, I think this case is really just like 
9  Iowa Utilities Board, in that the argument there --
10
11 
12
13
14
argument there was that you ought not interpret the 
15
16  FCC to have authority to implement particular rules 
17  because Congress gave to State public utility 
18  commissions the responsibility to carry out and execute 
19  the rules and then, to Federal courts, the power to 
20
21
22  States ought to lead you to conclude not to apply 
23  Chevron deference to the agency --
24
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  In that -- in that -- the 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But, in rejecting 

review them and cut the FCC out. 

 And the argument there was that respect for

 In Section 2 and looking at pages 384 and 

 It was entirely de novo, unlike in Section 

3, when it was finally decided, okay, we've got the 

1  that argument in Section 2 of the opinion, the author of 
2  that opinion in nowhere, in no place, applied Chevron 
3  deference in answering that question. 
4
5
6  answer here, and, now, we will defer to the agency on 
7  the substance of the determination. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I -- I understand that 
8
9  the Petitioners made that argument, Mr. Chief Justice. 
I read the opinion differently, and, if I could, I'll 
10
11 
explain why. 
12
13  385 of the opinion, after the Court had established that 
14  there was general authority, under Section 201(b), to 
implement the provisions of the Act, which I do think 
15
16  the Court established de novo, and we would agree that 
17  that's appropriate, the Court then moved on to consider 
18  these specific jurisdictional questions. 
19
20
21  commissions and then considered the -- the argument that 
22  one ought to infer from that, that the FCC's cut out of 
23  the process.

"We think this attributes to that task a greater degree 

of the statute which gave authority to the State

1  of autonomy than the phrase 'establish any rates' 
2  necessarily implies." 
3

similar about the next argument that the -- that the

14  four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 pages of

19
20
21  we weren't accurate in our discussion of the -- the 
22  concluding paragraph of this phrase.  But I would like 
23  to turn the Court's attention to that because I think we 
24  were.  This is at page 397 of the opinion. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  It does not.

 Now, the jurisdictional dispute was the

Rule 319." 

1
2  starts, "The 1996 Act can be read to grant most 
3  promiscuous rights to the FCC vis-a-vis the State 
4  commissions and to competing carriers vis-a-vis the 
incumbents, and the Commission has chosen, in some 
5
6  instances, to read it that way, but Congress is well 
7  aware that the ambiguities it chooses to produce in the 
8  statute will be resolved by the implementing agency.  We 
9  can only enforce the clear limits that the 1996 Act

14  commissions over who had the authority to implement the

16
17  that Chevron is not cited in that Section 2 of the 
18  opinion, the tenor of that discussion does seem to me to 
19  say that the Court was looking, once it had established 
general authority, for clear evidence that Congress had 
20
21  intended to carve out, from that general authority, the 
22  particular provisions at issue and because the -- the 
23  provisions to which the challengers pointed did not 
24  necessarily imply an intent on the part of Congress to

talking about them adding something.  I didn't think 
15
16  that's what was at issue.  I thought that there is a 
17  word in the statute, "reasonable," and what the 
18  administrators did at the FCC was to interpret that 
19  word.  Am I right or wrong? 
20

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, our view, Justice 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you -- can you tell 
me, what is -- what is the ambiguity?  Because I looked 

1  meaning of the language "reasonable time," to give it 
2  more precise content, to allow -- to deal with the 
3  failure to act situation --
4
5
6  at (b).  (B) is limitations.  Limitations is on the 
7  State, and then it uses the phrase of what the State 
8  cannot do.  The State has to conform to a reasonable 
9  time.  What is ambiguous about this? 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  "reasonable" was what people were talking about as being 
18  ambiguous, although I think -- I don't think "ambiguous" 
19  is the proper word.  "Reasonable" is vague.  You don't 
20
21
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I took that -- I think 
22  that's it's -- it's, certainly, susceptible to further 
23  elaboration in that sense.  But I took Justice Ginsburg 
24  to be asking me about the ambiguity with respect to the 
25

Ginsburg, is that there isn't any ambiguity, that 
the -- that the rule ought to be upheld, no matter what 
standard of review applies, in fairness to my friends on 
the other side.  But I do think this points up the 
problems going down the road they are suggesting is --

authority of the (7)(A) --

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Reasonable -- reasonable is 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right.  And, in fairness 

to my friends and as the Chief Justice has just 

 But I do think this points up the difficulty 
is that, if you -- if you look at the provision that the 

1
2  uncertain who.  Who has -- it doesn't tell us who had 
3  the authority. 
4
5
6  indicated, it's an inference from (7)(A), and I suppose 
7  an inference from (7)(B)(v), and that -- and that the 
8  courts are in the process. 
9
10
11  FCC's actually implementing here, it's not a 
12  jurisdictional provision; it's a normal substantive 
13  standard.  The FCC is giving it more precise content. 
14  That's what an agency's job is.  It's doing its job 
15
16
17  (7)(B)? 
18
19  exactly. 
20
21 
22
23  clear that the FCC has authority, given (7)(A), because 
24  of the "except as provided in this paragraph" argument. 
25

It's, I think, our friends on the other side who say 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  What is there 

about (7)(A) that you think is ambiguous? 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  We think it's -- it's

 And I think you're adding needless 

1  that it's (7)(A) that creates uncertainty about whether 
2  the FCC has the authority to implement the reasonable 
3  time provision in (7)(B)(ii) -- and I think that points 
4  up the problem of adding this additional step to the 
5
6
 Once the Court has satisfied itself that the 
7  agency has general rule-making authority, it's not going 
8  to be hard to cobble together inferences to make 
9  arguments on de novo review that the -- that the agency 
lacked the authority to implement a particular provision 
10
11 
with the force of law. 
12
13  complexity, and I do think -- the reason I suggested, 
14  earlier, that I think this is a Pandora's Box is because 
15
16  principled line that can be drawn between what my friend 
17  describes as interpretive authority questions and the

19  substantive jurisdictional questions that Respondent 
20
21
22  that the agency has acted in excess of its statutory 
23  authority.  And, if that's sufficient to justify de novo 
24  review in the first instance, it's sufficient to justify 
25

I do not think there's, at the end of the day, a 

de novo review in the second instance. 

IMLA is focused on. 

 In each of those situations, the argument is

of the administrative process because that 
interpretation is locked in. 

1
2  that you have really unravelled Chevron.  The -- the 
3  good work that that -- that that doctrine does to 
4  stabilize the development of administrative law is gone. 
5
6  that -- that de novo review is required, and, in every 
7  case in which a court agrees that de novo review is 
8  required, once the court has interpreted the statute as 
9  a matter of de novo review, then you have ossification 
10
11 
12
13  your argument there is basically saying, when the 
14  statute says something is reasonable, it means that the 
Commission doesn't have -- it's a jurisdictional 
15
16  question whether it's reasonable or unreasonable. 
17
18  quite a bit different.  It talks about the authority of 
19  a State.  And, usually, when we are talking about the 
authority of which entity can -- can govern, we view 
20
21  that as jurisdictional. 
22
23  are -- that are difficult.  But -- but your argument is, 
24  basically, reasonable or unreasonable is the same as

 There may well be cases at the margin that

that's true, and I think that the arguments that are

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I don't think it is, 
1
2  Mr. Chief Justice.  I think the -- the federalism values 
3  are important, but I do think, as the -- as the --
4
5
6  your argument that, oh, once you say you can draw a 
7  jurisdictional line here, people will argue you can draw 
8  it everywhere. 
9
10
11  being made by my friends on the other side demonstrate 
12  that.  But I guess what I would say, in this situation, 
13  in particular, is that -- that we're really not -- the 
14  fact that it does involve the Federal and State 
authorities doesn't change the analysis because, 
15
16  applying Chevron in the normal way, one would not 
17  conclude that Congress has spoken clearly and -- and 
18  restricted the agency's authority. 
19
apply a clear statement rule here because Congress, 
20
21  clearly, had the authority to impose the limitations 
22  that it imposed in Subsection (B).  And those are direct 
23  limitations on the State authority, and Congress made 
24  that judgment. 
25

 And there is no means -- there's no basis to 

It isn't the agency wading on -- in on its 

56
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 These are judgments that Congress made, and 

1  own to decide that State or local authorities should be 
2  subject to limitations. 
3
4  the agency is implementing them in very much the same 
way that the Court found it was appropriate for the 
5
6  agency to implement the preemptive scope of the word 
7  "interest" in the National Bank Act in the Smiley case. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Verrilli, why isn't it 
8
9  an easy answer to the whole case to read (7)(A), except 
as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter 
10
11 
shall limit or affect the authority of State or local 
government?  Okay?  "Except as provided in this 
12 
13 
paragraph." 
14
15
16  local government shall act on any request for 
17  authorization within a reasonable period of time." 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's why -- that's 
18
19  why -- that's our --
20
21 
22
23  right.  That limits it.  And -- and the question then 
24  is, of course, whether that's enforced in court --
25

enforced in court or before the agency; right? 

 And then later, in the paragraph, in the 

subsection entitled, "limitations," it says, "A State or

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I agree with 

Justice Scalia because -- because I do think that, no 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I think the question 
1
2  is whether the agency has the authority to flesh out the 
3  substantive standard that the court will subsequently 
4  apply --
5
6  whether the standard is defined in -- by -- through 
7  direct judicial review or by the agency, with deference 
8  to the agency.

8  running as fast as you can away from the arguments that

what, where -- you know, or how question and that we 
10

have to answer that. 
12
13  raises, I think, is a fair question, is how your 
14  argument, which says that we have to consider in each 
case as to each statutory provision whether an agency 
15
16  has interpretive authority is any different from IMLA's 
17  argument that we have to consider with -- in respect to 
18  every case whether we're dealing with a when, what, who, 
19  where question, or a how question.  It's the same

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, it is not.  This Court 
22  has said, time and again, including in Meade, that the

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Of course, there's a 


 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We are at loggerheads, 

1
2  case, and that is a distinct inquiry.  Once you decide 
3  that they have that delegated authority over that 
4  provision, then, as -- as this Court has done in every 
5
6
7  threshold question, but the threshold question has 

8  always been is the agency interpreting its organic 

9  statute and is -- does that statute give the agency 

rule-making authority and is that what the agency is 
10
11 
exercising? 
12
13  Justice Kagan.  I believe that Louisiana Public Service 
14  Commission and Adams Fruit are just simply contrary to 
that.  It also doesn't make any sense to believe that 
15
16  Congress gave the agency this 201(b) authority and then 
17  implicitly gave the agency the authority to decide how 
18  far 201(b) extends.  This is just a question-begging 
19  exercise.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is because I am only

4  asking the threshold question, did Congress give the

7
8  illustration, and that is there is an extended 
9  discussion of this question in the FCC's order.  It had 
no difficulty identifying that as a separate inquiry.  I 
10
11 
did want to just turn to the merits -- let me just say 
that the Solicitor General's argument about whether the 
12 
13 
201(b) authority extends to 332(c)(7) is a great 
illustration of our argument on the question presented 
14 
because that's a lawyer's argument.

16
17  about there was a technical question of communications 
18  law and how wireless siting facilities operate.  That's
