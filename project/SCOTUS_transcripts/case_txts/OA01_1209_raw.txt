JUSTICE STEVENS:  We'll now hear argument in our


first case, Number 1209, the Boeing Company against the


United States. 


Mr. Geller.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GELLER:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may


it please the Court:


The Internal Revenue Code generally requires


every corporation to pay an annual tax measured by its


entire net income, but Congress decided 30 years ago in


the DISC and FSC statutes that it wished to encourage


exports by giving favorable tax treatment to the portion 

of a company's net income that's attributable to export


sales.


In order to determine the extent of this income


tax benefit, it's obviously critically important to


determine precisely how much net income is generated by a


company's export sales in any particular year.


In enacting the DISC statute, Congress said


quite specifically how it expected this export net income


calculation to be made.  Gross revenues from export sales


were to be reduced only by those costs that were directly

and factually related to the export income.  Export sales


revenues were not to be burdened with unrelated expenses


which would distort the true amount of export income, and


thereby reduce the intended incentive. 


The DISC regulations, which were promulgated


shortly after the statute was passed, reiterate that there


must be a direct factual relationship between export sales


and expenses.


QUESTION:  Where do you -- do you get that


proposition in the statute, Mr. Geller?


MR. GELLER:  Justice Scalia, we get it out of


two separate statutory provisions.  One is section 994.


QUESTION:  Where are these to be found?


MR. GELLER:  These are -- this is found on


page 27a of the appendix to the petition. 

And specifically, the reference in 994(a) and


994(a)(2) to the requirement that a determination must be


made of the net income, quote, attributable to export


receipts.  We think that the common sense nature of the


word attributable, which this Court in the tax context has


construed to mean generated by, or caused by, is that you


have to take the export -- the revenues from exports and


reduce them only by the costs or deductions that are


related to those exports, or else you can't possibly come


up with a true figure of export -- net export income

that's attributable to those -- to those sales. 


QUESTION:  I -- I suppose that -- that R&D


expenses have to be attributed in a lot of other instances


under the code, don't they?  And -- and doesn't the


Government use this same procedure that it's been using


here in other -- in other areas where it has to


attribute -- where -- where R&D expense has to be


attributed?


MR. GELLER:  Yes.  It relies on a provision,


which we'll talk about in a few minutes, that has many,


many applications, and it may well be that in a number of


those other applications, it's perfectly valid.  Our


position is --


QUESTION:  Well, why is that?  I mean, why is


it attributable --


MR. GELLER:  Well, as I hope to --


QUESTION:  -- okay elsewhere to -- to produce


this result, but not okay here to produce this result? 


MR. GELLER:  Because it -- the DISC provisions


are unique in a number of respects, one of which is it


allows the taxpayer to engage in a particular grouping of


transactions, and the -- the -- as we'll talk about in a


few minutes, the R&D regulations insist that R&D be


attributed in a way that disregards the particular


groupings that the taxpayer has selected.

 But there's another statutory provision that I'd


like to call your attention to, Your Honor, and that's


section 861.  861 is a section of the code that has been


in the code, was in the code for more than 50 years at the


time the DISC statute was passed, and it provides for how


deductions are to be allocated to gross income.  This --


this appears at page 26a of the appendix. 


Now Congress, in passing the DISC statute, said


quite specifically that it wanted deductions under the


DISC statute to be allocated in a way generally in


accordance with the principles of section 861, which were


well-established at that time. 


QUESTION:  Where -- where did Congress say that?


MR. GELLER:  Congress said that in the reports


of the House, of the tax-writing committee. 

QUESTION:  Just for my benefit, when it's in the


statute, would you say Congress said it.  When it's in


legislative history, would you tell me who said it?


MR. GELLER:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Because when you say Congress said


it, I thought you mean it's in the statute.


MR. GELLER:  Well, it's not in the statute. 


It's in the reports of the tax-writing committees.  But,


Your Honor, these were not idle statements.  These were


not statements of individual Congressmen, or statements on

the floor.  These were deliberate statements put in the


reports of both the House and Senate tax-writing


committees which focused specifically -- specifically --


on how Congress expected these deductions to be allocated. 


And I would refer the Court to page --


QUESTION:  And I'm sure everybody who voted for


that knew about those statements. 


MR. GELLER:  Your Honor, these were specific


statements that went to the heart of the issue that's


before the Court today, and we've quoted them at page 22


of our brief, the blue brief.  Congress said that


these 861 rules --


QUESTION:  The committee said.  Please, please.


MR. GELLER:  The committee reports said --


excuse me, Justice Scalia. 


The committee reports said 

that -- that the 861 rules, which are important because


later the regulations themselves under DISC reference the


861 rules, so it's -- and that's the heart of the


Government's argument in this case, so it's important to


understand what people thought at the time these 861 rules


meant. 


QUESTION:  But -- but why does 861 get you out


of the general allocation provisions any more than 994


does?  In other words, the question was, why do we ignore


the usual rule for apportionment of R&D?  And you said,

well, because 994 is -- is specific and -- and has some


policies of its own.  And then you said -- and to further


that argument, you show us 861.


MR. GELLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But the regs that we're talking


about, which the Government relies on, are under 861.


MR. GELLER:  Yes, but the -- the regulation,


Justice Kennedy, that the Government relies on was added


to 861 after the DISC regulations were finalized.  It was


added in 1977.  The DISC statute was passed in 1971.  The


DISC regulations were finalized in 1975.  So our position


is it's important to understand what Congress in 1971


thought it was doing in the DISC statute, and therefore it


seems to us extremely important that it said that it


expected deductions, including presumably any deduction, 

including R&D, to be allocated in accordance generally


with the principles of section 861, which were described


quite clearly in the Senate and House reports of the


tax-writing committees to --


QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, there's one problem. 


Perhaps you can cast some light on it.  The word is


attributable that you pointed to in 994.  And the R&D you


have divided into Blue Sky and program- or product-


specific.


MR. GELLER:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  That -- that's Boeing's creation. 


The R&D -- that division is eminently manipulable, it


seems to me, if it -- it's the distinction whether it's


allocated across the board because of Blue Sky or


particular program or project depends on some official act


by a corporate board which could be yesterday, could be


next month.  It's in the control of the corporation.


MR. GELLER:  Not -- not quite, Justice Ginsburg. 


It's not manipulable.  It has to satisfy the regulations


promulgated under DISC.  The DISC regulations -- and here


I would refer the Court to page 33a of the appendix to the


petition, and specifically the grouping regulations --


provide that a taxpayer can only group -- can only group


transactions if they fall within a recognized industry


product line. 


So, in other words, you can't -- you can't 

allocate expenses to any sorts of transactions you want. 


They have to be grouped in a way that's consistent with


the DISC statute. 


And that's exactly what Boeing did here.  The


Blue Sky R&D was attributable to all of their airplane


products, and therefore it was allocated to the groupings


of all of the different airplane programs.  These


program-specific R&D -- and I don't think there's any


factual dispute about this.  The program-specific R&D was


factually and directly related only to a specific program.

The 747 R&D, for example, was -- was factually and


directly related only to the 747 program.  And that's why


Boeing allocated that R&D only to the 747 program. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, can I ask you a factual


question that will help me understand?  Does the -- is


there just one DISC involved here, or do you have several


DISCs for different product lines?


MR. GELLER:  No.  It's one -- it's one DISC.


QUESTION:  So that what difference would it make


whether it was the 747 program, or the 727 program if the


DISC sells them both anyway?


MR. GELLER:  Because, Justice Stevens, under the


statute, combined taxable income or export income is -- is


to be determined on the basis of product groupings, or at


least, the taxpayer has the option of choosing to group by 

different products rather than by all the sales of the


DISC.  So, therefore, here, we determine what the export


income is for the 747 program, which takes the revenues


from the 747 program and reduces them by the deductions,


including R&D that's factually and directly related to the


747 program, and you -- you come up with the CTI for the


747 program.  Under -- it's not all mixed together as one


group of export income.  Under -- under the statute and


regulations Boeing was entitled to group transactions.


The -- the problem here is that the regulation

that the Government relies on takes huge amounts of R&D


that are directly related to a specific program and


allocates them among all of the programs. 


QUESTION:  But, of course, the converse, I


suppose under your view, all of the R&D would go to the


domestic corporation because it all takes place before the


product is put on the market.


MR. GELLER:  No.  It doesn't really matter


whether the product is on the market or not, Your Honor. 


It has to be allocated to a class of gross income.  Now,


that class of gross income may well include, as it does in


this case, products or programs that aren't yet on the


market that are being developed.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. GELLER: 


And nonetheless, the regulations 

are quite clear that the deductions have to be allocated


to that class of gross income. 


So, for example, in the 757 program, which was


in -- which was being developed in 1982, there were no


sales of the 757 in 1982, and yet there were hundreds of


millions of dollars of R&D expended in that year.  In our


view, the regulations make it quite clear that Boeing had


to allocate those deductions, that R&D and other


deductions, to the 757 program. 


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what do you say to at

least this argument of the Government?  I -- I guess the


Government would probably say, sure, there's -- there's a


kind of factual sense in which there is the kind of


relationship that you're talking about.  But if you want


the closest relationship -- the most perfect


relationship -- you would capitalize your R&D and you


would start amortizing it when you actually have a product


that is generating income that you're selling.  That would


be the closest match you could get. 


That match, in effect, has -- has been -- has


been set aside.  Instead of forcing you to do that, the


law now allows you to -- to use your R&D as -- as a


current expense.


Once you start using it, once you start treating


it as a current expense, that very close relationship that 

you have, if you had capitalized it, is gone.  And what


the Government is saying is, it's a judgment call how


close it's got to be now, now that you have broken the


link and have allowed current expense.  And that kind of a


judgment call is quintessentially the judgment call that


the -- that the Treasury makes when it's write -- when it


writes regulations. 


And why isn't that a pretty powerful argument? 


And if it is, how do you get over the point of


reasonableness or -- or Chevron deference as the

Government would see it? 


MR. GELLER:  Well, Justice Souter, you've


described the Government's position.  Let me see if I can


respond to it. 


But generally, just -- as to the last point --


this is not a legislative regulation.  There really is no


Chevron deference that's in play here.


QUESTION:  Well, there's -- there's -- certainly


there is some degree of deference here. 


MR. GELLER:  There is some degree of


reasonableness.


QUESTION:  We can argue whether it's Chevron or


not.


QUESTION:  It was a notice and comment


regulation. 


MR. GELLER:  It was, but it was promulgated


under section 7805.  There's no specific provision in the


code that allows the Treasury to issue legislative regs


here, but I don't want to get off on that because it --


QUESTION:  But you -- if it's -- whether you


call it -- if you call it an interpretive regulation --


MR. GELLER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- it still deserves some respect


from a court --


MR. GELLER:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  -- does it not? 


MR. GELLER:  Yes, it does but it has to be


consistent, obviously, with the legislative scheme that


it's interpreting. 


Justice Souter, let me answer your question a


number of different ways. 


First, it is not at all unique for expenses to


give rise to future year income.  In fact, most expenses


give rise to future year income.  The fact that an expense


may occur in year 1, and the income may be generated in


year 2, is a commonplace.  It doesn't in any way --


QUESTION:  Sure they do. 


MR. GELLER:  It --


QUESTION:  But the most precise way to match it,


I -- I would suppose, is the capitalization way.  And the


Government says once you -- once you lose the


quintessentially perfect way of doing it, then how you're


going to recognize it is a judgment call. 


MR. GELLER:  Well, I don't accept -- they can't


capitalize it, Your Honor, because Congress made a


judgment in section 174 of the code in order to encourage


R&D to allow it to be immediately deducted in the year in


which it's incurred. 


QUESTION:  Absolutely.  And they say when


Congress made that judgment, there's a further judgment

left and that is the judgment how close has it got to be.


MR. GELLER:  Yes, but the Government's


regulation here is not close at all.  The Government


concedes that -- that expenses for R&D give rise to future


year income.  They can't -- because of section 174, they


can't --


QUESTION:  Well, sometimes -- sometimes they do


and sometimes they don't.  I mean, if things work out


fine, the answer is yes.  If they don't work out fine, the


answer is no.  And that's -- that's one of the -- that's


one of the problems that the Government raises. 


MR. GELLER:  Well, look at what the 8(e)(3)


regulation does, Your Honor.  It doesn't make any attempt


to match current year R&D expenses with some future income


that might be generated from that R&D.  What it, instead,


does, it allocates all of that income to current year


expenses -- to current year revenues for products that


have no relation whatsoever to that R&D. 


For example, let me say -- come back again to


the 757 program. 


QUESTION:  Well, here -- may -- may I interrupt


you with this question? 


MR. GELLER:  Sure. 


QUESTION:  You say it has no relation


whatsoever.  I take it then you are saying that the

Government is simply factually wrong when it makes the


statement that R&D, which may have a closer relation to


one product line than another, nonetheless tends, as a


general rule, to have benefits that go beyond product


lines.  We -- they -- they, in effect, say, look, you


learn useful things, and you use them all over the place.


Are you saying that that is factually wrong?


MR. GELLER:  Yes.  I'm saying that -- that --


I'm saying clearly in this case it's factually wrong.  For


example, this case went off on cross motions for summary


judgment.  There was really no dispute that Boeing had --


as a factual matter -- allocated the R&D expenses


correctly.  As a factual matter.  The Government said they


had to be reallocated because of this conclusive


presumption in section 8(e)(3).


But, yes, I'm telling you, Justice --


Justice Souter, that that's incorrect as a factual matter,


that in fact, under section 174, in order to take a


deduction for R&D at all in any circumstance, DISC or no


DISC, the taxpayer has to be able to factually relate that


R&D expense to a particular product.


QUESTION:  Oh, you've got to show the


relationship --


MR. GELLER:  Yes, factual relationship. 


QUESTION:  -- but it doesn't follow from that

that there is no benefit to product lines outside of that


relationship. 


MR. GELLER:  Yes, but if there -- there could


well be a spill-over benefit to future product lines, but


that doesn't, A, mean that it's not directly and factually


related a specific current program. 


And also, look at the oddity and anomaly of the


Government's position here, Justice Souter.  Even if it


is -- there is some spill-over effect for future product


lines, when the Government -- when the -- when Boeing was


developing the 757, it's conceivable that they were


learning things that would benefit future products.  But


what the Government does is take all that R&D and allocate


it to existing products, sales of existing products that


couldn't possibly have benefitted from that R&D. 

QUESTION:  That's so.  But could -- I'd like


very much to hear your response to Justice Kennedy's


question.  Was it -- and where we started was with Justice


Scalia and Justice Kennedy.  And as I understand where


they were driving, there is a statute, and the statute is


DISC.  And under this statute, there's either some


language, or there's some history anyway, which is of


interest to me, which says when you work out the


allocation rules, follow section 881 -- or 861. 


MR. GELLER:  861.

 QUESTION:  861, which is for allocation of all


kinds of things --


MR. GELLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- for Puerto Rico, to abroad,


et cetera. 


So now we look to 861. 


MR. GELLER:  But --


QUESTION:  And lo and behold, what they did in


861, after DISC was passed, is they changed the 861 rules,


and in those changed rules, it says you're going to


allocate everything to a SIC category called


transportation services.  And then it has a little


sentence here.  The taxpayer may not subdivide the


categories in this list. 


MR. GELLER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  All right?  So that's their 861 rule.


MR. GELLER:  That's -- that is the --


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, what legally is


wrong with that --


MR. GELLER:  What's legally --


QUESTION:  -- since Congress told them to use


861, and here they're using it. 


MR. GELLER:  Well -- well, there are a number of


things wrong with that, Justice Breyer.  The first is, as


you yourself pointed out.  At the time Congress made this

cross-reference, at the time the legislative history said


that the rules under 861 would be followed, and at the


time the regs were issued in 1975 that cross-referenced


861, this 8(e)(3) rule, which is an aberrational rule,


doesn't follow the general guidelines of the 861 rules. 


It was not even in the regulation. 


QUESTION:  That's right.  In respect to that,


for you to win on that, we'd have to say that Congress


intended that the rules be different for DISC's than for


Puerto Rico, for Europe, for Saudi Arabia --


MR. GELLER:  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  -- for everything.  Or we'd have to


say that we're throwing out this reg for everything.


MR. GELLER:  No, no, no.  The reg has many other


applications, and we're not suggesting that it be --

QUESTION:  So you're saying DISC has to be


different. 


MR. GELLER:  I'm saying DISC is different,


Justice Breyer. 


QUESTION:  Okay, what in --


MR. GELLER:  And let me explain, if I could --


QUESTION:  Yes.  That's what I wanted to --


MR. GELLER:  -- why DISC is different. 


QUESTION:  That's -- we are.  I -- all right.


MR. GELLER:  DISC is different because -- for

two reasons.  One is, DISC provides preferential tax


benefits to a -- to a subclass of net income, export net


income.  It is critically important to have an accurate


calculation of what the export net income is.  You cannot


have an accurate calculation of the net income from sales


of 747s if you're going to start with the gross revenues


from the sale of 747s, and then you're going to deduct


from it expenses that have no factual relationship to


747s.  You inevitably are going to be left with an


erroneous net income calculation. 


Now, I want to also add that this was focused on


in 1973 and 1975 when the Treasury was issuing its DISC


regulations.  In 1973, Treasury issued proposed


regulations under 861 that specifically said how R&D was


going to be -- was going to be allocated in the context of 

a DISC.  They gave an example, which is identical to the


example of this case.  It was an example involving a


manufacturer that manufactured four-, six-, and eight-


cylinder engines.  Each was grouped as a separate product


line, as it was entitled to be --


QUESTION:  I'll assume the example was


identical. 


MR. GELLER:  It is identical. 


QUESTION:  And I will take your words that you


have just said.

 MR. GELLER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And I will ask you why a different


person quoting those words couldn't make the identical


argument in respect to the tremendous tax advantages given


to Puerto Rico --


MR. GELLER:  Because --


QUESTION:  -- or in respect to the supreme


importance of having allocation between Europe and the


United States among subsidiaries --


MR. GELLER:  You'd have to look -- you'd have to


look --


QUESTION:  -- and principal corporations be


accurate. 


MR. GELLER:  You'd have to look at those


statutes. 


It may well be that 8(e)(3) couldn't be applied 

there at all if it would lead inevitably to an incorrect


calculation of -- of that net income. 


But there's something in addition here, Your


Honor.  Two things in addition.  First, Justice Breyer,


the 994 regulations do not incorporate verbatim all of


these 861 rules.  They don't incorporate 8(e)(3).  They


don't incorporate -- they say that the allocations to be


made under section 994 are to be done generally in


accordance with the rules under 861. 


At the time that that was put in the

regulations, the rules under 861 unequivocally provided


that there had to be, for every allocation, a direct


factual relationship between the expenditure --


QUESTION:  Yes, but that doesn't mean when --


you say in accordance with 861.  Does -- does that mean as


it now exists, or --


MR. GELLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- 861 as it may be amended from --


or, you know --


MR. GELLER:  I --


QUESTION:  -- as it may be interpreted from time


to time by -- by --


MR. GELLER:  Not -- not --


QUESTION:  -- by Treasury?


MR. GELLER: 


I believe, Justice Scalia, not if 

an aberrational -- not if a rule could be put in several


years later that's inconsistent with the rules that the


tax-writing committees and that the Treasury Department


assumed --


QUESTION:  But that --


MR. GELLER:  -- would be the 861 rules.


QUESTION:  That's a different argument.  That --


MR. GELLER:  That excepts --


QUESTION:  What I'm saying is it doesn't seem to


me, even if you believed in -- in legislative history, you

can't rely on the fact that they say it's going to be done


pursuant to 861.  The Government says, we are doing it


pursuant to 861.


MR. GELLER:  But not pursuant to the rules. 


This is -- if you look, in fact, at the 8(e)(3)


regulation, Justice Scalia, it begins by explaining why


it's deviating from the general rules of 861, why it felt


the need for R&D to deviate from the general rules that


require a factual connection between expenditures and


revenues. 


Now, there's another -- there's --


QUESTION:  If you -- if you want me to say that


a regulation drawn after a statute was enacted, another


statute, is -- is invalid because the intervening statute


is -- is applicable instead, what -- what case do I cite, 

or what rule?  Is -- is the rule just that the specific


controls over the general?  I mean, is that all we're


talking about? 


MR. GELLER:  It is.  It is certainly the


specific controls over the general.  It is also the fact


that there was a regime here that requires a -- accurate


calculation of export income.  The rules that were


promulgated in 1975 did that.  An aberrational rule was


put in in 1977 which we say is inconsistent with the


accurate calculation of net income and can't be applied,

at least in this context. 


But there's another reason, Justice Kennedy, why


the 1977 8(e)(3) regulation is inconsistent with DISC, and


that's the grouping regulations, which I want to call your


attention to, which is a very, very important part of the


DISC statute. 


If I could call the Court's attention to the


grouping regulations which appear at -- at 994(c)(7),


which is the bottom of page 33a of the appendix to the


petition, you will see that the -- the taxpayer was


entitled to group its products, to figure out export


income not in gross, but on the basis of each product or


recognized product line, which is what Boeing did here.


And if the Court would look at (6)(iv) in the


middle of page 33a, you'll see that the regulations 

provide that the taxpayer's choice as to how to group is


controlling -- controlling.  And the regulations go on to


say that costs deductible in a particular year shall be


allocated and apportioned to the classes of gross income


resulting from such grouping.


QUESTION:  Now -- now, perhaps you can help me


here because this is a complicated statute.  Is the


Government going to answer that, of -- of course, that


is -- is controlling, but that is only for the purpose of


one of the three -- of -- of one of the three choices that

it makes in -- and -- and it's made the choice to have the


combined income?


MR. GELLER:  Yes, that's the Government's


argument.  But it's completely inconsistent with the words


of the regulations, Justice Kennedy.  The regulations say


that all of the determinations under (c) have to be made


consistent with the grouping, including the allocation of


deductions.  So --


QUESTION:  And where -- where does it say that?


MR. GELLER:  It says it in the language that I


just read to you, that the -- all -- that the costs


deductible in a taxable year shall be allocated to the


items of gross income resulting from such grouping. 


So, here, Boeing grouped its -- its classes of


gross income --


QUESTION:  Where were you reading from,


Mr. Geller?  I'd like to follow. 


MR. GELLER:  Excuse me.  Yes. 


QUESTION:  What were you reading from?


MR. GELLER:  I'm reading -- I'm reading in the


middle of page 33, Justice Stevens, the (iv), the


paragraph --


QUESTION:  Oh, number iv, okay. 


MR. GELLER:  -- which talks about how costs are


to be allocated after the taxpayer has chosen particular

that we --

Department interpretation?  That's the sticking point for


me. 


MR. GELLER:  Well, Justice --


QUESTION:  We owe some kind of deference. 


MR. GELLER:  I appreciate that, Justice


O'Connor.  You don't defer, I think, for several reasons.


First, the language of the statute -- it's


critical to determine an accurate calculation of export


net income.  The 8(e)(3) regulation provides conclusive


presumptions in place of factual matching so that it


inevitably will lead to an incorrect -- and secondly, as I


said, the -- it was the understanding of everyone, 

including the Treasury Department when it issued the DISC


regulations in 1975, that the taxpayer's choice of


grouping would be controlling, that -- that allocations of


deductions, including R&D deductions, would be -- be made


on the -- on the basis of the taxpayer's grouping.  And


when 8(e)(3) comes in, it says, no, no, no.  For R&D --


QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, on that point doesn't the


word grouping, the last word in subparagraph (iv), refer


to the three choices in subparagraph (vi) of the -- on --


on page 32a?

 MR. GELLER:  No, no, no.  I think it refers to


the -- to the choices that are to be made in paragraph


(vii) at the bottom of page 33a, and the top of 34a.


The groupings are -- you can -- you can


determine CTI, Justice Stevens, either on the basis of


each individual transaction, which would be very, very


cumbersome.  Congress understood that and therefore


expected that there would be grouping.  The taxpayer is


entitled to choose two different ways to group its


transactions.  One is by recognized product line -- which


is what Boeing did here, the 747s, the 767s, the


recognized product lines -- or basis of SIC code.  Boeing


could have chosen to group its transactions by SIC code. 


It chose not to do that.


And nonetheless, the 8(e)(3) regulation comes in 

and insists that although all other deductions can be made


on the basis of the product groupings chosen by Boeing,


which the regulations say are to be controlling, this one


class of deductions, R&D, has to be allocated on the basis


of SIC code.  And that's completely inconsistent with the


statement in the middle of page 33a that we were talking


about that says that all of the deductions are to be


allocated on the basis of the taxpayer's grouping, and


that that grouping is, in the words of the regulation,


controlling.

transaction, we would apply our normal rule under 861.


MR. GELLER:  If you did a --

MR. GELLER:  I think the -- actually --


QUESTION:  Would that be correct if they did --


MR. GELLER:  No, no.  It would actually help our


argument.  If you did it transaction-by-transaction, you


took an individual sale of a 747 --


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. GELLER: 


-- airplane and you tried to figure 

out what the export net income was from that sale, it


seems to me you would start with the cost of the -- of the


revenues generated by the sale of that single airplane,


and then you would try to figure out what costs were


incurred in producing that airplane, including the R&D


costs.  You would never, I think, take costs that were


incurred that year in trying to develop a 787 airplane,


which had no relationship whatsoever to the sale of


that 747, and attribute those costs to it in order to


reduce the net income.  That's what the 8(e)(3) regulation

QUESTION:  Mr. Jones. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. JONES:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may


QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, before I lose the thread


of -- my thread of thought, is it correct what Mr. Geller


just said, that if it was done transaction-by-transaction,


you would not use the same -- the same allocation basis


that you're using here?


MR. JONES:  No. 


If it were done on a 

transactional basis, which is the -- the base case


provision under DISC, 861 regs would tell us how to


allocate costs to the income from that transaction.


And what -- I mean, really the -- the first


point of departure that Mr. Geller made from the statute


is that he suggests that only costs -- or that any -- the


costs must be factually related to an item of income to be


set off against it.  But that's not the statutory


standard.


QUESTION:  Well, this is kind of simplistic, but

it does seem that in -- in the 1970s, Congress wanted to


encourage exports, and to do that, they thought they


should make some income tax advantages for companies


producing products for export.  And that involved allowing


grouping of products and favorable income tax treatment


which, if you didn't have the -- the 861 regulations on


R&D, would allow the taxpayer to do what the petitioner is


arguing here. 


So, it seems to me the argument is that the 861-


regs are just so contrary to DISC that they shouldn't


govern and don't govern.  Is that the thrust of it?


MR. JONES:  Oh, clearly that's not the case. 


The 861 regs were -- were formulated for the purpose of


determining combined taxable income for DISCs and FSCs. 


That's what Congress -- that's what the committee said 

they wanted the Secretary to do under the DISC, and that's


what the 861 -- if you look at 861(f)(1)(iii), it says


that expressly.  So --


QUESTION:  But 861 applies generally, doesn't


it, not just to DISCs? 


MR. JONES:  It -- it applies generally, but it


was specifically formulated with the calculation of


combined taxable income for DISC in mind.  And so it's --


it's illogical to suggest, as -- as they do --


QUESTION:  The statute was, or the reg --

that both by the terms of the reg 861-8(f) --


QUESTION:  Well, how do we know that?


QUESTION:  Getting back to Justice Scalia's


question, and I think it relates to what Justice O'Connor


is asking too, is -- is your answer to the last argument,


that a transaction-by-transaction basis -- we would --


would clearly not have this problem -- is we clearly would


have this problem and we'd look at 861, and you'd lose


there too?  Or is that not your answer? 


MR. JONES:  Well, that's one way of making the


point, but let me -- let me address directly --

QUESTION:  No, no.  I want to know what your


position is.


MR. JONES:  Well, my position is they've totally


misdescribed the grouping provision of the DISC regs, and


once you understand it, you will appreciate that the 861-8


regs apply to all of these transactions.  And you can --


you can see that by looking at only two pieces of the DISC


regs. 


The DISC regs, at page 29a in the middle of the


page, says, grouping of transactions for purposes of

applying the pricing method is provided by (c)(7).  So,


you group to decide what your pricing method is, and if


they choose the -- the combined taxable income method,


which they've done here, then you go to (c)(6), which is

(c)(6) says here's how you determine combined


taxable income.  You take the income.  You deduct the


costs of goods sold, and then you allocate under


provisions of -- of section 861 regs.  And then the


provision that Mr. Geller cites says -- is the (iv)


provision, which says you that allocate the costs to the


items of income resulting from the group.  That's what the


grouping does.  It groups the income, and then against


that income, we apply the costs allocated under the


section 861-8 regs.  It is --


QUESTION:  Where is -- where that's last


language I'm looking for?  It's on --


MR. JONES:  It's 33 of the petition appendix.


QUESTION:  33a, yes. 


MR. JONES:  It's the last phrase of the -- of


the item (iv), and it says that we allocate costs to the


income resulting from the grouping.  Now, that's what the


grouping is all about.  They're allowed to pick out a


series of transactions, group the income, calculate the


CTI for the group, so they don't have to file a separate

report for a thousand different transactions.  That's all


that the grouping is about.


Now, that's been the Secretary's interpretation


of his own regulations for 25 years.  And of course, under


this Court's precedents, his interpretation of his own


regulations is entitled to controlling weight unless it's


inconsistent with the provisions of the text of the regs. 


And as the Tax Court explained in the St. Jude case, and


as I have just described, the text of the reg says you


allocate under 861 to the income resulting from the


grouping.


QUESTION:  All right, that's fine.  But he says


that -- and what you're supposed to do is you're supposed


to, I guess, subtract the costs which are allocated to the


items of gross income in that group. 


Is that what you're 

supposed to do?  You take the gross receipts in that


group --


group --


MR. JONES:  You take the gross receipts for that


QUESTION:  -- and you subtract the costs. 


MR. JONES:  -- and then you allocate costs --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. JONES:  -- under 861. 


QUESTION:  Right.  Now, you allocate them


under 861.

 MR. JONES:  Right.


QUESTION:  So we go to 861 --


MR. JONES:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- and he says, now, if you look at


861, and try to allocate according to 861 to the group


that they've picked out, it's seriously nuts, basically.


I mean, imagine that you had a farmer and the


farmer raised roses, and he had some fishes, and -- and


what he has is he does research on fish diseases.  And he


says -- you'd say, well, my goodness, you're going to


allocate his whole laboratory costs which does nothing but


fish diseases to the growing of roses because both are


farming or fisheries.


Now, is it -- something like that is really out


of whack, it makes so little sense that that isn't a 

reasonable method of allocation under anybody's theory.


MR. JONES:  That's -- that's a fair synopsis of


their position, and -- and the defects in it --


QUESTION:  Right.


QUESTION:  So why is it reasonable to allocate


the fish disease research to rose culture? 


MR. JONES:  Well, let me start with what the


Secretary was supposed to do in the regs, and get to you


the answer to your question. 


The -- the statute on which the regs are adopted

doesn't just say you allocate the costs that are


definitely related to the product in determining what


costs would be charged against it.  It also says you


allocate to it a share of costs that cannot definitely be


allocated to any particular item of income. 


Now, when the conundrum for research costs --


and the reason that we have a separate regulation for it


is that there's more than one way that research costs are


treated under the code.  When research costs are


capitalized and amortized over their useful life, they're


then properly attributed -- as this Court said in


INDOPCO -- to the revenues as they're received.  But when


the taxpayer makes the election that section 174 gives it


to take a current deduction, it severs any relationship


between the costs and the income. 


There is a mismatching, 

as we say.  There is no proper connection between the


costs and the income. 


Now, the reason that we need to -- the -- the --


in that case where there is no definite relationship


between the costs and the income, the default principle of


the statute is that the costs are to be allocated over all


income of the taxpayer, not just the income from any


specific product, but the income from --


QUESTION:  He'll grant you all that.  He grants


that.

 MR. JONES:  No --


QUESTION:  But he says, you know, sometimes it


is clear.  For example, it is clear that roses don't get


fish diseases, and similarly, he says, it is equally clear


that -- I don't know the factual details, but he says it's


equally clear that a 727 research is not as vague as a --


is -- is different from a 757.  Just the same -- roses and


fish diseases.  And he says where it's that clear, it's


not reasonable for the Treasury to try to pretend that


it's vague or hard to allocate, et cetera.


MR. JONES:  The -- a reason why the regulation


is reasonable is because if, as I have just said, the


statutory default cases -- you can apply it against all


income.  What the Secretary has said is, well, I'm not


going to make you apply it against all income.  I'm going


to make you apply it only against a subcategory of income,


in this case, the income associated with sales of a


product from which foreign sales income might be derived.


QUESTION:  Yes, but you use this link -- this


severance argument, and you say, oh, well, once you do


this, you sever the expense from the future income. 


I would have thought -- please correct me if I'm wrong --


that all expenses are -- are severed in the sense that all


expenses can be used for future income.


MR. JONES:  No.  That's a -- that's a fallacy

in -- in the suggestion of Mr. Geller that mismatching


occurs all the time.  It's very rare for mismatching to be


tolerated.  For example, if a taxpayer spends $10 building


a widget in year 1, and sells the widget in year 2, the


$10 he spent in year 1 isn't mismatched.  It's put in the


inventory costs.  It's charged as a component of the costs


of goods sold in year 2, when the item is sold.  The code


is -- and the Secretary is very thorough about routinely


requiring matching of expenses. 


This is an exceptional situation created by the


Congress allowing the current deduction, but as Justice


Souter pointed out, allowing the current deduction for


research doesn't mean that that's -- that Congress decided


it was definitely related when it was taken.  It clearly


isn't definitely related. 


And so my -- my point was that if it would have


been reasonable for the Secretary to just do what the


statute says, which is we'll apply it against all income,


it's more reasonable, the Secretary decided, to apply it


against a smaller category.  And then -- and then 5 or 7


years later, the Secretary decided it was even more


reasonable to -- to apply it against a somewhat narrower


category, and we got down to SIC code 3.


Well, these are all alternatives, each of which


is reasonable.  They're more reasonable than the statutory

default case, the Secretary decided. 


QUESTION:  Under code 3, would there be any


difference?  It was still transportation equipment as a


category. 


MR. JONES:  For Boeing, we can go all the way to


SIC code category 4, which is planes and parts.  I mean,


this -- this issue is sort of abstract in this case


because whatever, you know, objective test the Secretary


had used, it would result in the same in -- in this case.


QUESTION:  Where does the statute say you could


just apply it across the board?  By -- the statute in 994


that I have just refers to 50 percent of the combined


taxable income, and that doesn't define --


MR. JONES:  I'm talking about section 861, which


is at page 26a of the petition appendix. 

QUESTION:  26a, yes.


MR. JONES:  And subpart -- part (b) in the


middle says that you allocate a ratable part.  It says


par, but I think that's ratable part of expenses which


cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of


gross income.  So you -- and you -- you would under the


default case make that allocation across all items of


income. 


QUESTION:  Well, his argument is that it can --


that -- that the research on fish can definitely be

allocated to fish. 


MR. JONES:  If -- if it's currently deducted, it


cannot be definitely allocated to an item of income.  You


see, petitioner just takes two words out of the statute


and changes them.  The statute says you allocate costs


that cannot be definitely allocated to an item of income. 


And he says, well, we allocate costs that are factually


related to a product.  Well, that's not what the statute


either says, or is about.  We allocate costs to income not


to products.


Now, the --


QUESTION:  It says item or class of gross

QUESTION: 


What is -- what is class of gross 

income.


income?


MR. JONES:  Well, for example, if they group


products, they -- they group all the sales of Boeing 707s. 


Then you allocate the costs to that group based on the


costs that can be directly allocated.


QUESTION:  For that year.


MR. JONES:  -- and they share --


QUESTION:  You're saying it has to be that year.


MR. JONES:  Yes, and a share of the costs that


cannot be directly allocated to an item -- to any item of

income.


Now, this -- the reasonableness of this -- of


the Secretary's approach is especially clear in light of


the alternatives that he faced.  If he had adopted the --


the position that petitioner prefers, the result would be


that petitioner would claim an expense against a product


that was going to be built and sold some other time, and


never charge that expense against that product when it's


sold. 


Now, the obvious and unimpeachable result of


that is they overstate their foreign sales income.  And in


this case, they do it by $2 billion over the period that's


at stake.  They overstate their foreign source income,


which has the direct consequence of overstating the -- the


DISC and FSC benefits that they calculate based on that 

amount of combined taxable income.


QUESTION:  But isn't it true, just going back to


Justice O'Connor's thought, that -- that the


consequence -- the Government's position is that all


research and development cost gets allocated to the DISC


when you're in a business like they are?


MR. JONES:  I think that's -- I don't understand


the factual context of that statement, but the -- the


answer is all research costs, like every other type of


cost gets charged against the income -- against foreign

sales income to the extent that --


QUESTION:  Proportionately.


MR. JONES:  Proportionally, yes, thank you. 


Pro rata if it's not current -- you know, if it's


currently claimed and not capitalized and amortized.


If it's capitalized and amortized -- I should


just point out because it's -- it is a factual point that


is worth knowing.  If it's capitalized and amortized, then


the costs are recovered as part of the cost of goods


sold --


QUESTION:  No.  I -- I understand the


distinction between capitalizing it and -- and taking it


in the current year.  But it seems to me that -- that


the -- the net result of the Government's approach is


that -- that all of the -- all of the research and 

development expense of the company would be attributable


to the DISC.


MR. JONES:  It would just be attributable to


the -- to -- well, I mean --


QUESTION:  If -- if the DISC is 25 percent of


its sales --


MR. JONES:  If all --


QUESTION:  -- 25 percent of its R&D --


MR. JONES:  Correct.  If all the sales were DISC


sales, then -- then you would be right.  But if -- if some

portion of the sales were domestic, which is certainly the


case with Boeing, then that portion would be allocated to


that portion of the income.  I mean, this pro rata


allocation that I've been talking about, that what you're


allocating between is the sales that the DISC makes and


the sales that the DISC doesn't make.


QUESTION:  What are the -- just out of


curiosity, what are the rough proportions of -- of


overseas and domestic sales? 


MR. JONES:  I believe the record says something


like two-thirds of Boeing's sales during this whole


10-year period were overseas and, therefore, I assume,


made through the DISC. 


QUESTION:  But just as a housekeeping matter, if


Boeing were to prevail here, would it still be open for 

the Government to say, well, all right, you can allocate


along your product lines, but the Blue Sky portion still


has to be greatly increased? 


MR. JONES:  You mean, would it be open at this


stage --


QUESTION:  I think I've got the right color. 


The Red Sky and the Blue Sky.  The Blue Sky is the


general.  Correct? 


MR. JONES:  Yes.  At this stage of --

If -- if the -- if Boeing prevails, can you still go back


and say, okay, you get the product line, but you've got to


add another 20, 30 percent to the Blue Sky?


MR. JONES:  I hate to make a concession that I'm


not 100 percent certain -- certain about, but --


especially since, you know, it -- it could be of


importance.  I do not believe that issue is open, but


it -- but if it were, I would reserve our right to address


that.  But I don't -- I don't know exactly how it would be


open.


QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, I thought -- maybe I'm


confused, but I thought the Government's position was Blue


Sky, product-specific -- this is R&D and we treat R&D a


certain way and we don't buy into that line, which is set


by the company.


MR. JONES:  Oh, I agree completely, but -- but I


understood Justice Kennedy to be saying that if the Court


adopted Boeing's approach, would there then be a factual


question about what part -- whether the Blue Sky amount


was accurately described in the record.  And I just don't


know for certain.  My assumption is that that's not still


open. 


QUESTION:  Is -- is it open as to -- suppose


the -- you were to say the following.  Where a taxpayer


can show that a particular R&D expense can be definitely

allocated to some item or class of gross income, other


than the DISC class in this situation or whatever, where


they can show that, then the commissioner cannot require


them to allocate it to a different item.


MR. JONES:  Well, it -- I --


QUESTION:  That would be just taking the words


of the statute.  Now, suppose you said that. 


MR. JONES:  It sounds -- it sounds like you


correctly described the statute, and let me point out that


if they, for example, did their fish research or whatever


it was --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. JONES:  -- and they capitalized and


amortized it to the -- to the appropriate products and


charged it, then -- then they would be entitled to --

you could.  And why aren't they in that category?


MR. JONES:  First, it only -- that only applies


if they're deducted under 174.  So -- so we've narrowed


the issue that much.  And when they're deducted under 174,


as I've said, there were a series of reasonable


alternatives facing the Secretary based from the statutory


default case that you allocated across all income. 


Now, the reason I keep stressing that point is


because this Court's decisions are very clear that the


Court, especially in the context of Treasury regulations,


doesn't sit here to decide the wisdom of the particular


rule chosen.  It only -- in the words of Correll -- looks


to see whether some reasonable method was applied, not


whether this was the best one, or the most logical --


QUESTION: 


Yes, but it seems to me that what 

you're doing is -- is quarreling with the decision


Congress made under 174.  Congress said R&D is inherently


something that ought to be capitalized, but we think it's


so important, it's going to be expensed.  And you keep


saying that, well, you know, really it can't be expensed. 


We're going to, in effect, make them capitalize it anyway. 


That -- that's --


MR. JONES:  No.  We're -- we're not making them


capitalize it.  I mean, I would cite, really, my


explanation of that as Justice Souter's question earlier,

that -- which is that the -- the decision to allow this


current deduction is effective in determining taxable


income for domestic purposes.  We don't dispute that


there's a deduction, but I'll point out 861 -- the mere


fact there's a deduction doesn't tell you how to allocate


it.  And the -- 861 says that if the deduction is not


definitely related to some item of income, then you charge


it against all the items of income.


QUESTION:  Can -- can I come back to the Blue


Sky expenses?  A question that was asked earlier caused me


to question my understanding of the case. 


As I understand it, Boeing is willing to accept


a ratable portion of the Blue -- Blue Sky expenses in its


DISC.  Right? 


MR. JONES:  Yes. 


They actually want to --

QUESTION:  Just a -- what it -- what it's


objecting to is -- is those expenses that -- you know,


that -- that go to fish research, those expenses that are


identifiable to a particular category.


MR. JONES:  Just to elaborate, that go to fish


research that that -- that were deducted currently rather


than amortized over the proper future income.  That's --


that's what this case is really all about is this


peculiarity --


QUESTION:  But that's the whole scheme that

Congress passed in the '70s to try to encourage exports. 


So it just -- the interpretation of 861 in the regs seems


to go somewhat contrary to the overall purpose of the


scheme for DISCs. 


MR. JONES:  Several -- several courts have


correctly said that the purpose of the -- of the combined


taxable income calculation is to serve as a limit on the


DISC and FSC benefits.  Congress didn't intend unlimited


benefits.  They didn't intend to allow benefits of the


type that Boeing is seeking where they inflate their


foreign source income by not -- not putting the costs


against that income in calculating it. 


And so, the answer to your question is no.  The


Secretary's rule is designed to accomplish the correct, in


the Secretary's view, determination of combined taxable 

income for this very purpose. 


Now, it -- I think that -- that the issue


that -- that may actually be the one the Court wants to


consider first is that in 1984, when Congress enacted the


FSC provision, it -- it in our view ratified and adopted


the very cost -- research cost allocation regulation that


we have in this case.  In -- in the Deficit Reduction Act


of 1984, there are two provisions that relate to this


case.  Congress adopted -- enacted the FSC which, of


course, is based on the provisions of the DISC, and -- and

it also contains the combined taxable income method of


limiting the -- the benefit.  And -- and at the same time


that they adopted the FSC, they enacted a provision that


took one piece of this regulation out and suspended it. 


That's the piece called geographic sourcing.  That, for


purposes of citation, is 1.861-8(e)(3)(ii). 


This case is about 1.861-8(e)(3)(i), which is


the rule that calculates combined taxable income.  And


when Congress took out -- said we're going to suspend this


geographic sourcing rule in this regulation, they said,


we're not suspending this regulation for application in


calculating combined taxable income for DISCs and FSCs.


Well, under this Court's decision in


Lorillard v. Pons, that is a ratification and adoption of


the regulation. 


The Court made the point in Lorillard 

that when a --


QUESTION:  Can I -- Mr. Jones, can I go back for


just a second -- and be sure I understand something


right -- to the fish/roses hypothetical?  Am I correct in


assuming that the fishes -- the research on the fishes


would be charged to the DISC only if fishes and roses were


in the same SIC grouping?


MR. JONES:  Under any scenario, that's correct.


QUESTION:  Oh.  So if they're in a different


grouping, then the rose farmer wouldn't have to pay for

the fish research. 


MR. JONES:  That's correct.  I was assuming you


carefully constructed your question. 


QUESTION:  But the -- but the grouping can be as


broad as -- as transportation equipment. 


MR. JONES:  It can be quite broad.


QUESTION:  That's a pretty broad group.


MR. JONES:  It can be quite broad.  But the


point is that it's not --


QUESTION:  And it includes, by the way,


agriculture, forestry, and fisheries.  That's one


category. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. JONES:  It's not -- it's -- the point is


it's not as broad as the statutory default rule.  The


statutory default rule is by definition reasonable, and


the -- the narrower rule that the -- that the --


QUESTION:  You've lost me.  The statutory


default rule --


MR. JONES:  Is that you apply these costs


against all items of income because they're not definitely


related to an item of income.  That's the statutory


default principle. 


QUESTION:  Where is that?


MR. JONES:  That's in 861(b) at page 26a of the

petition appendix.  It says that --


QUESTION:  Got you. 


MR. JONES:  Okay.


Now, on the ratification point, Lorillard v.


Pons makes the point that when Congress enacts a statute


that's based upon a -- a prior -- the provisions of a


prior act, it is assumed to have adopted the -- the


administrative interpretation.  Now, that's not a -- by


itself an overpowering presumption, but what Lorillard


pointed out was that when Congress, in doing that, looks


at the agency's interpretation and excised a portion of


it, the inference that it approved the remaining part is


very strong.


Now, here, it's strong not only because of that


inference, but because Congress said -- I'm sorry -- the 

committee that made this amendment said that they --


although they were excising this part about geographic


sourcing, that the part about combined taxable income


calculations for DISCs and FSCs would remain in effect.


Now, petitioner says, but 2 years later Congress


did something that somehow negates at that ratification. 


Well, of course, the sub -- Congress can't change the law


as ratified, but that's not what happened in '86 in any


event.  What happened in '86 was that the -- the committee


what was -- that was removing the suspension of the -- on

the geographic sourcing rule said that we're not saying


whether the regulation is valid or not.  Well, the


regulation that they were talking about was the geographic


sourcing rule.  Petitioner says, well, they were talking


about the whole rule.  No.  They were talking about the


geographic sourcing rule as we know from the last part of


that same report which says that nothing in this act has


anything to do with the use of these -- of the -- of the


research cost allocation regulations for calculating


CTI -- combined taxable income -- for DISC and FSC


purposes.


QUESTION:  Correct me if I'm wrong.  In the


court of appeals opinion -- and it's the paragraph at


12(a).  I think you'll be familiar with this one, where


the court of appeals said, the more narrowly a taxpayer 

chooses to define incomes, the more costs become


indirectly or indefinitely related.  Can I be excused from


trying to understand that, or --


(Laughter.) 


MR. JONES:  Well, I can try to help, but I'm --


I can't promise results.  It -- it looked to me like what


they had in mind was the thought that this -- that a


taxpayer who says my research only relates to wing nuts


on -- on this plane is -- is defining it so narrowly that


it's not realistic.  And -- and indeed, the record of this

case reflects that -- that research on one type of plane


has applications on other types of planes.  And -- and I


think what the court was addressing there was his view


that -- that this was an appropriate accommodation.  This


was one of the choices that the Secretary had.  It was a


reasonable choice. 


QUESTION:  It really was restating the problem


rather than offering a specific solution.


MR. JONES:  I think it was restating the problem


in a way that indicated it felt that the Secretary's


choice was a reasonable one. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, can you tell us this


continuing significance of this arrangement?  I -- we're


now past the successor of the FSC.  Is that true?


MR. JONES:  Yes. 


The FSC is no longer with us. 

It was replaced by the extraterritorial income


provisions -- maybe in '98.  I'm not sure. 


QUESTION:  What about the two-digit SIC?  Is


that still with --


MR. JONES:  Two-digit is -- it was replaced by


the -- the narrower three-digit band in '94, I believe.


QUESTION:  So if we thought the two-digit was a


little bit going too far, would that throw open all kinds


of claims on the -- on the -- from all kinds of people? 


MR. JONES:  Well, I mean, again, if the Court

wanted -- felt it needed to look at the two-digit versus


three-digit, although to me they're just, you know,


spectrums along the --


QUESTION:  The degree of specificity -- well, at


least three-digit would separate the roses from the fish.


MR. JONES:  This case really doesn't present the


question --

way to SIC 4.  And so if the standard is are the products


reasonably related, which -- which is --


QUESTION:  So we don't have to consider it.  All


we'd have to --


MR. JONES: 


I don't think you have to consider 

it, but if you did, I think you would do it in the context


of realizing these are reasonable alternatives, and that


the Secretary didn't have to pick the best one.  He just


had to pick one of them.  And I -- if you thought that


none of these were reasonable, then -- then, you know, it


wouldn't matter which one he picked.


QUESTION:  At some point they certainly --


MR. JONES:  If there are no further questions,


thank you.

 Mr. Geller, you have a little over 2 minutes


left. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GELLER:  So much to say. 


Justice Kennedy, I think you put your heart on


the -- on the Government's -- the -- the problem with the


Government's position here.  It's simply an unwillingness


to accept the fact that Congress created a number of


incentives here that were not designed simply to raise


revenue.  They had other purposes such as the export --


the -- the beneficial treatment of export income and also


the immediate deductibility of -- of R&D. 


Now, the Government tries to defend this


regulation here on the -- on the basis that there's this 

temporal mismatch and it's all the result of not


capitalizing.  I should say a number of things about that.


First, this was not the basis for the regulation


at the time the regulation was issued.  It was not the


basis for defending this regulation in the lower courts. 


And it -- and the Government's position is not even


consistent with that regulation because if the whole


problem here is the lack of a temporal mismatch, you would


think that if you had a class of gross income in which in


a particular year there was both revenues and R&D

expenses, well, in that situation there's no temporal


mismatch.  They would at least allow you to allocate those


R&D expenses to that revenue in that year.  No.  Even if


there's revenue in a class of gross income in a particular


year, they still insist that those R&D expenses be spread


across all of the income in that SIC code.


Now, I want to mention St. Jude, because in this


case we're dealing with airplanes and airplanes, and while


the -- the costs are specifically allocated only to


particular programs, it gets a little more complicated.


But look at St. Jude.  In St. Jude, you had a


manufacturer who was exporting artificial heart valves. 


That's all it was doing, is manufacturing and exporting


artificial heart valves.  In the same year, it was


engaging in R&D for insulin pumps, and for pacemakers. 

The Government insisted that the export income from the


sale of those heart valves be reduced, and that the DISC


benefit be reduced because of the R&D spent on these other


products that obviously had no basis or relevance to the


sale of the heart valve simply because they were all


within the broad -- same broad SIC code.


And I should say, Justice Kennedy, the Ninth


Circuit's opinion I think is somewhat unintelligible. 


The -- the part that you -- you referred to, we all


stumbled over because it makes no sense.  The more


56 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

narrowly -- the more narrowly you define your classes of


gross income, the more that -- that costs will be directly


allocated to more than one class of income.  It's not a


question of anything being indirectly allocated. 


And there's no default rule at issue here either


because all of our costs are directly allocable to


specific programs.  That's all we ask that we be allowed


to do. 


We ask that the judgment in the Ninth Circuit be


reversed.  Thank you. 


JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Geller.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
