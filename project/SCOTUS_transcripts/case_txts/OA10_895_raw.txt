Ms. Millett. 

 MS. MILLETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

The court of appeals in this case had 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 (11:00 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal, but in doing so, 
it decided the case wrongly.

8
9  please the Court: 
10
11 
12 
13
 Mr. Gonzalez's petition for habeas corpus 
14  was timely because it was filed within a year of the 
conclusion of direct appellate proceedings in the State 
15
16  court and at the -- within a year of that court's ending 
17  of his appeal process. 
18
19  existed because a certificate of appealability was 
20
21  denial of a constitutional right. 
22
23  certificate did not identify the substantial 
24  constitutional question required by 2253(c)(3).  That is 
25

issued.  It rested upon a substantial showing of the 

 With respect to jurisdiction, jurisdiction 

 To be sure, the judge in issuing that 

a requirement.  It is mandatory, but it is not

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if he had 


different constitutional issue, a Fourth Amendment 

1  jurisdictional. 

2
3  identified a constitutional issue, speedy trial issue? 

4  Does that give the court the authority to consider a 

5
6  issue? 
7
8  a gatekeeping function to identify which case, which 
9  appeals should go forward and claim the attention of the 
court.  But the text of the statute and 22 -- that's on 
10
11 
page -- excuse me -- page 3a of the appendix to the blue 
brief.  It provides that an appeal may not go forward, 
12 
13 
and if a certificate is issued, appeals may go forward. 
The operative language here in (c)(1) is that this is 
14 
about an appeal going forward. 
15
16
 So, once the certificate identifies issues, 
17  the appeal goes forward.  It's much like 1292(b), where 
18  certification of questions comes to an appellate court, 
19  and they decide whether to take interlocutory review. 
20
21  The entire order comes up for review. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, what if it 
22
23  identifies something that is not remotely a Federal 
24  constitutional issue?  By the terms of the COA, it's 
25

Once they do, they're not bound to just those questions. 

 MS. MILLETT:  Yes, it does.  Once -- this is 

quite clear, you know, whether it is a State law issue or

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do you decide whether 

 Does that still work for you? 
 MS. MILLETT:  It -- it works in the sense 

that it's not a jurisdictional bar to going forward.  It 

it's a jurisdictional bar?  You acknowledge that the 
issuance by a judge of a certificate of appealability is 
a jurisdictional step; right? 

1  something else.  There's no constitutional plausibility 
2  on the face of it. 
3
4
5
6  is a violation of (c)(3).  If timely raised by the 
7  State, then it can either be dismissed or revisited by 
8  the original judge.  An appeal from the authorizing 
9  judge --

18  Miller-El --

20
21  appealability "shall indicate which specific issue or 
22  issues satisfy the showing required," whether that 
23  provision is a requirement for the validity of the 
24  certificate of appealability.  If it is, then there's no 
25

 MS. MILLETT:  This Court so held --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is jurisdictional.  If 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So -- so, the issue 

is whether (c)(3), which says the certificate of 

he doesn't do that, there's no jurisdiction. 

 MS. MILLETT:  Because this Court held in 

jurisdiction, because the certificate of appealability

 MS. MILLETT:  Well, I don't --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that right? 
 MS. MILLETT:  I don't agree that the 

so-called content validity of a document that is post 

1  is invalid. 
2
3
4
5
6  hoc certifying a gatekeeping requirement is itself 
7  jurisdictional, because there is a --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, let's take the Fourth 
8
9  Amendment, I mean, which says, "no warrants shall issue, 
but upon probable cause."  Okay?  So -- but then it goes 
10
11 
on, "supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly 
describing the place to be searched and the persons or 
12 
13 
things to be seized."  Is the warrant valid if indeed it 
does not meet those requirements of being supported by 
14 
oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the --
15
16
 MS. MILLETT:  No, a warrant may well not be 
17  valid if it doesn't --
18
19  just be invalid. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

appealability is invalid as matter of law here.  It's an 
incorrect -- it's an incorrect action by the court. 
That doesn't make it jurisdictional.  It's just --
warrants aren't jurisdictional, either, in that sense. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It won't be valid.  It will 

MS. MILLETT:  But the certificate of 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just to take a kind of nutty 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

is when something happens --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, what counts as a 

1  example, Ms. Millett, suppose that a judge took a blank 
2  piece of paper and typed the words "certificate of 
3  appealability" on top and issued it.  Still jurisdiction 
4  to take the appeal? 
MS. MILLETT:  Still jurisdiction to take the 
5
6  appeal.  Of course, one would expect -- one would expect 
7  either the court of appeals judges or the State, 
8  which -- both of which have every incentive to check on 
9  these things, to raise the issue.  But the question 
10
11
12  certificate of appealability is I guess the question. 
13  All you need is those three words, and then you have a 
14  certificate of appealability --
15
16
17  attaches? 
18
19  mean, it's not issued by the clerk's office, right?  The 
20
21  circuit judge or justice -- circuit justice -- to issue 
22  this.  And these are -- these are officials who are 
23  sworn to uphold the law and the Constitution.  And when 
24  they do this, when they make these determinations, they 
25

MS. MILLETT:  Well, I think it --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- such that jurisdiction 

statute requires a judge to do this, a Federal judge, 

 MS. MILLETT:  No, there's more to it.  I 

aren't handing these out like candy; they're deciding 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 So, the fact that a certificate is issued is 

fair to presume that it is a deliberate determination by 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, under Justice --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Millett, suppose, 

(2), and (3), Congress had written (c) as just one 
paragraph that says:  You must have a certificate of 
appealability, and this is what the certificate must 
contain.  No division into (2) and (3).  Would you still 
maintain that only the first sentence of the paragraph 
is jurisdictional and the rest is not? 

1  that their court, their colleagues, maybe themselves, 
2  should invest resources in this process. 
3
4  not simply a piece of paper coming out.  I think it is 
5
6  a judicial officer. 
7
8
9  instead of having the statute broken down into (c)(1), 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 MS. MILLETT:  Well, my position would be 
17  harder for precisely the reason you phrased.  And as 
18  Justice Scalia was asking, how do we tell?  These are --
19  these are jobs of statutory construction, and the fact 
20
21  out by itself, and there's a noticeable turn in the 
22  language by the time you get to (c)(3) -- (c)(1) says 
23  "no appeal shall be taken."  That sounds jurisdictional. 
24  (c)(3) says a document "shall indicate" issues after the 
25

that Congress broke these two steps out and broke (c)(3) 

fact. 

8

 The important thing to understand here is 

 Is there jurisdiction to consider 2 through 

before we decide that something is jurisdictional.  And 

circuit judge says, I'm granting it on issue 1, I'm 
denying it on issue 2 through 9 -- 2 through 10. 

1
2  that you not only have the language shifting materially, 
3  but your starting presumption, the starting presumption 
4  here, is that we need a clear direction from Congress 
5
6  this Court has faced language far more emphatic than 
7  (c)(3).  For example, in Reed --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose the Petitioner asks 
8
9  for a certificate of appealability on 10 issues, and the 
10
11 
12
13  10? 
14
15
16  court.  They could also determine not to.  And I say 
17  that, again, because the language talks --
18
19  if the State moves to dismiss the arguments that are 
20
21  would the panel be obligated to do that? 
22
23  be obligated to, because what (c)(1) says is this 
24  determines when an appeal comes forward, the whole 
25

 MS. MILLETT:  There is jurisdiction to 

consider.  It's obviously within the discretion of the 

made by Petitioner on issues 2 through 10, would the --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, in that situation then, 

 MS. MILLETT:  No, it wouldn't.  It would not 

appeal comes forward. 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It could do that without 

incorrect, that jurists of reason could disagree on 

appealability or adjusting its own decision in the 
course of its ruling, explain that we've decided to 
reach these is not, I don't think, of jurisdictional 
significance, which way they --

1
2  issuing a new -- without issuing a certificate of 
3  appealability, without saying we think that the judge 
4  who issued the certificate of appealability was 
5
6  issues 2 through 10? 
7
 MS. MILLETT:  Well, I think -- I think 
8  whether you have -- the panel would then have to do 
9  the paperwork of doing a new certificate of 
10
11 
12 
13 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Millett --
14
MS. MILLETT:  I'm sorry. 
15
16
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it seems to me you beg 
17  the question when you say that the issue is whether the 
18  appeal will go forward.  That's precisely what -- what 
19  the issue is here, whether it is that the appeal will go 
forward or whether an appeal on an identified issue will 
20
21  go forward.  That's exactly what we're talking about. 
22
23  construction question, whether Congress --
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it seems that the 

structure of the statute wants an appeal to go forward 

 MS. MILLETT:  Well, it's a statutory 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

could have written the statute that way, but I think it 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It says it doesn't come 

forward -- doesn't come forward unless there is a 

1  on a particular issue, and not in -- not in general on 
2  -- on who knows how many issues. 
 MS. MILLETT:  Well, Justice Scalia, with 
3
4  respect, that's not what the statute says.  Congress 
5
6  would be extraordinary to tell courts that an appeal 
7  comes forward but we're only going to allow you to look 
8  at this precise issue decided by one judge. 
9
10
11  certificate of appealability. 
12
 MS. MILLETT:  Yes. 
13
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And then it says the 
14  certificate of appealability shall indicate which 
15
16
17
18  saying you -- we're going to have an appeal but just an 
19  appeal on the issue that's identified. 
20
21 
22 
23
24  this case, wouldn't it, because there is a 
25

can certainly do that as a matter of discretion, but 
whether they are compelled --

 MS. MILLETT:  But in nowhere --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, I read that as 

specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required. 

MS. MILLETT:  First of all, I mean, courts 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then that would exclude 

constitutional issue?  It's a speedy trial issue.  But 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MS. MILLETT:  There -- there are other 

Is there another constitutional issue other than the 

a speedy trial one.  And that's the one that we 
identified --

1  that issue was not reached below, because the case was 
2  dismissed as untimely.  So, the only constitutional 
3  issue that's in the case is one that couldn't be 
4  adjudicated by the court of appeals.  Isn't that right? 
5
6  speedy trial issue? 
7
8  issues that were raised.  I think for our purposes that 
9  the strongest one that was most clearly substantial is 
10
11 
12
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's a little odd that 
13  you would identify that issue for the court of appeals 
14  when the court of appeals couldn't take it up because it 
15
16  dismissed at an earlier stage. 
17
18  Ginsburg, your question actually captures why these 
19  mistakes happen by court of appeals judges.  The court 
20
21  presuming here.  This Court's seen this mistake happen 
22  before.  And I think what -- the judge that looked at 
23  this didn't make a determination there wasn't a 
24  substantial constitutional question, had to know that 
25

wasn't reached below, because the case was -- was 

 MS. MILLETT:  Well, I think, Justice 

of appeals judge presumably -- and again, I'm just 

that was there. 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But for the court of appeals' purposes, 

1
2  they're just going to sort out the procedural question, 
3  and if it's timely they're not going to address speedy 
4  trial in the first instance.  That would go back to the 
district court.  So, that's one of the reasons I think 
5
6  just as a practical matter why this mistake happens 
7  sometimes in this certificate of appealability process. 
 But the fundamental question here is one of 
8
9  statutory construction:  Did Congress make clear, clear 
at the level we require for jurisdiction, clear that we 
10
11 
-- at the level we would require for holding -- and I've 
never seen this anywhere in this Court's precedent --
12 
13 
holding that an individual pro se prisoner who does 
everything reasonably possible, fully and timely 
14 
complies with all obligations, will still have his right 
15
to first habeas on a substantial constitutional claim 
16 
17 
irretrievably jurisdictionally foreclosed because the 
court of appeals judge miswrote a certificate 
18 
documenting a judgment that the officer made. 
19 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

the argument -- does it help you, in distinguishing the 
notice of appeals section, to -- to say that the notice 
of appeal has to say the judgment or order that's being 
appealed? 

That's almost clerical.  It doesn't require 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you -- can you make 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

distinguish the two? 

 You rely on the fact that the notice of 

 MS. MILLETT:  I think certainly that there's 

that point.  I think what's important to recognize is 

1  any -- any discretion on the part of the judge or 
2  extensive review of the record, whereas in the COA, 
3  there has to be an element of judgment in deciding what 
4  the constitutional issue is.  Does that help you 
5
6
7  appeals cases were decided before our -- our case 
8  indicating that it has to be clear language. 
9
10
11  that there's actually a similarity between this Court's 
12  notice of appeal cases in something like Houston v. 
13  Lack, the mail -- prison mailbox rule.  You have a 
14  specific textual jurisdictional requirement in the -- in 
15
16  with the clerk of the district court.  And this Court 
17  said, look, when it comes to prisoners who have done 
18  everything humanly possible within their control to meet 
19  the jurisdictional requirements, we are not going to 
20
21  don't interpret rules to strip away jurisdiction from 
22  individuals who have done everything humanly possible, 
23  particularly when the facts on the ground are that the 
24  statute was satisfied. 
25

interpret these rules -- as part of the presumption, we

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but --
 MS. MILLETT:  -- but didn't want to go into 

What if the district judge does -- makes a 
mistake and -- and he thinks that there has not been a 
substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional 
right?  He makes a mistake about that.  What happens? 

1  there's every reason to think that Judge Garza made that 
2  determination --
3
4
5
6
7  humanly possible, and just because of the mistake of a 
8  -- of a district judge, it can't go forward.  But that

23  hard to get from a court of appeals judge, and that's a

providing documentation of a substantial speedy trial 

 MS. MILLETT:  That can be appealed. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The same -- the same 

terrible result --

 MS. MILLETT:  That can -- that can be 

 The difficulty here is that you have a pro

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But is it necessary for you 

 He documented that for the court, did 

everything he could.  And it isn't until this Court that 

1  claim, a speedy trial claim unlike this Court has ever 
2  seen, a 10-year gap between indictment and trial and 
3  then conviction on nothing but eyewitness testimony. 
4
5
6  the State says, hang on; there was never any 
7  jurisdiction over this whole case.  They didn't tell the 
8  court of appeals judges that.  They didn't say anything 
9  until the case came to this Court.  And that type of 
10
11
12  to go -- is it necessary for you to go as far as you 
13  seem to be going?  Would it be possible to read (c)(3) 
14  as mandatory but not jurisdictional? 
15
16
17  understood what you just -- your argument to be that it 
18  doesn't even have any effect, that so long as there's 
19  any document that's called a certificate of 
20
21  court of appeals panel without the issuance of a -- of a 
22  certificate of appealability covering the issue. 
23
24  jurisdictional, then if the State moves or maybe if the 
court, if the panel, sue sponte identifies the fact that

MS. MILLETT:  That's --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  So that if -- well, I

Alderson Reporting Company

1  there may be an error, there's an opportunity for a new 
2  certificate of appealability.  If nothing is done, 
3  then -- then there isn't a problem.  It's not a 
4  jurisdictional issue that lingers forever. 
MS. MILLETT:  No, I'm sorry if I misspoke. 
5
6  I absolutely agree that it's mandatory and, if timely 
7  raised, must be dealt with.  I think it's an open 
8  question whether if it's not raised until you're 
9  actually before the panel, whether the panel then has to 
identify one of its judges to issue a certificate or it 
10
11 
can simply in the course of its opinion say we've 
determined that this should go forward, even though the 
12 
13 
initial -- would you have to go through a formal 
amendment process or you just do that as part of your 
14 
decision?  I think either one will accomplish the same 
15
result and will comply with the statute, the functional 
16 
17 
gatekeeping requirement. 
18
19  question -- your comment leads to is that in looking at 
20
21  function to be subject to perpetual review and revision, 
22  obligatory perpetual review by the panel?  You couldn't 
23  accept that your colleague found that there was a 
24  substantial question; all three judges would again have 
25

to revisit that and determine that it's substantial. 

 But the separate question which your 

this, would Congress have wanted this gatekeeping 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

courts of appeals, single judges. 

 We simply -- we try -- we look at this and 

merit the time and resources of the court.  And once 

1
2  requirement, and it was meant to be a -- a promotion of 
3  efficiency, not to cause more work, not to cause more 
4  paperwork, to sift out cases, identify the appeals that 
5
6  that's identified, the more efficient process is not to 
7  make the certificate of appealability a whole side show, 
8  a whole other layer of processing, ping-ponging cases 
9  back and forth between this Court, courts of appeals; 
10
11
12  we determine that a judgment was made by a judicial 
13  officer sworn to uphold the law; a substantial showing 
14  was made.  And the fact that it wasn't written down as 
the statute likes is a problem; it should have been 
15
16  raised, but it wasn't raised, and we don't start all 
17  over.

reading of 2244(d)(1)(A) is to read it like we read 
2255.  And we read 2255 to say that finality is reached 
when direct review -- and direct review concludes when 
the court affirms a conviction or denies a petition, or, 
if the defendant forgoes direct review, when the time 
for seeking such review expires.

because he didn't go to the intermediate court, we don't 
look at the direct review prong; we only look at 
expiration of review prong.  We don't look at that.  We 
stop and we look to see is the State done.  And

2
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Millett, let's 
3  take a look at the text of 2244(d)(1).  It says the 
4  limitation shall run from the latest of.  And then it 
gives four dates essentially, four sections, each of 
5
6  which produces a date, (A), (B), (C), and (D).  And (A) 
7  is the one that's concerned here.  And (A) says the date 
8  on which the judgment becomes final, and then it gives 
9  two ways by which a judgment can become final.  And the 
two ways are basically you lose or you quit, right?  You 
10
11 
lose or you abandon your process. 
12
13  quite honestly, because it seems to me that (A) says the 
14  date, a single date, on which the judgment becomes 
15
16  people it's going to happen when they lose, and for 
17  other people it's going to happen when they quit. 
 MS. MILLETT:  First of all, the language 
18
19  forks out again, and so it says the date on which the

21  for finality. 
22
23  become final:  They lose or they quit. 
24
25

 MS. MILLETT:  Well -- and the question in 
this case is, how do we know when that -- that direct 

final.  When is that going to happen?  Well, for some 

judgment becomes final, and then there's the two options 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  Two ways for it to

say, as this Court talked about, is the State done?  This 

1  review process, what you're calling the lose prong, 
2  ends?  And it's when the State says it’s done.  Because the 
3  point of this is not an exhaustion prong.  The point of 
4  2244(d)(1)in particular, but 2244(d) generally, is to

6  supports federalism.

13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
22  compels that one way or the other.  It says when does it 
23  become final.  And so, let's ask the questions:  When 
24  did direct review conclude --
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's no suggestion in 
section (A) that there's ever going to be a conflict 
between these two ways of a judgment becoming final. 
There is no suggestion that one is going to have to pick 
between them.  Subsection (A) is most naturally read --
again, it says "the date" -- as there's just going to be 
one date.  And some people, the date of finality is 
going -- you know, it becomes final because they lose. 
Other people, it becomes final because they quit.  But 
subsection (A) suggests a single date, not two dates 
which you then have to choose between. 

 MS. MILLETT:  One, I don't think the text 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it does -- it does

 MS. MILLETT:  And the issue is -- and I hate 

to go up the ladder has ended, that's it.  It -- it 

1  suggest, Ms. Millett, that final, two ways -- conclusion 
2  of direct review is you've gone up the ladder, and 
3  that's it.  And the second part is, well, if you don't 
4  go up the ladder, you just stop.  Then when your time 
5
6  seems that there are those two possibilities, as Justice 
7  Kagan put it so well:  You lose or you quit. 
8
9  to call it the "lose prong" -- but when did he lose? 
When did the State say, we're done and we've decided 
10
11 
this case is over, this appeal is over?  And that was 
when the mandate issued.  This is only about when that 
12 
13 
prong happens.  And because you can have --
14
15
16  level, you would have a variety of times because some 
17  States -- they don't all make it the mandate.  They 
18  don't set finality at the mandate.  There may be 
19  different -- there may be different periods of time 
20
21  time periods for State prisoners.  But if you were a 
22  Federal prisoner, then you would have -- there would 
23  only be the one --

difference between 2255 and 2254.  And on the State

4  know it -- we don't -- there would be no conclusion for

21  appealability may issue under paragraph (1) only if the 
22  applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial

that's jurisdictional if "jurisdiction" means, as we

22  competent to hear.  So, I look at 2254.  That's State 
23  habeas. 
24
25

MR. MITCHELL:  Well, perhaps analogy from 
other areas of appellate jurisdiction -- sometimes a 
district court may issue a final judgment for the wrong 
party.  Perhaps he entered summary judgment, and he 
shouldn't.  That final judgment may be erroneous, it may 
be wrongly issued, but it doesn't mean it deprives the 
appellate court of jurisdiction to review what the 
district court did.

MR. MITCHELL:  Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  2253, it seems to me, is 
7  a processing rule that applies to both categories.  It 
8  applies to '54, and it applies to '55, but the classes

16  final order shall be subject to review on appeal by the 
17  court of appeals.  It doesn't mention the word

13  was trying to get at, and Justice Breyer, which is: 
14  What you are requiring and you're saying the statute 
requires if, is that for the district court to always reach

2  conviction, the judgment became final as a potential 

3  starting point for the 1-year limitations period and 

4  then establishes two prongs for determining when that 

date of finality occurs.  Finality, under the statute, 
5
6  can occur either at the conclusion of direct review, or 
7  it can occur at the expiration of time for seeking such 
8  review.  And the Fifth Circuit correctly held that the 
9  conclusion of direct review prong applies only when the 
habeas applicant pursues direct review to its natural 
10
11  conclusion, by obtaining either a judgment or a denial

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, in most cases, the

 What (c)(2) says is, have you made a 

right?  That's a very different inquiry. 

 MS. O'CONNELL:  It is, and once a judge 

 What we're saying in -- when we say that 

(c)(2) is jurisdictional is that if it becomes --

1  cite a Federal constitutional provision?  If so, there's 
2  a Federal question in the case. 
3
4  substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional 
5
6
7  issues a certificate of appealability on that question, 
8  it should be presumed that it's been satisfied. 
9
10
11
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, is it a jurisdictional 
12  rule that we're -- rule that we're going to presume that 
13  it's been satisfied?  That's a sort of odd thing to do 
14  for jurisdictional rules, right?  Jurisdictional rules, 
15
16  serious about them. 
17
18  district judge or a court of appeals judge has made a 
19  determination that there's a constitutional issue that's 
debatable, going forward that seems to be something that 
20
21  would be extremely hard to overturn. 
22
23  the merits of the constitutional issue as to which there 
24  is a reference in the certificate of appealability, when 
25

we sua sponte have to look at them, and we have to be 

it -- when it writes its opinion it first has to ask 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So, if the panel looks at 

 MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  But if a -- if a 

53

 And then -- but if it says, well, there was 

affirm.  Is that -- is that right? 

1  itself, was there a substantial showing?  And if there 
2  wasn't, then it will say we'll dismiss this claim. 
3
4  a substantial showing, but it's wrong, then we'll 
5
6
 MS. O'CONNELL:  I mean, I think that could 
7  happen.  In most cases, it's not going to be an issue. 
8  If somebody certified that it's debatable, then somebody 
9  has made that showing.  If it turns out -- like, for 
example, if there was, if the petitioner had said my 
10
11 
right to testify at trial was violated, they wouldn't 
let me testify; and then that issue is certified and 
12 
13 
then it turns out when it gets to the merits panel that 
he did in fact testify and it was a totally frivolous 
14 
claim, yes, I think that the court of appeals should 
15
dismiss the case at that point for lack of jurisdiction. 
16 
17
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Then let's go on to (c)(3), 
18  because (c)(3) seems to be just a documentation 
19  requirement.  In other words, let's presume that (c)(2) 
has been satisfied; there was a substantial showing 
20
21  made; and there is a documentation error and (c) --
22  under (c)(3).  Why should that be jurisdictional?  A 
23  sort of -- you know, there has been a substantial 
24  showing made.  There's a documentation error.  It's an 
25

error that the habeas petitioner has absolutely no

2  jurisdictional bar? 

3
4  because we don't actually know that a substantial 

5
showing has been made until a Federal judge tells us 
6  that.  We could -- you know, you could assume that a 
7  substantial showing was made.  It's not clear that --

22  discretionary petitions for review.  Far less than 
23  that -- 99.7, 99.8 percent -- do not seek cert on direct

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't understand that, Ms. 

in the highest State court.  The situation is not 

1  Federal prisoners, is going to drive the statute --
2
3  Millett.  I mean, the situation in this case is 
4  presented because the Petitioner here didn't seek review 
5
6  presented because the Petitioner did not file a cert 
7  petition. 
8
9  means by the so-called natural conclusion of direct 
review.  Now, statistically -- this is a statutory 
10
11 
provision written for State prisoners by Congress, to 
address State prisoners; and if the natural thing that 
12 
13 
happens in the world is 99 percent do not even seek 
review in the State's highest court -- and I'm 
14 
extrapolating from Texas; I don't know all 50 States, 
15
but I have no reason to think that's anomalous. 
16 
17 
Ninety-nine percent don't file petitions for 
discretionary review.  What kind -- why would Congress 
18 
have written this statute in a way that's going to 
19 
create a gap, that is going to cause prisoners who 
20
wouldn't otherwise file to now file?  Instead of 2,000, 
21 
22 
they're now going to have 102,000 petitions for 
discretionary review, and the Texas courts --
23 
24
25

understand you.  You're saying 99 percent don't file 

 MS. MILLETT:  Well, the question is what one 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I’m sorry.  Let me make sure I 

56
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MS. MILLETT:  Correct.  Correct.  And I'm --

1  petitions in Texas's highest court? 
2
3  this is -- the Texas judicial reports are -- are 
4  available online that record this.  I'm -- I'm looking 
at the number of petitions each year.  Roughly the last 

5
6  3 years, in the 2,000-ish range.  Convictions in the 

7  State, more than 100,000 range.  And so --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You're saying 99 percent of 

8
9  the -- of the defendants who take an appeal through the 

Texas system don't file a petition with the Texas Court 
10
11 
of Criminal Appeals?  Or is it 99 percent of those who 
don't do that and then file a Federal habeas petition? 
12 
13 
I would imagine it's the former, right? 
14
15
16
17
18  here is -- we are --
19
20
21  shape, right?  They're going to have their claims 
22  unexhausted or defaulted. 
 MS. MILLETT:  They -- they may or may not. 
23
24  As we pointed out, in the Kinsey case the Texas court 
25

review, these petitioners are not going to be in good 

of -- the Texas courts have actually entertained a 

 MS. MILLETT:  I'm talking about the former. 

Right.  But the point --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes. 
 MS. MILLETT:  The point is that – the argument 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because under Federal habeas 

57
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 In Johnson v. United States, this Court 

1  speedy trial claim in -- at both levels.  It was raised 
2  on direct review, and then it wasn't, but -- right.  It 
3  was also -- they raised in both forums.  So, it casts 
4  some doubt on the procedural default argument advanced 
here, but you're right.  Of course, there -- there are 
5
6  issues here, but the question is whether Congress wanted 
7  a gap. 
8
9  construed 2255, I think it was subsection (4) there, the 
one on -- if a conviction is overturned that was used to 
10
11 
enhance.  And then when do you -- what is the timing to 
come back and file a habeas claim to change your 
12 
13 
sentence that relied on a now-vacated prior conviction. 
14
15
16  the -- when the finality attaches and when the time that 
17  you can actually file for postconviction review 
18  commences. 
19
20
21  requirement; it's respect the State.  And Texas couldn't 
22  be clearer:  In Ex parte Johnson footnote 2, it says the 
23  appeal continues -- sorry, may I finish the sentence? 
24
25

 The whole point of this, of 2244, was to 
respect State processes.  It's not another exhaustion 

 And this Court said we're not going to 
construe this language to create a gap between when 

 The appeal continues until the mandate 

issues.  Federal law shouldn't change that.
