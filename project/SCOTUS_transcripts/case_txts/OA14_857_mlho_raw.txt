CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­857,  Campbell­Ewald 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company  v.  Gomez. 

 

 

            

Mr.  Garre. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  GREGORY  G.  GARRE 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To  affirm  the  Ninth  Circuit  on  the  first  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  presented,  this  Court  must  accept  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  two  propositions: 

 

 

            

First,  a  plaintiff  can  force  a  court  to 

   

   

 

 

 

adjudicate  the  merits  of  his  claim  simply  by  refusing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant's  offer  of  capitulation  and  complete 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief. 

            

And,  second,  that  a  plaintiff  has  what 

   

 

 

 

 

amounts  to  a  substantive  right  to  class  litigation  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  as  soon  as  the  complaint  is  filed  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitles  the  case  to  proceed  even  if  his  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  drops  out  before  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  there  any  controversy 

  

 

 

 

 

over  whether  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  offer  is  complete  relief? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  I  don't  think  so,  Your  Honor.

The  district  court  found  that  it  was  at  page  40  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petition  Appendix.  The  Ninth  Circuit  decided  this  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  that  premise.  That's  at  page  5a  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petition  Appendix. 

 

            

            

So  I  think  as  the  case  comes  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Do  we  take  it  on  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption,  too? 

 

            

            

MR.  GARRE:  I  think  you  should,  Your  Honor. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Now  ­­ now,  they  have  argued  below  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  reason  that  it  wasn't  for  complete  relief  was  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ because  it  didn't  provide  for  attorneys'  fees.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  TCPA,  the  underlying  statute  here,  does  not  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  attorneys'  fees. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  that's  a  merits  question 

   

  

 

 

 

as  to  whether  they're  entitled  to  attorneys'  fees.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  is  complete  ­­ you  know,  "complete  relief" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  what  the  plaintiff  has  asked  for.  The  plaintiff 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  asked  for  attorneys'  fees  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  I  don't  think  that's  what 

    

 

 

 

 

"complete  relief"  means,  Your  Honor.  I  think  it  means 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  plaintiff  has  received  everything  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  ­­ that  he  could  if  he  received  a  judgment  in  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ in  his  favor  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  he  would  ­­ he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  receive  a  finding  of  liability,  which  you  didn't

admit  in  your  offer. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GARRE:  He  ­­ I  ­­

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  He  would  ­­ he  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  an  injunction  against  that  activity,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  that  caused  this  particular  situation,  and  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others  were  shown,  to  an  injunction  in  other  ways. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  see  how  this  could  be  ­­ putting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aside  the  class  action,  putting  aside  the  attorneys' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees,  those  appear  to  me  to  be  fairly  critical  liability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determinations  that  were  not  made  by  the  court  below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Okay.  First,  as  the  case  comes 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Court,  I  think  it  is  accepted  that  the  offer  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  complete  relief. 

 

 

            

raise. 

            

Now  let  me  try  to  answer  the  points  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First,  he's  not  entitled  to  a  finding  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

liability.  If  a  litigant  was  always  entitled  to  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

finding  of  liability,  then  essentially  no  case  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

become  moot.  If  you  take  the  voluntary  cessation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

context,  a  litigant  could  always  insist  that  he's  still 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  the  finding  of  liability. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  ­­ it  seems  that  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  us  to  write  an  ­­ an  opinion  saying  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement  offer  is  equivalent  to  a  judgment.  And  we've 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

had  cases,  like  the  Kokkonen  case,  in  which  there  was  a

settlement  approved  by  the  court,  case  dismissed,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  settlement  was  not  performed.  They  went  to  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking  an  injunction.  The  court  said,  no,  no.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  contract.  You  have  to  file  again.  You  have  to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  into  a  different  court.  You  have  to  start  all  over 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again. 

              

A  settlement  offer  and  a  settlement  contract 

   

 

 

 

and  a  settlement  agreement  are  different  from  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

judgment,  and  you  do  not  have  a  judgment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  accepted  principle  is  that  a  settlement  moots  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  and  requires  the  court  to  dispose  of  the  case.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  I  think  that's  the  accepted  principle.  And  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you  didn't  pursue 

  

 

 

 

 

that.  You  didn't  apply  under  the  rules  for  a  judgment. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  ­­ and  ­­ and  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  us  to  write  an  opinion  and  say,  oh,  well,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement  offer  is  the  same  as  a  judgment,  that  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  accord  with  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  with  our  cases  like  the  Kokkonen  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  this  case  is  consistent  with  the  Kokkonen  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  the  Kokkonen  case  recognized  is  that,  once  a  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  come  to  an  end,  the  Court  has  ancillary  jurisdiction

to  dispose  of  it.  In  that  case  it  dealt  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  of  a  consent  decree. 

   

 

 

            

            

Here  our  fundamental  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  the  Federal  rule  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

point,  Mr.  Garre  ­­ and  it  says  ­­ Rule  68  says  an  offer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  judgment  expires  automatically  after  14  days  if  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  accepted.  It  is  deemed  withdrawn,  and  it  cannot  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  for  any  purpose  other  than  to  saddle  the  plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  costs  if  she  doesn't  get  more  than  the  offer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  have  a  Federal  rule  directly  in  point, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  instructs  litigants  what  an  offer  of  judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means.  Why  do  we  look  any  further  than  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  first,  Your  Honor,  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case,  there  was  not  only  the  Rule  68  offer  of  judgment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  a  freestanding  settlement  offer.  So  we  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  mechanics  of  Rule  68  don't  apply  here.  It's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  isn't  that  rather 

  

 

 

 

 

an  end  run  around  the  offer  of  judgment? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

so.  I  mean,  it  still  presents  the  question  of  whether 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  controversy  still  exists  given  that  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  offered  the  plaintiff  everything  that  he  ­­ he  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secure  through  a  Federal  judgment. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  plaintiff  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  asks  for  class  action,  didn't  get  that  because

they  weren't  far  ­­ far  along  enough  for  the  plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  to  move  for  certification. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  And  the  plaintiff  in  Genesis 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Healthcare  asked  for  a  collective  action.  The  Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

found  that  that  allegation  did  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  the  collective  action 

  

 

 

 

 

is  simply  a  device  for  permissive  joinder.  It's  quite 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

different,  as  Genesis  recognized. 

 

 

 

            

Class  action  ­­ I  don't  remember  Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

Thomas'  exact  words,  but  it's  a  whole  different  kettle 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  fish. 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  I  mean,  here's  how  I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

it's  different,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

            

You're  right.  It  is  different.  But  it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

different  in  that  this  Court  has  repeatedly  said  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  class  has  no  independent  legal  status  until  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certified.  And  it's  different  in  that,  in  Genesis 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Healthcare,  you  had  a  statutory  right  to  a  collective 

   

   

 

 

 

 

action,  but  the  Court  said  that  that  didn't  trump 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article  III. 

 

            

            

And  here  you  just  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  All  it  ­­ all  it  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  an  invitation  to  people  to  join  you.  That's  all  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  that  ­­ it's  a  permissive  joinder.

important  to  the  plaintiff  in  that  case,  and  it  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  right. 

 

            

And  here  the  question  is:  When  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

individual  claim  drops  out,  is  there  any  basis  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  to  proceed  simply  so  that,  on  the  ­­ on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential  that  a  class  could  be  certified? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

potential. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  One  ­­ one  is  ­­ is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  other  is,  it's  not  that  I  would  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  attorneys'  fees  from  the  loser,  but  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  class,  then  there  are  a  lot  of  other  people 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  will  share  in  the  attorneys'  fees  and  I'll  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay  less. 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  And  that  ­­ that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cost­sharing  argument  that  was  made  in  Roper. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

that. 

            

And  if  I  could  say  a  couple  things  about 

   

   

 

 

 

 

First,  the  plaintiff  in  this  case,  unlike 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plaintiff  in  Roper,  never  made  that  argument  below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  never  argued  in  favor  of  cost  sharing.  In  fact,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint,  if  you  look  on  page  21  of  the  Joint  Appendix, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

touts  that  he  has  all  the  financial  resources  necessary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  bring  this  action. 

 

 

 

            

Second  of  all,  in  Roper  the  Court  relied  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  interest  solely  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  the

appeal  from  the  denial  of  certification  when  the  mooting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

event  occurred  after  the  denial  of  certification. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  there  you  had  a  real  relation  back  issue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  the  Court  had  been  wrong  in  denying  certification, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  the  case  never  would  have  become  moot  in  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place. 

            

Here,  the  mooting  event  takes  place  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification.  There's  nothing  to  relate  back  to. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  if  I  could  go  back  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

little  bit,  Mr.  Garre.  And  this  is,  I  think,  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  Justice  Scalia  started  with. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  are  a  number  of  things  that  you've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

said,  well,  he  asked  for  it,  but  he's  not  entitled  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  He  asked  for  attorneys'  fees,  but  he's  not  entitled 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  attorneys'  fees.  And  he  asked  for  an  injunction  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declaratory  relief,  and  he's  not  entitled  to  that.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  asked  for  class  certification,  but  he's  not  entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  that,  and  so  the  case  is  moot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  "so  the  case  is  moot"  seems  to  me  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  non  sequitur.  In  other  words,  he's  asked  for  these 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things,  you  haven't  offered  these  things,  and  there's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute  about  whether  he's  entitled  to  these  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  you  might  be  completely  right  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  "He's  not  entitled  to  attorneys'  fees."  But  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  adjudicated.  You  can't  ­­ a  court  can't  just

say,  oh,  you've  offered  complete  relief,  because  in  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  you  haven't  offered  complete  relief,  and  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  litigation  is  all  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  And  a  court  can  make  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

determination,  just  like  a  court  can  determine  whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

or  not  a  defendant  who  says  he's  going  to  stop  his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  has  truly  voluntarily  ceased  his  action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  A  court  can  absolutely  make 

    

 

 

 

 

that  determination.  But  the  question  is:  Does  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

court  make  that  determination  in  the  guise  of  a  mootness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion? 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  I  think  it  absolutely 

   

  

 

 

 

does,  just  like  it  would  in  the  voluntary  cessation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context. 

              

I  ­­ I  want  to  be  clear  because  I  think  we 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  little  bit  of  a  ­­

   

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  can't  it  ­­ why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can't  it  do  that  in  the  context  of  a  summary  judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion?  I  mean,  why  does  it  have  to  moot  the  case? 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wouldn't  the  appropriate  vehicle  be  a  summary  judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

motion  in  which  you  admit  the  facts  that  make  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liable,  or  you  concede  the  facts  that  make  you  liable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  you  fight  about  the  legal  questions? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  The  ­­ the  reason  is,  when  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  one  party  throws  in  the  towel,  the  match  is  over.

Here,  the  question  is  whether  there's  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article  III  case  or  controversy  when  the  defendant  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer  fighting  over  the  result  as  to  the  thing  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue.  That's  ­­ those  are  the  words  that  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  in  the  San  Pablo  case.  That's  an  Article  III 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  I  ­­ but  what's  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Article  III  determination  is  whether  he  or  it  or  she  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  the  relief  that  they  asked  for.  May  well  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  not. 

 

            

            

MR.  GARRE:  And  functionally  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  they're  entitled  to 

  

 

 

 

 

have  the  court  say  it,  not  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  A  ­­ a  court  can  certainly  make 

    

   

 

 

 

 

the  determination  of  whether  or  not  they  have  provided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete  relief.  In  a  case  like  this  where  you're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

dealing  with  liquidated  damages,  that's  easy. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's  just  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  By  the  way,  you  called 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  a  "freestanding  offer,"  but  I  have  it  right  here, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ­­ offer  says,  "Offer  of  judgment  pursuant  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  68." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  was  your  client's  submission. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  No  ­­ well,  you're  right,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  That's  the  Rule  68  offer.  If  you  go  on  page  57a

of  the  Petition  Appendix,  there's  the  freestanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement  offer,  which  isn't  a  Rule  68  offer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  other  thing  about  Rule  68  is  it's  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  designed  for  the  situation  of  complete  relief.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed  for  the  situation  where  the  defendant  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  have  to  gamble,  essentially,  over  whether  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  an  offer  for  less  than  complete  relief  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  ­­ they  ­­ they  want  to  settle  on  that  basis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  this  case  you  had  a  freestanding 

   

 

 

 

 

settlement  offer.  It  provided  for  complete  relief,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  the  question  is  whether  or  not  the  ­­ the  plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  a  personal  stake  in  the  case  sufficient  ­­ in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome  of  the  case  sufficient  to  keep  this  case  alive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  Kennedy,  to  get  back  to  your  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  settlement  ­­ and  I  think  what's  important  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  here  is  ­­ here's  our  position:  When  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offer  of  complete  relief  is  made  and  when  a  court  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined  that  it  is,  indeed,  for  complete  relief,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  has  to  come  to  an  end.  Now,  whether  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ it's  moot  at  that  precise  moment  or  whether  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  it  starts  the  ball  rolling  down  the  hill  towards  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal  or  entry  of  judgment  for  the  plaintiff  based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  terms  of  the  offer,  the  point  is  ­­ is  that  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant  has  offered  everything,  the  courts  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  ahead  and  expound  on  the  law.

Now,  this  Court  has  repeatedly  said,  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  necessary  to  decide,  it's  necessary  not  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide.  And  that's  the  fundamental  principle  at  stake 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  Defendant  has  offered  everything,  and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Suppose  one  day  after  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

offer  the  defendant  defaulted.  Would  a  case  that's  now 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

­­ was  once  moot  now  become  non­moot? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  and  that  would  be  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusual  situation  if  it  did,  Your  Honor.  I  think  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  happened  in  Kokkonen. 

  

 

 

 

 

We  had  a  case  on  it  here  in  the  Court. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  And  ­­ and  ­­ you  know,  Roper's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  case  where  there  was  an  offer  that  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  ­­ it  didn't  really  question  in  that  case  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  offer  mooted  the  claim  on  the  merits.  The  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  was  whether  they  could  appeal  the  denial  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification.  Here  the  plaintiff's  position  is  asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  to  go  far  beyond  what  the  Court  recognized  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Roper  and  really  to  recognize  a  substantive  right  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  adjudication.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  that's  what

class  status? 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  I  ­­ I  don't  think  you  can 

    

   

 

 

 

 

describe  it  as  a  procedural  right.  This  Court  has  said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Rule  23  is  a  procedural  mechanism.  When  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  are  met,  it  said  that  there's  no  separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  status  for  the  class  until  the  class  is  certified. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  the  Jacobs  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  why  is  it  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit  relation  back  at  all  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ if  ­­ if  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  that  say  when  a  case  has  become  moot  in  the  middle 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  litigation,  it  can  relate  back  to  the  beginning? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Okay.  Well,  first  of  all  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  mootness  is  mootness, 

  

 

 

 

 

mootness  is  mootness,  right? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Yes.  First  of  all,  the  Court 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  recognized  two  narrow  exceptions,  Your  Honor.  First 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  appeal  from  the  denial  of  class  certification  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  mooting  event  happens  while  a  case  is  on  appeal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  Roper  case.  And  the  second  is  the  inherently 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transitory  exception. 

 

            

Now,  it's  not  even  clear  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents  are  asking  for  either  exception,  because  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  see  "relation  back"  or  "inherently  transitory"  in

their  red  brief.  But  it's  clear  that  the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  doesn't  apply  because  this  case  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  an  appeal  from  the  denial  of  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification,  and  it's  clear  that  the  second  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  doesn't  apply,  "inherently  transitory," 

 

 

 

 

because  in  Genesis,  this  Court  made  clear  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern  of  the  so­called  picking  off  wasn't  a  sufficient 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  to  say  that  a  claim  was  inherently  transitory. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  exception  doesn't  deal  with  the  defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  conduct;  it  deals  with  whether  the  claimant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  is  going  to  recur,  like  a  pretrial  temporary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention  situation.  This  case  doesn't  fit  into  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  exception  at  all.  What  ­­

MR.  GARRE:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  if  the  defendant  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

very  shaky  finances,  maybe  on  the  verge  of  bankruptcy,

that  the  plaintiff  ­­ the  defendant  is  ready  and  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay.  And  third  of  all,  in  the  situation  where  the  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  dismissed  for  mootness  based  on  the  terms  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offer  and  then  it  turns  out  that  they  can't  execute  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offer  ­­ I  mean,  that's  a  situation  where  the  court  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plaintiff  can  go  back  to  the  court  and  say,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  ­­ you  ­­ you  dismissed  the  case  on  an  erroneous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual  premise.  That's  like  the  Judge  Friendly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

decision  that  we  cite  in  our  reply  brief.  So  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  is  not  going  to  happen. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  all  of  these  practical  concerns  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  go  away  if  this  Court  recognizes  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  defendant's  offer  of  complete  relief  ends  any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  or  controversy  over  the  individual  claim.  The  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes  away.  The  plaintiffs  are  going  to  accept  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offer. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Can  the  offer  of  complete 

  

 

 

 

 

 

relief  from  a  solvent  defendant  where  it  looks  like  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief  will  be  forthcoming,  if  ­­ if  you  lose  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  the  case  is  not  moot,  could  still  be  considered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  factor  in  the  court's  decision  whether  or  not  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certify  the  class? 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  I  don't  think  ­­ it  certainly 

    

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  be  a  classic  certification  decision  factor, 

   

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  And  I  think  ­­­ I  mean,  one  of  the  reasons

why  the  court  insists  on  an  Article  III  case  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversy  is  that  it  wants  to  insist  that  it  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expound  on  the  law,  but  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  In  other  words,  the  class 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certification  goes  along  without  reference  to  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lead  plaintiff  has  any  injury  any  longer? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  it's  a  ­­ it's  certainly  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

very  unusual  situation  where  the  personal  representative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  made  whole.  Now  ­­ now,  there's  some  claims  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  why  I  asked  if  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

trial  judge  could,  in  his  discretion,  consider  that  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor  in  certifying  or  not  certifying  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  I  suppose  that  he  could  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

terms  of  the  person  represented,  but  the  real  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is:  Why  would  you  want  a  court  to  expound  on  the  law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  questions  about  certification,  as  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knows  as  well  as  anyone,  when  there's  no  case  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversy  to  begin  with,  when  the  defendant  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered  the  plaintiff  everything?  And  then  the  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is:  If  his  individual  claim  drops  out,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  ­­ to  put  it  in  Judge  Friendly's  terms,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  does  a  ­­ does  a  plaintiff  have  ­­

you  ­­ multiple  times  in  your  brief  and  now  twice  ­­ but

claims  had  already  been  done  and  dispensed  with, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguished,  extinguished.  So  it  wasn't  a  case  of  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

class  certification  not  yet  ruled  on;  it  was  ruled  on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  class  action  was  out  of  the  case.  It  was  only  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual. 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  you're  right,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about  that  distinction,  but  I  think  what  Judge  Friendly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  applies  equally  here,  which  is  that  when  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  loses  his  individual  interests  in  the  case,  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  no  ­­ no  right  to  ­­ to  litigate  on  a  class  action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  might  benefit  others. 

 

 

 

 

            

He  also  pointed  out  that  the  offer  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete  relief  in  this  case,  in  this  kind  of  situation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

puts  the  plaintiff  in  a  better  position  than  a  default 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

judgment.  The  plaintiff  has  everything  that  he  asks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for.  He's  walking  away  with  the  money. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  to  your  point  earlier,  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor,  just  to  be  clear,  the  offer  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included  a  stipulation  to  an  injunction  as  well.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  that's  for  future 

  

 

 

 

 

conduct,  not  ­­ not  directed  to  the  conduct  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  conduct  at  issue  here.  But  I  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well  if  ­­ you  can't  undo  past

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  ­­ you  know,  I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

looked  at  the  three  railroad  cases  that  you  cited  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proof  that  this  has  always  been  the  case,  but  do  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  anything  besides  those  things?  In  the  common  law, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  can't  find  any  situation  in  which  a  court  accepted  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offer  that  wasn't  accepted  by  the  party.  In  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

railroad  cases,  what  they  found  was  that  an  offer  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  and  the  other  side,  by  taking  money,  accepted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offer. 

            

            

MR.  GARRE:  No,  but  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Have  you  found  any  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  common  law  that  ­­ where  there  was  an  offer  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  unaccepted,  was  entered  by  the  court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  three  responses  to  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

First,  in  the  San  Pablo  case,  for  example,  the  court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  specifically  makes  clear  that  the  plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refused  that  offer. 

 

 

            

Second  of  all  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  you've  had  to  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  to  deposit  the  money  in  an  account  in  the  name  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plaintiff.  And  San  Pablo  turned  on  a  provision  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  California  Civil  Code  that  said  an  obligation  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment  is  extinguished,  is  extinguished  by  an  offer  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment,  if  the  money  is  immediately  deposited  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reputable  bank  in  the  name  of  a  creditor.

MR.  GARRE:  That's  ­­ that's,  of  course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right,  Your  Honor.  But,  of  course,  if  acceptance  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rule,  then  it's  a  little  bit  odd  that  the  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  mention  the  fact  that  he  didn't  accept  it  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  other  point  I  wanted  to  make  in  response 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Justice  Sotomayor's  question  is:  We  cited  a  long 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

footnote  in  our  opening  brief  that  has  many  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognizing  this  principle,  and  in  our  reply  brief,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite  the  holding  case  out  of  the  English  courts.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  1840  case,  and  that  case  is  exactly  on  point.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  a  situation  where  a  claim  was  brought  for  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

debt,  the  defendant  came  in  and  said,  here's  your  money, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  court  in  that  case  ­­ the  plaintiff  refused  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept  it.  And  the  court  in  that  case  said  it  had  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beholden  duty  to  end  the  case,  given  that  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  had  offered  everything  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  Mr.  Garre  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  GARRE:  ­­ plaintiff  was  seeking. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ and  this  is  very  much 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

along  the  same  lines  ­­ you  know,  you  ­­ you  have  an  old 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

English  case.  You  have  these  three  cases  in  the  '90s, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1890s,  which  were  really  about  liabilities  had  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  already  been  satisfied,  and  the  court  said,  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  been  satisfied,  payment  has  already  been  made. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  there's  really  no  history  at  all  ­­ and  tender

offers  have  existed  for  a  long,  long  time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's  no  history  at  all  of  ­­ of  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  tender  offer  moots  a  case,  as  opposed  to  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

classic  understanding,  the  common  law  understanding,  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tender  offers  was  that  it  created  an  incentive  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties,  and  that  that  was  their  purpose  and  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  effect,  was  to  incentivize  parties  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something,  but  not  to  ­­ for  ­­ not  to  provide  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism  for  a  court  just  to  throw  out  a  case  when  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  decided  that,  for  whatever  reason,  he  thought  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  tender  offer  was  not  good  enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  So  I  think  first  ­­ just  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

quibble  ­­ I  do  think  there's  a  longstanding  practice  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

recognizing  that  when  the  defendant  has  been  offered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  he  could  secure,  the  case  goes  away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second  of  all,  and  I  think,  you  know,  maybe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  important:  I  mean,  I  would  say  that  your  dissent 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  Genesis  Healthcare  itself  ­­ itself  recognizes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acceptance  can't  be  the  rule  in  all  cases.  I  mean,  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  in  the  situation  where  the  plaintiff  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept  for  obstinacy  or  madness,  but  once  you're  there, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  recognize  that  acceptance  can't  be  the  rule.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  got  to  be  right,  because  in  the  voluntary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cessation  context,  we  don't  require  the  plaintiff  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept  that.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  but  I  ­­ I  said  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

mootness  is  not  the  appropriate  remedy  in  that  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  appropriate  remedy  in  a  case  where  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely  clear  that  ­­ that  the  ­­ that  the  defendant

it  as  moot,  or  do  we  tell  the  lower  court  to  enter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  for  plaintiff  based  on  the  terms  of  the  offer,

MR.  GARRE:  There  hasn't  been  an 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

adjudication,  Your  Honor.  It's  judgment  entered  based 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  terms  of  the  offer.  It's  not  a  judgment

entered  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Garre,  the  only  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  see  a  court  entering  judgment  in  the  Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  is  a  Rule  56  judgment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Someone  moves  and  says,  you  got  everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  entitled  to.  The  other  side  comes  back  and  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no,  I'm  entitled  to  attorneys'  fees,  I'm  entitled  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever.  And  the  court  says,  no,  you're  not;  this  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full  satisfaction;  I  enter  judgment. 

   

 

 

              

I  don't  know  why  we  have  to  make  a  merits 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  based  solely  on  an  unaccepted  offer  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment. 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  first  of  all,  a  judgment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  just  technically  an  order  disposing  of  the  case.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  we  went  back  and  looked,  and  you  yourself  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  judge  issued  judgments  in  cases  where  you

dismissed  it  as  moot.  It  just  reflects  that  the  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  come  to  an  end. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

Second  of  all,  what  we've  recognized  as  an 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  position  is  the  Sixth  Circuit  position  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  that  ­­ that  in  this  situation  you  can  dispose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  case  by  entering  judgment  for  plaintiff  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  terms  of  the  offer.  That's  not  a  judgment  on  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits  because  it's  not  adjudicating  the  claim  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits. 

            

It's  not  picking  a  winner,  not  involving  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

court  picking  a  winner  ­­ a  loser  or  winner,  and  it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolves  all  of  the  hypothetical  concerns  that  they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  about  eliminating  the  case  before  they  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  check  in  hand.  And  that's  ­­ that's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  way  of  disposing  of  this  case.  And  no  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  argue  that  there's  an  Article  III  interest  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding  with  the  litigation  once  they  have  a  judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposing  of  the  case.

payment  is  made  before  the  case  gets  to  litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  ­­ there's  no  principle. 

 

 

 

 

            

Once  the  ­­ once  the  litigation  begins,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  that  controls  is  Article  III.  Article  III's

plaintiff  had  a  ­­ have  a  personal  stake,  a  live 

   

   

   

 

 

 

personal  stake  in  the  outcome  of  the  case  at  all  stages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  proceeding. 

 

 

            

And  on  the  first  question,  our  point  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once  you've  been  offered  everything  you  could  receive  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  again,  that's  how  the  case  comes  here,  and  he  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  offered  everything  that  he  could  get  through  a

Healthcare,  the  would­be  class  representative  is  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  exact  position  he  was  before  this  case  goes  away, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  he  can  still  file  his  own  claim.  He  can  settle

is  policy  arguments  about  whether  or  not  the  Court  ought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  find  some  basis  to  keep  the  class  action  alive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That's  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  GARRE:  That's  not  an  appropriate 

  

 

 

 

 

determination  of  Article  III. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  How  could  he  file  a  class 

   

  

 

 

 

 

action  on  your  theory?  That's  what  he  wanted  to  do,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  was  stopped  very  early  on  by  this  offer  of  judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  this  ­­ this  gets  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern  of,  these  sorts  of  class  actions  are  going  to  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away. 

            

First  of  all,  it's  ­­ it's  hard  to  feel  too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry  about  the  plaintiffs  who  have  everything  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  possibly  ask  for  when  we're  talking  about  absent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  As  a  practical  matter  in  these  sorts  of  class 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions,  what  they  get  is  pennies  on  the  dollars  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  claim.  The  big  money  goes  to  the  class  action 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers  here. 

 

            

All  of  this  can  be  addressed  if  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  address  it  by  addressing  these  policy  concerns. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Garre,  both  sides  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

these  class  action  policy  arguments,  but  it's  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  to  let  those  drive  this  pretty  technical  mootness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  So  if  we  could  just  take  the  class  action 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  out  of  it.

Just  let's  say  that  there's  a  plaintiff,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

he  claims  10,000  ­­ he  wants  $10,000  plus  attorneys' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees,  okay?  And  the  defendant  says,  I'll  give  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10,000. 

            

And  the  plaintiff  says,  no,  I  really  want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys'  fees,  too.  And  the  defendant  says,  no, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not  entitled  to  attorneys'  fees.  Plaintiff  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no,  I  think  I  am.  I'll  ­­ I  think  I  ­­ I'm  going  to 

   

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

reject  your  settlement  offer. 

 

 

 

            

So  you  say  at  that  point  the  court  can  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  and  say,  oh,  the  case  is  moot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Now,  how  is  that  possible? 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  in  the  same  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  There's  a  ­­ there's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

contested  question  as  to  what  one  person  owes  another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  ­­ the  defendant  has  said  he  doesn't  want  to  accept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  offer  because  he  doesn't  think  it  gives  him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  that's  entitled  ­­ he's  entitled  to.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure  of  complete  relief  has  to  be,  at  this  stage, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  his  complaint  asks  for. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  It's  just  like  the  voluntary

Campbell­Ewald's  mootness  argument  fails

obtaining  a  court  judgment  that  incorporates  that  relief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that's  been  offered. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­ well,  what  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  you're  worried  about,  that  they  won't  make  good  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  offer,  or  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  The  mere  offer  of  complete 

  

 

 

 

 

 

relief  does  not  have  anything  to  do  with  mootness.  Even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  plaintiff  and  the  defendant  agree  on  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  judicial  relief  should  be,  the  only  question  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  situation  is  whether  the  court  should  enter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  for  the  plaintiff,  not  dismiss  the  case  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lack  of  jurisdiction. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Suppose  Mr.  Garre  right  now

the  merits  if  Mr.  Garre's  client  can  say,  we've  paid  the

defense  on  the  merits.  He  could  plead  accord  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfaction.  He  could  plead  res  judicata.  He  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  why  is  there  a  live 

   

  

 

 

 

 

case  or  controvery?  What  is  the  controversy? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Because  there's  ­­ there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

past  injury  that's  been  alleged  caused  by  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  could  be  redressed,  in  theory,  with  judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief.  That  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Which  would  give  the  ­­ the

addition  to  the  money,  under  my  hypothetical? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  He  shouldn't  get  anything  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

addition  to  what  he's  already  received,  but  that  goes  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  merits,  not  to  whether  an  Article  III  case  or

for  $10,000  and  $10,000  is  deposited  in  a  bank  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrevocable  instructions  to  pay  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  ­­ what  ­­ what  is  ­­

results  in  adversity? 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  The  concrete  injury  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

past  injury  that  he's  already  suffered.  That  the  injury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  already  been  remedied  is  a  defense  that  goes  to  the

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  sorry.  Go  ahead.

Kennedy,  that  under  your  hypothetical,  the  case  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  thrown  out  of  court.  The  only  dispute  is  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  thrown  out  of  court  on  jurisdictional  grounds  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article  III  or  whether  it's  bounced  on  the  merits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  defendant  has  an  affirmative  defense.

MR.  MITCHELL:  If  ­­ if  it's  certain  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  conduct  won't  reoccur. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  if  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

certain  that  they're  going  to  give  you  the  money  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  asked  for,  why  isn't  the  same  result  applied? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  other  words,  why  is  it  not  simply  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plaintiff  wants?  He  doesn't  want  the  money  he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  for;  he  wants  a  judgment  that  will  give  him  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.  As  far  as  I  can  tell,  that's  your  argument. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  When  you're  dealing  with  past

MR.  MITCHELL:  There  is  adversity  if  the

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Other  ­­ other  than  the  ­­

MR.  MITCHELL:  If  the  plaintiff  comes  into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court  demanding  more  and  the  defendant  says,  no,  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  entitled  to  that,  there  is  adversity,  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy. 

            

Now,  the  plaintiff  is  not  legally  entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  additional  damages  on  the  merits  if  he's  already  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paid.  But,  again,  that  goes  to  the  merits.  That's  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  Article  III  inquiry. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Redressability  under  Article  III  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

ask  whether  the  plaintiff  is  legally  entitled  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief  he  demands.  He  could  be  making  an  utterly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meritless  claim  for  relief. 

 

 

 

            

But  that's  not  the  Article  III  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article  III  assumes  the  plaintiff  would  have  a  legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement  to  the  relief  demanded  and  asks  whether  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief,  if  granted  by  the  court,  would  redress  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  that  he  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  put  a  lot  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

weight  on  what  the  plaintiffs  ­­ but  there's  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  here,  which  is  the  ­­ the  court's  interest. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You're  being  given  everything  you  want.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say,  well,  we've  had  a  past  injury.  Well,  you  asked  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief  on  that,  and  that  is  what  you're  being  given. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  yet  you  say,  nonetheless,  we're  entitled  to  enlist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  and  the  court's  time.  And  not  only  that,

was  correct? 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  No.  The  Ninth  Circuit 

  

  

 

 

 

assumed,  for  the  sake  of  argument  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  think  that  is  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

same  as  proceed  to  decide  for  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  No.  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  ­­ I 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

don't  agree,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

 

 

 

 

            

There  was  binding  precedent  in  the  Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  already  before  we  got  there,  in  Diaz  and  Pitts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  said  even  an  offer  of  complete  relief  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  does  not  moot  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  the  defendant  throws  up  his  hands  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconditionally  surrenders,  whether  it's  a  class  action 

   

 

 

 

 

or  not,  that  has  nothing  to  do  with  mootness.  It  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justify  a  forced  entry  of  judgment,  but  it  does  not  moot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case. 

 

            

And  that's  the  problem  that  Mr.  Garre  cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  around,  because  Campbell­Ewald  insists  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  district  court  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  you're  ­­ you're  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're  contrasting  a  forced  entry  of  judgment  on  the  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hand  with  mootness  on  the  other.  But  a  forced  entry  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  is  one  of  the  remedies  for  mootness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  No.  Those  are  mutually 

  

  

 

 

 

exclusive.  If  the  case  is  moot,  a  court  cannot  enter  a

to  a  settlement,  the  court  can  enter  a  judgment.

why  settlement  ­­

court  is  entering  a  judgment,  by  definition  the  case  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  moot.  Mootness  requires  a  jurisdictional  dismissal. 

   

  

 

 

 

Mootness  forbids  the  entry  of  any  type  of  judgment.

agreed  to. 

 

            

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  That's  still  a  judgment. 

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  doesn't  go  to  the  merits 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  claim. 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  It  ­­ oh,  it  may  not  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  not  resolve  the  merits  for  purposes  of  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclusion.  That's  correct,  Justice  Scalia,  but  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

still  a  judgment  under  Rule  58.  It  is  court­ordered 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

relief.  And  a  court  cannot  do  that  in  a  case  when  it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lacks  subject­matter  jurisdiction. 

 

 

            

Mootness  and  forced  entry  of  judgment  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mutually  exclusive. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ so  just  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  on  the  facts  without  getting  into  a  dispute,  let's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  the  offer  is  for  the  ­­ all  relief  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  asked  for. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Not  a  question  of 

   

  

 

 

 

what  you  think  they're  entitled  to  or  what  they  think;

fees,  so  there's  no  question  of  cost­shifting  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  like  that.  All  injunctive  relief. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

 

They  come  to  you  and  say,  you  write  the

controversy  that  could  proceed  to  litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  There  is  a  case  or 

   

  

 

 

 

controversy  that  might  lead  to  a  forced  entry  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  if  the  plaintiff,  for  obstinacy  or  other  types 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  reasons,  wants  to  decline  this  offer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

It's  hard  to  imagine  ­­

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What's  ­­ what  is

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ what  is  the

MR.  MITCHELL:  The  controversy  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  wants  a  judgment  of  the  court  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

incorporates  that  relief. 

 

 

              

A  mere  offer  from  the  defendant  is  a  legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

nullity.  He's  not  getting  the  money. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  thought  you 

   

  

 

 

 

said  if  the  plaintiff  is  being  obstreperous  or  whatever, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  the  ­­ just  refusing  to  take  it  for  spite  or

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  what  would  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  say? 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  The  judgment  would  say:  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

asked  for  X.  The  defendant  offered  X.  This  case  is

should  be.  And  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

            

what  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  I  thought  that's 

   

  

 

 

MR.  MITCHELL:  ­­ and  enter  a  judgment. 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ Mr.  Garre  was  arguing. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

He  said  he'd  need  a  judgment. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  No.  He's  saying  it's  moot. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Now,  he's  trying  to  say  that  mootness  allows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  also  to  enter  a  judgment,  but  that's  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contradiction  in  terms  if  it's  moot. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  I  take  it  that  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

judgment  that  you're  talking  about  would  be:  He  offered 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  It's  everything  that  you  asked  for.  We  are

MR.  MITCHELL:  Yes.

may  still  have  to  enforce  the  judgment,  but  that's  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easier  than  enforcing  an  ­­ an  offer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  That's  better  ­ it's  better 

   

  

 

 

 

to  be  ­­ if  somebody  gave  you  the  choice  between  a

the  defendant  is  supposed  to  tender  the  money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

And  when  he  tenders  the  money,  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  won't  accept  it,  he  goes  to  the  court  and  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deposits  the  money  in  the  court.  And  the  court  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  a  judgment  saying,  this  case  is  over. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  what  I  read  here  in  pages  9  to  11, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  have  lots  of  authority,  and  that  gets  rid  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  problem.  And  there's  no  ­­ it  seems  to  me,  well,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  isn't  right,  why  isn't  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

moot. 

            

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  It  may  be  over,  but  it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  MITCHELL:  This  has  nothing  to  do  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  moot  is. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Who  ­­ what  the  judge  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  say,  they  want  $10,000.  What  the  defendant  does  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  says,  they  won't  take  my  check,  which  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certified.  So  he  deposits  it  in  court. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Right.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  judge  at  that  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

should  say,  the  defendant  has  all  he  wants.  The  case  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over.  Goodbye.  And,  of  course,  if  that  person  now  has 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  he  wants,  he  can't  certify  this  is  a  class  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  isn't  harmed. 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  He  gets  judgment  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

merits  in  that  situation. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Fine.  Give  him  judgment  on 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  merits.  Who  cares? 

  

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  It's  actually  a  very 

   

  

 

 

important  distinction. 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why? 

  

 

MR.  MITCHELL:  Because  many  reasons. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  give  me  one. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  All  right.  I'll  start  with 

  

  

 

 

 

 

one.  The  question  presented  ­­ the  question  presented 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

asks  whether  an  offer  of  complete  relief  renders  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  not  interested  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

moment  in  the  question  asked.  I  am  interested  in  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  I  am  asking. 

   

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  All  right.  It  may  very  well 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  that  if  the  defendant  in  that  case  comes  into  court

and  says  the  case  is  over,  the  district  court  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prerogative  to  enter  a  judgment  on  the  merits  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant  because  the  plaintiff  has  already  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paid,  and  the  plaintiff  can't  double­dip.  That  goes  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  merits. 

 

            

But  Campbell­Ewald  never  asked  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

court  for  judgment  on  the  merits. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  that  isn't  what  I  said. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

You  now  sound  as  if  you  are  agreeing  with  the  AFL­CIO. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  I  don't  agree  with  it  because 

    

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  implying  that  that  would  moot  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  they  don't  say  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  of  it  would  be. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

practical. 

            

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Fine. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  I  want  ­­ I'm  being 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  MITCHELL:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  the  practical  thing  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  defendant  wants  to  pay  off  the  plaintiff  by

MR.  MITCHELL:  Yes.  We  agree  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  there  a  way  to  do  it? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

What  they  say  is,  yes,  the  way  to  do  it  is  you  tender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  money  in  a  certified  check,  and  if  he  won't  take  it, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay  the  money  into  court.  And  the  ­­ the  judge  then

MR.  MITCHELL:  Yes,  apart  from  class  action, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  a  more  complicated  question.  But  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  it's  not  a  more 

   

  

 

 

 

complicated  question. 

 

            

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Well,  it  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  In  my  hypothetical,  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

saying,  in  those  circumstances,  do  you  agree  ­­ do  you

thing  that's  left  is,  you'd  like,  says  the  plaintiff, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  certification,  or  at  least  the  lawyer  would. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  The  case  is  not  over  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  talking  about  class  certification,  because  Roper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holds  specifically  that  the  representative  plaintiff  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  litigating  the  class  certification  if

MR.  MITCHELL:  That  was  the  situation  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Roper.  There  was  a  forced  entry  of  judgment  imposed  on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  representative  plaintiffs.  And  this  Court  allowed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  representative  to  continue  litigating  the  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification  issue  because  he  had  a  financial  stake  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  class  certification  decision. 

 

 

 

            

And  Mr.  Gomez,  likewise,  has  a  financial 

   

 

 

 

 

stake.  That's  undisputed  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  is  ­­ what  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  financial  stake  here? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  There  are  two  of  them.  One 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  cost  sharing  of  the  lawyers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well,  the 

  

  

 

 

 

cost  ­­ so  then  that's  fully  satisfied  if  the  offer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covers  attorneys'  fees? 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Yes.  Of  course,  this  ­­ this 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

offer  does  not. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay.  Now,  if  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Yes. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Right. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  was  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one? 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  The  other  one  would  be  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive  award  that  he  would  recover  if  the  class  is

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  incentive  award? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  MITCHELL:  The  incentive  award. 

  

 

 

 

Normally,  a  representative  plaintiff  after  a 

   

 

 

 

class  gets  certified  and  the  settlement  gets  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  ­­ is  there  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern  that  a  plaintiff  who  has  received  or  has  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered  all  relief  that  he  could  receive  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  representative  plaintiff  of  parties  who  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  gotten  all  the  relief? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  That  ­­ that  might  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

something  for  a  court  to  consider  under  Rule  23,  whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  person  is  an  adequate  representative.  But  we  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  is  much  of  a  difference  there  because  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive  award  still  gives  him  incentives  to  press  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fellow  class  members. 

 

 

 

            

where  ­­

 

            

And  this  Court's  upheld  qui  tam  litigation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  the  argument  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  an  individual  plaintiff  who  has  gotten  everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  has  asked  for  ­­ and  I  realize  you  argue  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  the  case  here. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Yes,  not  even  close,  yes.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay. 

  

 

 

MR.  MITCHELL:  But,  again,  that's  only  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  many  reasons  why  we  win  on  the  mootness  question.

exclusivity  between  a  mootness  finding  and  a  forced 

   

   

 

 

 

entry  of  judgment. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Can  I  ask  you  just  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

practical  question?  Is  Mr.  Garre  right  that  this  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  if  he  were  to  proceed,  if  it  were  ­­ the  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  certified  and  you  get  a  judgment,  this  is  a  case 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  class  action  attorneys  are  going  to  get  a  lot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  members  of  the  class  are  going  to  get  virtually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing? 

            

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  would  have  to  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  to  prove  that  at  the  ­­ to  establish  damages, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  you  not,  that  the  members  of  the  class  did  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent  to  receive  these  messages,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  That  ­­ that's  correct.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

it  went  beyond  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  How  would  you  do  that?  How

MR.  MITCHELL:  Yes,  MindMatics. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  you  didn't  sue.  What 

  

  

 

 

 

 

is  the  reason  that  you  went  after  the  contractor  only? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Campbell­Ewald  is  vicariously 

  

 

 

 

liable,  and  they  were  the  ones  that  were  sued.  But... 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  you're  relying  on 

  

 

 

 

 

vicarious  liability? 

 

            

MR.  MITCHELL:  Yes.  The  Ninth  Circuit  found

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

MR.  MITCHELL:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

The  Ninth  Circuit  found  that  the  TCPA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporates  vicarious  liability  and  that  Campbell­Ewald 

 

 

 

 

 

is  vicariously  liable  for  MindMatics'  actions.  And  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  not  appeal  that.  That  is  the  law  of  the  case.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  Mr. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Yang. 

 

            

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ANTHONY  A.  YANG 

 

 

 

 

 

    

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                 

SUPPORTING  RESPONDENTS 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  take  the  opportunity  to  clarify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Article  III  question  by  addressing  the  elements  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  Article  III  case  or  controversy,  an  established 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  practice  that  I  believe  shows  that  an  offer  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  unaccepted  offer,  in  particular,  cannot  moot  a  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  there's  time,  I'd  like  to  address  the  derivative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  immunity  argument. 

 

 

            

First,  there  is  a  distinction  that  this 

   

 

 

 

 

Court  has  established  between  prospective  relief  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrospective  relief.  When  you  seek  prospective  relief,

you  need  to  show  an  ongoing  or  imminent  injury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  that  context,  a  defendant  can  actually 

   

 

 

 

 

halt  the  injury  that's  necessary  by  stopping,  so  long  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  meet  the  voluntary  cessation  doctrine  or  ­­ so  long 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  you  show  that  it's  not  capable  of  repetition  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  in  review.  So  the  injury  with  respect  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prospective  relief,  that  is,  the  injury  that's  occurring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  or  in  the  future,  can  end. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  we're  talking  about  retrospective 

 

 

 

 

relief,  damages,  the  injury  is  in  the  past.  It's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undone.  An  offer  of  money  may  be  compensation  for  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury,  but  the  injury  continues  to  exist. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  purposes  of  Article  III,  the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  there  has  to  be  an  injury.  It  has  to  be  fairly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traceable.  That's  established  by  the  past  injury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ caused  by  the  defendant.  And  the  requested 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial  relief  would  likely  redress  the  injury.  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  requested  relief,  even  when  there's  been  an  offer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is:  I  want  money. 

    

 

            

Second  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I'm  sorry.  Those  are  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

those  are  the  three  requirements  for  Article  III 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing,  but  there's  an  additional  requirement  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adverseness.  None  of  those  three  requirements  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ that  are  set  forth  in  our  ­­ in  our  opinions  deal

with  adverseness.  That's  a  separate  ­­ separate  issue. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  YANG:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  that's  what's  being 

  

 

 

 

 

challenged  here. 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  I  don't  believe  so.  It's 

    

  

 

 

 

embedded  in  the  request  for  relief.  The  plaintiff  comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  court  and  says,  I  want  relief  from  the  court. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  defendant  says,  no,  no,  don't  grant  the  relief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I've  either  ­­ the  case  is  moot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  that's  what's  going  on  here.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  distinction  between  ­­

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  There  has  to  be  injury,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  okay?  It  has  to  be  attributable  to  the  ­­ to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant,  okay.  And  the  court  must  be  able  to  remedy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  None  of  those  three  requirements,  which  are  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classic  requirements,  deals  with  the  quite  separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  of  adverseness. 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  I  believe  it's  embedded  in  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  If  somebody  comes  in  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says,  yes,  you've  been  injured,  the  court  could  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief,  but  I  ­­ I  agree  with  all  of  that,  and  here  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  money. 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Well,  then  the  case  is  not  moot. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  court  can  grant  relief.  The  court  enters  a  judgment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordering  relief,  which  is  enforceable  with  all  the

court's  powers,  which  is  quite  distinct  from  a  judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  dismissal  for  one  of  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  ­­ that's  a  ­­ you  need  to  have  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  needs  Article  III  power  to  direct  a  remedy  against 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant.  It's  quite  unlike  a  dismissal  for  one  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  It's  also  quite  unlike  the  remedy  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacatur,  which  undoes  a  court  judgment. 

   

 

 

 

            

So  Mr.  Garre's,  you  know,  attempt  to  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frame  this  either  as,  you  know,  a  ­­ a  prospective 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

relief  case  or  a  case  where  you're  getting  a  judgment,  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  of  dismissal  for  one  of  jurisdiction  is  not  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable  judgment  in  the  way  that  is  relevant  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  of  Article  III  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Yang,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  do 

   

   

   

  

 

 

understand  what  you  and  Petitioner  ­­ Respondent's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  are  arguing,  which  is  someone,  a  judge,  has  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  at  some  point,  this  is  in  fact  complete  relief  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enter  a  judgment  for  that  complete  relief. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

That's  your  argument. 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  In  part,  I  believe  that's  right. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right. 

  

 

 

            

Parties  could  stipulate.  If  they  ­­ if  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept  an  offer  of  settlement,  that's  like  a  stipulation

MR.  YANG:  The  ­­ and  the  parties  when  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 

  

 

MR.  YANG:  When  they  say,  we've  agreed  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

agree. 

            

            

we  ­­ we  give  up,  the  case  will  normally  be  thought  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  moot. 

 

            

But  there  is  ­­ there  are  several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longstanding  Federal  practices,  both  in  Federal  courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually,  as  well  as  in  State  courts,  that  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reflects  this  point. 

 

 

              

A  party  ­­ parties  can  agree  to  settle  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  but  a  court  retains  jurisdiction  to  enter  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent  decree.  This  is  an  enforceable  judgment. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  Kennedy,  you  talked  about  Kokkonen. 

 

 

 

 

 

This  is  the  great  distinction  between  a  settlement  offer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  a  judgment. 

   

            

The  court  has  authority  to  enter  a  consent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decree  even  after  the  parties  have  settled.  That's  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  an  offer.  It's  actual  ­­ a  settlement. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

Two,  courts  can  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Excuse  me. 

  

 

 

            

It  ­­ it  has  authority  to  enter  that  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  the  case  is  moot;  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  No.  It  ­­

nonetheless  issue  a  judgment  enforcing  that  settlement, 

   

 

 

 

 

no? 

            

MR.  YANG:  The  case  is  not  moot  because  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  are  ­­ are  saying,  we  are  agreeing  on  the  entry

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  ­­ so  even  though  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  have  no  adverseness  at  all  and  they  all  agree  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  outcome  should  be,  but  we  want  a  court  to  go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  this  matter  which  we've  all  agreed  on  because  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  a  judgment?  Is  ­­ is  ­­ is  that  ­­

MR.  YANG:  Our  point  is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Other  cases,  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  moot. 

 

            

            

they  dismiss  it  as  ­­ why  ­­ why  doesn't  that  go  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial?  Or  ­­ or  you  get  the  benefit  of  the  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination? 

            

MR.  YANG:  The  standing  inquiry  has  to,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  be  addressed  at  the  relevant  stage  of  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So,  for  instance,  at  the  pleading  stage,  if  you  failed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  allege  an  injury  sufficient  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  think  you're  wrong.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

think  if  there's  no  standing,  I  don't  think  you  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissed  as  moot.  I  think  you  get  a  judgment  for  the

It's  not  a  resolution  of  the  claim  itself.

address  this. 

 

            

In  a  judgment  where  the  court  says,  I  have 

   

   

 

 

 

 

power  to  ­­ to  enter  relief  that  is  enforceable  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral  proceedings  through  all  the  ­­ the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

great  power  of  a  Federal  court,  that  is  a  big 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

difference. 

              

A  court  requires  Article  III  jurisdiction  to 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  that  power  over  the  litigants.  And  that's  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normally  happens  with  consent  decrees,  with  dismissals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  prejudice,  with  a  judgment  under  Rule  68  offer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  it  also,  conversely,  even  when  a  party's  been  fully 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paid. 

            

The  fact  that  the  defense  of  payment  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accord  and  satisfaction  can  all  be  waived.  So  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end  of  the  case,  if  the  defendant  hasn't  actually  raised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  and  then  belatedly  says,  I  forgot.  I  paid  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

guy,  and  the  claim  was  for  a  thousand  dollars,  the  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  sorry.  Forfeited.  Judgment  for  another  $1,000. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  even  if  a  ­­ even 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  plaintiff  is  given  all  the  relief  to  which  he  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled,  you  say  the  plaintiff  still  has  a  right  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  the  Federal  court  in  that  ­­

right  to  call  ­­ go  into  Federal  court  and  say,  I  know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court,  you're  busy  with  a  lot  of  things,  but  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  want  you  to  hear  my  case  even  though  I've  gotten 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  I  could  get. 

   

 

            

MR.  YANG:  And  I  don't  want  to  mislead  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court  into  thinking  that  we're  advocating  protracted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  on  claims  where  there  is  a  powerful  defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  payment.  That  is  a  merits  defense:  We've  paid  the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  You  don't  ­­ you  can't  get  any  more  money  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me. 

            

But  for  ­­ the  question  of  the  court's  power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  entertain  that  merits  defense  is  what  we're  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ like  the  fact  that  we  have  affirmative  defenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  may  be  waived.  Even  a  res  judicata,  the  court  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  adjudicated  the  very  claim,  and  yet  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  does  not  raise  it,  this  Court  has  held  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  go  to  the  court's  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  so  the  ­­ you  could  get  relief  twice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  is  a  ­­ is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  who  has  been  given  all  the  relief  that  he's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requested,  in  the  view  of  the  United  States,  an  adequate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  representative? 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  This  is,  again,  not  an  Article 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

III  question  but  a  Rule  23  question.

to  be  looking  out  for  the  interests  of  the  class.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  part  of  the  requirement. 

 

 

 

 

              

A  defendant  who  says,  I'll  just  accept  my

Rule  23  ­­ and,  again,  now  we're  stepping

from  Rule  68.

confused  by  your  argument.  You  get  to  say,  on  your  own, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unilaterally,  I  offered  you  complete  relief,  even 

   

 

 

 

 

though,  right  or  wrong,  the  plaintiff  is  asking  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  injunction  and  a  particular  attorney's  fee. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

You,  without  any  judicial  interpretation,

it's  a  settlement  context. 

   

 

            

Everyone  agrees  this  Court  has  repeatedly

There's  two  options  for  this  Court.  One, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  hold  that  the  case  should  be  dismissed  as  moot,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  ­­ if  you  don't  agree  with  that,  then  two,  you  hold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  case  should  be  disposed  of  by  entering  judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  plaintiff  based  on  the  terms  of  the  ­­ of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offer  of  complete  relief. 

 

 

 

            

That's  the  Sixth  Circuit  rule.  You  can  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  look,  as  we  did.  There  are  plenty  of  judgments 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  courts  have  implemented  that  rule.  There's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  any  difficulty  in  applying  that,  and  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  does  is  it  disposes  of  cases  in  a  common­sense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fashion.  It  prevents  court  from  ­­ courts  from  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ahead  and  expounding  on  the  law  in  cases  in  which  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  no  business  doing  so. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  I  could  make  one  point  on  the  immunity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue:  Justice  Ginsburg,  you're  exactly  right.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

sued  the  wrong  party.  MindMatics  did  everything  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  and  we're  at  least  entitled  to  immunity  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vicarious  liability. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon,  at  11:05  a.m.,  the  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
