CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-1491, Charles DeMore versus Hyung Joon


Kim.


General Olson.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Based upon years of experience, study, hearings,


and overwhelming persuasive evidence, Congress concluded


that the prompt removal of aliens convicted of committing


serious felonies was essential to the Nation's ability to


control its borders. 


Detention of these aliens during 

removal proceedings was considered vital by Congress to


effectuate that policy, to prevent flight, to evade


removal, and to prevent harm done by recidivist criminal


aliens.


This is a facial substantive due process


challenge which cannot succeed unless there are no sets


of -- no set of circumstances under which the


congressional policy would be constitutional. 


As this Court has repeatedly --


QUESTION:  General Olson, do -- do we have

authority to entertain this challenge?  As you know, an


amicus has raised a jurisdictional question, and I think


did it maybe in the court of appeals stage as well.  It


certainly did it early on here.


The problem is section 1126(e) which says, no


court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney


General under this section regarding the detention or


release of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial


of bond or parole.  Now, is that provision, number one,


inapplicable or, number two, unconstitutional?  And if


neither of those, why doesn't it mean that we have no


authority to entertain this case? 


MR. OLSON:  Justice Scalia, it's the


Government's position, as held by three courts of appeals,


that that provision does not apply to a habeas corpus 

challenge to the constitutionality of the statute itself,


that the language of that provision relates to challenges


to an action by the Attorney General or administrative


action and does not preclude a challenge. 


QUESTION:  No.  It doesn't -- doesn't say the


challenge -- no.  It says, no court may set aside any


action by the Attorney General.  And -- and what is asked


for here is that we set aside the Attorney General's


action in detailing -- in detaining this alien.


MR. OLSON:  It's -- it's our submission, after

careful examination -- the Government originally took that


position that you've suggested in court proceedings.  It


was rejected by three courts of appeals.  We studied it


further.  The Government studied it further and came to


the conclusion that those decisions were correct and it


would not preclude -- and we're not contending here


today --


QUESTION:  And -- and you're relying on what


language to --


MR. OLSON:  Well, we're relying on the language


that it refers to, and a reasonable construction of the


statute refers to actions, administrative actions, by the


Attorney General or immigration -- administrative action


by administrative officials, and this Court's construction


of statutes against precluding constitutional challenges 

to other statutes.


QUESTION:  Oh, but all of those other statutes


had some wiggle room I think, even St. Cyr, and there just


is no wiggle room here.  It doesn't refer to judicial


review.  It simply says, no court may set aside any action


by the Attorney General under this section.


QUESTION:  Even in the Quirin case where the --


the presidential order said that the people shall have no


access to the courts at all, this Court sat to hear


whether that sort of a provision was constitutional or

not.


MR. OLSON:  That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,


and while it would be in the Government's interest to


preclude this challenge at all, we think a fair reading of


the Court's decisions, including the -- the Court -- the


decision that the Chief Justice mentioned, would to --


would be to construe that statute as not to preclude this


action in this case.  Of course, that would lead -- your


construction would lead to a -- a victory on behalf of the


Government in this case, but we've carefully examined it,


and we think that we're not advocating that position here


today. 


QUESTION:  Well, I appreciate your carefully


examining it, but I'd still like to know what language in


it leads your careful examination to conclude that it does 

not cover this case.  I mean, if it's unconstitutional,


that's another matter. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, we -- we may be --


QUESTION:  Maybe we'll strike it down for that


reason.  But my goodness --


MR. OLSON:  We -- we may be wrong, Justice


Scalia, but we're referring to and relying on the second


sentence which says, no court may set aside any action or


decision by the Attorney General under this section.  It


does not state -- and -- and we think the Court would

construe it as not precluding a challenge to the

QUESTION:  It doesn't refer to the issue.  It


doesn't refer to the basis on which the setting aside is


done.  It doesn't say, may set aside, you know, on grounds


other than -- it doesn't even refer to the basis.  It


says, no court may set aside any action by the --


MR. OLSON:  I understand, Justice Scalia, and


the Government did, indeed, make that assertion, take that


position in early proceedings in this case.  It was


rejected by three courts of appeals.  We came to a


different conclusion after reexamining it, and that's our


position here today.


As this Court has repeatedly stated, Congress 

has exceedingly broad latitude in dealing with aliens,


immigration, and the Nation's borders. 


QUESTION:  Can I have a quick answer just to --


you said a facial challenge.  I've been assuming that it's


a challenge brought by a resident alien who himself has a


plausible claim that the statute doesn't apply to him


because he's saying two -- you know, petty theft with a --


petty theft with a prior is not -- doesn't fall within the


category of crimes.  I don't know if that's right or


wrong, but shouldn't I consider the case of a person who

has a -- an arguable claim that he's outside the system? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, Justice Breyer, the -- the


case has not been litigated on that basis from its very


beginning.  I refer the Court to page 9 of the joint


appendix which is -- which, at the bottom of that section,


articulates the requested relief by the -- by the


respondent in this case.  Petitioner seeks a declaration


that this provision is unconstitutional on its face as


violative --


QUESTION:  It uses those words, I know.  I just


don't know how to consider it that way.  I mean, a person


who had no claim whatsoever -- am I supposed to consider


it on the basis of a person who has -- well, he would get


the removal order entered in 24 hours if he had no claim


whatsoever.


MR. OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  Is that who I'm supposed to consider?


MR. OLSON:  Well, it --


QUESTION:  -- or somebody like the plaintiff


here? 


MR. OLSON:  If this -- not only is it in the


petition for habeas corpus that the individual was


challenging on its face, the district court considered it


on that basis, and the Ninth Circuit considered it on that


basis, and it's been litigated here all the way through by

the -- by the respondent on that basis.  If there was to


be an as-applied challenge, there would be a great deal of


other considerations.


And -- and this -- as this Court has said, the


facial challenge must be rejected unless there are no set


of circumstances under which the congressional policy


would be upheld. 


QUESTION:  General Olson, didn't --


MR. OLSON:  There -- there's been no --


QUESTION:  -- didn't the Ninth Circuit narrow


the group somewhat?  I thought that in the district court,


the district court said the whole thing falls.  I thought


the Ninth Circuit said only as to lawfully admitted --


what was it?  Lawful permanent residents.  And so that was


not taking the whole thing at its face, but only a part of 

the total group.


QUESTION:  I had the same question.  It's at 6a


of the petition for the appendix.  The court of appeals,


in the paragraph at the bottom of 6a, says we stop short


of affirming the holding that it's facially


unconstitutional.


QUESTION:  Right.


QUESTION:  We affirm the grant of habeas corpus


on the ground the statute is unconstitutional as applied


to him in his status as a lawful permanent resident of the

United States. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes, and the Ninth Circuit -- the


Ninth Circuit did say that both on page 6 -- 6a and -- and


on page 30a.  But what -- what the Ninth Circuit did was


issue a broad, sweeping declaration of unconstitutionality


of the statute with respect to a broad class of


individuals, that is to say, all lawful permanent


residents.  That's the equivalent of a facial decision as


to unconstitutionality as to a broad spectrum of the


people covered.  And -- and --


QUESTION:  So it's your position, in effect,


that although the Ninth Circuit said it was an applied


challenge, in fact the Ninth Circuit itself struck it


facially.


MR. OLSON:  Yes, Justice --


QUESTION:  It just narrowed the description of


what it did.  Is that right?


MR. OLSON:  That's -- that is correct, Justice


O'Connor.  That's --


QUESTION:  But it -- but it struck it facially


only with respect to the permanent resident aliens.


MR. OLSON:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  To permanent resident aliens.


MR. OLSON:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Sort of half-facial.

 (Laughter.) 


MR. OLSON:  Mostly facial.


QUESTION:  Mostly facial. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. OLSON:  That's -- that is what the Ninth


Circuit did, and it's our position that this -- this case


must be considered under those circumstances as a facial


challenge.


As I was saying, the Court has repeatedly said


that in connection with immigration and protecting the


Nation's borders, there is no power at which there is more


deference to congressional judgment, no authority under


the Constitution granted more to the political branches,


particularly to Congress.  Congress regularly makes rules,


this Court has said, applicable to aliens that would be 

unacceptable if applied to citizens. 


QUESTION:  Is there a regulation or -- or is


there a policy with -- in the Department of Justice or the


INS which says that there has to be a conviction before


you utilize this section?  Or if the Attorney General just


has information that a felony has been committed, is that


sufficient to detain?


MR. OLSON:  Well, the statute --


QUESTION:  Here there was a conviction.


MR. OLSON:  Here there was a conviction, and

that is specifically what is said in the statute itself. 


It's my understanding --


QUESTION:  Well, the statute itself talks about


a conviction. 


MR. OLSON:  Absolutely.  And -- and what happens


in practice, Justice Kennedy, is that either the removal


proceeding is brought, as Congress has suggested, if


possible, during the period of incarceration of the


individual, or immediately upon release from


incarceration.


So we were talking, to summarize, a -- this --


this provision under 1226(c) applies only to the period of


the removal proceeding itself, which was carefully


distinguished by this Court in its Zadvydas decision of


2 years ago. 


This is on -- compared to that Zadvydas 

decision, not an unlimited, potentially permanent


detention period, what, as the Court suggested in -- in a


distinguishable situation a number of years -- years ago


in the Carlson case involving members of the Communist


Party, a temporary, limited detention for the purpose of


keeping the individual in custody, an individual who's had


a full panoply of due process, having been convicted


beyond a reasonable doubt with full due process of --


QUESTION:  Yes, but General, it is true, is it


not, that there are people in the class who might have

been convicted even before the statute was passed.  So


you're not just -- just continuing detention.  You have to


go out and find them and -- and put them under detention.


MR. OLSON:  It's my understanding, Justice


Stevens, that it applies to convictions after the statute


was passed.  I may be misunderstanding that, and if so,


I'll try to correct that during -- during rebuttal.  But


that to the vast -- that would all -- to the extent that


that might be true and I might be mistaken, that would


only illustrate why this is a facial challenge.  The


statute itself should not be declared unconstitutional,


particularly in connection with individuals convicted


afterwards. 


QUESTION:  What -- what about this particular


individual? 


MR. OLSON:  This was after the statute was


passed, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  General Olson, you've -- you've put


in statistics about the number of -- of aliens who don't


show up for the hearings and the -- the rather low


percentage of those who are ultimately deported from the


class that don't show up and so on. 


On your view of the Government's authority


over -- over aliens and the deference that the Court owes,


would our -- in your judgment should our decision be the

same regardless of those statistics?  If you had told us


nothing about the -- the probabilities of catching people,


should we, on your view, or would we, on your view, be


obligated to defer and simply say it's up to the


Government? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, I think Justice Souter, the


answer to that is that the test that the Court has


consistently applied in this area is there -- is there a


rational basis, is the congressional objective rationally


likely to advance a legitimate governmental purpose. 


Those statistics that we set forth in our brief and which


were before Congress when Congress enacted this statute,


provide the purpose for which Congress acted.


QUESTION:  Well -- well, is that rational basis


review the one we would employ in reviewing legislation 

passed by Congress concerning immigration policy?  And


have we applied a more circumscribed review over the means


of effectuating those policies?  Are -- are there separate


questions?  I mean, the power of Congress to pass the law


and to say what it does versus the implementation of it.


MR. OLSON:  Well, under certain circumstances,


the Court has used that language. 


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. OLSON:  The -- the means to achieve the


objective --

 QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. OLSON:  -- will be looked at possibly


separately.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. OLSON:  But it seems to me -- and it seems


obvious particularly in this case -- that the means are


wrapped up in the objective itself.


What -- it is clear Congress is dealing with a


very difficult problem of a certain category or groups of


aliens that were committing serious crimes in this


country.


QUESTION:  Well, does -- is -- does that -- do


your statistics define that category as the -- the legal


permanent resident aliens or all aliens?  I think it's the


latter. 


it's all.


MR. OLSON:  Well, it is -- yes, Justice Souter,


QUESTION:  But if it -- if it is the latter,


then I don't know that the statistics tell us anything one


way or the other about the legitimacy of the ends, i.e.,


the -- the automatic detention, with -- with respect to


the class that we've got under consideration here. 


MR. OLSON:  What the statistics tell us is that


there were large numbers of aliens committing serious


crimes and that those -- those individuals committing

those crimes were highly likely to be recidivists and that


they were -- that class of individuals or those groups of


individuals were cultivating a criminal class that was


engaging in organized --


QUESTION:  But, General Olson, those statistics


go to the likelihood of entry of the order of deportation,


not of the likelihood of flight which this statute is


directed at. 


MR. OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  As I understand the statistics --


correct me if I'm wrong -- that as to the likelihood of


showing up at the hearing itself, which this statute


protects, 80 percent of the people do show up.


MR. OLSON:  Well, 80 percent --


QUESTION:  Is that correct? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, the -- the statistics have to


be looked at very carefully because that 20 percent --


20 percent of the --


QUESTION:  Eight out of 10 of these criminals


show up. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, no. 


QUESTION:  That's very comforting. 


(Laughter.)


MR. OLSON:  In that -- that -- well, actually


the -- it's -- it's worse than that, Justice Scalia,

because that figure of 20 percent who absconded were


people that had been, during this period of time, been


given individualized hearings.  They were the ones that,


after a hearing, the authorities thought were probably


likely not to flee and 20 percent of that group did.  When


you look at --


QUESTION:  But -- but they include all aliens


and not just the -- the permanent resident aliens.


MR. OLSON:  Yes, Justice Souter, but there's no


question that there were large numbers of lawful permanent


resident aliens that were evading the deportation


proceeding itself.  Once the deportation --


QUESTION:  Well, I presume there was some,


but --


QUESTION: 


Yes, but, General Olson, I wish you 

would answer this question.  It's very important to


understand the -- the Government's position on it.  We're


focusing on the percentage who show up for the hearing. 


Am I -- and that's correct.  That's what this statute is


directed at.  And am I not correct that 80 percent of the


aliens in the class did show up for the hearing without


being detained?


MR. OLSON:  No.  The figure jumped to 40 percent


for people who were never detained at all, Justice


Stevens, and that's explained in the brief.  The

who had absconded.  And we're not talking just about


showing up for the hearing because if that alien isn't in


custody, he won't -- and -- and the figure jumps to


90 percent of people that will escape the deportation


order itself if there --


QUESTION:  But the statute doesn't -- the


statute is not directed at the consequences after the


deportation order has been entered.  Am I not right on


that? 


MR. OLSON:  I -- I respectfully disagree in this


sense, that if you have the alien in custody during the --


the removal period itself, he will be in custody at the 

time the order is issued.


QUESTION:  Oh, I'm sure.


MR. OLSON:  If he's not, it's very difficult for


the Government --


QUESTION:  But if he's at the hearing, at the


conclusion of the hearing, you say, lock this guy up.


MR. OLSON:  Well, that -- that is not the way


the process works, Justice Stevens.  There is a potential


appeal that the individual can take --


QUESTION:  No, but this statute is not directed

at the time during potential appeal.  It's directed at

wrong.


MR. OLSON:  No.


QUESTION:  As I understand the statute, it's


directed at the time before the hearing starts.


MR. OLSON:  Yes, it is, and the Government --


and the Congress --


QUESTION:  So why can't the immigration judge at


the end of the hearing say, A, you're going to be removed,


and B, you -- you go in the clink until your -- you go


away?


MR. OLSON:  Well, but this -- let me answer it


this way.  That 20 to 40 percent -- and the statistics are


difficult in this area. 


There are such large numbers of 

individuals.  We're talking about 15,000 criminals


convicted of serious crimes per year that are -- go


through this process.  If -- if we're losing 20 -- even


20 percent of those individuals that are absconding from


the process and not available for deportation or removal,


that is the -- that is what Congress regarded as a very


serious problem. 


QUESTION:  I grant that --


QUESTION:  But, General Olson, you don't


necessarily lose them.  All you're being asked to do is to

have an individualized hearing as to each member of that


20 percent. 


MR. OLSON:  But that 20 percent, Justice


Stevens -- and it's explained in the brief.  That


20 percent were the individuals for which there had been


an individualized hearing given during that period of time


when that process was taking place.  If you don't have an


individualized hearing, of course, the numbers go up


higher.


QUESTION:  But why can't you deal with that


problem with a standard that's tough, that's different


from having the hearing?  After all, we give bail pending


appeal to criminals who have been convicted.  We give bail


to alien terrorists who are about to be deported.  Why


couldn't you have a tough standard but, nonetheless --

like bail pending appeal, but, nonetheless, give the bail


hearing to the person who's willing to come in and he'd


have to show, you know, he's not going to run away, he's


not a danger, and he has a good issue on the merits?


MR. OLSON:  One of the -- one of the problems


that Congress had is that it had experimented with that


process.  It was not being successful.  The individuals


were absconding notwithstanding --


QUESTION:  I don't think there was a tough


standard.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, it -- it appeared -- it


appeared to Congress and it appeared to the immigration


authorities to be a reasonably tough standard.


The problem with criminal aliens is that once --


once they enter this process, once they've been convicted


after due process of having committed a serious crime and


once they're in that process, which is virtually certain


to lead to removal -- I mean, this is -- removal is


automatic --


QUESTION:  What I -- what I'm worried -- I see


that, and what I'm worried about on the other side of


it -- I'm -- I can see also how you could limit it like to


bail pending appeal, a tough standard.  The other side of


it is the alien who's there and who's the wrong person or


the -- or the statute doesn't apply to him or there's a 

crime that they say he committed which he didn't.  I mean,


there could --


QUESTION:  Isn't he able to challenge those


points? 


MR. OLSON:  Pardon me?


QUESTION:  I thought those points can be


challenged.  I thought he can get a hearing as to those


points. 


MR. OLSON:  That's -- that's correct, Justice --


QUESTION:  We're only talking about people as to

whom it's acknowledged that they committed the crime, it's


acknowledged that they're deportable.  And the only reason


they may not get deported is the Attorney General might


exercise discretion to let them into the country.


MR. OLSON:  That's -- that's precisely correct.


QUESTION:  That is correct.  So if, in fact, I


have a good claim, I'm let out on bail while they're


considering it?


MR. OLSON:  If -- no.  If you have a -- if you


as --


QUESTION:  You can take it to court.


MR. OLSON:  -- and I think it's on page -- pages


26 and 27 of the Government's brief sets forth the -- the


regulations of the -- of the Immigration and


Naturalization Service that provide that you may have an 

immediate hearing if it is not you, if you are a citizen,


if you contend that you didn't -- weren't convicted of a


crime --


QUESTION:  If you have a claim, you're let out


on bail while they consider the claim?


MR. OLSON:  It's my understanding that what


happens is that there's an immediate, or a relatively


prompt individualized hearing.  I'm not positive of the


answer to that question, but there is the hearing that the


Ninth Circuit talked about --

which -- which would have applied all the way across the


board --


QUESTION:  Well, given --


MR. OLSON:  -- in those cases under those


regulations. 


QUESTION:  Given that, General Olson, that we're


only talking about people who have acknowledged -- you


know, who have no claim that they didn't commit the crime,


who have no claim that they are not deportable, why do we


have to rely upon whether 80 percent of them will flee or


90 percent, or even -- you know, or none of them will


flee?  Why is it -- does the Government concede that it's


unreasonable to say, look, somebody who has no right to be 

at large in this country -- he's here illegally, has no


right to be at large.  And besides that, on top of that,


he's already committed a crime in this country.  He should


leave the country, and we're going to hold him in custody


until he leaves.  If he wants to fight that -- that


departure, that's fine, but he will be in custody until he


departs.  What is -- what is wrong with that?


MR. OLSON:  Well, we're -- I'm not quarrelling


with your characterization of what --


QUESTION:  No, but you're -- you're fighting it

on the -- on the ground that somehow we have to prove --


MR. OLSON:  No.  No, Justice --


QUESTION:  -- that a large number of them will


flee.


MR. OLSON:  No.  I'm simply --


QUESTION:  It seems to me that even if none of


them would flee, if they have no right to be here, if


they've committed a crime, why cannot -- they cannot be


held in -- in custody until they leave?


MR. OLSON:  This -- we may well be here on


another occasion defending a broader policy.  But let me


emphasize the facts that distinguish what you're


suggesting and what the Court considered in the Zadvydas


case, an immense difference that exists between the


circumstances here, and the circumstances under those 

circumstances. 


QUESTION:  Before you get to -- to Zadvydas and


the distinction, you -- you make, I take it, no


distinction between lawful permanent residents and people


who are excludable.  People who are lawful permanent


residents have many rights in common with citizens. 


Indeed, this Court once said that they were a suspect


classification.  But as far as this case is concerned, it


seems to me you're making no distinction at all.


MR. OLSON:  The statute makes no distinction.

The Ninth Circuit, of course, did with respect to


excludable aliens, said that with that category of aliens,


the statute -- even under the Ninth Circuit's reasoning,


the statute was constitutional. 


What we -- the statute doesn't make that


distinction, but what it does do is it provides for a


brief, limited detention, which is not unlimited and not


potentially permanent, of aliens, an area of Congress'


authorities at its zenith, convicted beyond a reasonable


doubt with --


QUESTION:  But it might be of a crime that


they -- one of the claims here is that this is not a


qualifying plot -- crime.  I don't get into that box.  Now


that may be wrong or right, but suppose -- on your


reading, or under this statute, someone would not be able 

to get bail despite a good claim that they are counting a


crime that doesn't qualify as one of these serious


offenses.


MR. OLSON:  That's the question that I believe I


addressed earlier that's referred to, the regulations --


and I hope I'm correct -- at pages 26 and 27 of the


Government's brief.  The -- the regulations provide for


someone claiming who is claiming that they are a citizen


as opposed to an alien, or claiming that the crime for


which they've been convicted was not a covered crime,

may -- may have an accelerated hearing, which is -- which


is --


QUESTION:  In other words, for the class that


we're talking about, it's rather artificial to talk about


lawful resident aliens because they can get a hearing on


whether their continuing residence is lawful.  They --


they are determined to be deportable.  They are no longer


lawful resident aliens. 


MR. OLSON:  That -- that is correct. 


QUESTION:  Well, General Olson, aren't they


lawful resident aliens until an order is entered that they


be deported?


MR. OLSON:  What they are is what -- they are --


they are lawful resident aliens until there's an order of


deportation, but --


QUESTION:  All right.  So at the -- at the point


of the -- we'll call it the preliminary hearing, the


Joseph hearing, when they can bring these challenges,


there is no order that they be deported, and they,


therefore, have got to be considered, as I understand it,


as lawful resident aliens. 


MR. OLSON:  They -- however, they have -- they


have been convicted after due process of a crime that


Congress considers serious, and they're being held for a


limited period of time --

QUESTION:  Very well, General Olson.


Ms. Rabinovitz, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDY RABINOVITZ


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The question in this case is whether Congress


authorized and, if so, whether the Due Process Clause


permits a statute that requires that lawful permanent


residents like our client be imprisoned throughout the


duration of removal proceedings. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Rabinovitz, do you have a


response to the jurisdiction problem?  I mean, it's


possible that despite the Government's failure to raise


it, that we could do so.


And why doesn't section 1226 tell the courts to

keep hands off?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  We agree with


the Solicitor General's explanation for why this Court did


not --


QUESTION:  I have to tell you I don't understand


it.  I thought maybe you'd enlighten me there. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  This -- this statute contains


no express language that repeals habeas jurisdiction. 


That's one answer that I could give you, Your Honor, and


based on this Court's decision in St. Cyr and Calcano,


absent that -- that language, the habeas -- there's still


jurisdiction in --


QUESTION:  How could that language not repeal


habeas jurisdiction? 


No court may set aside any action by 

the Attorney General under this section.  How can -- how


can that -- I mean, what can you do in habeas corpus


unless you're setting aside action by the Attorney General


under this section?  How can that possibly not set aside


habeas corpus?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  But this Court has said --


QUESTION:  I mean, now, maybe you want to argue


it's unconstitutional, but gee, to say that it doesn't do


this is -- I mean, it's -- it's incredible.


QUESTION:  Well, the Court in St. Cyr, with

which both Justice Scalia and I disagreed, said something


very much like that, didn't it, that you had to be very


specific if you were going to repeal habeas jurisdiction? 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Try Johnson v. Robson too.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  The point is that this statute


requires the Government to detain individuals like our


client who are lawful permanent residents not because


their detention is necessary to protect the public from


danger of flight risk, but merely because they were


convicted in the past for one of a broad range of crimes


that the Government believes may render them deportable.


QUESTION:  Can -- you say the Government


believes it.  The Congress believed it, did it not?


MS. RABINOVITZ: 


Well, Your Honor, the question 

that remains to be determined in all these cases is


whether an individual is, in fact, deportable.  Congress


did decide that certain kinds of crimes should render an


individual deportable and these individuals have been


convicted of crimes.  But the fact --


QUESTION:  What more do we need?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  The fact that they've been


convicted of a crime, Mr. Chief Justice, doesn't mean that


it's a crime that renders them deportable under the


statute.  And I think that this addresses, in part,

Justice Kennedy's question about have they been -- is this


just that they're suspected of committing crimes or have


they been convicted of crimes. 


QUESTION:  Well, but in -- in this case, your --


your client was convicted, was he not?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --


QUESTION:  So --


MS. RABINOVITZ:  He was convicted, but there


still is a question about whether his conviction actually


renders him deportable.


QUESTION:  And what question is that?  Does


Congress in the statute set forth the crimes?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Your Honor.  Congress sets


forth a -- a broad category of crimes that can render


somebody deportable, and one of those is -- is a broad 

category that are labeled aggravated felonies.


The question, though -- and this is a question


that has been very hotly litigated in the courts -- is


whether a conviction is an aggravated felony.  And in this


case, that question is especially relevant because in our


client's case, the conviction that he was --


QUESTION:  Well, did -- did you -- but the Ninth


Circuit didn't go off on that basis, did it?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Your Honor.  The Ninth


Circuit --

 QUESTION:  So are you going to -- are you going


to defend the Ninth Circuit's basis here?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  We're defending the Ninth


Circuit's ruling, Your Honor.


I'm -- I'm just explaining that this issue about


whether somebody is deportable is an open issue, and


that's precisely what the -- that's precisely what a


deportation proceeding is to determine.


QUESTION:  Now, Ms. Rabinovitz, I had -- I had


understood from General Olson -- and please, you know, if


it's wrong, I -- I want to know it -- that -- that your


client could get a hearing on that particular issue,


whether the crime he's being -- he has been convicted of


is one of the crimes that entails deportation.  Is -- is


not true that he can -- that he gets a hearing on that? 

MS. RABINOVITZ:  He gets a hearing --


QUESTION:  Individualized hearing.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  He gets a hearing, Your Honor,


but it's a very limited hearing to the extent that that


hearing does not determine that he has, in fact, been


convicted of a crime that renders him deportable.  All


that it --


QUESTION:  In other words, it's a hearing that


says you were convicted of X or you weren't convicted


of X.  It's not a hearing that says that X renders you

deportable.  Is that the point?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, although, Your Honor, it


does say that the Government is not substantially unlikely


to prevail on its charge, so -- that you are deportable. 


So -- and essentially it --


QUESTION:  So it --


MS. RABINOVITZ:  -- it says that there is


reason -- there's a possibility.  It's not impossible that


you will be found deportable.  You -- that it's not --


since the Government is not substantially unlikely to


prevail on the charge. 


I think it's important to recognize that there


are many individuals who are subjected to mandatory


detention under this statute who cannot satisfy that


standard. 


In fact, that that -- they've had that hearing 

and the court has held the Government substantially -- you


know, we can't show that the Government is substantially


unlikely to prevail. 


QUESTION:  I mean, I have a reason.  I mean, now


I am -- I'm confused on this and I'd appreciate it.  I --


I assume there is someone in prison.  He's detained like


your client.  There's a class of people.  There are two


subgroups.  Group 1 is a group that has no non-frivolous


argument that they shouldn't be deported.  It's virtually


conceded they're -- they should be deported.  Their only

arguments against it are frivolous.  Group 2 are people


who have a real non-frivolous argument -- a real non-


frivolous argument -- that they aren't -- it's the wrong


person, this crime doesn't fall within the statutory


definition, I probably will get asylum, something like


that.  They have a real non-frivolous argument. 


Now, I thought that what we were talking about,


at least in part, was that people in this group 2 were


being held without bail.  Now, am I right?  Because I


think what I heard the Solicitor General say is I'm wrong. 


We're only talking about people in group 1.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  No --


QUESTION:  That was just, I think, what Justice


Scalia was concerned about.  That's just what I'm


concerned about, and I'd appreciate some elaboration on 

it. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Your Honor.  You're


absolutely right.  We are talking about the second


category of cases.


QUESTION:  But aren't there one-and-a-half or --


there's this Joseph hearing.  It's not just that either


you have a hearing or you don't have a hearing.  You have


the hearing that Justice Souter was referring to where


your burden is enormous because you will not succeed at


that hearing if you show it's more likely than not that

this crime is -- doesn't qualify as serious.  You have to


show overwhelmingly that the Government will win on that


issue in it.  So -- but there is something other than --


There's this Joseph hearing, which you say is not


adequate, is it? 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Your Honor. 


It's exactly --


QUESTION:  You're -- you're not asking just for


individualized hearings on those items, are you? 


You're -- you're not just asking for individualized


hearings on whether you are the person that did the --


that -- that was convicted and whether the -- the crime of


conviction causes you to be deportable.  You want a


hearing on whether, if you are let go, you will show up


for -- for a later hearing.


And I don't see why -- why that is necessary --


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes --


QUESTION:  -- so long -- so long as you get a


hearing on those other substantive points, it seems to me


the Government ought to be able to hold you, an alien who


has no right to be at large in this country, until you


leave.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Let me try -- let me try to


explain how the statute works and why we believe that it's


a problem.  The -- the proceeding that you're asking for,

a determination about whether, in fact, an individual is


deportable, is precisely what a deportation hearing is


for, and that kind of decision is not made the first time


you come before an immigration judge.  It's often a very


protracted process, and we have individuals who have --


who have been in jail for 17 months pending an immigration


judge hearing to determine that exact question, Justice


Scalia, about whether they are, in fact, deportable, which


is why we say that the relevant question is whether


pending those proceedings, there's a regulatory purpose in


detaining that individual.  And we're not --


QUESTION:  Well, and the -- the Government


answers that there's a substantial number of people who


don't show up for these hearings, and that's the purpose


of holding them. 


So that certainly is a regulatory 

purpose.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is


a regulatory purpose.  But this Court looks to the


regulatory purpose in an individual's case when you're


talking about depriving somebody of a significant liberty


interest, which is what's here.  We don't allow people to


be locked up based on averages.


QUESTION:  Well, but you -- look -- look at the


immigration cases.  Look at Carlson against Landon. 


I mean, that certainly was a class, not an individual.

 MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Your Honor, Mr. Chief


Justice.  I respectfully -- I read Carlson differently. 


In Carlson, what this Court did is it upheld the Attorney


General's discretionary decision that five individuals


could be detained because there was -- that -- the


decision to detain them was with not -- was not without


reasonable foundation.  It was a discretionary decision. 


It's wholly different from this case. 


What makes this statute so unique and so


unprecedented is that the Government is prohibited. 


There's no discretion here.  The Attorney General is


prohibited from releasing individuals like our client, a


lawful permanent resident who has a legal right to be


here, even when --


QUESTION: 


Well, who has the legal right to be 

here, although he's been convicted of a crime which makes


him deportable.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's


not clear that this conviction makes him deportable.  In


fact --


QUESTION:  Well, it's clear he's been convicted.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  He's been convicted of a crime,


but it's not clear that this conviction renders him


deportable.  That's precisely what a deportation


proceeding is for.

 QUESTION:  You mean the first degree burglary

MS. RABINOVITZ:  Both --


QUESTION:  -- is not an aggravated felony?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Not necessarily, Your Honor. 


That remains to be determined, but --


QUESTION:  Well, how could a first degree


burglary not be an aggravated felony?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  That's a good question,


Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Well, it's a very good question. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  But -- but -- yes.  But let me


point out -- I refer you to the -- the amicus brief for --


by Citizens and -- and Immigrants for Equal Justice.  It's


one of these green briefs.  And it's on page 12 of their


brief.  They referred to a case, the Solorzano-Patlan


case, where an individual was convicted of entering an


automobile with intent to commit theft, and the Board of


Immigration of Appeals said -- or the -- the -- excuse me. 


The immigration judge said exactly what -- what you have


said, which is that how could this crime not be an


aggravated felony?  It's a burglary, entering an


automobile with intent to commit theft.

this person -- excuse me -- he wasn't our client -- was


detained, the Seventh Circuit disagreed.  Despite what the


Board of Immigration Appeals said that how could this


crime not be a burglary --


QUESTION:  Well, but -- it's not just a question


of being a burglary.  First degree burglary usually means


with -- with people present and on the premises.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice --


QUESTION:  Of course, the Seventh -- Seventh


Circuit might have been wrong.


(Laughter.) 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  That's a good point, Your


Honor, but the Government did not petition for cert in


that case. 


And -- and the point that I want to make --

QUESTION:  Well, it sounds like you're -- you're


still seeking some kind of facial invalidation of the


statute rather than as applied to your client.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  No, Your Honor, we're not


seeking --


QUESTION:  Because you're relying on a


conviction of someone else for a different kind of a


crime. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  No.


QUESTION:  Are we talking about this person as

an as-applied challenge, or do we have a facial challenge?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Your Honor, this is definitely


an as-applied challenge, and I refer you to page --


QUESTION:  So we are talking about the first


degree burglary --


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, we are.


QUESTION:  -- not entering a car with intent to


commit theft. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Right, right. 


My point with raising that example was just to


point out that the question of what constitutes an


aggravated felony is very contested.


QUESTION:  And isn't it the --


QUESTION:  Well, but not in this case.


QUESTION:  Not in this case.  First degree


burglary. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Oh, it -- it certainly is.  It


remains a question about whether this is an aggravated


felony --


QUESTION:  Well, but --


MS. RABINOVITZ:  -- because you need to look at


the precise --


QUESTION:  Justice Breyer's classification of


people who have really serious claims and people who have


frivolous claims -- surely a claim that first degree

burglary is not deportable under the statute would verge


on the frivolous. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, I need to --


to disagree with you.  It's unclear.  To decide whether


this is -- is an aggravated felony, the Court is going to


need to look at the specific language of the statute. 


The -- the specific crime that our client committed was he


broke and entered into a tool shed and he was convicted


under California State law.  This is a very complicated,


technical area of the law.


And all that I can tell you is that if you refer


to our brief at page 5, note 6 -- oh, no.  Excuse me. 


That's not the place.  To our brief at -- our brief at


page 30, note 27, we note numerous examples where the


question of whether something is an aggravated felony has 

been contested and decided --


QUESTION:  Do you -- you consider whether he


broke into an inhabited tool shed, I guess, to be not


within the statute, and the other side thinks it is.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Right.  Right.  Right.


QUESTION:  In your opinion, would -- would --


and this goes back to my initial question which I'm


still -- haven't heard you really answer.  Look, on


appeal, somebody who has been convicted of a crime, in


order to get out on -- on appeal -- have bail on appeal,

he has to show not only he wouldn't run away, not only he


isn't a danger, but also that he raises a substantial


question.


Now, suppose that we were to say at least those


people who show that they raise a substantial question --


a substantial question -- and it says not for purposes of


delay -- that as to those people, you have to have an


individualized hearing. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  In this case, if we're talking


about somebody who raises a non-frivolous challenge like


our client, that would satisfy this case because this


is --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm not saying if it'd satisfy


the case, though I take it from what you say it would


satisfy you and your position.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Your Honor, I misspoke.  What I


meant is that in this case, this is an as-applied


challenge.  It's a -- it's a challenge about whether this


statute as applied to our client who's a lawful permanent


resident, who has bona fide challenges that he is not


deportable and is eligible for relief from deportation,


that in this case, applying the statute to him is


unconstitutional. 


QUESTION:  So to keep someone in prison without


bail, after they've been convicted of something, pending a

deportation order is not constitutional without an


individualized hearing at least if -- or don't say at


least -- if, among other things, he shows there is a


substantial question not for purposes of delay.  Imagine


an opinion that said that.  Would you argue for or against


that opinion? 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  I would argue for that opinion


in this case because it would resolve this case.  I


believe that there also might be -- there would be a


constitutional issue that even somebody else -- due


process requires that they have an opportunity to show


that they're not a danger and a flight risk because that


is the purpose of regulatory detention.  And as the --


QUESTION:  I -- I note that you have redefined


substantial question as non-frivolous.  Anything that's


not sanctionable raises a substantial question for


purposes of -- of this new rule?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Wow.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  -- and -- and it has to be that


way because there are so many examples of circuit courts


finding that the board's decision about what constitutes a


deportable offense is wrong and yet, that those were cases


where the individual could -- where their -- their claim


might have been considered bordering on the frivolous,

even though it wasn't. 


And let give you a very --


QUESTION:  That -- that is true but all --


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Let me give you an example.


QUESTION:  -- all of -- at least for people who


have committed their crimes after this statute was


enacted, it seems to me that they are on notice.  If you


get convicted of a felony, your -- your welcome in this


country is at an end if it's an aggravated felony, and you


will be held until it is -- it is finally determined


whether that is, indeed, an aggravated felony or not. 


I don't know that that's terribly unfair.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  But your question presupposes


the answer.  You're saying --


QUESTION:  No, it doesn't. 


It -- it's just one 

of the risks you take when you commit a felony.  Your --


it's -- it's part of -- of the condition of your


admittance to this country.  Once this statute is passed,


any lawful resident alien knows that if he commits a


felony and it's an aggravated felony, he will be deported.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Two points.


QUESTION:  And -- and until the question of


whether it is an aggravated felony, assuming it's at least


arguable, is decided, he will be held in custody and not


permitted to be at large in this country.

 Now, that doesn't strike me as terribly


unreasonable.  Just don't do the felony.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Well, two points, Your Honor. 


First, in this case, the conviction that is now being


considered as possibly an aggravated felony was committed


before the statute took effect.  So even under Your


Honor's proposal, the statute could not apply to him.


In terms of what you're suggesting, though, if


Congress was to say that anybody who -- there still is an


issue of whether somebody is, in fact, deportable, and to


condition -- and -- and this Court has recognized that


individuals who are facing deportation, particularly


lawful permanent residents, have a right to a fair


hearing.  To say that those individuals must give up their


right to physical liberty --


QUESTION:  Well, but there's no question that


these people are going to get a fair hearing eventually. 


The question you're challenging is whether they should


be -- be incarcerated pending that hearing.  So we're not


talking about a fair hearing.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  You're right, Your Honor,


Mr. Chief Justice.  But the -- the point is that if


somebody is locked up for a year-and-a-half, and they


can't get the evidence for their case, because being


locked up in jails also makes it much harder for people to

present their cases, there's no right to appointed


counsel.  It means they can't work.


There are -- and this is, again, where I would


like to refer you, just in general, to the amicus brief by


the Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice which points


out other cases where individuals gave up their claims


because otherwise they were going to be in detention for


so long.


And let me just point out one other --


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you've got someone who


is an alien here.  The alien has committed a felony. 


I mean, it's difficult to -- for me to say that they


should have all these additional benefits so that somehow


they can avoid deportation.


MS. RABINOVITZ: 


Well -- well, first of all, 

Mr. Chief Justice, this -- it's not only for people who


are convicted of felonies.  Even the definition --


QUESTION:  Well, but that's with the case we're


dealing of here. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Okay, but the -- the question


is what -- what constitutes an aggravated felony. 


Misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony as well. 


You're right.  In this case, the initial conviction --


QUESTION:  What -- what do you -- what do you


mean, misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony?

 MS. RABINOVITZ:  I know it's somewhat shocking,


Mr. Chief Justice, but, in fact, the way that aggravated


felony has been defined so broadly --


QUESTION:  Well --


MS. RABINOVITZ:  -- the courts have held that


even misdemeanors can be aggravated felonies. 


QUESTION:  But there's no question that first


degree burglary is not a misdemeanor.  So, in our case,


that's not -- we don't have to worry about that, do we?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  But let me return to the point


about whether it's -- whether due process is satisfied by


requiring that somebody be mandatorily detained throughout


the process of their deportation proceeding, a process


which, as I said, can be months, often years, without any


individualized determination of danger and flight risk. 

And the example that I wanted to give ties back


with this Court's decision in St. Cyr, which said that


212(c) relief was available to individuals whose


convictions -- who had pled guilty prior to -- to the


statute having taken effect.  All of those individuals


were subject to mandatory detention under the statute. 


Their claim would have been considered close to frivolous


until the Supreme Court ruled differently. 


QUESTION:  Well, that's -- that's -- I mean,


your argument to me rings true for people who have real

claims, but if you're trying to apply it to a person who


has an insubstantial claim or a claim that is interposed


for purposes of delay, I'm tempted to say, well, there's a


very good reason to keep him locked up, namely, he doesn't


have any argument and he's about to be deported and -- and


if he wants to be deported quickly, he can be. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Your Honor, that's --


QUESTION:  But if he has a substantial claim,


it's different. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Your Honor, I think it's


important to recognize that that's precisely the kind of


factors that the Immigration Service and the immigration


judge looks at when they make a determination whether


somebody should be released on bond.  They -- when they're


determining flight risk, that's precisely what they look 

at.  They say, oh, this is a frivolous -- this is a


frivolous claim.  We're not going to release this person


on bond because they're not going to show up.  And we're


not saying that individuals in that situation should be


released from detention. 


All that we're saying is that an individual


needs to be given some opportunity to demonstrate, look,


I was convicted of this crime, but I have claims for


relief.  I'm not a flight risk.  I'm not a danger.


QUESTION:  Would you say that --

 MS. RABINOVITZ:  And I think it's important to


look at --


QUESTION:  Would you agree that the alien has


the burden of showing that?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Your Honor, we have no --


QUESTION:  In your -- in your regime, you


would -- would there be any problem putting the burden on


the alien to show that?


MS. RABINOVITZ:  We have no problem with


Congress creating a presumption that individuals who are


charged with these kinds of -- with being deportable for


these kinds of crimes are a danger and are a flight risk,


and that they need to come forward to show that they're


not.  And in fact --


QUESTION: 


Well, but I -- I'll get to that in a 

minute.  But insofar as the substantiality or -- or the


likelihood of prevailing -- forget about flight risk for a


moment.  Insofar as the likelihood of prevailing and the


substantiality of the -- of the issue, that's almost what


the statute already provides for in a bail determination


hearing, as set forth on page 26 of the Government's


brief.  A person in INS custody is -- is entitled to a


bond determination hearing.  And the standard is whether


or not the Government is -- he has to show the Government


is substantially unlikely to prevail.  That's very --

forget flight risk for a moment.  That is very close to


the regime that you propose.  So I don't see what we're


arguing about here as to that.


Now, if you want to say that you're entitled to


release if you're not a flight risk, that's something


quite different.  And I would -- and I would doubt the


latter, but --


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Let me try to clarify what I


believe is some confusion about what that hearing does. 


The hearing essentially just shows you need to show that


the Government has no frivolous claim.  That's essentially


what you need to show.  I mean, you have to show that the


Government had -- that the Government's charge is


frivolous.  And I would assume that the Government is not


putting people into proceedings if they have no possible 

argument.  But to require that an individual be locked up


throughout the whole deportation process just because they


cannot show that the Government has a -- has a frivolous


claim, that doesn't satisfy due process. 


In terms of burden, Your Honor, what I was


referring to -- what I thought you were referring to is


whether an individual is going to have an obligation to


show that they're not a danger of flight risk.  But


even --


QUESTION:  Well, perhaps that's why I asked you

that question first.  It -- it does seem to me that if you


concede that he has the burden, that that is really very,


very close to what the -- the statute already provides,


forgetting about flight risk for the moment, or -- or --


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  I don't --


I don't see it that way.  I see that the question about if


you need -- if an individual has to prove that the


Government's argument is frivolous, that's not the same


thing as showing that you have a non-frivolous claim.  And


that's all that we're saying.  I think that they're


completely different.  One is showing that the


Government's argument is frivolous.


I don't -- most of the cases where individuals


were found not deportable, it wasn't that the Government's


claim was frivolous, but those individuals prevailed in 

their proceedings.  And that's the issue here, whether --


whether an individual can be detained for a substantial


period of time without any opportunity to show that --


that there's no purpose that's served by their detention.


And I think that -- that this case is a perfect


example because in this case, once the district court --


our client was detained for 6 months without any


individualized determination.  The district court then


said due process requires an individualized determination,


and the INS, the Immigration Service, on its own decided

he poses no danger and he can be released on 5,000-dollar


bond.  And he's been out for the past 3-and-a-half years. 


He's now getting his college degree.  He's working.


If the Government prevails in this appeal, it


will have no choice but to re-incarcerate him throughout


his proceedings.  It's not a question of discretion like


Carlson, where they can make that determination. 


And going back to your question about burden, I


think it's important to recognize that the regime that was


in place prior to this statute, and that is now in place


in those circuits where they've said that the statute


needs to be interpreted to -- or that the statute -- due


process requires an individualized determination, still


requires that an individual show that they are not a


danger of flight risk.  They bear that burden.  And so


under this system, no individual who's a danger of flight


risk is going to be released except for those cases where


there's, you know, obviously going to be error.  But in


general, individuals who are a danger of flight risk


aren't going to be released. 


I think it -- there's one last point that I


would like to make because I realize my time is short,


which is that this case poses a serious constitutional


problem, and we believe that there is a way that this


Court can avoid that problem by construing the statute to

not apply to individuals like our client who are, in fact,


not deportable. 


The statute says that individuals shall be


mandatorily detained.  An individual who is deportable on


one of these grounds is subject to mandatory detention. 


As we've been talking about here, in fact, the question of


whether he is deportable remains very much to be decided. 


He doesn't have any order of deportation.


QUESTION:  Ms. Rabinovitz, why wasn't Judge


Fletcher absolutely right in rejecting that claim? 


Because the language is when the alien is released from


criminal custody. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Because --


QUESTION:  The statute directs custody when the


alien is released from criminal custody, and not at some 

later time, not at the time of the issuance of a removal


order. 


MS. RABINOVITZ:  Because I think that what Judge


Fletcher was not aware of is that the whole regime right


now that the Immigration Service has is to conduct


deportation proceedings while individuals are still


serving their criminal sentence, which makes complete


sense, because then you do not have this problem.  People


are already ordered deported, determined deportable while


they are still in jail.  And so the --

 QUESTION:  But still, if the statute says when


released from criminal custody, even before release, but


it doesn't say at the later time of the final removal


order.


MS. RABINOVITZ:  There's two different issues,


Justice Ginsburg.  One is when -- is deportable.  It says,


when released.  Our point is only that there are


individuals who have deportation proceedings while they're


in prison, and there will be an immigration judge decision


or a BIA decision that says they are deportable.


Now, they may still be seeking review of that


decision in the Federal courts, in which case, that


decision is not final and they would not fit under the


next statute, the statute that you -- that this Court


construed in -- in Zadvydas, which was 1241, but they 

would -- or excuse me -- 1231.  But they would still have


an order of deportation, and then, that would be a way to


say that individual is deportable.


Whereas, here you have a situation where anybody


who the Government charges with being deportable -- in


this case, our client, even though he may not actually be


deportable -- is subject to mandatory detention for


possibly a year, 2 years, however long. 


I see my time is up.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Rabinovitz.

 Mr. Olson, General Olson, you have 4 minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


QUESTION:  General Olson, I don't want to


intrude upon your rebuttal time, but I have one question


that's very important for me and you can answer it yes or


no.  Assuming I disagree with you as to the reading of the


statute as to whether there is jurisdiction in this case,


if there is no jurisdiction, is that provision of the


statute in the view of the Government unconstitutional? 


MR. OLSON:  No.  Now, we haven't briefed and


studied that and -- and I have to rely on the answer that


I gave before.  But I think that that would be a correct


with -- it would be within the power of Congress to do 

that under certain circumstances. 


QUESTION:  Well, you can rely on the presumption


of constitutionality if you haven't briefed it. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. OLSON:  Well, then I would've have to answer


the question differently. 


Well, if -- I guess no, I guess I would --


that -- that's a good answer. 


Let me -- let me --


(Laughter.)

 MR. OLSON:  Let me just deal with a few things


that were raised during my colleague's argument. 


First of all, the date of the offense that's


involved in this case was after the enactment of this


statute.  On page 8 of the respondent's brief, it is


asserted that he was convicted of petty theft with priors


and sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment in 1997.  That was


when that conviction took place. 


Secondly -- and I think a lot of time has been


expended with respect to the question that focused in


large part by Justice Breyer.  What happens if it's not


the individual?  What happens if he's really a citizen? 


What happens if he wants to challenge whether this crime


was one that should be covered?


As we said on page 26 -- and we cite the 

relevant provision of the INS regulations -- those types


of things can be challenged in an individualized bond


hearing at which the -- which is what the Ninth Circuit


was talking about and which is what our opponents are


talking about here, and that those issues may be raised at


that point, which is precisely what the respondents are


talking about.  So that's already built into the statute.


Now, one might quarrel with whether -- what the


burden of proof is, and where it should be and how it


should be written, but that's a -- this is a determination

by the executive branch with respect to the statute.  If


the alien can show that the INS is substantially unlikely


to prevail on its underlying charge of removability, then


the individual may be released on bond.  If the decision


goes against the individual, that can be taken to the


Board of Immigration Appeals.  So there's a process that


takes care of precisely those -- that category 2, as you


put it. 


Now, that does not deal with the question of


dangerousness or risk of flight, but that's what Congress


was concerned about when it -- when it enacted the


statute.  Congress was concerned about a situation in


which large numbers of individuals who commit serious


crimes -- and Congress went to the effort of define what


it thought -- defining what it thought was serious crimes. 

Now, if there is some question about that in an


individual case, or if there's some question about an


aberrational lengthy detention, that should be brought to


this Court or the courts below in an as-applied challenge. 


The respondent is saying here today that this is an


as-applied challenge, but that has never been the way this


case has been litigated from the petition, which I cited


as a facial challenge, through the district court's


decision to the -- to the as -- the -- the facial


challenge in part of the decision of the Ninth Circuit. 


56

This has been a challenge to the congressional


determination that people who commit serious crimes are


to -- to be deportable as rapidly as possible. 


They -- and -- and to the -- in order for that


policy to be effectuated, for our borders to be protected,


to avoid the acculturation of a criminal alien class in


the United States that's operating freely, for a limited


period of time, that individual will be detained during


that process until the final order of deportation is


entered. 


85 percent of the aliens that are brought into


these procedures don't even challenge the immigration


decision -- immigration judge decision, and more than half


of those cases are resolved within 30 days.  The


statistics are in the brief.


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson.


MR. OLSON:  Thank you. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
