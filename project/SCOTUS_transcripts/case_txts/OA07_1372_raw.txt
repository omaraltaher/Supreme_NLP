 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in case 07-1372, Hawaii 
versus the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.

 General Bennett.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MARK J. BENNETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BENNETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 A 1993 congressional apology resolution did 
not alter Hawaii's right to transfer its public lands or 
repeal, by implication, prior congressional enactments 
that it extinguish all competing claims to those lands. 
It was, as its sponsor said at the time, a simple 
apology, and no more.

 The lands in question were the former Crown 

and government lands of the Kingdom of Hawaii.  The 
Republic of Hawaii was the successor in interest and 
ownership to those lands and was recognized as such by 
the United States.  The 1898 Newlands Resolution of 
Annexation recited that the Republic of Hawaii was 
ceding the absolute fee ownership of those lands to the 
United States, and that that cession was accepted, 
ratified and confirmed.  Once the United States Congress

so acted, all competing claims to title were 
extinguished, and under precedent going back almost 
200 years, the determinations by Congress to accept the 
cession were final and conclusive on any court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Excuse me.  Does that 

proposition settle the question whether your opponents 
have equitable interest in the lands?

 MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, what the 

Respondents have contended from day one in this case is 
that they have a property right in this -- in the land, 
and the Newlands Resolution conclusively settled that 
question.  There is no property interest that could have 
competed with the United States as perfect title.  That 
perfect title was passed to the State of Hawaii in 1959 
through the 1959 Hawaii Admission Act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But would the state of 

Hawaii, under Hawaii law, be entitled to take the 
position, if it so chose, that as the new owner of the 
lands, it has a special duty as a trustee that some 
other owner might not?

 MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, the Admission Act 
gives the State the right to manage and dispose of the 
lands according to State law.  So the political branches 
certainly have the right to decide which lands they are 
going to use for which of the five purposes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then -- then it's just 

a question of whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court --
assuming that it made the decision that I hypothetically 
stated -- whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court, as opposed 
to Hawaiian legislature, could make the determination of 
whether or not there is some special trust obligation 
imposed on the State of Hawaii by reason of its own 
duties.

 MR. BENNETT:  But, Your Honor, in this case 
what Respondents urged was that the Apology Resolution 
changed the legal landscape and commanded the State to 
hold these lands possibly in perpetuity without 
alienation.  The Hawaii Supreme Court specifically found 
that the Apology Resolution dictated the results here, 
that plaintiffs claims did not even arise until the 
Apology Resolution was signed into law by President 
Clinton.  In addition, the plaintiffs -- the Respondents 
urged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court a property right, a 
property and ownership interest in these lands.  Even if 
--

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, General Bennett, if 

I understand correctly, looking to your question 
presented, the only thing before us is the effect of the 
Apology Resolution.  The question presented doesn't say 
anything about the Admissions Act or the Newlands

Resolution.  So shouldn't we just stick to the question 
as you presented it?  Whatever the picture is, does the 
Apology Resolution have any substantive effect?

 MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, that certainly is 

one question before the Court, but we believe fairly 
included in that question is the issue of the nature of 
the State sovereign authority.  The question presented 
talks about whether the Apology Resolution changed in 
any way the State's sovereign authority, and that 
question -- certainly interior and predicate to an 
intelligent resolution of that question is the nature of 
the State sovereign.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why is it necessary?  Why 
isn't it sufficient just to say that this resolution has 
no substantive effect, period, and then remand to the 
Hawaii Supreme Court?

 MR. BENNETT:  Because, Your Honor, the 

Hawaii Supreme Court's decision also rests on a premise 
foreclosed by Federal law, that is that there are 
competing claims to title.  As late as page 18 of the 
red brief, Respondents even say now that Native 
Hawaiians are entitled to these lands as a matter of 
property law, but they do not say anywhere in the red 
brief how that property law claim arises or how that 
property law claim could survive the Newlands

Resolution, the Hawaii Organic Act, or the Admission 
Act.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  General, the difficulty I 
have is that not only do they not say, so the Supreme 
Court of Hawaii didn't say so either.  And it seems to 
me that we would be well advised to make sure that we 
understand the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Hawaii 
before we start talking about the relationship between 
the various Federal statutes and whatever this claim may 
be.  I simply don't understand the claim myself.

 I do understand your point, because I think 
this much is clear from the Hawaiian opinion:  That they 
think the Apology Resolution seriously affects the 
claim.  That we can deal with, but once we get out of 
that, the -- the whole case seems murky to me.  Am I 
missing something?

 MR. BENNETT:  Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii 

Supreme Court, at page 69a of the appendix for the 
petition, says that this was a claim seeking an 
injunction -- injunctive relief with regard to property 
rights.  At page 87a of the petition appendix, the 
Hawaii Supreme Court said there are questions regarding 
the title to the State's ceded lands.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There -- there may well 

be, but then the Hawaii Supreme Court chose its grounds,

and it said at one point the resolution dictates the 
preservation of the ceded lands.  At another place it 
said that Federal law provides the basis for its 
decision and that State trust law is interwoven with 
that Federal law.  It also said that Federal law grounds 
the decision and provides the governing legal standards.
 Now, they could not have been clearer.  They 
repeated at least five times that their decision rested 
on the resolution, that everything turned on that 
resolution having substantive effect.  That's why they 
said that their decision was driven by Federal law.  And 
I don't know why we shouldn't take the Hawaii Supreme 
Court at its word repeated so many times.

 MR. BENNETT:  Well, Your Honor, we believe 

that Respondents' attempt to trivialize this Court's 
jurisdiction -- they say, for example, in the brief in 
opposition that even if this Court were to reverse, the 
Hawaii Supreme Court will simply reinstate the exact 
same decision, and presumably they would press upon the 
court the exact parameters they've pressed for 14 years 
--

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We don't --
MR. BENNETT:  -- that is --
JUSTICE BENNETT:  We don't know that for 
sure.  It may well be, but there is a large -- large

difference, and if they're relying on Federal ground 
that insulates them from any checks by the Hawaii 
polity, but if they are forced to rely on State law, 
then it's up to the people of Hawaii whether they like 
it or not.  They could change the State statutory law, 
equitable notion, constitutional law.  But by doing what 
the Hawaii Supreme Court did, they have taken the case 
out of the realm of State law, subject to the political 
check, put it on Federal grounds.

 So I think that that's what -- the issue 

properly before this Court, and not anything about the 
interpretation of the Admissions Act, which -- if it's 
implicit in your question, it's a little hard to see. 
Ordinarily, if a party wants us to address the effects 
of a piece of legislation, they will mention that in the 
question presented.

 MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, I agree that this 
decision clearly rests on Federal grounds, but we would 
also suggest that the question presented talks about 
whether the State's sovereign authority is stripped, and 
the State's sovereign authority, we would submit, is 
clear.

 The United States had perfect title.  The 
State of Hawaii succeeded to the United States perfect 
title.  Respondents do not suggest that anywhere in

their pleadings why that is not so, or why they continue 
to press even with this Court this property right claim 
to these lands.  And so we would suggest that it would 
be prudent for the Court to address what we believe is 
the fairly included question of the nature of the 
State's sovereign authority, especially as it would 
appear to be entirely not subject to contravention by 
the Respondents.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm not sure it 

would be prudent when the great bulk of the opinion is 
based on the Apology Resolution.  And I -- I certainly 
do think you have a powerful argument if the Apology 
Resolution presents us with a Federal question.  But the 
more far-reaching question -- I just inferred --
suggests -- might not even be very specifically within 
the question presented, and even if it's fairly 
embraced, you used the word "prudent."  It seems prudent 
for us to confine our decision to the effect of the 
Apology Resolution and whether or not the Hawaiian 
Supreme Court got that part of that right.

 MR. BENNETT:  Well, with -- with respect, 
Your Honor, the Court could limit its ruling, but in a 
case that has been gone on for 14 years and which, in 
virtually every pleading, the Respondents have filed 
they have asserted essentially that the State lacks

title to these lands because the United States lacked 
title, the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii was 
illegal, and that's the precise reason for 14 years the 
State has either been through an injunction or, as a 
practical matter, not been able to alienate its lands, 
that this Court certainly has the ability for a question 
that we believe --

JUSTICE ALITO:  If the Apology Resolution is 

put aside, I'm not quite sure what is left, other than 
State-law issues.

 MR. BENNETT:  Well, what's left --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You could -- would there be 

anything to prevent the Hawaiian legislature from 
passing a law that says, we have absolute -- we have 
title to these lands, but we are going to impose a 
five-year moratorium on any transfer of these lands 
because we want to promote a reconciliation process?

 MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, certainly under 

the terms of the Admission Act, the authority given the 
political branches for the management and disposition of 
the lands is broad and would run up against only the 
Federal common law of trust that the Ninth Circuit says 
governs --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that's not what the 

Hawaiian Supreme Court said.  I am reading from page 98a

of the petition appendix, the concluding portion of the 
opinion. "We hold, number one, that the Apology 
Resolution and related state legislation give rise to 
the state's fiduciary duty."

 The only Federal statute mentioned is the 

Apology Resolution, and the rest of their reasoning 
seems to rest upon some kind of State equity law or 
trust law.  Now, that trust law may ultimately be 
inconsistent with prior Federal acts, but the only --
the only thing they are disclosing right now is -- aside 
from the Apology Resolution, seems to be State trust 
law.

 MR. BENNETT:  Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii 
Supreme Court did say that this is an injunction based 
on property rights.  The Hawaii Supreme Court did say --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But trust law is based on 
somebody's property rights.  We don't know whether they 
are talking about legal rights or equitable rights, and 
that's consistent with the statement I just read to you.
 MR. BENNETT:  Well, Your Honor, at page 85-A 
of the appendix to the petition the Court said that the 
Congress recognized that native Hawaiians had 
unrelinquished claims to the ceded lands.  And as a 
result of that recognition the Apology Resolution 
dictated the entry of this injunction.

We believe that clearly that is not so, but 

that this idea of unrelinquished claims is an 
unrelinquished property-right claim.  This is what was 
urged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court at every stage.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But, General, I think --
with respect, I still don't know what the position of 
the Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to be if this Court 
rules that the Apology Resolution does not support the 
proposition that you just read.

 I don't know whether at that point the 

Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to say, okay, all we 
have got left to deal with now is State trust law, or 
whether they've got to pull another rabbit out of the 
hat and say, but there is -- there is some kind of -- of 
prior -- there is some kind of a -- a claim against 
which prior Federal law could not prevail.

 I don't know.  And I -- that's -- that's why 

it seems to me, to -- to say the least, imprudent to 
wade into it at this point.  The one thing we know that 
seems to have been significant to their decision is the 
Apology Resolution.  And I think we would be wise to 
stick to that.

 MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, what our response 
would be is a simple one:  That the issue of the State's 
title would in our view be undisputed.  The United

States's title is perfect and indisputable, and the 
State's title is perfect and indisputable.  And this 
Court has said that one of the functions in -- in cases 
where respondents claim an adequate and independent 
State-law ground is to remand the case by disabusing the 
State court of incorrect notions of what Federal law 
either permits or requires.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  A point on which both you 
and your adversaries seem to agree is that the Apology 
Resolution really is not critical to the decision of the 
Hawaii Supreme Court.  Because if you thought that 
simply taking the Apology Resolution off the books would 
provide an acceptable outcome from your point of view, 
you would be happy with our deciding just that narrow 
question.  And your opponent explicitly says that the 
apology resolution wasn't critical to the decision of 
the Hawaii Supreme Court; isn't that true?

 MR. BENNETT:  Yes, Your Honor, and they have 

not asked this court to affirm.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And isn't it true that you 
don't think that just saying the Apology Resolution did 
not change anything would be insufficient?

 MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, because it seems 

to us clear that both the respondents and Hawaii Supreme 
Court believe that there are property-right claims that

the Native Hawaiians have.  And we believe those 
property-right claims are clearly inconsistent with 
Federal law, the Newlands Resolution, and the Admission 
Act, and that there is no reason for this Court not to 
reach such a clear claim.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But they don't say that --
there is nothing in the Resolution and nothing in the --
does anything in the Court's opinion or the Resolution 
say that the claims are valid?  We all know they have 
claims.  They have been making claims.  Is there 
anything in any document I have that says the claims are 
valid claims?  Maybe they are valid, and maybe they are 
not.

 MR. BENNETT:  The -- the only thing is the 

position of the Respondents who assert --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course, they think they 

are valid.

 MR. BENNETT:  But I mean --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so since you have 

normally one group thinks they are valid; another group 
thinks they are invalid.  Well, here we are.  Let them 
fight it out.

 And all we can say is that this Resolution 
of the Apology doesn't really say who's right.  And if 
Hawaii wants to give some more money, or whatever they

want to do, to the Native Hawaiians, that's their 
affair.  What's the -- what's the problem?

 MR. BENNETT:  Well, Your Honor, it is 

certainly true that the Apology Resolution does not as 
Respondents state recognize the validity of any claims, 
but federal law forecloses the validity of any claims. 
And we believe that that is a question that is fairly 
included interior to the question of whether the 
Resolution stripped Hawaii of its sovereign authority. 
It's only natural for the Court to declare what we 
believe is the indisputable proposition that Hawaii's 
sovereign authority is based on --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Could the Hawaiian 

Legislature pass a law saying that the Native Hawaiians 
have claims?  Those claims, because of the Federal 1950 
-- whatever it is -- are not valid any more.  But that 
was pretty unfair to them.  And, therefore, what we 
think we should do is the following.  And then they pass 
a whole lot of things that they think would be 
appropriate to do in light of what I just said.  What 
stops that?

 MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, the -- legislature 

has wide discretion in managing and disposing of the 
assets.

they had wanted to -- as I understand the Admission Act, 
it lists five purposes to any one purpose.  And the 
legislature, if it so chose, could say, we want this 
property -- the proceeds from this property to be for 
the exclusive betterment of the conditions of the Native 
Hawaiians.  They could.  It would be up to the 
legislature to give it all to the Native Hawaiians.

 MR. BENNETT:  That would not violate the 

Admission Act, Your Honor.

 MR. BENNETT:  That would not.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would it violate the 

Admission Act if the legislature had not said -- said we 
are giving it to them because we want to, because we 
think it's a good idea.  No, we are giving it to them 
because we think they have a right to it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did you answer my question 

just then?

 MR. BENNETT:  Yes.  I'd -- I'd like to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Please, let me put my 

question again.  Let's assume that the legislature does 
not say, we want to give it to the Native Hawaiians 
because we like the Native Hawaiians or because we think 
they deserve it; but, rather, we think we have to give 
it to the Native Hawaiians because it's theirs.

 MR. BENNETT:  I think that would be contrary 

to Federal law, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it would be.
 MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, if I -- if I may 

reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
 MR. JAY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Three binding Federal laws make clear that

in the Federal trust and also has the power to sell 
those lands for the purposes Congress set out in the 
trust instrument.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you think on 

the question-presented issue?  Are all of the Federal 
laws on which the Hawaii Supreme Court relied to say 
there was a cloud on the title before the court.

 MR. JAY:  We think that they have been in 

the case from the beginning, and they -- they were 
clearly pressed in the State supreme court.  And we 
think they are fairly encompassed in the question 
presented partly because, as General Bennett said, the 
-- the questions referenced to the State's sovereign 
authority, which necessarily includes consideration of 
the act which made Hawaii a sovereign state, the 
Admissions Act, is -- is a necessary antecedent to the 
resolution of that question.

 But also the admission in the Apology 
Resolution, itself, in the preamble on which the 
Respondents rely extensively goes into great detail 
about the Newlands Resolution and the cession of 
absolute fee and ownership by the Republic of Hawaii to 
the United States.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I don't see where this 

law -- where those laws get us.  The -- the argument

that is made on the other side is that the Native 
Hawaiians have a moral claim to these lands, not that 
they have a property-right claim to the lands.

 And if the State of Hawaii, acting through 

any branch of its government -- and that is not a matter 
of concern to us -- says they have a moral claim to the 
land and, therefore, there should not be any land 
transfers for some period of time, what's inconsistent 
with Federal law in their doing that?

 MR. JAY:  Let me answer that in two steps, 

Justice Alito.  The first step is that the State's 
supreme court permanent injunction, although Respondents 
are now saying that the claims on which -- the claims on 
which -- they state are moral in nature, but a permanent 
injunction is a legal obligation and enforceable by 
contempt.

 So the State supreme court, by effectively 

locking up the lands for an indeterminant period of 
time, has treated them as -- as legally valid and has 
entered relief that is legal in nature.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is -- is it the function of 
the Hawaiian Supreme Court to declare moral obligations?

 MR. JAY:  Well, Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would there be any problem 
-- certainly there is noted the legislature deems there

to be a moral obligation and gives the land away on that 
basis.  But do you -- do you think there -- there might 
be some democracy problem if -- if the Supreme Court of 
Hawaii goes around pronouncing moral obligations and --
and giving away land on that basis?

 MR. JAY:  Well, Justice Scalia I guess the 

second half to my answer to Justice Alito as well, which 
is that the State supreme court is not free as a matter 
of State trust law or otherwise to formulate obligations 
that don't relate to the State's obligation as trustee 
of the Federal trust --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But isn't it perfectly 

clear that's a question of State law?

 MR. JAY:  I don't think so, Justice Stevens, 

because that State law has to comply with the 
limitations set out in section 5(f)of the Admissions 
Act.  To be sure, the political branches operating as 
trustee of the trust have broad discretion to allocate 
lands within and among the five purposes set out in 
section 5(f).

 But what the State can't do and what in 
particular the State courts can't do in the name of 
formulating State trust law is to rely on considerations 
that are all together outside the trust.  In this case, 
any consideration of the unrelinquished claims of the

Native Hawaiians would not be based on their status as 
one of the beneficiaries of the trust.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are you saying that the 
State court couldn't do it but the legislature could?

 MR. JAY:  I'm saying the -- the -- no, 

Justice Stevens.  The State court can't rely, nor, I 
think, could the State legislature --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Could the legislature do 

it?

 MR. JAY:  The legislature could determine 
that the wisest use of the lands today, the way that 
would best further -- promote the welfare of Native 
Hawaiians today would be not to sell it.  The 
legislature certainly could do that and then could enact 
a moratorium that was consistent with that view.

 But what it can't do is treat it -- and this 

is the question Justice Scalia asked at the end of 
General Bennett's presentation -- what the State is not 
free to do is, based on claims by Native Hawaiians, not 
as beneficiaries of the section 5(f) trust, but based on 
considerations that arose before the Admissions Act was 
ever enacted, based on -- based on their status as 
competing claimants to the title of the land, give them 
an equitable, moral, or otherwise claim to lock up the 
use of the land.

The theory that the Respondents advanced in 
the state Supreme Court under the name of trust law is 
that a trustee may not, in furtherance of a trust, 
engage in an illegal act.  And that is on Joint Appendix 
141A to 143A and other places in the record.  And the 
illegal act they contemplate is the continued ownership 
of the lands by the State of Hawaii.  So, the State 
cannot, in ostensible furtherance of the federal trust, 
rely on State law principles that presume the illegality 
of the federal trust or the illegality --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The State power -- the 

State legislative power to act depends on the validity 
of its reasoning.

 MR. JAY:  Well, Justice Stevens, the 
State -- the State has given authority to act for 
particular purposes.  And so, the purpose of the -- of 
the -- for which the State acts is necessarily relevant. 
The State can't act for a purpose that is not --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the position that 
it's -- it is imposing a moratorium on land transfers 
because it thinks this is the best way to promote the 
interests of the Native Hawaiians, and part of their 
thinking is that there was an inequity done when 
absolute title was transferred to the United States and 
then to the State of Hawaii?  Would that be a violation

of federal law?

 MR. JAY:  I think, Justice Alito, that if 
the state made that determination with respect to the 
classic Native Hawaiians who are defined in the 
Admissions Act as -- as one of the present day 
beneficiaries of the trust, and determined that it 
was -- that that was the best way to act for the 
betterment of Native Hawaiians, which is a permissible 
trust purpose, that that would be permissible.

 But for the State to act on considerations 

that are wholly extrinsic to the trust, to treat the 
native -- the claims of Native Hawaiians as valid, even 
though they are -- and to assume a duty to the Native 
Hawaiians that has nothing to do with the State's 
obligations as trustee of the section 5(f) trust, we 
think that would be impermissible.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that doesn't seem to be 
what the Supreme Court of Hawaii has done.  The Supreme 
Court of Hawaii, in effect, has said the land is tied up 
until these people who are currently negotiating, the 
State, the Native Hawaiians and -- what is it, the 
United Church of Christ, all come to a -- in effect, a 
resolution and a reconciliation.

 Whatever that means, it does not sound to me 

as though it is the recognition of a legal title claim

or indeed the validity so far as courts are concerned 
with validity of any claim the Native Hawaiians are 
making.  They are just saying, no more land transfers 
until these people sit down and make up their 
differences.

 Isn't that all the court is saying at this 

point?

 MR. JAY:  Well, the court said, 

Justice Souter, that there is a fiduciary obligation not 
to make these land transfers at any time until this 
indeterminate point in the future which reconciliation 
is achieved.

 But to say -- to say that that -- that they 

are not thereby pronouncing on the validity of the 
title, I think that is inconsistent with the Newlands 
Resolution.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't the fact that you and 
I are having this exchange a pretty good indication that 
we don't know what they meant exactly by that?  The only 
thing we can be sure of is that that thought the Apology 
Resolution had some legal significance.  They said, you 
know, it's required after the Apology Resolution.

 We can say you are right or you are wrong, 
and I think we know what -- what we are talking about. 
But to go beyond that, it seems to me, that we are

wading into an argument that you and I can't settle 
here.

 MR. JAY:  Well, I wholly agree, 

Justice Souter, that the State supreme court thought 
that the Apology Resolution had significance and that 
the Apology Resolution --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  More than significance. 
I am reading the sentence that immediately follows the 
one that General Bennett brought to our attention on 
page 85A. It says, "Accordingly, the Apology Resolution 
dictates that the ceded lands should be preserved 
pending a reconciliation between the United States and 
the Native Hawaiian people."

 It is very fear language, dictates.  And 

that's why I am really puzzled as how this Court has any 
business wading into any question other than telling the 
Hawaii Supreme Court either their right about what the 
resolution dictates or they are wrong, and they are 
wrong because it's a nice apology but it's without 
substantive effect.

 MR. JAY:  Well, I certainly agree, 

Justice Ginsburg, that the State supreme court thought 
the Apology Resolution dictated the entry of the 
injunction, and the -- also on page 85A the State 
supreme court says that the Apology Resolution gives

rises to the -- to a fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians.
 And it is -- it is that principle that the 
State supreme court was able to find a fiduciary duty 
and impose it on the State's trusteeship obligation, 
even though that fiduciary duty arises outside the 
section 5(f) trust.  And that is why we think that the 
scope of the State -- of the State's obligation as 
trustee is within the Court's review at this stage.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The only issue properly presented in this 

case is whether the Hawaii Supreme Court concluded that 
the Apology Resolution created an affirmative federal 
obligation not to sell ceded land.  In our view, it did 
not.

 The Hawaii Supreme Court held only that the 
sale of ceded lands would breach the State's fiduciary 
duty to Native Hawaiians under State law.  And it relied 
on the Apology Resolution only for its recognition that 
Native Hawaiians have claims to the ceded lands that are

currently being addressed through the political process.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, they relied on 
federal law to create the fiduciary obligation.  So if 
we think that federal law did not create the fiduciary 
obligation, what should we do?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Then the Court should vacate 
and remand.  But we believe the better interpretation of 
the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion is that it believed 
that the source of the fiduciary duty at issue was State 
law and not Federal law.  To be sure --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All Federal law? 

All Federal law?  In other words, not simply the Apology 
Resolution but the other Federal provisions?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  As the source for fiduciary 

duty?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think 

those -- yes.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  The source for the fiduciary 

duty, according to the Hawaii Supreme Court, was State 
law.  To the extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Shanmugam, on page 99, 

the State supreme court is saying, inasmuch as the 
Apology Resolution and related State legislation give 
rise to a fiduciary duty.  They are saying the Apology 
Resolution did so, too, not only State law.

MR. SHANMUGAM:  They did say at various 
points in the opinion that the Apology Resolution, 
together with State law, gave rise to the fiduciary 
duty.

 But I think that if one looks at the 

critical portion of the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion 
on pages 31A to 32A, where the Hawaii Supreme Court 
actually discusses the relevance of the Apology 
Resolution, the Court makes clear that it is relying on 
it only for the acknowledgment that Native Hawaiians 
have unresolved claims.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then how to you explain 
the language, over and over again, I won't repeat it, 
but they said this resolution of ours is dictated by, 
compelled by, the Apology Resolution?  Without the 
Apology Resolution it would be an entirely different 
case.  And now you seem to be taking what the Hawaii 
Supreme Court put as the necessary link, the Apology 
Resolution, before that this would have been impossible, 
and you are treating it now as sort of window dressing, 
icing on the cake, really didn't matter.

 But we would disrespect the Hawaii Supreme 

Court if we didn't take them at their word and say --
using words such as "dictated," "compelled."  You -- you 
are treating this as sort of just part of the

atmosphere.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, it was more than mere 

window dressing, Justice Ginsburg.  The apology 
resolution really did confirm the factual predicate for 
Respondent's State law claim.  And I do mean to 
emphasize that these have been State law claims from the 
outset.  If you take a look at the original complaint in 
this case, which is found in the Joint Appendix at pages 
34a to 36a, the only source of law on which we rely for 
the counts at issue here was article 12, section 4 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's what you relied on 

but it's not what the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on, 
and I would repeat the point I made in the prior 
argument:  what's worrisome about this is they are 
fastening on a piece of Federal legislation and said, we 
are compelled to do this because of Federal law.  What 
that does is it removes it from the Hawaii political 
process.

 If they left Federal law out of it, and they 

said truly this decision rests on State law, we think 
that the title belongs with the Native Hawaiians, then 
they have to answer to the policy; and here the Hawaii 
Supreme Court insulates themselves by using the Federal 
law as a crutch.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Let me -- let me be clear

about this, Justice Ginsburg, if the Hawaii Supreme 
Court's opinion is read to construe the Apology 
Resolution as creating some affirmative duty or 
obligation as a matter of Federal law, we agree that 
that would be erroneous.  And if the Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you agree that there 

would be a Federal question if the Hawaiian Supreme 
Court said the Apology Resolution dictates our results?
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  No, because we believe that 
read in context, Justice Kennedy, that that statement is 
consistent with our theory of the Hawaii Supreme Court's 
reliance on the Apology Resolution.  So --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why doesn't the Hawaii 

Supreme Court's reliance upon Hawaiian law to establish 
that there is some property right on the part of these 
native Hawaiians -- why doesn't that conflict with 
Federal law?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  The Hawaii Supreme Court 

relied on Hawaii law only for the existence of the 
fiduciary duty and that fiduciary duty has repeatedly 
been recognized by the Hawaii Supreme Court.  That duty 
gives Native Hawaiians an equitable or beneficial 
interest in the plan.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care what you call 

it; it's a property interest.

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  As I read the Federal law, 
it extinguished all property rights in these lands; the 
lands were transferred to the Federal Government; and 
the Federal Government transferred them in absolute fee 
without any encumbrances to the State of Hawaii.  Now if 
you are telling me the Hawaii Supreme Court is now 
finding as a matter of State law that there is a 
property interest on the part of the Native Hawaiians --
I don't care what you call it, equitable or whatever --
it seems to me that is flat contradiction of Federal 
law, and probably is an issue that we ought to address 
in this opinion.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  There are two separate 
issues, Justice Scalia.  The first is what was the 
source for the injunction in this case.  And the source 
of the injunction was Respondent's instant claim for 
breach of fiduciary duty.  Now to be sure, we were 
arguing that there would be a breach of the fiduciary 
duty to Native Hawaiians precisely because Native 
Hawaiians have underlying claim to the land.  It's those 
underlying claims that trigger all of these additional 
Federal issues that Petitioners are now seeking to 
inject into the case.

 But I think that the critical point for

purposes of this Court's review at this stage is that in 
the Hawaii Supreme Court, we freely and repeatedly 
conceded that any underlying claims to ceded lands would 
be nonjusticiable.  That much was clear as a matter of 
State law.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You concede -- you concede 

that the Apology Resolution does not say that the 
Hawaiian people's claims are valid.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 
JUSTICE BREYER: 

The Apology Resolution --
Does it say that?  Yes or 

no.

MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- does not directly speak 

to the merits of any underlying claims.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, so if that's so, do 

you object to a three-sentence pro curiam opinion in 
this case where we say, to the extent that the Hawaiian 
Supreme Court could be read to suggest that the Apology 
Resolution either resolved or cast a cloud, legally 
speaking, on the title of the trust land, or suggested 
in any way that land be enjoined -- the sale be 
enjoined, the Court made a mistake; and insofar as it is 
resting on State law, that's up to them.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  I -- I think so, with one 

caveat and I don't mean to quibble --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You would object to 

that?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  I think we would acquiesce 
in that with one small quibble, which is that I think 
the issue being debated here is not whether the Hawaii 
Supreme Court relied on the Apology Resolution as 
creating some cloud on title.  Precisely because we 
conceded below that the underlying claims were 
nonjusticiable, the Hawaii Supreme Court did not opine 
on the merits of those underlying claims.  The only 
issue is whether the Hawaii Supreme Court believed that 
the Apology Resolution created a fiduciary obligation to 
essentially preserve and protect the ceded lands, until 
those underlying --

JUSTICE BREYER:  How could it have done 

that?  I mean, I didn't see anything in here that 
suggests anything like that.  That is to suggest that 
the Apology Resolution created an obligation on the part 
of the State courts to enjoin sales until everything was 
worked out.  Now I have read this Apology Resolution 
about six times, and I certainly didn't see anything 
like that.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes.  And we agree that the 

Apology Resolution could not be read to create some 
affirmative duty not to sell the ceded lands.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  No.  There are various --ere 

are various findings in the Apology Resolution that 
could potentially be relevant to the ultimate 
disposition of the land.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  It is, after all, 

significant that Congress --

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Congress expressed its

Justice Ginsburg's question, and we feel it's important-
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If -- if you took Federal 

law, the Apology Resolution, out of the picture, the 
Hawaii Supreme Court could reach the result that it 
reached and then we might have questions about its 
consistency with the Admissions Act and the Newlands 
Resolution; but as Justice Breyer said, if we disabuse 
them of the notion that there is any Federal compulsion 
here, then the rest is to be sorted out.  We wouldn't

not address it.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes.  I think that's it.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the political process 

question I think is really bothersome, that the Hawaii 
Supreme Court chose to use this Federal crutch.  It 
seems a very weak reed.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  And it's for that reason, 
Justice Ginsburg, that we freely concede that if the 
Hawaii Supreme Court had relied on the Apology 
Resolution as creating some Federal duty, that would be 
problematic.  That would be not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the 

Newlands Resolution and Admission Act and the Organic 
Law, do you acknowledge that if the Hawaii Supreme Court 
relied on those, that also would be inappropriate?
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, it's hard to say 

because it would depend on how they relied on them, but 
I think that the critical point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They relied on them 

the same way you say they relied on the Apology 
Resolution, to give rise to a fiduciary responsibility 
under State law.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I don't think that a 
Federal act could be read as creating a fiduciary duty 
not to sell the ceded lands.  So I think I would concede

that that would be problematic as well.  But I think 
that the question before the Court according to 
Petitioners is whether an injunction, even if that 
injunction were framed solely in terms of State law, 
might itself contravene the Newlands Resolution by 
virtue of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you would have no 

-- just to carry on the opinion-drafting process, you 
would have no objection to an opinion that said no 
source of Federal law gave rise to a duty under State 
law, fiduciary or otherwise; that any further 
proceedings on remand should be based solely on State 
law?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I think that that is 

right in the sense that we certainly think that the 
Hawaii Supreme Court in the first place intended to rely 
on a State law of fiduciary duty.  And we would 
certainly have no problem with and indeed would welcome 
a remand that afforded the Hawaii Supreme Court an 
opportunity to do what we think they did in the first 
place.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They do nothing at all? 

Could I get back to Justice Breyer's three-sentence pro

Court of Hawaii relied upon the Apology Resolution as

creating any -- any property entitlement in the 
Hawaiians, it was in error.  Okay, we send it back to 
the Hawaiian Supreme Court and the Hawaii Supreme Court 
smiles, and doesn't do a blessed thing.  Leaves --
leaves the injunction against any distribution of the 
land in effect.  What -- what happens then?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I don't think they 

would do that, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't?
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  On remand, I think that they 
would consider the issue of whether the injunction could 
be granted on State law, which after ball was the basis 
of our complaint from day one in this case.  And there 
is certainly language --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not if we said "to the 

extent that."  I mean, if we said it is -- it's grounded 
on the proposition that the Apology Resolution creates 
property rights, and that's wrong; then they have to do 
something.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, presumably --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  To the extent that it may 

be grounded on that, we take no position on whether it's 
grounded on that or not --

JUSTICE SCALIA.  -- why would that require 

any action on their part?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  If the Court were to write 

that opinion, I assume the last line of the opinion 
would be to vacate and remand, and that would eliminate 
the injunction and so the Hawaii Supreme Court would 
have the case once again; and at that point the Hawaii 
Supreme Court could clarify that the source of fiduciary 
duty at issue was State law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not simply a 

question of the source of the fiduciary duty.  It, 
presumably, in the course of saying what the Apology 
Resolution, the Newlands Act, the Organic Act, and the 
Admission Act had to say, we may well say something to 
the effect that, because it conveyed perfect title, it's 
inconsistent with the cloud of that title, under a 
fiduciary obligation created by State law or anything 
else.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  And if the Hawaii Supreme 

Court on remand, Mr. Chief Justice, addressed the merits 
of any underlying legal claims, then the Court could 
review the decision, and at that point it might have a 
sense of, for instance, what those legal claims actually 
are.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if we told them

that these various Federal resolutions, including the 
Apology Resolution, conveyed title to the State in a 
particular way that precluded the burdening of the 
State's title on the basis of Federal law, then they 
would have to find a basis under State law that was not 
inconsistent with the Federal law's conveying of perfect 
title.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, that is presumably 

always true, but, you know, I think for purposes of the 
current posture of the current case, Mr. Chief Justice, 
the only Federal issue that is before the Court is the 
question of whether the Apology Resolution was the 
source of the underlying obligation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And do you think --
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Petitioners did not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you think that that 

resolution is distinguishable in any way from the 
apology that the United States made to the people of 
Japanese ancestry who were interned after World War II? 
The United States did say -- it was -- I think it was an 
executive order by President Ford that, in no uncertain 
terms, stated that the United States made a dreadful 
error and there was never reason for rounding these 
people up and putting them in interment camps.

 Did -- is there any difference?  And that,

as I understand it, had no substantive effect until 
Congress passed legislation providing for compensation.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  The -- the Apology 

Resolution in this case does not speak directly to the 
merits of any underlying claims.  What does do is 
recognize that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii 
was illegal, apologized for the Federal Government's 
involvement in that overthrow, and, in the operative 
provision of the resolution, expresses support for the 
reconciliation process.  And it is that expression of 
support on which the Hawaii Supreme Court critically 
relied here in informing its application of State law.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  If I said that -- just in 
the opinion -- and said just what you said, and nothing 
else about the resolution, say we don't see any other 
way in which the resolution could have supported this, 
would that -- is that okay with you?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes, that would be okay, 

Justice Breyer, and I do think that it would be 
important for this Court to make clear that to the 
extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court, in any subsequent 
remand, relies on the Apology Resolution only for what 
are essentially factual findings, its acknowledgment 
that Native Hawaiians have unrelinquished claims, which 
is undoubtedly true as a factual matter -- I don't hear

petitioners to suggest otherwise -- and its recognition 
that there is an ongoing reconciliation process, that is 
entirely proper.  And the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But then it would 

also have to just -- the opinion we're drafting would go 
further, I suppose, and since we are interpreting all 
these Federal provisions, it may not be sufficient to 
say that it did not create this obligation and the 
Hawaiian Supreme Court was wrong to do that, but that it 
precluded the creation under State law of this type of 
obligation.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And if the Hawaiian 

Supreme Court wants to create, under State law, a 
particular type of fiduciary obligation grounded on the 
status of the land prior to admission, then it has to 
run -- under the Supremacy Clause, it has to be 
consistent with the Federal provisions.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  But the Hawaii Supreme 

Court, in the opinion under review, did not ground that 
duty on any judgment about the validity of the original 
conveyance of title --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I'm not saying 
they did.  That's the first question.  I'm not saying 
they grounded it on Federal law; I'm saying we would

have to determine whether Federal law precluded the 
grounding of the fiduciary duty under the status of the 
land prior to admission.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  But I do think, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that that is an entirely discrete 
question from the question presented, and it's entirely 
discrete precisely because this argument concerning the 
Newlands Resolution could have arisen, even if the 
injunction were, as we believe it was, unambiguously 
based solely on State law with nary a reference to the 
Apology Resolution.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Native Hawaiians --
MR. SHANMUGAM:  And it is precisely --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Native Hawaiians --

they do get 20 percent of the proceeds, correct?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what -- that comes 

out of Hawaii legislation?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes, that's right.  It comes 
out of -- I think it's Hawaii statute 10-13.5, and as a 
matter of State law they get 20 percent of the revenue 
from the ceded-lands trust, though the amount of that 
revenue has itself been the subject of protracted and 
unresolved litigation.

figure, is that the subject of litigation?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  The valuation of the 

Leiali'i parcel was challenged in this litigation, and 
it remains pending before the trial court.

 But, I think, more broadly the important 

point is that to the extent that the injunction in this 
case was based on the lack of resolution of underlying 
claims in the State political process, the Hawaii 
legislature could readily resolve those claims without 
in any way casting any doubt on the validity of the 
original conveyance of lands to the Federal Government.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  It also, I guess, has a --

there -- in the Admission Resolution, it set up a trust. 
They hold it in trust, and there are five purposes in 
the trust, and only one of those relates to the Native 
Hawaiians.  Now, I know from the newspapers -- I don't 
know the merits of it -- but the trust that has been set 
up is the subject of controversy continuously.

 So what I don't see -- and I hope we don't 
have to get into this -- is what the relation between 
the trust principles as enacted in the legislature is 
and the trust principles set forth in the Admissions 
Resolution.  Is there any law going to anything like 
that?

something about that, because you think that it is 
relevant to our interpretation of the Hawaii Supreme 
Court's opinion.  What State of Hawaii did, with article 
12, section 4 of the Hawaii Constitution, was 
essentially to say that, while the State does have some 
discretion to use the assets in the section 5(f) 
ceded-lands trust for any of the stated purposes, the 
State owes a particularly high duty to Native Hawaiians.

 The Hawaii Supreme Court has so construed 

article 12, section 4, in other cases involving the 
ceded-lands trust.  And, at page 39a of its opinion in 
this case, the Hawaii Supreme Court plainly relied on 
that provision as a source of its fiduciary duty, the 
fiduciary duty that we believe was at issue in this 
case.  The opinion does not cite that provision in so 
many words, but it refers to the Hawaii Constitution in 
a case construing that provision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is the court the trustee?
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  The State is the trustee.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The State is the trustee. 

So I assume it would be up to the State officers to 
decide to what extent the obligation to the Hawaiians, 
among the five obligations, should be given precedence. 
Is the Supreme Court of Hawaii directing the State 
officers to give it precedence?

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, article 12, section 4, 
we would respectfully submit, Justice Scalia -- it does 
place Native Hawaiians in something of a privileged 
position vis-a-vis the other beneficiaries.  And in 
construing article 12, section 4, the Hawaii Supreme 
Court was doing, albeit in a somewhat unusual context, 
what courts do every day, which is essentially to 
evaluate whether the trustee is acting consistent with 
the trustee's obligations under the terms of the trust.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And saying that the trustee 

must direct it primarily to -- to that among the five 
ends.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  All that the Hawaii Supreme 
Court said was, in light of the very realistic prospect 
that lands may be returned to Native Hawaiians as part 
of the reconciliation process that Congress recognized 
in the Apology Resolution, it would constitute a breach 
of fiduciary duty to sell those lands for another trust 
purpose, for the simple reason that once those lands are 
gone, they are gone forever.  And that is entirely 
consistent with the general principle of trust law, that 
a trustee in exercising its discretion --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And all this comes from the 

fact that Congress made reference to and approved a 
so-called reconciliation process?

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, Congress did support 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So in -- in perpetuam, this 
land can't be transferred because Congress approved the 
this reconciliation process?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Only until the claims of the 

Native Hawaiians are resolved.  And what is clear --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- regardless of the degree 

of the reliance on the Apology Resolution, Justice 
Scalia, is that the Hawaii legislature has substantial 
discretion to act and to act in a way that essentially 
vacates the terms of the injunction.  So if the Hawaii 
legislature either says, we're going to reach a 
definitive solution of the underlying claims of the 
Native Hawaiians by giving them land or additional 
monetary compensation, or the Hawaii Supreme Court 
determines that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or denying it to them?
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Or denying it to them.  Then 
presumably, according to the terms of the injunction, it 
would no longer have any force.  So the Hawaii 
Legislature remains empowered to act in such a way as to 
get out from under the terms of the injunction to the 
extent they are restrictive.

I would note, however, parenthetically, that 

immediately after this litigation was commenced the 
Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources imposed 
a unilateral moratorium on the sale of ceded lands. 
That moratorium, as an executive matter, has remained in 
effect during the 14-year pendency of this litigation 
even during the considerable period between the trial 
court's ruling in favor of the Petitioners and Hawaii 
Supreme Court's ruling in our favor.

 So there doesn't seem to be any great 
impetus on the part of the State to sell the ceded 
lands.  Indeed, Governor Lingle, one of the Petitioners 
in this case, has recently and repeatedly made 
statements to the effect that the State has no intention 
to sell ceded lands.

 And if that is really the State's position 

-- and I would be very interested in my friend's, 
General Bennett's, views on the matter, then it would 
seem that there really is no case or controversy before 
this Court at all.  Because if the State has no 
intention to sell ceded lands and the sale of ceded 
lands was the instigating event for this litigation, 
there would not necessarily be any real dispute between 
the parties.

 I -- I want to say just, you know, one more

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the decision of 

the Hawaii Supreme Court would then be vacated.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  The petition would be

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what is --
MR. SHANMUGAM:  If there is, in fact, 

mootness.  And if there were -- if the State -- if the 
State had not intention to sell ceded lands, presumably 
the underlying dispute would be moot.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't quite understand. 

You mean -- you mean a Federal court can enjoin the sale 
of my house, and there is nothing I can do about it 
inasmuch as I do not have any present intention of 
selling my house --

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, if --

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  If a Federal court enjoins 

you from selling your house without any underlying legal 
authority for doing so, presumably that injunction would 
be invalid.  But the critical point here --

controversy, so I -- I cannot get its validity 
adjudicated, right?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, here the lawsuit was 
commenced by Respondents, because Respondents believed 
that the State was going to imminently sell the Leiali'i 
parcel.  That was the triggering event for this 
litigation.

 It now appears at -- at least possible that 
the State has no intention to sell even that parcel.  If 
that was true --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think that -- I 
don't think that the State has to have an immediate 
intention to sell any particular piece of land in order 
to object to an injunction against any sale of land by 
the State in the future.  I -- I don't think it has to 
wait until it -- it wants to sell a particular plot.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, it just -- it merely 

suggests that the -- that there is no longer an 
underlying dispute, Justice Scalia.  Because, again --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But there is.  The State 
says that I am free to sell the land, and -- and the 
Court says, no, you are not.  Isn't that a dispute?

Article III sense precisely because there was a dispute 
between the parties about --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your whole case rests on a 
cloud on the title in favor of your clients.  But you --
you ignore the cloud on the title that has been entered 
against the State.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, first of all, our 

whole theory has never been that there is a cloud on the 
title.  To be sure, we have maintained at various points 
in this litigation that Native Hawaiians do have 
potentially valid legal claims, as well as moral and 
political claims, to the underlying land.

 But we have never argued that the injunction 

in this case should be based on some assessment of the 
existence or validity of legal claims.  To the contrary, 
we have consistently taken the position -- and this is 
clear from our briefs in support of the Hawaii Supreme 
Court -- that any such underlying claims would be 
nonjusticiable.

 And for that reason all we were seeking was 
an injunction to protect these lands until those claims 
could be resolved through the political process.  That 
was all we were conceding below, and the Hawaii 
Legislature again could readily resolve those underlying 
claims without in any way casting doubt on the validity

of the Newlands Resolution or any other Federal 
enactment that purports to recognize absolute title --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can I --
MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- to ceded lands.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can I go back to your --

your suggestion that this is a moot case because the 
government -- because the -- the governor agrees with 
your position.  But wasn't a lot of money already sunk 
into developing this area of Maui for desperately needed 
housing?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  A lot of money was sunk into 

this parcel, at least according to the record below. 
And the State would remain free at a minimum to proceed 
with the development by simply entering into long-term 
leases instead of the sale of these parcels of land. 
Indeed, that appears to be some suggestion that that is 
what the State would do in the event that this Court 
does not vacate the injunction.

 And so -- and, indeed, in the State of 

Hawaii it is not uncommon for land to be transferred by 
means of such long-term leases.  So it isn't as if the 
State would be barred from engaging in any development 
whatsoever.  The terms of the injunction simply prohibit 
the sale of these lands.

 And, again, the State's executive has been

operating under an effective moratorium on the sale of 
ceded lands of its own volition during the pendency of 
this litigation, which suggests at a minimum, regardless 
of the jurisdictional implications, that there is no 
great burden on the State from this injunction, which, 
again, by its terms lasts only as long as the State 
legislature acts.

 And I would add one additional point on that 
score, which is that to the extent that we believe that 
the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision rested on a 
fiduciary duty under State law, the State would, of 
course, be free to amend its constitution in order to 
make clear that the State's fiduciary duty to Native 
Hawaiians does not run to the extent of requiring this 
injunction.  But this -- there has been no effort to do 
that, and I would submit, as a political matter, it 
would be highly unlikely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Shanmugam, you -- you 
didn't raise in -- in your opposition to the petition 
the -- the question of mootness.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, the governor's 

statements about the lack of an intention to sell ceded 
lands were only made literally in the days before we 
filed our brief.  We do refer to them in a footnote in 
our merits brief, and I think that that would be

sufficient to preserve the issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you don't have to 
preserve it.  I mean it's -- it's an issue of Article 
III jurisdiction, so we would have to look into it on 
our -- on our own.  But it does suggest that it is not a 
very strong string to your bow, if I may put it that 
way.

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I would submit that 
even if the Court does not believe that this rises to 
the level of jurisdictional import, that it is at least 
significant in assessing the substantiality of the 
burden on the State.  That the State through its highest 
representative appears to be suggesting that the State 
has no present need to alienate any of these lands.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Shanmugam, just 
as a matter of curiosity, do you know what percentage of 
the Hawaiian population is comprised of Native 
Hawaiians?

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  I think the most recent 

figures from the 2000 census are that there are 
something like 1.2 million people in the State of 
Hawaii.  And of that number something like 240,000 
identify themselves as Native Hawaiians in the way that 
that phrase is currently defined under State law.

 Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

General Bennett, you have a minute remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MARK J. BENNETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BENNETT:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 It is undisputed that Respondents asserted a 

property-interest claim.  That any property-interest 
claim is, in fact, inconsistent with Federal law.  That 
the State has perfect title to these lands, and that 
there is no possible reason why this Court should not 
disabuse the State court of the incorrect notion that 
the State lacks perfect title.

 On the mootness issue, the ASARCO versus 
Kadish case makes clear that the injunction that has 
been entered is a present injury.  But, in addition, the 
governor, who does not control all of the State lands --
there are a variety of independent agencies that do --
talked about sale but not transfer or exchange, which 
are other things that are forbidden by this court's --
the State court's -- injunction.  But ASARCO clearly 
sets out that we have an injury.

 But, again, what -- the basis of the State 
court's decision is a property-right interest.  It is 
now undisputed by counsel that such a property-right 
interest is absolutely inconsistent with Federal law,

and there is no reason why in this 14-year-old 
litigation this Court should not make clear the simple 
and indisputed fact that, pursuant to the Newlands 
Resolution, the Organic Act and the Admission Act, that 
the State has perfect title.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, general. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:10 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled mattered was submitted.)
