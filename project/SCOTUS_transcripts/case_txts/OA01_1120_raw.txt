 P R O C E E D I N G S


JUSTICE STEVENS:  We will now hear argument in


(10:04 a.m.)


Number 01-1120, Meyer against Holley.


Mr. Benedon.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS G. BENEDON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BENEDON:  Justice Stevens, and may it please


the Court:


The question -- excuse me.  The question


presented should be answered with the following bright


line rule:  Imposition of vicarious liability under the


FHA should be determined by application of established


rules of corporate and agency law not criteria unique to


the FHA. 


Under these principles, corporate shareholders 

and officers are not vicariously liable for the torts of


the other agents of the corporation.


The Ninth Circuit held that a different rule


should apply under the FHA, that vicarious liability could


be based on control alone.  That is not, nor should it be,


the law. 


While the starting -- the starting point for the


analysis is necessarily the statute itself, while Congress


has authority to expand the class of persons liable for


violation of a Federal law, when it has done so, it has

done so expressly.  The FHA was never -- which neither


defines nor expands the class of persons liable under the


act, and as this Court stated in Bestfoods, this silence


is dispositive.


Specifically, Congress has spoken directly when


it has wished to impose a control test.  For example --


QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose that I were to


agree with you and the Court were to agree with you as to


your criticism of the Ninth Circuit's reasoning and -- and


that it agreed with you too that general principles of


agency and corporate liability apply.  Based on this


record, could we go on to say that under California law


and real estate law generally, the real estate salesman is


the agent of the broker, and therefore the broker is


liable under agency law?


MR. BENEDON:  The answer --


QUESTION:  Or -- or would I have to -- would we


have to remand before we did that?  Because this is


discussed in the -- in the respondents' brief, and the


respondent makes it quite clear.  And maybe you disagree,


but the -- the law is cited on page 15 of the red brief,


that under California law, the broker is the principal. 


And I take it the principal would be liable under


respondeat superior in this case. 


MR. BENEDON:  Correct, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  If -- if we find who the principal


is, we know the principal is going to be liable.


MR. BENEDON:  That's where --


QUESTION:  Under California law the broker is


the principal.


MR. BENEDON:  My -- Your Honor, my answer to


that is -- is several-fold.


First, the distinction needs to be made between


a corporate broker and an individual broker.  Mr. Meyer in


this case is a corporate officer who holds a broker's


license solely as the officer of the corporation.  The


corporation is the employer of the agent.  The agent


operates under the license held by the corporation.


QUESTION:  But isn't it fair to say that -- or


isn't it? 


Maybe you'll take issue with this, that the 

corporation operates as a broker only because it has the


individual's broker license assigned to it.


MR. BENEDON:  It has to, Your Honor. 


A corporation as a paper person needs human beings to


fulfill the function that a corporation must do, as does


any corporation.  There will always be supervising


officers --


QUESTION:  Is -- is there any California law


saying that -- that the corporation is the principal in a


situation like this and not the holder of the -- not

the -- not the named broker?


MR. BENEDON:  The named broker, again -- to


answer your question, no, not that I'm aware of.


QUESTION:  This -- this is a --


QUESTION:  Let me ask the opposite.  Is there


any California case in which the named broker in the


corporation has been held liable as the principal solely


because he's the named broker?


MR. BENEDON:  Not the designated officer, Your


Honor.  The corporation has been held liable.


QUESTION:  Yes.  That's what I'm talking about.


MR. BENEDON:  But not the designated


officer/broker.


QUESTION:  So --


QUESTION: 


Is there a difference in the 

licenses, the individual license that Justice Kennedy was


referring to and that's mentioned on page 15 of the red


brief, the individual broker license and the statement


that the individual broker licensee is vicariously


liable and the broker who holds the license under the


corporate name?  Are those different certificates?


MR. BENEDON:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  There are


separate licenses issued by the Department of Real Estate


in California:  one to individuals who act as brokers, and


one to individuals who are brokers only in their capacity

as officers of a corporation.  Those are separate


licenses.


The only license in this cases was held by


Mr. Meyer as an officer of the corporation.  He could not


step outside the corporation and act as a broker.  His


existence as a broker depended on the corporation.  He


could not transact --


QUESTION:  May I ask you this question?  You


explained to Justice Scalia that there is no California


case holding a corporate broker liable in this situation,


as I understand.  Are there any California cases going the


other way?  Has it ever -- has the issue ever been


presented to the California courts?


MR. BENEDON:  Yes, it has, Your Honor.  In two


cases, there have been, one -- one State case and one 

district court case cited in our -- in our briefs, in


the -- re Grabau case.  They've held that the California


statutory scheme imposes only a disciplinary remedy for


any violations of the scheme such that a broker -- a


designated officer/broker who violates any of the


provisions of the statute may be subject to discipline,


but is not the basis of a civil action. 


QUESTION:  So in this case the individual could


be subject to discipline, but not to liability.  Is


that --

 MR. BENEDON:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  What were your other reasons.  You


said you -- you had a multi-faceted answer, or something


like that.  What -- what are the other --


MR. BENEDON:  The --


QUESTION:  -- prongs or the other facets of your


answer? 


MR. BENEDON:  The other facets is that liability


under the FHA cannot be premised on California agency law. 


There, the -- the agency under the FHA is determined on


Federal rules of agency.  To determine Federal agency,


this Court held in General Contractors, you look to the


Restatement which has a two-prong test.  One is the right


of control, but the other is that the person controlled 

has to be acting on behalf of the principal.


Here, the agent works -- is working on behalf of


the corporation.  In this case when Mr. Crank went out and


did real estate transactions, he was acting on behalf of


Triad.  He was not acting on behalf of Meyer.


The problem with looking at each State's


structure is we're going to end up with a patchwork


construction of a Federal statute.  The law may be


different in Nevada than from Oregon than from Washington


than from West Virginia.

 QUESTION:  Is that --


QUESTION:  Suppose it were the majority rule


that a real estate broker is the principal for the


salesman.  Would we follow that rule generally? 


MR. BENEDON:  Again, Your Honor, the --


QUESTION:  And again, I'm -- I'm referring to


the red brief at pages 14 and 15 which sets this -- this


out.  You say there's a distinction because there's a


corporate broker and -- and an individual broker.


MR. BENEDON:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Now, we -- I -- we can explore that a


little bit.  But suppose it were the -- the general rule


in most of the States that had addressed the subject that


the broker is the principal.


MR. BENEDON: 


To answer that question, I think 

you still need to make a distinction between individual


brokers and corporate licensed brokers.  We do not dispute


that --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I was simply addressing


the point of whether or not State law as opposed to


Federal law controls.  And if it's the general law in most


States that the broker is the principal, then that would


certainly be sufficient for the imposition of liability


under this Federal scheme.  Would it not? 


MR. BENEDON:  Again, I -- I disagree, Your

Honor.  I would say that the rules still -- you need to


still look at the Federal law of agency rather than how


the State defines the relationship between the broker and


the agent.  You -- again, you look to the Federal rules of


agency to determine agency under the FHA. 


QUESTION:  I thought you said those were general


common law principles that are -- presumably the States


would share.


MR. BENEDON:  The general law principles applied


in the broker/agent context would establish that the


agent -- the sales agent -- is the agent of the principal


broker when the broker is acting in his individual


capacity when the agent is acting on behalf of the


principal, of the individual broker, and subject to that


broker's control. 


The situation is different when it's a 

officer/broker who is not -- the agent in that situation


is not acting on behalf of the officer.  He's acting on


behalf of the corporation.


QUESTION:  Then if I understand your argument


correctly, you're saying that the discussion, whether it's


California law or Federal common law, is in this case at


least academic because under California law, if you were


to apply it, there is no relief for these plaintiffs, that


the only remedy where it's -- the license is held in the


corporate name is a disciplinary sanction?

 MR. BENEDON:  To date, that is how California


has treated violations of the California statutory scheme. 


Correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Only -- only by these corporate


brokers or -- or by -- by individual brokers?


MR. BENEDON:  Excuse me, Your Honor.  Individual


brokers as well.


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. BENEDON:  It's a statutory scheme that


applies to brokers in general and salespersons in general


who -- who allegedly violate the act.


QUESTION:  But I thought you said that if -- if


this were a license to an individual broker, if this were


held -- the license were held by Meyer as an individual --


that he would then have a principal agent relationship 

with Crank.  Is that not so?


MR. BENEDON:  That is correct, Your Honor, if


it's an individual broker's license. 


I think I may have caused some confusion.  Under


general principles of agency law, common law principles of


agency law, the sales agent is in an agent principal


relationship with an individual broker.  If there is a


violation of the act by the broker under California law,


then he would be subject to disciplinary action.  That is


separate and apart from vicarious liability under the FHA,

which would adhere based on the principal agent


relationship. 


QUESTION:  Is there an issue in this case about


piercing the corporate veil as a means of holding Meyer


liable?


MR. BENEDON:  Not in this case, Your Honor.  We


hold that the theory and doctrine of corporate veil-


piercing is -- is available in the appropriate case as it


would be under any case under the general common law,


although here it's been -- it wasn't raised and it's been


waived, and it's never been proven.


QUESTION:  But they came --


QUESTION:  Was there some reference to


veil-piercing in the respondents' brief in the Ninth


Circuit? 


MR. BENEDON:  On the last page of argument in a


footnote, Your Honor, there's a reference arguing that


based on sole ownership, that they could establish an


alter ego, but as a matter of law, that's insufficient to


establish alter ego.


QUESTION:  Well, didn't -- refresh my


recollection.  Doesn't this come up on a motion for


summary judgment? 


MR. BENEDON:  First a motion to dismiss, Your


Honor --

 QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. BENEDON:  -- followed by a --


QUESTION:  Which was denied and then there was a


motion for summary judgment. 


MR. BENEDON:  The motion for dismiss was granted


in part, Your Honor, as to all the State law claims --


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. BENEDON:  -- the 1981 claim, and it


proceeded just on the FHA claim.


QUESTION:  Right.  Now, so if it came up on a


motion for summary judgment, then whatever -- whatever


evidence the plaintiffs were going to rely on for the


veil-piercing would have had to have been brought forward. 


Isn't that right? 


MR. BENEDON:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  And what did they bring forward? 


MR. BENEDON:  Nothing, except sole ownership.


QUESTION:  Sole ownership is the only thing --


MR. BENEDON:  Which is in dispute.  Which is in


dispute.  We maintain that ownership was, in fact,


transferred, but we are assuming for the purpose of this


proceeding that there is in fact ownership resided in


Mr. Meyer.


QUESTION:  I thought that if -- that a judgment


winner, as the Holleys are at this stage, can defend the

judgment on another ground.  In other words, the Ninth


Circuit ruled in their favor and now they're saying, well,


here's another theory on which we could prevail.  I didn't


know -- certainly they can't get an immediate victory, but


if they attempt to defend the judgment on that basis,


aren't they then entitled to go back and make the case


rather than taking from them their victory and saying you


lose?  They say, but we have another theory that would be


viable.  Up till now, we won with this one.  Why isn't


that altogether appropriate they should now be given a


chance to air that other theory in support of the


judgment? 


MR. BENEDON:  They -- the theory was never


raised below.  An alter ego is in and of itself a fact-


driven inquiry. 


Where it's -- and so the fact that it 

wasn't raised below, it's -- it's now been waived.  It


can't be raised for the first time in this Court.


QUESTION:  Even if -- even if it had been


raised, my understanding is in -- in order to have it sent


back on the -- on the basis that although the court below


relied on one theory, it could have relied on the other,


the motion for summary judgment put the plaintiff to his


proof to -- to at least come up with facts, the assertion


of facts, not the demonstration of them, but the assertion


of facts that would support the other theory.  And the

only fact contained here is control.  So if control is --


does not suffice to pierce veils, that's the end of the


case, it seems to me. 


MR. BENEDON:  That's correct.  That is correct


and that is our position. 


QUESTION:  I thought there were a bunch of


things.  I mean, the Government in its brief lists a whole


bunch of things.  He was the sole shareholder.  He was the


president.  He did control it.  He paid the taxes in his


own Social Security number.  He made various transactions


that violated the terms under which it was supposed to be


the corporate form, and he didn't train the person


properly.  I mean, they have a list of things which I take


it they didn't just make up, that they're there in the


record. 


Then -- and then they say that, well, in the


Ninth Circuit brief, what it says in the footnote is that


evidence -- evidence will show that Meyer is the sole


shareholder of Triad, and thus an argument to pierce the


corporate veil would be meritorious.  Well, they don't


list all those things in that footnote.  That's true.  But


we should send it back and let the Ninth Circuit decide.


I guess that's basically their argument, and I


think I want to hear as complete a response to that as --


as you have.  Maybe I've heard it already.

 MR. BENEDON:  No.  You -- I would like to


amplify on that, Your Honor. 


The issue of -- of alter ego that's been now


raised for the first time in this -- in this Court by the


Solicitor General is based on speculation beyond the


showing that there was sole ownership and that there is no


insurance coverage.  Everything else is unsupported by the


record in terms of establishing that there was a failure


to adhere to corporate formalities, that there was under-


capitalization.  All that is speculation.  And the


argument boils down --


QUESTION:  Was it not even asserted?  I mean --


MR. BENEDON:  No. 


QUESTION:  -- to survive the motion for summary


judgment, you don't have to prove it, but you have to say 

I -- you know, I will prove it.


MR. BENEDON:  No, it wasn't --


QUESTION:  It wasn't even asserted.


MR. BENEDON:  It was not even asserted.  It's


asserted for the first time in this Court.


QUESTION:  Well, in the footnote -- they mention


it in the footnote. 


MR. BENEDON:  They mention sole ownership in the


footnote.

While that was alleged, it was never proven at the summary


judgment stage.  That's just an allegation in their --

judgment stage.

brought in at all to establish it.

under his ID?  None whatsoever.


QUESTION:  Well, was -- was there an affidavit


on their side claiming that? 


MR. BENEDON:  On the other side claiming that?


QUESTION:  Yes.  How did it get raised?


MR. BENEDON:  It was raised solely as a -- as an


allegation in the complaint.  And then when it came time


for them to put their proof on the table, it wasn't there.


QUESTION:  So at the summary judgment stage,


they didn't rely on that is what you're saying.


MR. BENEDON:  Correct.


QUESTION:  They didn't.  Okay.


MR. BENEDON:  Correct.

 QUESTION:  And did you deny it?


MR. BENEDON:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  But


again, it was not raised as a disputed material fact on


the summary judgment, so there's no formal denial in the


record because it was never raised.  I'm denying it now.


QUESTION:  And you said there was no genuine


issue -- no triable issue at the summary judgment stage,


that there were no facts?


MR. BENEDON:  That there was no issue regarding


payment of taxes under Mr. Meyer's personal ID number.


QUESTION:  Well, if the question is the -- the


liability of Mr. Meyer -- and at the summary judgment


stage, it's not a trial.  You don't prove your case at


that point.  It's only if there's no genuine triable


issue.


MR. BENEDON:  Right.  The only issue on the


summary judgment was whether or not Mr. Meyer was still


the owner of Triad Corporation.  The district court found


not.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that there


was a disputed issue on sole ownership.


QUESTION:  But what was the relevance of whether


he was the owner or not?  I don't quite understand. 


MR. BENEDON:  They're claiming that that was


sufficient to establish alter ego, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Alter ego, but not piercing the

corporate veil, is that --


MR. BENEDON:  Well, I'm using those


interchangeably.  I apologize. 


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I didn't understand you.


MR. BENEDON:  I use those interchangeably. 


They -- both alter ego as a basis for piercing the


corporate veil.  They were arguing -- and in fact, the


Ninth Circuit held -- that sole ownership of the


corporation was enough to pierce the corporate veil.


QUESTION:  They were arguing that.  So they were


arguing the pierce the corporate veil theory then.


MR. BENEDON:  No.  They -- solely based on sole


ownership.  Correct.


QUESTION:  But the -- but the purpose of


investigating the sole ownership issue was to determine 

whether or not they could pierce the corporate veil.  Is


that right? 


MR. BENEDON:  Based --


QUESTION:  Which seems to me as though their


issue of whether they could pierce the corporate veil was


at least raised, and the question is whether their claim


of sole ownership was sufficient to establish that point. 


Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. 


MR. BENEDON:  Right.  Well, that -- that's the


argument that's made in their footnote on the last page of

their brief is that sole ownership would establish an


alter ego sufficient to pierce the corporate veil.  And as


a matter of law, that's -- that is insufficient.


QUESTION:  But -- but now I'm just a little


puzzled about the extent to which it was raised in the


district court.  Was there a debate on the -- in the


district court as to whether your client was the sole


owner or not? 


MR. BENEDON:  Yes, there was.


QUESTION:  And what was the purpose of that


debate in the district court?  Wasn't it for the very same


reason? 


MR. BENEDON:  They were trying to -- no, I


disagree.  I think what they were trying to establish in


the district court was the -- the control exerted by my 

client over the corporation as opposed to saying that he


should be necessarily a veil-piercing --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe I -- I don't remember the


facts correctly.  But I thought that control was really


not in dispute.  I thought that the -- the person to whom


he transferred stock didn't get all the stock, did he, or


did he get just some of the stock?


MR. BENEDON:  He got some of the stock, but


ownership --


QUESTION:  So he still would have had control.

 MR. BENEDON:  He would have partial control as


a -- as a shareholder.


QUESTION:  I see. 


MR. BENEDON:  But the -- the Ninth Circuit held


that that was enough.  The court -- the Ninth Circuit --


QUESTION:  Not -- not that it was enough for


piercing the veil, but that it was enough for what?


MR. BENEDON:  It was enough to impose personal


liability.


QUESTION:  On what basis?  Not on


veil-piercing --


MR. BENEDON:  No.


QUESTION:  -- basis.


MR. BENEDON:  Solely on sole ownership.  They --


the Ninth Circuit, taking a -- its lead from, I believe, 

the Seventh Circuit, said basically that in a situation


like this where you have sole ownership, under the FHA


that's enough to impose --


QUESTION:  Okay.  You don't have to pierce the


veil.


MR. BENEDON:  Correct.  It's -- it's an almost


per se piercing based on sole ownership.


QUESTION:  But just returning one -- once again


to the broker problem.  I'm looking at Gipson versus Davis


Realty, which is a case by Judge -- written by Judge

Molinari.  It's cited on page 15 of the respondents'


brief.  That was a standard respondeat superior case where


the broker -- pardon me -- where the salesman is in an


automobile accident and they seek to hold the principal


for the damages caused by the accident within the course


of his employment.  And this is the case where the


statement is made that the broker is liable for the


misconduct or -- or malfeasance of -- of the agent in the


course of -- of his employment. 


And it's a case much like this where there's a


corporation that holds the license.  There -- there


doesn't seem to be a -- a distinction between the


corporate license and -- and the broker license that you


made.  Is that -- was the law changed since the Gipson


case, or --


MR. BENEDON:  Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor.


Again, I -- I don't have the facts of that case


at -- at the tip of my fingers.


QUESTION:  Well, it was relied on in the


respondents' brief. 


MR. BENEDON:  Right.  But again, in that case I


don't recall if it was a corporate broker or whether it


was an individual broker.  But if it was a corporate


broker and they're holding them individually liable for


the torts of the --

 QUESTION:  Well, as I understand the facts of


the case, it was an individual who held the license and he


operated through a corporation.  That's -- that's --


MR. BENEDON:  Well, again, I would say that what


California decides to do is not what needs -- can be what


determines under the -- the Federal statute.  It's been


argued by both sides and the case law is consistent that


it's Federal rules of agency.  And under Federal rules of


agency, the salesperson is the agent of the corporation,


not the individual broker.


If there are no further questions, I would just


like to conclude and save the rest -- the remainder of my


time for rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Very well.


Mr. Schwemm.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT G. SCHWEMM


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. SCHWEMM:  Justice Stevens, and may it please


the Court:


I'd like to begin by addressing the


veil-piercing and the preserving issue, particularly with


respect to Justice Scalia's question because I disagree


with my learned friend on the procedural posture of this


case. 


There was a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  In the

complaint at that time, there were essentially two


theories.  The complaint said that Mr. Meyer should be


liable as an individual because he owned the corporation,


and the complaint also said that Mr. Meyer should be


liable because he was the officer/broker.


The district court granted in part, even with


respect to the Fair Housing Act claim, the 12(b)(6) motion


and, in particular, held that the allegations of the


complaint with respect to ownership under no circumstances


could lead to liability.  And the only thing that the


district court did not grant 12(b)(6) on was the issue


with respect to liability based on officer/broker. 


That led to discovery.  The district court then


granted summary judgment because it was the district


court's theory on that issue that there could not be 

liability unless Mr. Meyer held an individual broker's


license as opposed to what he holds in this case, which is


a license through Triad, or more properly, according to


the California law, Triad holds the license through him.


So with all respect, what the district court


held in the 12(b)(6) motion was that no set of facts that


the plaintiffs could prove could justify veil-piercing. 


We never got --


QUESTION:  Well, could prove or -- or claimed


they could prove in response to the motion.  I mean,

you -- you don't have to sit back and say, I wonder what


they might be able to prove.  You -- you have to have made


an offer of proof, and -- and what the court held was that


none of the facts that you claimed you could prove would


suffice.  Isn't that an accurate description of -- of


what -- what the holding of the court was?


MR. SCHWEMM:  And the facts that we alleged were


that Mr. Meyer was the sole owner of the corporation,


which they denied, and that that was sufficient to impose


individual liability.  And when the district court granted


12(b)(6) motion, my understanding of that is that he is


saying, under no set of facts will you ever win. 


Now, what would --


QUESTION:  -- isn't that true that -- that you


have to have something more than simply a person being a 

sole owner of a corporation?  Otherwise a person couldn't


create a corporation with himself as a 100 percent owner.


MR. SCHWEMM:  Absolutely. 


QUESTION:  All right.  So they're -- what


they're saying is you didn't allege anything than that,


and you certainly didn't support anything other than that


with affidavits or other -- or other offers of proof.


MR. SCHWEMM:  That's -- that was my point --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. SCHWEMM:  -- with respect to the summary

judgment. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Well, if you -- if you


didn't, then you're out of luck, aren't you?


MR. SCHWEMM:  I don't think so because --


QUESTION:  Because? 


MR. SCHWEMM:  -- at the 12(b)(6) motion stage,


we are told that you can't even --


QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm not saying 12(b)(6). 


I mean on summary judgment. 


MR. SCHWEMM:  Yes.  If my learned friend was


right that this was a summary judgment dismissal of that


claim, I might agree.  But that's not right.


We were stopped at the very pleadings stage.  We


were prepared to show both of the key factors with respect


to veil-piercing, which is that the corporation is heavily 

underfunded.  In fact, in a colloquy with the district


court, the defendant's counsel, after the 12(b)(6) motion,


Your Honor, when the only thing left was the summary


judgment with respect to the broker situation, the


district court said, is there any money in the company? 


And the defendant's lawyer said, no, there is not.


QUESTION:  Okay.  I have your complaint here on


page 16 and 17 of the joint appendix.  First claim, Fair


Housing Act.  I don't see anything there about -- about


veil-piercing or anything like that.  Where -- where is it

in the complaint?


MR. SCHWEMM:  Correct, Your Honor.  The -- the


phrase veil-piercing is not mentioned --


QUESTION:  No, no.  Or anything even vaguely


like that.  I mean, what it seems to say is that Mr. Meyer


himself did all these things, or through his agent.  Now,


that's -- that's what it says.


MR. SCHWEMM:  The allegation, if I could refer


Your Honor to page 4 of the joint appendix in paragraph 6


of the complaint, says that he owned the corporation and


on that basis he's individually liable.  And then it goes


on and says he also was the officer/broker of the


corporation, which is the other theory --


QUESTION:  Yes, I see where it says he owned the


corporation. 


What I don't see is something that says, and 

therefore he is liable because he owned it.  I mean, it


just seems to be the part where you're describing the


parties.


MR. SCHWEMM:  There is another part, Your Honor. 


Page 7 of the joint appendix, paragraph 13, which carries


over to page 8.  Essentially the same thing.  I'm not


suggesting that there is additional material there, but


there is the allegation of ownership leading to personal


liability.


QUESTION:  No.  I mean -- to be honest with you,

I'm not -- I'm just debating with myself whether you -- we


should send this back to the Ninth Circuit, tell them work


this out or not.  And district court judges are not


mind-readers.  They -- they can't make up what you're


saying in a complaint unless you say it and unless you


argue it.  So -- so that's why I'm pressing you on this. 


I'm -- I'm trying to find the particular point where you


really made this point to the district court so the judge


would focus on it and make a decision.


MR. SCHWEMM:  Well, I wish it was more detailed,


Your Honor, but it seems to me it's sufficient for notice


pleading.  The district court understood it.  The


defendants understood it.


QUESTION:  Well, he didn't seem to, in his


opinion, understand it because the only reference he has 

to veil-piercing seems in a footnote in a paragraph.  And


what he seems to be saying there is referring to a


different argument, the argument that there could be no


veil-piercing because he didn't even own this corporation.


And he says, that -- that's really wrong.  It's not true. 


Or maybe he said it was right, but he was wrong if he said


it was right.


MR. SCHWEMM:  And that's at the 12(b)(6) stage. 


And -- and my understanding of that is he is saying, I'm


not going to get you -- let you go forward to your proof

because under no circumstances can there be veil-piercing


under the Fair Housing Act, which is just wrong.


QUESTION:  This was at the summary judgment


stage?


MR. SCHWEMM:  No, sir.  On page 32, which is the


district court's order, page 32 to the joint appendix,


which is the district court's order --


QUESTION:  32 of the joint appendix. 


MR. SCHWEMM:  Yes, Your Honor.  It actually


starts as an opinion on page 25 of the joint appendix.


This is the district court's order granting in part the


12(b)(6) motion.  He doesn't allow going forward at the


12(b)(6) stage the claim based on ownership.  He allows


going forward the claim based on corporate broker, and he


specifically refers to a case -- this is the 12(b)(6) 

decision -- that talks about veil-piercing.  Page 32 of


the joint appendix in the footnote. 


Now, our point is that that's enough for notice


pleading.  The defendants understood what was going on. 


The judge understood what was going on.  We were


prepared -- certainly at the summary judgment stage,


Justice Scalia, we would -- we would have been happy to go


forward with proof of underfunding, and there is


substantial proof of underfunding.  We would have been


happy to go forward with proof of lack of corporate

formalities.  This is a company --


QUESTION:  Well, had you alleged any of these


things?  I mean, opposing counsel referred in his argument


to an allegation that the individual taxpayer ID number


was being used.  Did you allege that in -- in the


complaint somewhere?


MR. SCHWEMM:  That we did allege.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Where is it?  I mean, this is


what we're fishing for.  Did you allege anything beyond


the mere claim of sole ownership?


MR. SCHWEMM:  Page 7 of the joint appendix, Your


Honor, paragraph 13 toward the bottom of the page.  After


it's been alleged that Triad was owned by Mr. Meyer --


QUESTION:  Yes.  I got it.


MR. SCHWEMM:  Got it? 


QUESTION:  Yes.


Did you allege anything -- I mean, okay, we've


got sole ownership.  We've got taxpayer ID.  Did you


allege anything else that might be a basis for piercing


the veil? 


MR. SCHWEMM:  We -- we did not allege the


details of that.  That is to say, we did not allege


underfunding, and we did not allege lack of corporate


formalities.  But it seems to me that's not required under


Conley versus Gibson.  There is notice pleading, and then

we are put to our proof if that had been permitted to go


forward to the summary judgment stage. 


QUESTION:  You're -- the point you're making is


that you are not certainly required under the Federal


rules to set out your -- any theory of the pleadings.  You


just have to state facts showing that there's a claim for


relief.


MR. SCHWEMM:  That's exactly right, Your Honor. 


And it seems to me in a case decided by this Court in the


mid-'90s -- I believe it was Peacock -- the Court said


veil-piercing is really not a new claim.  It is a theory


of relief.  We have claimed Fair Housing Act liability in


the complaint based on these --


QUESTION:  Mr. Schwemm, can I ask you this


question? 
 We really didn't grant certiorari to decide --

MR. SCHWEMM:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- a California question as esoteric


as this one is.  And I'm just wondering, do you defend the


rationale of the Ninth Circuit and do you defend the -- do


you abandon reliance on any Federal defense here?


MR. SCHWEMM:  Our position --


QUESTION:  Or Federal regulation. 


MR. SCHWEMM:  -- is that the Ninth Circuit's


judgment was correct, but it went too far when it reached


out and said under the Fair Housing Act we have to go

beyond traditional principles of agency.  We think the


standard should be, just as it is under Title VII, the


employment discrimination law, in Kolstad, Burlington


Industries, and Faragher, that the standard for vicarious


liability under the Federal statute should be a Federal


standard.  And that standard should be traditional agency


principles as informed by the policies of the Fair Housing


Act. 


Now, the Ninth Circuit apparently felt that they


had to go beyond traditional agency principles.  What


we've tried to do in the brief in Roman numerals I, II,


and III is point out three separate and independent


alternative theories under traditional agency principles. 


And in that sense, we -- we think the Ninth Circuit just


reached out and tried to do something that wasn't 

necessary. 


QUESTION:  Well, then is your piercing-of-


corporate-veil theory a Federal theory or a State law


theory? 


MR. SCHWEMM:  Our position on that is that it's


probably Federal law, but as I read Bestfoods, the Court


hasn't specifically determined, and if I may say that


this -- this is something that I don't have a position on. 


But either way, we are entitled to a remand whether it's


Federal or California law.  But the cause of action

clearly is the Fair Housing Act.


I believe the Government takes the position --


and we certainly don't disagree with the Government --


that it is a Federal question. 


And if I may, I want to get into those parts I,


II, and III of our brief, and particularly the first part


and vicarious liability. 


The problem we have with petitioner's argument


is that I believe it's based on two faulty assumptions. 


One is that petitioner wants to take certain parts of the


California corporation and real estate law that are


advantageous to him, but he doesn't want to take the other


part, which is the responsibility part.  It is literally


true that in California, a corporation can be a broker,


but it cannot be a broker unless there is an individual 

appointed who is an officer of the corporation and has


qualified under the broker requirements, and that


individual is required by California law to take


responsibility for the supervision and control of the


agency. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but your opponent says that


the -- the results under California law is he can be


disciplined if he fails to do so, but there are no


California cases holding him personally liable if he fails


to do so.

 MR. SCHWEMM:  Our position is that that may be


right, it may be wrong.  We believe this is a Federal


standard.


QUESTION:  Do you think it's right or wrong?


MR. SCHWEMM:  If we got a remand, Your Honor, we


would very much like the opportunity on this basis to


argue that it's wrong.  There is a California case in 1978


that holds that, but a year later, California amends its


licensing statute to add the very key provision in this


case which is 10159.2 which says that the individual who's


appointed by the corporation as the officer/broker has


personal responsibility.  So our argument would be on


remand that that change. 


But I want to -- I want to make the point


that --


QUESTION:  Well, can -- can I go back to an


earlier point you made.  You said that California law says


that the corporate broker, the -- the one who's designated


for the corporation, has to exercise control over the --


over the brokers in the corporation.  That may well be


true.


The -- the issue is not whether he -- he has to


exercise control.  It's whether he exercises control in


his personal status or rather exercises control as an


officer of the corporation.  If it's in the latter

capacity that he exercises control, he -- he should not


have personal liability.  It's the corporation that has


liability.


MR. SCHWEMM:  Well --


QUESTION:  Now, as I understand the California


law, this broker could not operate under that license on


his own.  The only way he could use that license was as an


officer of the corporation.  Isn't that correct?


MR. SCHWEMM:  I would put it actually a little


differently.  If you divide the corporation from


Mr. Meyer, Mr. Meyer can then apply, because he's


qualified, to become a broker.  Currently he would have to


file a paper, but he would clearly get the status.  But


Triad, Inc. would cease at that moment being able to be a


broker. 


And none of the acts in this case, none of the 

salesman's acts, could have been performed under the


rubric of Triad.


And the other point that I was going to make


about the petitioner's argument that I think is faulty is


it's the assumption that if Triad, Inc. is the principal


of these agents, nobody else can be the principal of these


agents.  And that's clearly inconsistent with longstanding


agency principles as reflected in the Restatement,


section 20, comment f, which says there can be joint


principals.

 QUESTION:  Well, yes, but -- sure, of course,


there can.  But -- but it's not -- it's corporation law


that -- that the officers of the corporation are not one


of those other principals.


MR. SCHWEMM:  Ordinarily, Your Honor, but not in


this case.  I -- I repeat.  This company cannot be a


broker if it doesn't have a broker-qualified individual


who takes responsibility for the agents.  And so --


QUESTION:  Do you think the Gipson case that you


cited in your brief is on all fours with your case?


MR. SCHWEMM:  No, Your Honor, it's not on all


fours.  I believe what it says is if the broker is


operating as a sole proprietorship, as an individual, he


clearly is vicariously liable.  That is, by the way, what


86 percent of the brokers in California do.  They operate


as sole proprietors, and they are clearly vicariously


liable.  There is a -- an additional question.  What


happens when you incorporate?  And -- and so it's not


exactly on all fours. 


And I think the -- the jury is out or the judges


are out with -- with respect to what California would do. 


Some States say in addition to the corporation, the


individual is vicariously liable; some don't. 


QUESTION:  Well, so that means you can't have a


corporation.  If -- if you want to run a real estate

corporation, you can't do it because there has to be a


broker's license, and you're going to be personally


liable.  What's the use of having a corporation then?


MR. SCHWEMM:  There are many uses, Your Honor,


and I would like to address that. 


The only thing that we are arguing that


Mr. Meyer was responsible for is what I would call the


licensed activities.  For example, if a broker went out on


the way to a meeting and negligently drove his car and


caused an accident, that is not the kind of behavior


that's subject to broker supervision.  And that would be


no liability.


QUESTION:  Well, but if he defrauds a client or,


I mean, anything that's going to involve big money on the


part of the corporation is going to come back on the head 

of the individual broker.  So you're saying if you want to


be in the brokerage business, you cannot do it as a


practical matter in the corporate form.


MR. SCHWEMM:  Only I'm not saying it, Your


Honor. 


QUESTION:  That's -- well, no.  That -- that's


what you say the California law says.


MR. SCHWEMM:  Yes.  And every State -- I want to


make this point.  Every single State says this.  11 States


say you can't even operate as a broker as a corporate

form.  39 States, including California, said we will allow


you to do this, but there has to be one human being that


is responsible. 


And in this particular case, there came a point


when Mr. Meyer was trying to get the Triad license


extended.  California said you haven't satisfied that


because you personally, Meyer, haven't engaged in the


continuing education requirements that an officer/broker


is required --


QUESTION:  That's even tougher than -- than what


most States provide for lawyers.


MR. SCHWEMM:  It's very analogous to lawyers,


Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  No.  It isn't analogous at all. 


Lawyers -- lawyers can -- can avoid personal liability. 

QUESTION:  California doesn't give personal


liability there, does it?  I mean, my statute here says


there's an officer who's designated by a corporate broker


license, and that officer is responsible for supervision


and control of activities conducted on behalf of the


corporation.  So that suggests that he's conducting that


supervision on behalf of the corporation, and so it's the


corporation that would respond in -- in -- under the


principle of respondeat superior.


MR. SCHWEMM:  Let me --

 QUESTION:  Evidently that's what California has


held, and given the wording, it seems reasonable.


MR. SCHWEMM:  Well, it held that and then


California's legislature came along and added -- added the


requirements. 


But let me -- let me make this observation: 


When Mr. Crank, the salesperson in this case, wanted to


extend his salesperson's license, he was required to have


his broker authorize the forms.  This was done four times


by Mr. Meyer.  If you look at the form -- joint appendix


lodging 75 is the most recent example, but there are three


other examples -- the California form says, list the


company.  Triad.  And then requires the officer/broker,


Meyer in this case, to sign a certification which


specifically says, I certify this salesperson is employed 

by me.


QUESTION:  I only have 74 pages in my joint


appendix.  You said it was joint --


MR. SCHWEMM:  I'm sorry.  I -- I misspoke. 


Joint appendix lodging, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Oh.


MR. SCHWEMM:  It's the large tan one. 


QUESTION:  Got you. 


MR. SCHWEMM:  And this was done, by the way, for


Mr. Crank on four different occasions.

 What I'm trying to -- to say is this is a

isn't true, Justice Scalia, in -- in every corporate


situation.  Of course, not.  We don't argue that.  We


argue that this is a responsible human being and that that


makes him liable --


QUESTION:  On the major question that we took


the case to decide, what -- what's the general rule --


well, we can ask the Government -- what the general rule


for when we look to State law and when we look to Federal


law.  Certainly State law informs what the Federal law


ought to be.  That's -- that's Faragher and Burlington.


MR. SCHWEMM:  That would be my response as well.


We have a -- a Federal standard informed by State law.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

may it please the Court:


As this case has been briefed in this Court,


it's common ground among the parties and the United States


that questions of vicarious liability under the Fair

Housing Act are to be decided on the basis of generally


applicable principles of agency and corporate law rather


than by reference to a rule that's distinct to the FHA. 


And obviously, it is a -- an important general principle


of corporate law.


QUESTION:  Well, do we look to general Federal


common law agency principles, or are we bound by State


agency law, Mr. Stewart? 


MR. STEWART:  I think the Court -- I'm sorry. 


I think the task for the Court would to -- be to devise a


uniform nationwide rule.  That's what the Court said --


But certainly the Court will look as -- as in


Faragher and in Ellerth, the Court looked to the


Restatement of Agency which for the most part is a


compilation of decisions rendered by State courts.  So


it's -- it's looking to the law of the States generally,


but it's not looking to the law of a particular State.  So


with respect to our veil-piercing argument, we would say


that the Court should devise a uniform Federal --


QUESTION:  Well, do you think it's fair to read


the complaint that was filed as putting anyone on notice


that it was a veil-piercing case?


MR. STEWART:  We think that the claim was


adequately raised in the district court.


QUESTION:  Where?

MR. STEWART:  The plaintiffs --


QUESTION:  I don't think if I read that


complaint, I would read it as one that was proceeding on a


veil-piercing theory.


MR. STEWART:  Well, the --


QUESTION:  I would have thought it was


proceeding on the designated broker theory. 


MR. STEWART:  Well, the plaintiffs -- the


plaintiffs didn't use the phrase, veil-piercing, but on


page of the joint appendix, for instance, they alleged


that Mr. Meyer is the designated officer/broker of Triad, 

the president of Triad.  They also alleged that


Mr. Meyer -- they alleged that Mr. Meyer was the sole


shareholder of Triad.  In addition, as Mr. Schwemm pointed


out --


QUESTION:  But that would be consistent with a


corporation that's wholly adequately funded and -- and


whose -- which -- whose veil cannot be pierced.


MR. STEWART:  And it's true that they -- they


didn't allege in the complaint inadequate capitalization. 


However, as Mr. Schwemm pointed out, there was a colloquy

in the district court in which the petitioner's counsel


appeared to acknowledge that the corporation was without


assets.  And --


QUESTION:  But it isn't -- I mean, look.  The


judge is sitting there on a motion to dismiss the


complaint, and he reads the complaint.  And when he reads


the complaint, he looks to claims, and he sees first


claim, Fair Housing Act, which doesn't have a word about


this theory.  And apparently in the brief, a different


theory was produced, the one that's been produced today,


that the reason they're liable is not because we want to


pierce the veil, but because it's Mr. Meyer who's really


the holder of the license in some sense, and that is


sufficient. 


So not surprisingly, the district court says 

that.  He says any liability against Meyer as an officer


of Triad would attach only to Triad in that plaintiffs


have not urged theories that could justify reaching Meyer


individually, with one exception.  And he then goes and


discusses the exception.  Well, if I were a district


judge, I would have thought I had done my job at that


point unless somebody came in and petitioned for rehearing


and said, judge, you missed something, which no one did.


MR. STEWART:  I think you're right that the


primary theory that the respondents advocated in the

district court was based on Mr. Meyer's --


QUESTION:  No.  Sole.  Let's try sole theory.


MR. STEWART:  Well, this -- this was raised and


disputed in the Ninth Circuit; that is --


QUESTION:  In the footnote.


MR. STEWART:  Not just in the footnote.  In the


Ninth Circuit at page 7 and 8 of the petition appendix,


the Ninth Circuit having turned to the possible liability


of Mr. Meyer as the shareholder of Triad.  And the Ninth


Circuit said petitioner Meyer disputes that he was sued in


that capacity.  However, the Ninth Circuit goes on to


hold, we disagree.  We think that claim was adequately


raised in the district court. 


QUESTION:  Of -- of course, what was raised is


we get Meyer because Meyer holds the license, and even 

though it's held in the name of the corporation, that


really doesn't matter. 


MR. STEWART:  No.  But the Ninth Circuit clearly


understood the claim against Meyer as shareholder to be


distinct from or at least in addition to the claim against


Meyer as designated officer/broker. 


That is, what -- what seems to us to make this a


paradigmatic case for veil-piercing, taking the facts --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe it is.


MR. STEWART:  -- in the light most favorable to

the respondent, is the combination of functions that


Mr. Meyer played. 


Now, it's true that the respondent by and large


and the Ninth Circuit appeared to regard these distinct


functions as separate and independent bases for liability. 


But in our view, it's only a short step to say even if no


one of the roles that Mr. Meyer played would be an


independently sufficient ground for imposing personal


liability, the combination of functions, together with the


inadequate -- apparent inadequate capitalization --


QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, as -- as I understand


the theory of why the failure to bring forward affidavits


or some -- some evidentiary proof of these matters at the


summary judgment stage was not necessary, as I understand


it, the plaintiffs' theory is it wasn't necessary because 

the piercing-the-veil portion of the complaint never made


it to the summary judgment stage.  It had been dismissed


on the face of the complaint.  Is that correct?


MR. STEWART:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  Now, was there an appeal of that


dismissal on the face of the complaint? 


MR. STEWART:  The -- the ultimate -- there was


not a separate appeal, but the ultimate appeal that went


to the Ninth Circuit was an appeal both from the dismissal


of certain portions of the complaint and from the grant of

summary judgment with respect to --


QUESTION:  What portion?  Was -- it was an


appeal of the -- of the portion of the complaint that


dismissed -- dismissed a -- a veil-piercing --


MR. STEWART:  It was not specific.  The -- the


appeal from the dismissal was with regard to Mr. Meyer's


potential liability as shareholder and the appeal from the


grant of summary judgment with regard to his potential


liability as designated officer/broker was based on the


grant of summary judgment. 


QUESTION:  Well, so in addition to the complaint


being very vague, the -- the appeal of the dismissal was


pretty vague too.  I -- I don't understand what -- I mean,


if you were objecting to the dismissal of the -- of -- of


a veil-piercing theory, you -- you should have, it seems 

to me, come forward and say, I object to dismissal of that


theory.


MR. STEWART:  I would acknowledge that the


theory that -- that we and the respondents have -- the


veil-piercing theory that we have advanced in this Court


is a refinement of what was said in the Ninth Circuit. 


But it's -- it's always been part of the case that


Mr. Meyer's liability was alleged on the basis of his


status as shareholder, his status as designated


officer/broker, his status as president.  And again, the

claim in the Ninth Circuit tended -- tended to be more


that these were independent bases for liability.  And our


view is that no one of them would be sufficient in and of


itself.  Taken together, they establish that Mr. Meyer


exercised pervasive control over --


QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, I'm -- I'm confused


about one procedural point.  Was there not a final


judgment in the district court --


MR. STEWART:  There -- there --


QUESTION:  -- at the end of the rope, one final


judgment that says that defendant wins and then you --


from that final judgment you can take up all the rulings


against the verdict -- the -- the judgment loser?


MR. STEWART:  That -- that's correct.  The


district judge first threw out on 12(b)(6) everything 

except the claim against Mr. Meyer as designated


officer/broker, and subsequently entered summary judgment


for the petitioner on that claim.  And then there was a


final judgment and that was taken up to the Ninth Circuit.


QUESTION:  And the final judgment would include


all the rulings on the way to that final judgment


disposing of the entire case.


MR. STEWART:  That -- that's correct. 


Now, in the course of doing discovery on the


designated officer/broker question, they -- the plaintiffs

unearthed some facts that are potentially relevant to the


veil-piercing theory, but they've had no discovery on


veil-piercing as such. 


And another important criterion in determining


whether veil-piercing is appropriate is whether the


individual bears some degree of personal fault for the


wrong alleged.  And here, the plaintiffs' allegation is


that Mr. Meyer negligently supervised Mr. Crank, that that


was a contributing factor in Crank's ultimate misconduct,


and that would suffice to show that aspect of the


veil-piercing analysis. 


I think it's also important to note that courts


are typically more willing to pierce the veil in tort


cases than in contract cases; that this Court has


described the Fair Housing Act as -- as essentially 

defining a new type of tort.  The theory is that in


contract cases, an individual who contracts with a


corporation has his own opportunity to assess the -- the


corporation's finances and decline to do business if the


corporation seems likely not to be able to satisfy its


obligations whereas in a tort case the -- the potential


plaintiff has no opportunity to do that.


Inadequate capitalization has always been an


important factor in veil-piercing analysis, and really it


goes to the question whether the incorporators have

QUESTION:  You don't -- you don't rely in your


submission on the proposition that under California law,


the broker is liable. 


MR. STEWART:  We -- we don't.  That --


QUESTION:  And is that because you accept the


distinction between a corporate broker -- a broker's


license which is in the corporation?


MR. STEWART:  I think it's partly that.  I think


it's partly just the general background rule is individual


supervisors are ordinarily not vicariously liable for


torts committed by the people they supervise.


QUESTION:  Suppose in a majority of the States,


the broker is liable for the -- I forget the --

intervening corporate -- suppose in a majority of the


States, the broker is liable for the acts of the


salesperson.


MR. STEWART:  May I answer?


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. STEWART:  If a consensus developed among the


States that designated officers/brokers were sufficiently


different from ordinary supervisors that they should be

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Stewart.


Mr. Benedon, you have 7 minutes left.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS G. BENEDON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. BENEDON:  Your Honors, I would submit at


this point unless there are any further questions. 


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  I --


QUESTION:  Oh, excuse me.


QUESTION:  I do have -- I'm still -- what is --


what is your response to the -- to the assertion that it


was not necessary for the plaintiffs to bring forward any


affidavits or evidence at the summary judgment stage


because on the -- on the veil-piercing issue -- because 

that issue was no longer alive at the -- at the summary


judgment stage.  It had been dismissed on the complaint.


MR. BENEDON:  I would start from the premise


that the veil-piercing theory was never born, not that it


wasn't alive.  Okay?


QUESTION:  In other words, you -- you concede


that then and -- and you -- you fall back on -- on the


simple fact that the veil-piercing theory was never -- was


never really contained in the complaint. 


MR. BENEDON:  Never contained in the complaint,

never raised --


QUESTION:  But it is actually.  I mean, it says


that -- that the -- the defendant violated the Fair


Housing Act when his agent discriminated.  That's what it


says in paragraph 41. 


And then previously in paragraph 13, it lists a


whole lot of facts about the relationship of Mr. Meyer to


the company including the fact about the tax numbers and


so forth. 


And so what they say is, you know, the complaint


doesn't have to spell out every theory, but it does state


some facts there from which this basis could be fairly


inferred, and therefore it shouldn't have been dismissed. 


Rather, they should have had at least an opportunity to


argue it. 


I -- I take it something like that is their 

claim. 


MR. BENEDON:  But again, we have to look at what


are the allegations in the complaint.


QUESTION:  Well, the allegations are just what I


had said, paragraph --


MR. BENEDON:  There --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. BENEDON:  There are allegations of sole


ownership, corporate -- that he was the sole owner, that


he was the officer/broker, and that he was the president,


52

and that the taxes were paid under his ID number, an


allegation that's never been proven. 


I think most telling to what was the issue in


this case is the holding of the Ninth Circuit itself, and


that's at page 67 of the joint appendix where the court of


appeals states where common ownership and management


exists, corporate formalities must not be rigidly adhered


to, a holding which is clearly erroneous, but which sets


out what was the issue in this case.  The issue was not


under-capitalization.  The issue was not mismanagement of


corporate formalities.  The issue is -- was could


Mr. Meyer as an individual be held liable because he was


the sole owner, president, and designated broker of


Triad -- Triad Realty.  Excuse me.


And for that reason, the Ninth Circuit should be 

reversed and the judgment of the district court in favor


of Mr. Meyer reinstated in full.


JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Benedon.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
