CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in Case No. 15-1293, Lee v. Tam. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Stewart. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The statutory provision at issue in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, 15 U.S.C. 1052(a), prohibits the registration of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any mark that may disparage persons, institutions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beliefs, or national symbols.  Based on that provision, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the PTO denied Respondent's application to register The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Slants as a service mark for his band.  The PTO's ruling 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not limit Respondent's ability to use the mark in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce, or otherwise to engage in expression or debate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on any subject he wishes. 

 

 

 

 

            

Because Section 52(a)'s disparagement 

 

 

 

provision places a reasonable limit on access to a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government program rather than a restriction on speech, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it does not violate the First Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is copyright -- copyright 

  

 

 

 

 

a government program? 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I think we would say copyright

and copyright registration is a government program, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

4 

it's historically been much more tied to First Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

values to the incentivization of free expression. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But part of that, seems to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, to ignore the fact that we have a culture in which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have tee shirts and logos and rock bands and so forth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are expressing a -- a point of view.  They are 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

using the -- the market to express views. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. STEWART:  I mean, certainly --

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I was -- disparagement 

   

  

 

 

 

clearly wouldn't work with copyright, and -- but that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a powerful, important government program. 

 

 

 

 

            

about that. 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Let me say two or three things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First, there's no question that through 

 

 

 

 

 

their music, The Slants are expressing views on social 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and political issues.  They have a First Amendment right 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to do that.  They're able to copyright their songs and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get intellectual property protection that way. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If Congress attempted to prohibit them, 

 

 

 

 

 

either from having copyright protection or copyright 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration on their music, that would pose a much more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial First Amendment issue.  But --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Substantial First Amendment 

  

 

 

 

issue.  I was somewhat surprised that in your briefs you

couldn't bring yourself to say that the government could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not deny copyright protection to objectionable material. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Are you going to say that? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. STEWART:  I -- I hate to give away any 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical statute without hearing the justification, 

 

 

 

 

 

but I'll come as close as I possibly can to say, yes, we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would give that away.  It would be unconstitutional to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deny copyright protection on that ground. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I -- I would also say, even in the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

copyright context, we would distinguish between limits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on copyright protection and restrictions on speech.  For 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance, it's historically been the case, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remains the position of the copyright office, that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person can't copyright new words or short phrases.  Even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if a person comes up with something that is original, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is pithy, that makes a point, if it's too short, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't get copyright protection. 

 

 

 

 

            

We would certainly defend the 

 

 

 

 

constitutionality of that traditional limit on the scope 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of copyrightable material, and if there were a First 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment challenge brought, we would argue that there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a fundamental distinction between saying you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright a four-word phrase and saying you can't say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the four-word phrase, or you can't write it in print. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But there's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's a significant 

   

  

 

6 

difference between the copyright regime, you can't sue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for copyright infringement unless you register.  Isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that so? 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  You have to have filed an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

application to register in order to -- to pursue an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement suit.  And so the -- the statute -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe it's 17 U.S.C. 411(a) indicates that if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed an application to register your copyright, even if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that application has been denied, you can still bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your copyright suit, and the register is entitled to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heard on questions of copyrightability. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's no restriction 

  

 

 

 

on -- on the trademark. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  You can file 

  

  

 

 

 

 

a suit under Section 1125(a) of Title 15 under -- under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trademark laws either for infringement or of an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unregistered trademark or for unfair competition more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally.  But -- but --

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I'm -- I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concerned that your government program argument is -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circular.  The claim is you're not registering on my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mark because it's disparaging, and your answer is, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we run a program that doesn't include disparaging 

   

 

 

 

 

 

trademarks, so that's why you're excluded.  It -- it

doesn't seem to me to advance the argument very much. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Well, I think the 

   

  

 

 

7 

disparagement provision is only one of a number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions on copy -- I'm sorry, on trademark 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registrability that really couldn't be placed on speech 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself.  For example, words -- marks that are merely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

descriptive, that are generic, marks as to which the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the applicant is not the true owner because somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else was previously using the mark in commerce, those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't be registered either. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, each of those -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I know there are several -- are related to the ultimate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of a trademark, which is to identify the source 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the product.  So every trademark makes that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement. 

            

Now, what is -- what purpose or objective of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademark protection does this particular disparagement 

 

 

 

 

 

provision help along or further?  And I'm thinking of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the provision that says you can say something nice about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a minority group, but you can't say something bad about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  With all the other -- I know the others -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know all, but I know many of them, and I can 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relate that.  You relate this. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I think Congress evidently 

    

 

 

 

concluded that disparaging trademarks would hinder

commercial development in the following way:  A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

trademark in and of itself is simply a source 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

identifier. 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right. 

  

 

MR. STEWART:  Its function is to tell the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

public from whom did the goods or services emanate.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not expressive in its own right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, it is certainly true that many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial actors will attempt to devise trademarks that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not only can identify them as the source, but that also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are intended to convey positive messages about their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

products.  For example, if you see the -- the name Jiffy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lube or a B&B that's called Piney Vista.  The -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mark is -- is sort of a dual-purpose communication.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

both identifies the source and it serves as a kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

miniature advertisement. 

 

            

There's always the danger, as some of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus briefs on our side point out, that when a person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uses as his mark words that have other meanings in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common discourse, that it will distract the consumer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the intended purpose of the trademark qua 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademark, which is to identify source, and basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress says, as long as you are promoting your own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product, saying nice things about people, we'll put up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that level of distraction. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But suppose the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

application here had been for Slants Are Superior.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a complimentary term.  Would that then be -- take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it outside the disparagement bar? 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. STEWART:  I -- I think that under the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

PTO's historical practice, probably not.  I believe --

    

 

 

 

 

 

and I think the same thing would be true of other racial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

epithets, terms that have long been used as slurs for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular minority group --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why isn't that 

  

 

 

 

 

disparaging of everyone else?  Slants Are Superior, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

well, superior to whom? 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I -- I think the basis for the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

PTO's practice, and they obviously don't have that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- that case, is that the term "Slants," in and of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself, when used in relation to Asian-Americans --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I have it.  Right.  I want 

    

    

  

 

 

to get the answer to my question because that is the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question I have for you. 

   

 

 

            

The only question I have for you is what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose related to trademarks objective does this serve? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I want to be sure I have your answer.  Your answer 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so far was, it prevents the -- or it helps to prevent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the user of the product from being distracted from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic message, which is, I made this product.

your answer, I will -- my follow-up question to that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be, I can think probably, and with my law clerks, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps 50,000 examples of instances where the space the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademark provides is used for very distracting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

messages, probably as much or more so than the one at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, or disparagement.  And what business does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress have picking out this one, but letting all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other distractions exist? 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Well, I think what -- I think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

what you've described as my first-line answer, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the precise justification for different kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- for prohibiting registration of different kinds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disparaging trademarks would depend to some extent on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who is being disparaged.  That is, in the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not disparaging; your 

  

 

 

 

 

answer was distracting.  And -- and -- and one of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

great things of 99 percent of all trademarks is they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't just identify; boy, do they distract.  It's a form 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of advertising.  So if the answer is distracting, not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you didn't provide an answer to disparagement.  You're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer is why disparagement was they don't want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distraction from the message. 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  They don't want -- they don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want distraction and they don't want particular type --

types of distraction.  That is, when we're dealing --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's where I have the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question.  What relation is there to a particular type 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

of distraction, disparagement, and any purpose of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademark? 

            

MR. STEWART:  The -- the type -- the type of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distraction that may be caused by a disparaging 

   

 

 

 

 

 

trademark will depend significantly on the precise type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of disparagement at issue.  That is, in the case of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial epithets, these words are known to cause harm, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause controversy.  They -- in some sense they may no --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they may be no more distracting than a positive message, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but Congress can determine this is the wrong kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distraction. 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stewart, please. 

  

 

 

 

MR. STEWART:  Another type would be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

competing soft drink manufacturer who wants to register 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trademark Coke Stinks, who wants to identify his own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product with a sentiment that is antithetical to one of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his competitors.  Congress can determine we would prefer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to encourage that form of commerce.  We can prefer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- that -- that commercial actors will promote their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own products rather than disparage others.  Obviously, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under the First Amendment, we couldn't prevent that kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of criticism, but we can decline to encourage it.

I'm sorry. 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Assume government speech 

  

 

 

 

itself is not involved.  I always thought that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

government programs were subject to one extremely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important constraint, which is that they can't make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctions based on viewpoint. 

 

 

 

            

            

So why isn't this doing exactly that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. STEWART:  Because it -- it precludes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

disparagement of all and it casts a wide net.  It --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Well, that's 

  

  

 

 

absolutely true.  It -- it precludes disparagement of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Democrats and Republicans alike, and so forth and so on, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it makes a very important distinction, which is that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can say good things about some person or group, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't say bad things about some person or group. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, for example, let's say that I wanted a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mark that expressed the idea that all politicians are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corrupt, or just that Democrats are corrupt.  Either 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way, it doesn't matter.  I couldn't get that mark, even 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though I could get a mark saying that all politicians 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

are virtuous, or that all Democrats are virtuous. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Either way, it doesn't matter.  You see the point. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The point is that I can say good things 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about something, but I can't say bad things about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something.  And I would have thought that that was a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

fairly classic case of viewpoint discrimination. 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. STEWART:  Well, as we pointed out in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, laws like libel laws have -- have not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically been treated as discriminating based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewpoint, even though they --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's libelism, one 

  

 

 

 

 

of our historically different, but very distinct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories.  And you don't make the claim that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

falls into a category of low value speech in the way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that libel laws and the way that defamation does or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fighting words or something like that.  And you're not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking to create a new category. 

   

 

 

 

            

So in that case, it seems that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewpoint-based ban applies, and -- and this -- as I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, I would be interested to hear your answer of why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the example that I stated is not viewpoint-based.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

says you can say something bad about -- you can say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something good about somebody, but not something bad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about somebody or something. 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Well, certainly if you singled 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out a particular category of people like political 

   

 

 

 

 

 

officials and say -- said you can't say anything bad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about any of them, but you can say all the good things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want, I think that would be viewpoint-based, because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would be protected a discrete group of people.

Let me just give a -- a couple of other 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

14 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why isn't that this? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but if you didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit it, if you -- if you said you can't say anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad about anybody any time, that's okay? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Again, it's -- again, we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not saying you can't say anything bad.  We're saying we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't register your trademark if it is disparaging. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Certainly --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no.  That's -- it --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as I said, even in a government program, even assuming 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that this is not just a classic speech restriction, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're still subject to the constraint that you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminate on -- on the basis of viewpoint. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Well, in -- in Boos v. Barry, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's -- it's not a majority opinion, but the Court there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was confronted with a law that made it illegal to -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe it was post signs or engage in expressive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity within 500 feet of a foreign embassy that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to bring the foreign government into contempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or disrepute.  And the -- the law was struck down as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sweeping too broadly, but at least the -- the plurality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have held that it was not viewpoint-based because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it applied to all foreign embassies.  It didn't turn on

the nature of the criticism. 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

Another example I would give, and it's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical example, but at least I have a strong 

   

   

 

 

 

 

instinct as to how the -- the case should be decided. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Suppose at a public university the -- the school set 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aside a particular room where students could post 

   

 

 

 

 

 

messages on topics that were of interest or concern to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them as a way of promoting debate in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonconfrontational way, and the school said, just two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground rules:  No racial epithets and no personal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

attacks on any other members of the school community. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It -- it would seem extraordinary to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a viewpoint-based distinction that can't stand 

   

 

 

 

 

because you're allowed to say complimentary things about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your fellow students --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so the government is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the omnipresent schoolteacher?  I mean, is that what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

you're saying? 

 

            

            

MR. STEWART:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The government's a 

  

 

 

 

schoolteacher? 

            

MR. STEWART:  No.  Again, that analysis 

  

  

 

 

 

would apply only if the public school was setting aside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a room in its own facility.  Clearly, if the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempted more broadly to restrict disparaging speech by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

students or others rather than simply to limit the terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

under which a forum for communication could be made 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

available, that would involve entirely different 

 

 

 

 

 

questions.  That's why the plurality in Boos v. Barry 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have found the law unconstitutional even though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they found it not to be viewpoint-based. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But one distinction 

  

 

 

 

 

is the scope of the government program.  If you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about a particular discussion venue at a -- at a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

public university, that's one thing.  If you're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the entire trademark program, it seems to me to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something else. 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Well, the -- the trademark 

  

 

 

 

 

 

registration program and trademarks generally have not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically served as vehicles for expression.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is, the Lanham Act defines trademark and service mark 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purely by reference to their source identification 

 

 

 

 

 

 

function. 

            

And I think it's -- to -- to get back to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright for just a second, I think it's at least 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

noteworthy that everyone would recognize that Mr. Tam is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not entitled to a copyright on The Slants.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

copyright office doesn't register short phrases.  Two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

words is certainly short, especially when one of them --

not because of the content or the viewpoint expressed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

it's just it's a short phrase, and any short phrase 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be no good.  This is -- this is -- you can't say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Slants because the PTO thinks that's a bad word.  Does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it not count at all that everyone knows that The Slants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is using this term not at all to disparage, but simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to describe? 

 

            

            

the word. 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I think --

    

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It takes the sting out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. STEWART:  Well, the trademark examining 

  

 

 

 

 

attorney went through this in a lot of detail.  And the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademark examiner acknowledged that Mr. Tam's sincere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent appeared to be to reclaim the word, to use it as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a symbol of Asian-American pride rather than to use it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a slur.  He -- he also found a lot of evidence in 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form of Internet commentary to the effect that many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Asian-Americans, even those who recognized that this was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Tam's intent, still found the use of the word as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

band name offensive. 

 

 

            

But the point I was trying to make about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright is, is not that copyright protection would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied on the ground of disparagement.  You're right, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be denied because it's a short phrase and not even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an original phrase.  But copyright is kind of the branch

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you deny that trademarks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are used for expressive purposes? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I don't deny that trademarks 

    

 

 

 

 

are used for expressive purposes.  As I was saying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

earlier, I think many commercial actors will pick a mark 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that will not only serve as a source identifier, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that will cast their products in an attractive light 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and/or that will communicate a message on some other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

topic.  My -- my only point is in deciding whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular trademarks should be registered, Congress is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to focus exclusively on the source 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identification aspect. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I wonder if you are not 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

stretching this, the -- the concept of a government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

program, past the breaking point.  The government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provides lots of services to the general public.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think you would say that those fall within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government program line of cases that you're talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about, like providing police protection to the general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public or providing fire protection to the general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public.  Those cost money and those are government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

programs.  Can the government say, well, we're going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

provide protection for some groups, but not for other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

groups? 

            

MR. STEWART:  No.  I think those would raise 

    

  

 

 

 

 

19 

serious -- I mean, depending on the nature of the -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction -- equal protection problems, potential --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  There are potential -- there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are potential First Amendment problems, too, if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature of the distinction was based on the person's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speech; isn't that right? 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Certainly.  I mean, clearly, 

    

  

 

 

if it was based on viewpoint and clearly I would say --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So absolutely clearly if it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was based on viewpoint.  And -- and so I guess I don't 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to interrupt your answer to Justice Alito, if --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I want to get back to -- because I don't really 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand the answer that you gave me before.  You said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a government regulation that distinguished between 

 

 

 

 

 

saying politicians are good and virtuous and politicians 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are corrupt would clearly be viewpoint-based; is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

MR. STEWART:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So -- and similarly, if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said that the flag is a wonderful emblem, this -- this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies to national symbols --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Uh-huh.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- but you could say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

the flag is a wonderful emblem, but you can't say that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the flag is a terrible emblem. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. STEWART:  I --

    

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That would be 

  

 

 

 

viewpoint-based. 

            

            

MR. STEWART:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, that's what this --

    

 

 

 

 

 

this regulation does. 

 

 

            

            

MR. STEWART:  If you're talk --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It says you can say one of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those things, but you can't say the other and get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademark. 

            

MR. STEWART:  But it -- it sweeps with a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broad brush -- brush.  And I think the reason that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewpoint-based discrimination has historically been the 

 

 

 

 

 

most disfavored type of regulation from a First 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment perspective is that it creates the danger that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government is attempting to suppress disfavored 

 

 

 

 

 

 

messages.  I mean, there was a -- there's a TTAB, a 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

Trademark Trial and Appeal Board decision from 1969 that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declined to register a proposed trademark that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

essentially the Soviet hammer and sickle with a slash 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

through it.  And registration was denied on the ground 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it disparaged the national symbol of the Soviet

Union.  Now, obviously, hostility towards the Soviet 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

Union was not inconsistent with United States policy in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1969.  No one would have perceived the denial of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademark registration as an attempt to suppress a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disfavored viewpoint.  And the point of the -- the point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of my defense of the statute is it casts -- it sweeps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with such a broad brush --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's like saying it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

does so much viewpoint-based discrimination that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes all right. 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  But it -- it does so -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, it -- it imposes this restriction only within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confines of a government program.  And --

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, yes.  And -- and I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

willing to give you that.  But even government programs, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, assuming it's not government speech itself, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government programs are subject to this constraint, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is that you can't distinguish based on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewpoint of a speaker. 

   

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Well, part -- part of this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government program is government speech.  And let -- let 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me just describe the two types of basic services that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the PTO performs in the course of administering the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the program. 

 

            

First, when an application is filed, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

examining attorney and potentially the -- the Trademark 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

Trial and Appeal Board will go through it to see whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the applicant satisfies the statutory prerequisites to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration.  And some of those, like 1052(a), are not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essential to having a valid trademark.  But many of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prerequisites to registration overlap with the 

 

 

 

 

 

prerequisites to having a valid trademark.  And so when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the examining attorney decides, is this merely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

descriptive, is it generic, does it serve as a mark that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumers will associate with the -- the product in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce, is this person the true owner of the mark, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examining attorney is deciding the same sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions that could arise in an infringement suit if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the applicant ever filed one.  And therefore --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about scandalous? 

  

 

 

 

That's another one.  Scandalous or immoral.  Those are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

just like disparaged.  They block you from registering 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mark; right? 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  They do block you from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

registering the mark, not -- not from filing an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement suit or alleging unfair competition. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

thing. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because that's the same 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. STEWART:  That's -- that's the -- that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same thing as disparagement.  I -- I was just saying

many of the other statutory prerequisites do overlap 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

with the prerequisites to having a valid trademark. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so if the examining attorney approves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the application, he is giving the -- the applicant at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least some comfort that he can continue to use the mark 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in commerce with a degree of confidence that if somebody 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else infringes the mark, he will be able to satisfy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the prerequisites. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Running the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

courts is a government program.  Can you say that the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts -- when it comes to trademarks, the courts are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not open for actions to enforce infringement of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disparaging trademark? 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  If Congress had taken to its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

furthest possible step the desire to disassociate the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal government from the enforcement of -- or from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these marks --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that was how the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical was framed --

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Right. 

  

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- the furthest 

  

 

 

 

 

possible step.  But it's the same -- do you apply the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same analysis you do simply with the -- as in this case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How far can they go in defining the government program?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If it's a government 

   

  

 

 

program, can you do anything you want with speech? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Or what -- what are -- what are the restrictions that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can -- is it intermediate?  You don't argue that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute meets strict scrutiny. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. STEWART:  I think -- I think --

    

   

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I take it you don't. 

    

 

 

 

 

MR. STEWART:  No.  I think the basic test 

    

  

 

 

 

 

would be is it reasonably relate -- related to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectives of the government program, and in cases of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewpoint discrimination, in cases where the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program raises the concern that the government is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempting to promote disfavored messages and suppress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disfavored messages, the -- the program would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumptively unconstitutional. 

 

            

The second form of service that the PTO 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides in the course of administering the program is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if it decides the trademark should be registered, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it publishes the trademark on the Federal Register.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

publication has a -- is significant in a variety of

ways.  First, outside the -- the context of legal suits, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

publication of the trademark on the Federal Register 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

reduces the likelihood that any infringement will occur, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it provides notice to potential competitors in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce that the PTO has approved this mark.  It will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give them an incentive to choose marks that are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusingly similar. 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And just as importantly, 

  

 

 

 

 

because your time is running, the questions have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concentrated on viewpoint discrimination, but there's 

 

 

 

 

 

also a large concern with vagueness here, and the list 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we have of things that were trademarked and things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that weren't.  Take, for example, one had the word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Heb," and that was okay in one application and it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not okay in another. 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  First, if -- if the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepts our basic theory that this should be judged by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the standards that typically apply to government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits under a government program, although the 

   

 

 

 

 

statute doesn't draw an entirely bright line, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently clear.  The Court has approved, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instance, the criteria for awarding any A grants that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

were at issue in Finley to the effect that the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant givers should take account of the diverse views 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and beliefs of the American public. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

The trademark -- the PTO receives 300,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

trademark applications every year, so it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surprising that there is some potential inconsistency. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the other thing I would -- the other two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things I would say are, first --

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't it another way to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say it's not clear enough for them to get it right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  It -- it's not a bright-line 

   

  

 

 

 

 

rule.  I would say two things -- two further things 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before I sit down. 

   

 

            

The first is that I think a lot of the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

examples that the PTO has had trouble with and where it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may -- there may be an appearance in, perhaps, the fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of inconsistent decisions, are instances where people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are deliberately using terms that have historically been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insulting, but with the intent to be edgy, provocative, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reclaim the slur.  This is entirely legitimate, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when people self-consciously use words in a way other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

than they have traditionally been used, it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surprising that -- that sometimes they're -- they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misunderstood. 

            

The second thing I'd say is the examples 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the other side gives are -- raise the concern that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the PTO might have approved some trademarks that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't have approved, but they really haven't

MR. CONNELL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

If our client, Mr. Simon Tam, had sought to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

register the mark of his band as The Proud Asians, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not be here today.  But he did not do that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instead he sought to register The Slants. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we had this 

  

 

 

 

 

hypothetical case.  The facts are largely parallel to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

these, other than the band are non-Asians, they use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makeup to exaggerate slanted eyes, and they make fun of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Asians.  Could the government, under a properly-drawn 

   

  

 

 

 

statute, decline to register that as a trademark in your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view?

both commercial speech and noncommercial speech, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disparagement clause specifically targets the 

 

 

 

 

noncommercial speech and denies registration to marks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that only express negative views. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I have --

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in your view, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress could not draw a statute, even different to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, to make the distinction that the hypotheticals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points out, and the Congress, in your view, could draw 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no statute denying trademark protection in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical case. 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  I cannot think of a 

    

 

 

 

 

circumstance under which that could occur. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then I have a question 

   

   

  

 

for you.  This is a bit different than most cases.  No 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one is stopping your client from calling itself The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Slants.  No one is stopping them from advertising

themselves that way, or signing contracts that way, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaging in any activity, except that stopping someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

else from using the same trademark.  But even that they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could do.  Because you don't need a registered trademark 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to sue under the Lanham Act's entitlement for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusion of the public in the use of any kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered or unregistered mark.  If another band called 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves Slants, they would be subject to deceptive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advertisements because they wouldn't be this Slants. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So there is a big difference.  You are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

asking the government to endorse your name to the extent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of protecting it in a way that it chooses not to.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- there is a reason why the argument's appealing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And why shouldn't we consider it in those ways when your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speech is not being burdened in any traditional way? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  The registration program, the 

  

 

 

 

 

regulatory system of trademark registration, is widely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available to a broad number of mark holders who seek the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal protections of registration. 

 

 

 

            

In this case, the government has used the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disparagement clause to selectively deny those legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits to a mark holder expressing negative views that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government favors, as opposed to mark holders who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received those benefits because they express neutral or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

positive views that the government does favor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It doesn't answer my 

  

 

 

 

 

30 

question.  You can still use your name. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. CONNELL:  But --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why is it a burden? 

   

  

 

 

 

MR. CONNELL:  It -- it is a -- it is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden because our client is denied the benefits of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal protections that are necessary for him to compete 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the marketplace with another band.  And the only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for the denial of those benefits is the burden on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his noncommercial speech contained in the mark. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He can still sue. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  He can still --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He can still compete. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  He can still compete, but he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He's just not getting as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

much as he would like, but he's not stopped from doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what he's doing. 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  He could still -- his only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

resort at that point would be to seek the protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of -- or to assert his right to exclusive use of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mark under Section 43, or State trademark law, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common law, none of which have the extensive and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial benefits that this Court has recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under trademark registration.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

mean, does your argument depend upon the breadth of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government program?  Let's say you had a government 

   

  

 

 

 

 

program putting on a -- a festival or a lecture series. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

We only want pro-Shakespeare presentations.  It's about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

celebrating Shakespeare.  And if you disparage 

  

 

 

 

 

Shakespeare, you can't participate. 

 

 

 

            

            

Is there anything wrong with that? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. CONNELL:  I -- I don't believe there is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

in that -- in that limited forum, that that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would make a difference.  But this is not that case. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is a widely available program that's made -- that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all comers can -- can utilize. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but no, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not.  If you have a disparaging trademark, you can't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

utilize it. 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  Except again, that targets the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

noncommercial aspect of speech, which has nothing to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the commercial objectives of the Lanham Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess I 

   

  

 

 

 

don't understand yet your distinction why the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only-celebrating-Shakespeare program is -- is okay, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trademark one is not.  You can't disparage 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shakespeare.  You can't have disparaging marks about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anybody in the trademark context.  Is it just the

MR. CONNELL:  In -- in this case it is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why does that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why does that --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- matter? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, maybe the government 

    

 

 

 

 

just decides we want to celebrate everything.  We want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be relentlessly positive. 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. CONNELL:  And Justice Kagan, that goes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

back to your point before, that that would -- would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminate against any negative viewpoints and only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arm one side of the debate. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It isn't quite like that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

After all, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more like a single bulletin board on the train station. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The train station which has a thousand bulletin boards. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

People can say whatever they want.  But this bulletin 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board, one out of a thousand, is reserved today for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people who want to say nice things about Shakespeare. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This is not a general expression program. 

   

 

 

 

 

This is a program that has one objective.  The objective 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is to identify the source of the product.  It stops 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nobody from saying anything.  All it says is when you're

trying to fulfill our objective, which is identify the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

source of your product, if you want, put a little circle 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with an R in it and write down beneath in tiny letters, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  Anything you want.  But in that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circle, not the thing that says the insulting thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about somebody else.  See?  Very much like one 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Shakespeare celebration board out of a million.  Let me 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

say 10 million to make the point stronger.  Do you see? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's -- that -- that's where you can't express 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yourself, so -- and then I said to them, well, why do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you do that?  And they said because, you know, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of a -- of a trademark is to identify a source. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

It's not to get people into extraneous arguments.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what this will do is it will get people into extraneous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments, losing or diluting the force of a program 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that seeks to use a trademark to identify a source. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that's what I got out of my answer to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the last question on the other side, and I would like to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know what you think. 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  Actually, I think the -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

government's position is --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't care what their 

    

 

 

 

 

position is.  I want to know what you think in respect 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the question I'm asking. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  Well, I -- I think what the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

34 

government is trying to do here is simply encourage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial actors to conduct business in such a way as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to not insult customers. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, not -- not conduct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

business.  They can insult customers.  Boy, you could 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have 50,000 insults on every physical item that you put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out.  All you cannot do is when it comes to a little 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mark or a form of words, it is designed to say one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing -- I'm repeating myself -- I am the source of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product.  And you can do that in little letters, big 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letters, tiny letters, no letter, whatever.  But there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to stick to business, and if you're going to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond business, don't use insults. 

 

 

 

 

            

Do you believe that they can stop trademarks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from saying -- this is the trademark you can't use --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Joe Jones is a jerk? 

   

 

 

            

            

MR. CONNELL:  They could not stop that.

couldn't do that? 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  The government cannot burden 

  

 

 

 

 

35 

the noncommercial aspect of the mark, and that's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would be doing in that case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now, that's saying you 

  

 

 

 

 

cannot trademark a slogan that has one of George 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carlin's seven day -- dirty words in it.

those seven words, we won't register your trademark. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  I think that is a burden on 

    

   

 

 

 

 

speech.  In fact, I think if the phrase that was used in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but --

MR. CONNELL:  Well, I --

but we're not going to let you get the extra benefits of

36 

air, and this Court upheld it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  Yeah.  Pacifica actually 

  

  

 

 

simply was limited to time, place, and manner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions.  The Court expressly said that they were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not banning the use of those words.  And in addition, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pacifica did say that notwithstanding the content 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions imposed on -- on -- on those words, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact of the matter was that if the -- the restrictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were motivated by a negative view of the ideological or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political message being conveyed, that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But time, place, or manner, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there is time, place, or manner.  In fact, you can use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these words anywhere at any time in your performance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Just don't use them as the registered source of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

message, I am the owner of the -- of the -- of the band. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Time, place, and manner.  You have the entire universe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you can say what you want, including this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So why is this somehow not a restriction on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

time, place, and manner if the others were? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  Because, again, I come back to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the fact that this is a burden on the noncommercial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect of the mark.

JUSTICE BREYER:  How do you --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's go back to, if we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can, the earlier part of Justice Breyer's question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

1052 has two components.  You can't 

  

 

 

 

 

disparage or falsely suggest a connection with a person 

   

   

 

 

 

 

institution.  Are you challenging or saying that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

second part of 1052 falsely suggests the connection is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional as well? 

 

 

            

this Court. 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  That's not the question before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know.  But your 

    

  

 

 

argument earlier was that if someone slanders or libels 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an individual by saying -- Trump before he was a public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure -- Trump is a thief and that becomes their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademark, that even if they go to court and prove that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a libel or a slander, that trademark would still 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

exist and would be capable of use because otherwise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

canceling it would be an abridgement of the First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment? 

            

            

            

MR. CONNELL:  I believe that's correct. 

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That makes no sense. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Connell, don't you think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress could deny a trademark registration for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

something that fit within the narrow, historically

recognized category of libel and slander which have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never been regarded as having First Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection? 

            

MR. CONNELL:  I -- I think the outer limit 

    

   

 

 

 

 

of the protection here are the categories of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically prescribed speech.  That would include 

  

 

 

 

 

threats, it would include fraud, things such as that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's not the case, obviously, with the mark that we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using here. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, one of the things, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Connell, that troubles me about this case is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not quite as simple as just saying, well, here's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government program and the government is discriminating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the basis of viewpoint, because there are aspects of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this program that seem like government speech itself, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe not quite that, but something approaching it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the program says that anything that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered, the government publishes in its own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

publication.  The government sends to foreign countries, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

again, in its own publication.  So the whole program is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geared in such a way that individual marks that are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered end up being -- I doubt anybody would ascribe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them to the government, but the government republishes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, communicates them and so forth.  And doesn't that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect of the program give the government greater leeway

here than it would in a typical program in which no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

government speech itself is involved? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  It does not.  The register 

  

  

 

 

 

 

simply serves as a recordation of the marks that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government has approved according to the statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criteria.  This is in no way different than copy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration, patent registration, marriage license 

 

 

 

 

registration, car registrations, any other kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typical government registrations that are simply 

 

 

 

 

 

ministerial.  The government is not speaking.  It's not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

its message.  The control over the creation and design 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the mark is retained at all times by the owner. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is no history here of the government using marks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to speak through private mark holders, and there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

association with -- between the government and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mark itself. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But doesn't the 

  

 

 

 

government have some interest in disassociating itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from racial ethnic slur -- slurs?  Things like, what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the license -- Texas license, vanity license 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plate, and they said we won't do one with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Confederate flag. 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  That was specifically a 

  

 

 

 

 

government speech case.  That's not our case here.  This 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not a government ID, issued on government property,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You've said --

  

 

 

 

 

you've said several times that the problem is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government is burdening noncommercial -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

noncommercial aspects of the trademark, but it seems to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me that that's an awfully blurry line.  A lot of these 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademarks promote the commercial aspect, in fact, by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disparaging other groups.  So they figure that it's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way to promote sales.  How do you tell the difference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the commercial aspect of the trademark and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noncommercial aspect? 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  The commercial aspect is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

part of the mark that simply identifies the source of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the good or service in question.  In the case of The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Slants, there's another component, that being the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noncommercial, which communicates the political and 

 

 

 

 

 

social message of Asian pride. 

 

 

 

 

            

This is akin to Justice Breyer before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about the in -- inherit advertisement that can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take place.  Bands don't exist without names, and -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people associate the music with the band name and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

band name with the music that they perform. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So that -- that is where the noncommercial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect of -- of the speech comes in.  And to the extent

that the government is burdening it by denying

41 

a negative view, that's unconstitutional. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want us to say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademark law is just like a public park -- the public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

park, a public forum, the classic example of where you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can say anything you want.  We treat this -- we treat 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trademarks just like we treat speech in a public park. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thank you very much.  Good-bye.  That's it.  That's your 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument. 

            

MR. CONNELL:  It -- it is my argument.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the limitation on that, as I said before, are the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories of historically prescribable speech. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Connell, this 

  

 

 

 

 

can't be right, because think of all the other things, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other -- I mean, I'll call them content distinctions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they are -- that trademark law just makes.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, Section 2 prohibits the registration of any mark 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's falsely suggestive of a connection with persons 

   

 

 

 

 

 

likely to cause confusion, descriptive, misdescriptive, 

 

 

 

 

 

functional, a geographic indication for wine or spirits, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government insignia, a living person's name, portrait, 

   

 

 

 

 

or signature.  You couldn't make any of those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctions in a -- in a -- in a public park, and yet, 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of course, you can make them in trademark law, can't

you? 

            

MR. CONNELL:  All of those other 

  

 

 

 

 

42 

distinctions are viewpoint-neutral and advance the 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial objectives of the Lanham Act in terms of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reducing consumer confusion. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, these might be 

  

 

 

 

 

viewpoint-neutral, but they're certainly not 

 

 

 

 

content-neutral, and yet we would -- I mean, I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that a challenge to many of these would fall flat. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CONNELL:  On what basis? 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because -- like, how is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

trademark law supposed to function unless it can make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these kinds of distinctions? 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  I'm suggesting that those --

  

 

 

 

 

 

those sections would survive. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well --

  

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  Section B --

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- okay.  If those would 

  

  

 

 

 

 

survive, then this is not a public park, because those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not survive in a public park. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  Agreed. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's something different 

  

 

 

 

here, in other words, that this is coming up in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of a government program --

benefits that the government doesn't have to provide at

MR. CONNELL:  The -- the point here is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- the government program, at least the goals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Lanham Act, are to reduce consumer confusion, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is a legitimate interest that the government has. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And these -- these factors under 1052 advance that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that purpose. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I want to come back to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the Chief Justice's question.  I really have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficulty separating the expressive from the commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect of a trademark.  Let me give you an example. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think that Nike's phrase "Just Do It" is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered trademark.  Now, is that commercial or is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that expressive? 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  It is both.  The -- the two 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are intertwined.  The -- just like with The Slants.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the source identifier that is inextricably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intertwined with the message that the mark is -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveying about the source -- or about the goods and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services identified. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if they're 

  

 

 

 

inexplicably intertwined, then I -- I don't understand 

   

   

 

 

 

how we can separate them and apply to the expressive

part a more rigorous test than we would apply to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial part. 

 

44 

            

question. 

            

MR. CONNELL:  I'm not sure I understand your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Do you think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that viewpoint discrimination is always prohibited in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial speech?  For example, could the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say -- and maybe it already has said -- that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturer of cigarettes could not place on a package 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of cigarettes "Great for your health.  Don't believe the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surgeon general"? 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  Viewpoint discrimination is 

  

 

 

 

prohibited in commercial speech, no question, under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sorrell case. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it's back to really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Chief Justice's question.  I -- I wouldn't ask it, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

but I think -- except that I think you do have something 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of an answer that you haven't fully expressed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Look.  We're creating, through government, a 

  

 

 

 

 

form of a property right, a certain form.  That's a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

trademark.  It's as if through government we created a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain kind of physical property right that certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people could dedicate a small part of their houses or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land to Peaceful Grove.  And in Peaceful Grove, you

you don't write messages that will provoke others to

Anything wrong with that?  I can't think of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

45 

anything wrong with that.  There are thousands of places 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where they can express hostile feelings.  It's just in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this tiny place, one-quarter of an acre, that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yourself have chosen to take advantage of that you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it will destroy the purpose.  It will destroy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the purpose of Peaceful Grove.  That's why I asked my 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

To what extent does interfering with 

 

 

 

 

 

viewpoints here serve a trademark-related purpose?  As 

   

  

 

 

 

we can see how in Peaceful Grove or in Shakespeare, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

messages that we were talking about did harm the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government purpose.  And here, they're saying similarly, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

disparaging messages get in the way of the objective of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this program, which is to identify the source.  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, I think, is what I heard.  That's what I'd like 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you to think about and respond to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  Disparaging messages in 

  

 

 

 

trademark do not interfere with the source.  They simply

other message.  It's the other message. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I understand that. 

   

  

 

 

46 

But now your answer -- okay, I've got your answer.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now your other answers were worrying me, because what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worrying me is I accept what you just said -- suppose I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did; am I suddenly saying no Peaceful Grove, no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shakespeare celebration, no normal restrictions on 

 

 

 

 

 

normal restrictions, no function -- you know, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functional, can't have functional things in a trademark, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

da, da, da, all the ones we read.  If I buy into your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer just -- that you just gave, have I suddenly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opened the door to striking down all those things? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

because --

 

            

            

MR. CONNELL:  No.  I don't think so, 

    

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why not? 

  

 

 

 

MR. CONNELL:  Because the purpose, as -- as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you said, Your Honor, of Peaceful Grove was to have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place of seclusion, of solitude, of -- of calm.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely different than the trademark regime, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open to all comers and which simply is trying to advance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the goal of source identification.  And if the mark 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holder wishes to include a component in the mark to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow advertise the good, the service to convey a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different message, that doesn't get in the way of the

source identification at --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to me that you're defining the government program 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently than the government would.  I think they're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting that there's more to their program than just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

source identification. 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  That is not clear at all in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Lanham Act.  In fact, the only purpose of the Lanham 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act, as identified by this Court in Park ’N Fly -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was a citation to, I believe, the -- the Senate 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Report, was the reduction of consumer confusion and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection of the goodwill of the mark holder.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was no suggestion that this was a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we heard --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. CONNELL:  -- a politeness statute. 

   

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we heard from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Stewart that they thought the disparagement aspect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would distract from the commercial identification.  I --

    

 

 

 

 

 

I think that's what he said. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CONNELL:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you're saying 

  

 

 

 

 

that's -- that's not really their purpose or --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CONNELL:  Well, I'll say they -- that's

the occasion of insult to customers.  That's -- that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not part of the Lanham Act.  That's not part of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial purpose of the Lanham Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you say the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thing about a scandalous mark?  Would that be equally 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

impermissible? 

            

MR. CONNELL:  I think that conclusion is 

    

 

 

 

 

inevitable. 

            

If there are no further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. STEWART:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Let make three quick points. 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Connell has said that the government --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the government registration program regulates only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the expressive and not the commercial aspect of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mark, and I think that's getting it exactly backwards. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

The -- Mr. Tam wants to do two things with the mark The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Slants.  He wants to use the mark himself in relation to

his band, and he wants to be able to sue other people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who use it in a way that would cause him commercial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm.  And denial of a registration affects only the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

second thing.  It places no restrictions on his ability 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

to use the mark.  It may limit the remedies that are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available for infringement, but -- but that's entirely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating the commercial aspects of the conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The second thing is Mr. Connell's position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly is that the test for constitutionality of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration condition is, could the government ban this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speech altogether?  And putting that in place would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

eviscerate the trademark registration program.  Most 

  

 

 

 

 

obviously, as -- as Justice Kagan has pointed out, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are a lot of other content-based registration criteria. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in addition, I'd point out one of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prerequisites to registration is that you be using the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mark in commerce.  If this were truly a suppression of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

speech, we'd ask by what authority could the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make the right to speech contingent on providing goods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and services in commerce. 

 

 

 

            

Finally, Justice Kagan, you mentioned 

 

 

 

 

commercial speech.  And there is an important government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicative aspect to this program.  The preparation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the principal register is not just an ancillary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence of this program.  It's the whole point to

50 

has been approved, what's off limits. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the consequence of Mr. Connell's 

 

 

 

 

 

position is that the government would have to place on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal register, communicate to foreign countries the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vilest racial epithets, insulting caricatures of 

 

 

 

 

 

venerated religious figures.  The test for whether the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government has to do that can't be coextensive with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test for whether private people can engage in that form 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of expression. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Stewart, you really 

  

 

 

 

 

think that speech can be restricted by the government on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ground that foreign countries may object to it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Could -- could the government do that with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright?  I mean, an awful lot of things are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyrighted in this country that are deeply offensive to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some foreign countries, and yet, the FBI enforces the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright laws. 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I would agree that with the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

copyright is different.  It's historically played a far 

   

  

 

 

 

 

more fundamental role in free expression than trademark 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law has played, but the government, at the very least, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a significant interest in not incorporating into its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

own communications words and symbols that the public and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign countries will find offensive.
