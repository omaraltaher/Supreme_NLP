 CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:  We'll hear  argument

5  Micro Devices.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR.  WAXMAN: 

Mr. Chief  Justice,  and  may it 

10  please the Court: 

11

 28 U.S.C., section 1782 authorizes discovery for 

12  use  in  a  proceeding  in  a  foreign  or  international 

13  tribunal, upon application by an interested person.  Those 

14  are  words of indeterminate  scope.  No one in  this case 

15  contends that  they should  be  applied to  the limits  of 

16  definitional  possibility,  that  words  like  interested 

17  person,  for  use  in,  proceeding  require  a  contextual 

18  interpretation, and the  context in this case is comity in 

19  discovery.  As -- in  language that everyone in this  case 

20  quotes, the 1964  Senate report characterized  the statute 

21  as for the purpose of, quote, adjusting U.S. procedures to 

22  the requirements of foreign practice and procedure. 

23

 And with  respect to  the question  presented in 

24  this case, there are three  salient, completely undisputed 

25  facts. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

3 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 Number  one,  EC  law  denies  an  antitrust 

2  complainant any discovery rights for anything at any stage 

3  of the proceeding however long or short it may go. 

4

 Number two, if AMD had  filed its complaint with 

5  the Antitrust Division  of the  Justice Department or  the 

6  FTC,  it  would  likewise  have  no  discovery  rights 

7  whatsoever. 

8

 And  third,  the  EC,  which  can  obtain  these 

9  documents directly from Intel, has not only declined to do 

10  so in this case, but has unequivocally represented to this 

11  Court  that permitting parties  that file  complaints with 

12  it, thereby to  invoke section  1782, will interfere  with 

13  its governmental functions. 

14

 QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman,  I -- I -- it  seems to 

15  make a lot of sense, but I need a -- I need a -- a hook to 

16  hang it on.  I need some  language in that text  which -­

17  which would enable me  to say, oh,  it means you only  get 

18  discovery  when  there would  have  been discovery  in the 

19  foreign proceeding.  But I -- I don't  -- I don't see any 

20  language that gets me anywhere near that. 

21

22

 MR. WAXMAN:  Justice --

 QUESTION:  You  can fall back, I suppose,  on -­

23  on  guided discretion  until, you  know, we  can tell  the 

24  lower  courts never  to  do  it  unless its  available  in 

25  foreign -- but I don't see it in the language.

1

 MR.  WAXMAN: 

Justice  Scalia,  I'm 

--  

I'm 

2  confident that our successive briefs  in this case provide 

3  a number of  hooks, but I'm going  to give you one  or two 

4  that I think  are particularly applicable with  respect to 

5  textual interpretation,  although obviously we  also would 

6  urge the Court, because this is a procedural statute,  not 

7  one that grants  substantive rights, that it  can and must 

8  announce general  rules of supervisory power  that outline 

9  where a -- where discretion ends and abuse begins because 

10  another operative word in the statute is may. 

11

 But  since we're talking  with text, let's look, 

12  for  example,  at  the  word,  interested  person. 

The 

13  innovation of  the statute is it said, okay, you can grant 

14  discovery either pursuant to a letter rogatory, et cetera, 

15  et  cetera,  which  is  the  ordinary  way  in  which 

16  international discovery is invoked by foreign tribunals or 

17  foreign  sovereigns, or by an interested  person.  Now, no 

18  one in  this case  says that  interested person should  be 

19  given  its  plain  meaning,  otherwise  we  would  have 

20  essentially  a universal  private  freedom of  information 

21  act.  And so -­

22

 QUESTION:  I understand that.  But I am looking 

23  or a word in here  that -- that similarly requires  you to 

24  decide  whether  the  foreign  court  itself  would  allow 

25  discovery.

2

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, we -- we think --

 QUESTION:  Which is -- which is the -- the major 

3  point you were addressing. 

4

5

6

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  I don't see any -- any -­

 MR.  WAXMAN:  Everybody will come  -- everybody 

7  who argues  today will  give you  some definition  of what 

8  interested person is, and none  of them are the limits  of 

9  definitional  possibility.  So you've  got to  give  it a 

10  construction  that  is  consistent  with the  history  and 

11  purpose of the statute. 

12

 QUESTION:  Why  not at least  a complainant?  I 

13  mean, the  person who is seeking the discovery here is the 

14  complainant, the one who comes  to the commission and says 

15  investigate. 

16

 And I understand  your third point.  Your first 

17  two points  puzzle me because  there is no  counterpart in 

18  European  schemes  to  our  out-of-court  discovery. 

It 

19  doesn't exist.  It all takes  place under the  control of 

20  the  court and  the direction  of the court.  And  on the 

21  other hand, the -- the  animal that the EC antitrust  unit 

22  is is  nothing like our Antitrust Division where the -- we 

23  don't have  that blending.  You don't have  a complainant 

24  who has a right before that commission to submit evidence, 

25  to be present  at their -- if they -- if  they do have  a 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

6 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  hearing.  We don't  have a  complaining party  before the 

2  Antitrust  Division  that  has  a  statutory right  to  be 

3  present at a  hearing.  So you  -- the -- the  systems are 

4  different and you can't compare them on both points. 

5

 MR. WAXMAN:  To be -- to be sure -- to be sure, 

6  Justice  Ginsburg. 

And  you  will  hear 

--  

you  know, 

7  everybody has their own favorite contextual interpretation 

8  of  words like interested  person or for use  in.  But the 

9  context of this  statute is discovery, and the purpose, as 

10  made pellucidly clear,  is to  reduce the significance  of 

11  international  boundaries in  discovery.  And  therefore, 

12  what we say, with  respect, is you should  read interested 

13  person to  mean an entity that has at least some discovery 

14  rights to something at some  stage of the process, whether 

15  it's pending or imminent or reasonably foreseeable. 

16

 QUESTION:  Some -- some discovery rights in this 

17  country? 

18

 MR. WAXMAN:  In -- in the foreign country, that 

19  is, for the foreign sovereign who's being assisted. 

20

 Now -- now, AMD suggests  that oh, no,  no, no, 

21  no. 

Another purpose  of  the statute  was  the imperial 

22  export of, quote, liberal American  discovery rules.  Now, 

23  we think that's wrong, but even if it were right, it would 

24  be unavailing  in this case because it  is undisputed that 

25  if they  had filed a complaint  with any of  the antitrust 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

7 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  regulatory authorities here, they would  be entitled to no 

2  discovery whatsoever.  And therefore, at least  you ought 

3  to interpret interested  person to  mean a private  entity 

4  that  has  no discovery  rights  whatsoever either  in the 

5  foreign proceeding or would have it here. 

6

 I  mean,  the very  premise  of, quote,  liberal 

7  American discovery is that it  is available when a private 

8  party  undertakes the  obligations  of  being a  litigant. 

9  That  is, you file a  -- you can't  get discovery based on 

10  some  speculation  that  you  have  a  lawsuit.  You  get 

11  discovery when  you undertake  the obligations  consistent 

12  with rule 11 of pleading a case.  And what they are trying 

13  to do -- there is no case, reported case,  decided by any 

14  court in the long history of this -­

15

 QUESTION:  But  even so, if  you take a  typical 

16  civil law proceeding  a -- between private  litigants, you 

17  can't go out and get discovery on your own.  The court has 

18  to authorize it, and the order for discovery will come not 

19  from  a subpoena that  you sent as a  private party.  It's 

20  just -- they don't -- so  if we were to interpret it  your 

21  way, then you would say, well,  that no private party in a 

22  civil  law  system  that  doesn't  know  from  pretrial 

23  discovery, doesn't have anything like pretrial  discovery, 

24  could  never  get  any  documents,  could  never  get  any 

25  testimony.

1

 MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, I -- I think -- I 

2  mean, I  think this Court ought to announce that since the 

3  manifest  purpose  of  the statute  is  to  assist, quote, 

4  foreign  tribunals and  litigants before  those tribunals, 

5  that the indeterminate words of the statute should be read 

6  in  that context.  But  even  if you  wanted to  say that 

7  discovery would be  available at least on  a discretionary 

8  basis, to someone who has some discovery rights somewhere, 

9  if  they were to file  this type of  action in some place, 

10  that would also be useful to the lower courts. 

11

 And there -- it is simply irrational to say that 

12  a  statute  that  was  enacted  in  order  to  reduce  the 

13  significance of international boundaries would create this 

14  giant  loophole  that  creates  ubiquitously  universally 

15  unavailable  discovery,  just  because  somebody  has 

--

16  happens  to  bring  an  administrative  complaint  in  one 

17  country and seeks to receive  documents that are available 

18  in this country when he or she couldn't have received them 

19  if he had sued here and where the foreign, quote, tribunal 

20  has stated  as a categorical matter that resort to section 

21  1782  by  complainants  before  it  will  affirmatively 

22  undermine its sovereign governmental processes. 

23

 QUESTION:  What happens  when AMD  goes to  the 

24  court of  first instance,  disappointed with  what the  EU 

25  commission or  that the EU committee has done, and then it 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  goes to  the court of first  instance?  Can  that court of 

2  first instance in its discretion order any discovery? 

3

 MR. WAXMAN:  I believe,  Justice Kennedy,  that 

4  the  answer to  that question  is no.  I'm sure  that Mr. 

5  Phillips, on behalf of the EC, will  be able to correct me 

6  if I'm wrong.  But whether it can -­

7

 QUESTION:  I'm  sure he'll -- I'm  sure he'll be 

8  glad you asked him to do that. 

9

10

 (Laughter.) 

 MR.  WAXMAN:  Well,  I'm giving him  at least 15 

11  minutes advance -- 10 minutes advance warning. 

12

 The point  here, I  think, in  response to  your 

13  question, Justice Kennedy, as whether it could or couldn't 

14  is a feature of a sovereign determination by the countries 

15  that make  up the  European  Community.  If discovery  is 

16  available in that  proceeding, there's  no doubt that's  a 

17  court  proceeding  and  that's  a  proceeding  before  a 

18  tribunal.  And whatever discovery rights -­

19

20

21

22

 QUESTION:  But I'm talking, Mr. Waxman -­

 MR. WAXMAN:  -- whatever --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman -­

 QUESTION:  That's  -- that's why I asked  and it 

23  would  seem 

--  

let's  assume that  the  court  of  first 

24  instance could  order and in the usual  course would order 

25  some sort of discovery.  Would that change your case here? 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 MR. WAXMAN:  It -- it  wouldn't at all.  If it 

2  could, then, you know, a 1782 request could be made in the 

3  unlikely event that the EC or the court couldn't simply do 

4  what it can  do now, which is  order Intel to  produce the 

5  documents. 

I  mean,  that's 

--  

that's  the  jarringly 

6  anomalous result that they're seeking. 

7

 QUESTION:  Mr.  Waxman, I  thought it was  clear 

8  that the court proceeding is a review of  the record as it 

9  comes to  the court from the commission, that is, that the 

10  only proof-taking stage is before  the commission and that 

11  the EC courts, both the tribunal of first instance and the 

12  ECJ, review  on the record that  exists.  They  don't take 

13  any proof. 

14

 MR. WAXMAN:  I believe that's correct,  and our 

15  -- they call -- they say that  this puts them in a, quote, 

16  Catch-22 or  a conundrum, but it does nothing of the sort. 

17

 The question before the court of first instance may be -­

18  and  this  is  assuming  a  lot  of  speculative  things 

19  including, among  others, that they  are disappointed with 

20  what the EC  does and that the EC doesn't do what it could 

21  do any day, including this afternoon, which is order Intel 

22  to produce these documents,  but assuming documents aren't 

23  produced and  the EC decides, as we fervently hope, not to 

24  proceed  against Intel  and -- and  they decide  that it's 

25  worth  it to  go to the  court of  first instance  and the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  review will  only be on the  record that the  EC compiled, 

2  under European Community law ipso facto the question would 

3  be whether or not the EC or DG comp erred in declining the 

4  request to obtain these documents. 

5

 I mean,  you -- we -- we don't have a proceeding 

6  -- let's say in a -- just  a regular lawsuit in the United 

7  States.  I'm -- you know, Intel is suing AMD.  Intel wants 

8  certain discovery.  AMD objects.  The judge says, I'm not 

9  going  to  grant that  discovery.  I  don't  really think 

10  that's necessary.  We don't have  a procedure.  You'd be 

11  laughed  out  of court  if  you came  in  and said,  well, 

12  nonetheless, we want it produced so that if we lose before 

13  this  court proceeding and  we go  up on appeal,  we'll be 

14  able to  argue not only that the district judge abused his 

15  discretion in denying discovery, but we want to be able to 

16  show what those documents would  say.  I mean, nobody  has 

17  such a procedure. 

18

 And  to  the  extent  that  there's any,  quote, 

19  conundrum  here -- and  frankly, I don't see  it -- it's a 

20  conundrum that  is the result of the way that the European 

21  Community has chosen to organize its processes. 

22

 QUESTION:  I  think the -- the difficulty  is -­

23  is, well, what are the rules.  What you say sounds as  if 

24  it makes  a lot of sense,  but there are three  aspects to 

25  the case. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 Starting backwards is, can a private party bring 

2  this?  The  answer is yes.  You  agree it's yes.  But you 

3  want to say  not always.  So  then you have  a rule  that 

4  you've just enunciated now of who definitely couldn't. 

5

 And as to the second, I guess -- I mean, I'm not 

6  sure that's the  right rule, frankly.  Maybe we'd  figure 

7  that out.  Maybe it is. 

8

 The second part.  I found an opinion  by Justice 

9  Ginsburg where she has a rule which is in the D.C. Circuit 

10  which says about  how close it has  to be in time,  and my 

11  guess  is  that  you  will say  that's  okay,  but  I'd be 

12  interested if you don't. 

13

 And  as to the  first part about,  well, yes, we 

14  agree this  is a  person who  can get  discovery, but  not 

15  here, now, there I don't see any rule at all.  So I'd like 

16  to know your views on that. 

17

18

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  I mean, you  want to follow their -­

19  all right. 

20

 So my two  questions are, is  Justice Ginsburg's 

21  approach to the time problem okay with you? 

22

23

24

 MR. WAXMAN:  No.  We think -­

 QUESTION:  No.  All right. 

 MR. WAXMAN:  -- that insofar -- well, we  think, 

25  first  of  all,  as  the EC  has  explained,  there  is no 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

13 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  proceeding before a tribunal and there won't be unless and 

2  until one of  these two parties ever decides to  go to the 

3  European -­

4

5

6

 QUESTION:  Well, that -- her quote --

 MR. WAXMAN:  And -­

 QUESTION:  Let me -- I  better quote this.  It 

7  says  you have  to  have to  get  this discovery  reliable 

8  indications  of the  likelihood that  proceedings will  be 

9  instituted within a reasonable time. 

10

11

 MR. WAXMAN:  Right. 

 QUESTION:  Now, you might win under that for the 

12  very reason you state. 

13

 MR.  WAXMAN:  I  think  we certainly  would win 

14  under it.  We think on  balance that when the  request is 

15  made  by a  private  party,  not  a foreign  sovereign  or 

16  tribunal, that the request should  be made by somebody who 

17  is a  litigant in pending litigation but that at the most, 

18  if the court were  to say, well, okay, even in the context 

19  in which there is a private who's not even a litigant yet, 

20  we're  going  to  allow  discovery  to be  obtained  where 

21  litigation is, as  the Second Circuit has  said, imminent, 

22  that is, reasonably likely to occur and reasonably soon to 

23  occur,  because otherwise  discovery  by private  parties, 

24  prior to the -- the initiation of any proceedings before a 

25  tribunal  is ubiquitously  unavailable unlike  the context 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  of, for example, an investigating magistrate or a criminal 

2  prosecutor  where  it  almost  always  is  universally 

3  available, and the 1996 amendment  to the statute reflects 

4  that. 

5

 QUESTION: 

Do  you  have  any  explanation for 

6  elimination of the word pending from the statute? 

7

 MR.  WAXMAN: 

None,  particularly  since  the 

8  legislative  history -- the language  of the  legislative 

9  history that explains  the statute continues to use it, it 

10  seems to me that what they -- what they -- it  most likely 

11  reflects the fact that  they wanted to include the  French 

12  investigating  magistrates 

--  

and  I  won't  mangle  the 

13  language by  trying to  give the  French pronunciation 

--

14  where  it  was  arguable  whether that  was  or  wasn't  a 

15  tribunal.  They wanted  to -- to cover it  and therefore 

16  pending wouldn't  necessarily have  been required  in that 

17  context. 

18

 But  I don't think  -- there  is not a  shred of 

19  evidence that when Congress considered this statute at any 

20  point in its  legislative development, it  ever considered 

21  -- and it had  no reason in the cases to  ever consider -­

22  an outlandish request  where a private party  that doesn't 

23  have any  discovery rights at  this stage anywhere  in any 

24  country no matter  where it files  such a complaint  would 

25  thereby  get  them  as  a  windfall  by  means  of  this

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Waxman. 

 Mr. Phillips, we'll hear from you. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 

 ON BEHALF OF THE AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

8  may it please the Court: 

9

 Justice Kennedy, the answer  to your question is 

10  that  the  court  of  first  instance  does not  have  the 

11  authority to order discovery. 

12

 But  Justice  Ginsburg,  the  answer  to  your 

13  question is that the court of first instance does have the 

14  authority to  say, in response to an argument made by AMD, 

15  that we  have not adequately explained why  we didn't take 

16  that  information into  account.  And  we  know from  the 

17  briefs  that  AMD  has  a  pretty  good  idea  what  that 

18  information entails and therefore would  be in a perfectly 

19  adequate  position  to  go  first,  obviously,  to  the 

20  commission  and say this  is why  we want you  to consider 

21  this information. 

22

 And  then second, in  the event that  we were to 

23  issue a refusal  to go forward with  the proceeding, which 

24  we have to explain, frankly, in quite excruciating detail, 

25  that's then  subject to  very much  plenary review  by the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

16 

Alderson Reporting Company

1  court  of  first  instance  and  ultimately the  Court  of 

2  Justice. 

3

 QUESTION:  And the court of first instance can't 

4  expand the record. 

5

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  The court of first instance 

6  does not expand the record.  It, like our Federal  courts 

7  reviewing  agency decision-making,  has  the authority  to 

8  send the  matter back to the agency to review the question 

9  a second time. 

10

 QUESTION:  Where does this proceeding stand now? 

11  I  mean, this is  a discovery  request and it's  pretty -­

12  it's been pending pretty long.  Has the commission made no 

13  preliminary determination? 

14

 MR. PHILLIPS:  The  commission has  not made  a 

15  preliminary determination.  I think  it's important to put 

16  it in context.  This is a  -- an abuse of  monopoly power 

17  claim based on a large  number of contracting arrangements 

18  between  Intel  and  a  lot of  its  customers. 

And the 

19  question -- and so there's a serious question of having to 

20  review a  lot of market data in order to determine whether 

21  or not there appears to be a pattern of abuse or a problem 

22  that's worthy of going forward with. 

23

 So the commission has for  some time been taking 

24  a  very  hard look  at  the  nature  of  the  market,  has 

25  obviously  talked to AMD,  has talked  to Intel.  I think 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

17 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  that's  an important aspect  of this  case that  the Court 

2  ought to have in mind, is that -- and -- and it's  part of 

3  the  comity  concerns that  I think  ought to  animate the 

4  Court's analysis of  this problem.  The commission  has an 

5  orderly process and that process may, at some day, require 

6  it to  ask Intel to provide these  particular documents or 

7  other documents.  We don't know. 

8

 But what we don't want frankly is for  a private 

9  entity to run to a United States court and use essentially 

10  the commission  as  a pawn  in an  effort  to obtain  pre­

11  complaint discovery.  That's pre-complaint both pre in the 

12  United States complaint and pre-complaint in the -- before 

13  the European Commission.  If  at some point in the  future 

14  we need assistance, we know  how to obtain that assistance 

15  on our  own.  We don't require,  quote, interested parties 

16  to do so. 

17

18

 In our -- in our assessment of the case and -­

 QUESTION:  How does that  fit in the rule then? 

19  I mean, what kind of -- what kind of a  rule of law is it? 

20  I mean, what do you -- how do you fit that in? 

21

22

 MR. PHILLIPS:  We -- we --

 QUESTION:  Do you say  if the commission doesn't 

23  want it, then don't give it  to them, but if they do  want 

24  it, do?  How does this fit? 

25

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well -­

1

 QUESTION:  How  do you interpret the  statute to 

2  get the result that you're arguing for? 

3

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Let  me give  you a  preliminary 

4  answer and then I'll tell you -- the -- the real answer as 

5  how -- we would interpret  it through the  word tribunal. 

6  That's the statutory  hook that the commission  feels most 

7  comfortable with. 

8

 QUESTION: No, a tribunal -- I don't think  it is 

9  a tribunal probably, but I'll hear more on the other side. 

10  But still,  there is a tribunal  in the offing  and that's 

11  the tribunal  that will be there if the commission decides 

12  to enforce this. 

13

 MR.  PHILLIPS:  To be sure, Justice Breyer.  But 

14  the Ninth Circuit's  decision was  based on an  assessment 

15  that the preliminary  actions taken  by the commission  in 

16  this particular  case are such  that render us  a tribunal 

17  within the meaning of the statute, which was  the explicit 

18  basis  on  which  the  court  of  appeals  ordered  this 

19  information to  be  evaluated at  least on  remand by  the 

20  district court.  And  -- and our position is,  at least to 

21  the extent  that this  Court is  going to  adopt an  -- an 

22  approach  akin to  that by  Judge  Friendly in  the Second 

23  Circuit opinion involving the Indian tax collectors, which 

24  looks to  see whether or not the  adjudicative function is 

25  distinct  from  the  investigative functions,  our  answer 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

19 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  would be that we are  not that kind of a tribunal.  We -­

2  everything we do is investigative.  We do not perform -­

3

 QUESTION:  That would do it, but they have -- I 

4  think  they have the alternative ground here, that even if 

5  you're not  a tribunal,  the Ninth  Circuit says  it could 

6  lead  to  a proceeding  in  the court  of  first instance. 

7  Don't they say that somewhere in their opinion? 

8

 MR. PHILLIPS:  They make that argument, but that 

9  would be an alternative theory. 

10

 QUESTION:  All right.  So as long as they  make 

11  that argument, then I can't say, okay, I've got the result 

12  there that -- that they're  arguing for, assuming  you're 

13  right,  that -- that  just by  using this thing  about the 

14  tribunal. 

15

16

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  All right.  Now, so -- so what  else 

17  could we use to get to your desired end with this statute? 

18

 MR.  PHILLIPS: 

Well, the 

--  

the  next step, 

19  obviously, and it's not one that the commission argues for 

20  specifically, but it's one that -- that Intel makes, which 

21  is that even if -- if you're going to use the court as the 

22  ultimate tribunal,  then what  is the  nexus between  this 

23  request  for  information  and a  proceeding  before  that 

24  court.  That's  so far off into the future.  It certainly 

25  implicates the  earlier  D.C. Circuit  opinion by  Justice 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

20 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  Ginsburg, et cetera. 

2

 QUESTION:  I assume that  the EU committee would 

3  be a tribunal under the first sentence if it asked for the 

4  documents. 

5

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No, it would not regard itself as 

6  a tribunal under those circumstances.  If we wanted  these 

7  documents, we -- we would seek them  either directly from 

8  the parties  or through some other mechanism.  This is not 

9  a  mechanism that the -- that the commission itself views 

10  as available to it to seek documents.  We would go through 

11  government  officials.  We would go  to the FTC.  We would 

12  go to the Department of  Justice to seek information.  We 

13  might  go  to  our 

--  

our  member  countries  to  seek 

14  information, or we would go  to parties over whom we  have 

15  direct jurisdiction to seek information.  But 1782 is  not 

16  a provision that  the commission views itself  as -- views 

17  as available to it, nor does it  want to be used as a pawn 

18  by -- by  private entities seeking to employ its processes 

19  as  a  mechanism  to  obtain  pre-trial 

--  

pre-complaint 

20  discovery that's available under no other circumstances. 

21

 The 

--  

the  over-arching  argument  that  the 

22  commission would like the -- the Court to take away  from 

23  this is -- is a question  of if you  have to decide  on a 

24  contextual basis, because  the language of the  statute is 

25  not unambiguous  and therefore  you have  to come  up with 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

21 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  some limiting  principles, the commission urges  the Court 

2  to recognize that the use of  discovery in this -- the use 

3  of  this  statute  in  this  particular way  is  a  direct 

4  interference. 

It  risks  the  release  of  confidential 

5  information.  It  increases the  burden on the  commission 

6  and  the  workload that  it  has,  and  it  allows  us  to 

7  unseemingly -- unseemingly being  used -- unseemly  being 

8  used as  a pawn  in this  kind of  -- in  this kind  of an 

9  effort at discovery.  And we would ask -­

10

 QUESTION:  How does it increase the commission's 

11  workload? 

12

13

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it -- it --

 QUESTION:  In the sense  that you look at it  if 

14  they give it to you? 

15

 MR.  PHILLIPS: 

In  that  sense  and  it  also 

16  provides an incentive. 

17

 QUESTION:  Why -- why don't  you just say we're 

18  not going to look at -­

19

 MR. PHILLIPS:  It -- it provides an  incentive 

20  for more  filings with the commission in order to use this 

21  device in  order to  obtain discovery  that you  otherwise 

22  could not get.  And I think there's good reason to suspect 

23  that it  may be  used.  Certainly if this  Court were  to 

24  uphold what  AMD attempted to accomplish here,  I would be 

25  quite worried about other plaintiffs in future cases using 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

22 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  this particular device. 

2

 And  remember, there  are no  rule 11  sanctions 

3  that  are  available  for  a  filing  with  the  European 

4  Commission.  You don't  have to  be a  lawyer  to file  a 

5  complaint with  the European  Commission.  It requires  a 

6  relatively minimal  amount of effort.  It's  a letter that 

7  identifies a  particular problem  and asks the  commission 

8  then to go forward and take a look at it.  Therefore, it's 

9  a -- it's  essentially a  costless exercise by  plaintiffs 

10  using the commission, I submit, in a way that I would hope 

11  the Court would find inappropriate  and therefore ought to 

12  resolve the ambiguities, whether you do it on the basis of 

13  tribunal or for use of or proceeding -- and the commission 

14  would not  presume to tell this Court how to interpret the 

15  language of  its statute,  but whatever  choice you  make, 

16  whichever  statutory hook  you  look  for, the  commission 

17  would ask that this Court interpret the statute narrowly. 

18

 QUESTION:  What about the  one that comes up in 

19  the reply brief?  And it -- and this is Intel's brief.  So 

20  I'm wondering  if the commission shares the view that 1782 

21  is meant to  deal with  procuring evidence  in the  United 

22  States from a third party,  not from the party before  the 

23  commission, not from Intel because the commission can tell 

24  Intel you  give -- give us  these documents.  But  it must 

25  refer to people who are not before the court. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

23 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 MR.  PHILLIPS:  Yes,  well,  the commission  is 

2  certainly supportive of that notion because the commission 

3  believes  that  when  and  if  it  needs  these 

--  

this 

4  information,  it will be  able to obtain  it directly from 

5  the party.  That is the  easiest undertaking in  order to 

6  obtain  information that  the commission has  available to 

7  it.  So to the extent the Court  wants to draw that line, 

8  certainly the  commission would be quite  comfortable with 

9  that  line. 

Again,  of  course,  the  commission  is 

10  uncomfortable  telling you how  to decide the  case -- the 

11  statutory -- the specific statutory language. 

12

 Let me just -- one  last point.  The last  thing 

13  in the  world the commission really  wants is to  have 800 

14  district  courts  deciding  this issue  on  a case-by-case 

15  basis exercising their  discretion.  It  seems to us  that 

16  that is an intolerable burden to impose on the commission. 

17  It  cannot monitor all litigation in  the United States in 

18  order  to make  its interests  and concerns  known.  And, 

19  therefore,  it  is  terribly  important  that  this  Court 

20  announce a  rule, either as a  supervisory matter or  as a 

21  matter  of  statutory  construction, that  will  limit the 

22  ability of the commission to be used, as I say, as  a pawn 

23  in this discovery effort. 

24

 QUESTION: 

What 

--  

what's our  authority  to 

25  announce a  supervisory rule?  What's your best  case for 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, geez.  I don't -- off the top 

3  of my head -- I mean, the commission didn't examine  it -­

4  that particular issue specifically, Justice Kennedy.  I'm 

5  -- I'm hoping that my  colleague in rebuttal will be  able 

6  to give -­

7

 QUESTION: 

Interpretation  of  what  comity 

8  consists of in this instance. 

9

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the -- the comity principle 

10  are the cases like McCulloch and the -- and the -- that we 

11  cited in the brief, and obviously Charming Betsy.  I mean, 

12  those are rules of interpretation that we have, but that's 

13  not

that doesn't  answer  Justice Kennedy's  specific 

14  question.

 Mr. Lynch, we'll hear from you. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK LYNCH 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. LYNCH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

20  the Court: 

21

22

 I'd like to underline three points. 

 First of all,  the question  of the EC's  comity 

23  concerns. 

Those  concerns  deserve  respect,  but 

24  emasculating section 1782 is not the proper way to respect 

25  those concerns.  Privilege is really the  right answer to 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

25 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  the EC's concerns and the right answer  to counsel's last­

2  expressed  concern  about  800  district  judges  reaching 

3  different conclusions in different cases. 

4

 As to the  second question, whether or  not this 

5  is a proceeding before a  tribunal, which seems to be  the 

6  heart  of  this  case, when  Congress  enacted  or amended 

7  section 1782 in 1965, it is absolutely clear that Congress 

8  intended to extend  the rights granted under  section 1782 

9  to  proceedings  in  foreign countries  that  were  quasi­

10  judicial  and administrative in  nature.  And it  is also 

11  quite  clear that  Congress  did  not  know  and  did  not 

12  consider it necessary to know all the different shapes and 

13  forms  that  administrative  law  might  take  in  other 

14  jurisdictions. 

15

 QUESTION:  In Israel, for example, if you have a 

16 

--  

a  criminal  prosecutor,  it  looks  just  like  our 

17  prosecutor.  My  understanding is that the  one difference 

18  is that a victim could go to court to force the prosecutor 

19  to bring a prosecution.  So does that  mean now under this 

20  statute, because of  that one difference,  all prosecutors 

21  in  Israel are open  to this  -- our tribunals  under this 

22  statute? 

23

 MR. LYNCH:  Well, I  -- I think that the  -- the 

24  question  of  whether  a victim  is  an  interested person 

25  arises -­

1

 QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm  not -- that's  not the 

2  part I'm getting  at.  I am  saying it's easy to  think of 

3  people whom, when we look at them, they are precisely like 

4  a  human  being  in  the  U.S.  Attorney's  office,  and 

5  everything they do every day is just like a U.S. Attorney, 

6  but for  one thing, that somebody who  wants a prosecution 

7  to be brought  can get  a court to  review a decision,  no 

8  prosecution. 

Now,  I'm  asking  you  if  that  single 

9  difference is sufficient to translate this into a tribunal 

10  under the act. 

11

 MR.  LYNCH: 

Your Honor,  I  believe  that the 

12  answer is that the court to which you can go in Israel and 

13  ask them to  direct the prosecutor to bring  a prosecution 

14  has to be a tribunal within the meaning of the statute. 

15

 QUESTION: 

No.  Now,  you're  not  getting my 

16  questions. 

17

 MR.  LYNCH: 

But  the  prosecutor  is  not  a 

18  tribunal. 

19

 QUESTION:  I don't want to just repeat it again. 

20  Did you  not understand the question?  The question is I'm 

21  imaging a person like  a U.S. Attorney, exactly  the same, 

22  and there's only the one difference I mentioned.  Somebody 

23  can go ask a judge to  say did he abuse his discretion  in 

24  not bringing  this  RICO case.  Okay? 

That's the  only 

25  difference.  Now, I'm asking you if we had such  a person, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  does that make him a tribunal under the act.

 MR. LYNCH:  A person -- the prosecutor would not

 QUESTION:  Fine.  If that's so -­

 MR. LYNCH:  The --

 QUESTION:  -- and I  agree with you -- how  does 

7  this  particular  tribunal  differ  from  the one  I  just 

8  described? 

I  don't  mean a  tribunal. 

How  does the 

9  commission differ from that prosecutor I just described? 

10

 MR. LYNCH:  Because under  the European rules of 

11  procedure which I can't relate to Israel, but I can relate 

12  to the United States --

19  from what I just said. 

20

 MR.  LYNCH: 

Under  the  European  rules  of 

21  procedure, Justice  Breyer, the -- the European Commission 

22  has to  consider the facts,  has to apply  the law  to the 

23  facts, has  to reach a decision  which is reviewable  by a 

24  court.  This is not -­

25

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

28 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  was our  U.S. Attorney who can be brought to court for not 

2  prosecuting  on  those  kinds of  grounds. 

You  said it 

3  doesn't  apply  to  him,  and  now  you're  more  or  less 

4  repeating  what  I said  was  the  special  feature of  my 

5  imaginary U.S. Attorney. 

6

7

 MR. LYNCH:  Well --

 QUESTION:  So is -- you can elaborate on that or 

8  give me another one too. 

9

 MR. LYNCH:  I believe that the -- the process I 

10  described is a classic example  of quasi-judicial activity 

11  by an  administrative body.  It would be  an adjudication 

12  under the Administrative Procedure Act. 

13

 QUESTION:  The  prosecutor has no  authority on 

14  his own to impose a  fine.  Right?  He can just  bring the 

15  case to court,  and I think what you're saying is that the 

16  commission here  does have  authority on  its own  to take 

17  action against a party.  That -- now, that action that  it 

18  takes will  be reviewable,  but it  can impose  a fine  or 

19  require  the -- the  selling of some of  the assets of the 

20  company and so forth.  Isn't that right? 

21

22

23

 MR. LYNCH:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  That's very important.  That's -­

 QUESTION:  That's different.  That's different 

24  from what a  prosecutor can do.  He can't -- he  can't do 

25  anything on his own.

5  is the -- what -- all my questions are serious.

7

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  But  this  is -- I  don't know  the

9  between  the EU saying  you pay  $10 million and  the U.S. 

10  Attorney saying  we want him to  pay $10 million?  What's 

11  the difference there procedurally? 

12

 MR. LYNCH:  The  -- the  order of  the EC,  the 

13  order of the  commission is a final,  enforceable judgment 

14  in Europe unless the party,  the respondent to that order, 

15  takes an appeal to the  community courts.  And that  would 

16  be the same as an order of the NLRB or an order of one  of 

17  our  administrative  agencies  which  is  enforceable  but 

18  subject to judicial review.  I don't want to -­

13  would  review the decision  of the  agency the same  way a 

14  U.S.  court would and  say, whether  or not this  is tying 

15  under article  82 or article 81, is  ultimately a decision 

16  of law and  ultimately the community courts  have the last 

17  word  on it.  If  they  were making  a decision,  was the 

18  procedure that was  followed here adequate, did the -- did 

19  the commission properly weigh the  evidence, did it pursue 

20  the  right evidence,  they would  give -- they  would give 

21  deference to  the commission's  ability to  decide how  to 

22  conduct its process.  So there's a great deal -­

 MR. LYNCH:  The fact-finding process is  -- I'm

 QUESTION:  No, I'm  not talking  about process. 

3  I'm  saying  does  the  reviewing  court  defer  to  the 

4  commission's finding of fact. 

5

 MR. LYNCH:  It -- I think it clearly defers, but 

6  I  can't  find  that  standard  of  review  because  the 

7  commission  has  been  reversed in  the  Guerin  case, for 

8  example, which is cited in the briefs.  The commission has 

9  been reversed because  the facts  before it, according  to 

10  the reviewing court, established a violation -­

11

 QUESTION:  My impression, which only  comes from 

12  the newspapers, is that the courts there are taking a much 

13  more active role and it's  becoming like they're vis-a-vis 

14  the  Antitrust  Division  and it's  not  like  vis-a-vis a 

15  commission.  But is that -- my -­

17

18

 MR. LYNCH:  I would -- I would say -­

 QUESTION:  I'm wrong on that. 

 MR. LYNCH:  -- with -- with all respect, I would 

19  say  it would be  like this  Court vis-a-vis  the district 

20  courts  or vis-a-vis administrative agencies as opposed to 

21  prosecutors. 

22

 And where -- where I started on this  point was 

23  that  in  enacting  1782, Congress  did  not  undertake to 

24  dictate  Europe or  to  any  other  country in  the  world 

25  exactly our standards of administrative procedure.

1

 QUESTION:  But did  it -- did it  undertake to 

2  dictate to  us that  we should  exceed our  standards?  I 

3  mean, I can understand the -- the argument that you -- you 

4  mustn't, in effect, limit the -- the discovery here by the 

5  discovery that they could have  had over there because who 

6  knows what it  -- I mean, we're just  not experts in that, 

7  and it's hard to find out. 

8

 We  are,  however,  at  least  closer  to  being 

9  experts  on  what American  law  would  provide. 

Is  it 

10  plausible to think that Congress  was, in -- in  extending 

11  this  great  example to  the  world, extending  an example 

12  which  would provide  even  more generous  discovery  than 

13  American law would in a domestic antitrust proceeding? 

14

 MR. LYNCH:  Your Honor, I think that is a false 

15  premise here.  The difference between what's  going on in 

16  Europe and  what's going on here  is that Europe  gave AMD 

17  one and  only  one  Europe-wide  remedy.  In  the  United 

18  States,  we could  have brought  a private  action  in the 

19  district court for these very same violations.  In Europe, 

20  our only Europe-wide remedy  was to go to the  commission. 

21  The European authorities as --

22

 QUESTION:  So,  in other  words, you're  simply 

23  saying we can't -- we could sue here.  We can't sue there. 

24  Therefore, you've  got to, in effect, give us the right of 

25  a  litigant  here even  though  we  are  not  there  in  a

 MR. LYNCH:  With all respect, I would say we are

Under our  interested party 

4  rules -­

5

 QUESTION:  But not  in -- not in the  sense of 

6  being a  party as  -- as  you would  be if  you brought  a 

7  private antitrust complaint.  That's all I meant. 

8

 MR.  LYNCH:  In  the sense  of being a  party in 

9  that our application has the  same standing under European 

10  procedural law as a complaint  would have here, that  when 

11  we file  that complaint, the commission ipso facto owes us 

12  an obligation to make an adjudication.  It cannot, just as 

13  a  matter of discretion, disregard our complaint.  It must 

14  make a  reasoned decision applying law  to the facts.  It 

15  must consider the evidence. 

16

 QUESTION:  Okay.  So you, in effect, I think are 

17  telling  me,  yes,  we'll  accept  the  position  that  we 

18  shouldn't  be better off  than we  would be in  the United 

19  States  if you realize  that we are in  the position of an 

20  American  plaintiff  right  now.  That's 

--  

that's your 

21  answer. 

22

 MR. LYNCH: 

I'm -- I  would say  it  slightly 

23  differently, that whether  you call us in  the position of 

24  an American  plaintiff right now or whether  you say there 

25  is no direct analogy, we  are a litigant in any  practical

Must  they 

12  consider any evidence you give them? 

13

14

 MR. LYNCH:  They must. 

 QUESTION:  Or can they say that it's -- that -­

15  that there's a -- certain relevancy rules that -- that you 

16  must adhere to? 

17

18

 MR. LYNCH:  Well --

 QUESTION:  Because what's happening, it seems to 

19  me, is that you want to force them to consider things they 

20  don't want to consider. 

21

 MR. LYNCH:  Well, I -- with all respect, I don't 

22  know  that they've ever  said they don't  want to consider 

23  it.  The indication we have  is that they  don't have the 

24  resources as  -- as an enforcement agency to go after this 

25  material which we think would be highly relevant.

 But the answer to your question is, according to 

2  the -- to the court of first instance, the European Court 

3  of Justice, they must consider the  evidence we put before 

4  them.  Like a  district court, they  could presumably say 

5  this is irrelevant evidence, but they -­

 MR. LYNCH:  They have not said that.  They have 

9  -- the -- the commission tells us -- and I believe counsel 

10  has indicated  -- if we present the evidence, they have an 

11  obligation to consider it  and they have an obligation  to 

12  deal with  that in their decision.  And they  must make a 

13  reasoned decision which is reviewed by the court -­

 QUESTION:  But they don't want it. 

 QUESTION:  Isn't the --

 QUESTION:  But they don't want it.  They've also 

17  said they don't want it.  They said, if you give it to us, 

18  we'll look at it, we have to, but frankly, we'd rather you 

19  go away.  Isn't that what they've said? 

20

21

 (Laughter.) 

 MR.  LYNCH:  No  -- no  one connected  with the 

22  commission  has  said  that  to  us. 

And  the 

--  

the 

23  commission's  briefs  I  guess  are  capable  of  that 

24  interpretation in  this Court.  But what -- what the staff 

25  working with us says is that they don't want to ask for it

Alderson Reporting Company

1  because of whatever decision they'd  make.  But they  have 

2  no have no  objection to us asking  for it.  We  told them 

3  about this  proceeding before we filed  it.  We  kept them 

4  informed every step of the way. 

5

6

 To go back -­

 QUESTION:  May -- may I go back to the -- to the 

7  one point  of your answer that -- that continues to bother 

8  me?  And it may be that I -- I don't understand something. 

9  So that's what I want you to help me on. 

10

 I thought their  argument was that when  you say 

11  your  present  position is  just  like the 

--  

or is  the 

12  position of a  litigant, the difference  between you as  a 

13  litigant over there and you as a litigant here is -- is a 

14  difference in  -- in  effect, in  responsibility.  You at 

15  least at not supposed to  bring an irresponsible complaint 

16  in the United  States.  You can  be sanctioned if you  do. 

17  They,  I think,  are  implying that  you  don't have  that 

18  obligation  of  responsibility  over  there and  therefore 

19  simply by filing  a complaint, without anything  more, you 

20  get  a free  ticket to  discovery, whereas your  ticket to 

21  discovery if you were suing  in the United States, is  not 

22  free because you would have to meet a certain threshold of 

23  responsibility  before you  bring it,  and therefore  your 

24  positions aren't the same. 

25

 What is the answer to that? 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

37 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 MR.  LYNCH: 

There  is  no  rule  11  for  any 

2  proceeding brought in the European  Commission.  They have 

3  no direct  rule 11.  They have  great power over the firms 

4  that come before  them, and  they're perfectly capable  of 

5  protecting themselves from frivolous activity. 

6

 I think  the difference  between the  commission 

7  and us is this.  When I finish or when  the last person to 

8  speak  finishes,  this Court  will  say the  matter stands 

9  submitted.  The commission  is arguing,  in effect,  that 

10  it's not litigation  until the commission says  the matter 

11  stands submitted.  And there's this momentary  point when 

12  they're a  tribunal and  the door  slams shut.  Then  the 

13  court  of review says,  you didn't come  to the commission 

14  and offer your evidence. 

15

 It's taken us nearly 3 years to -- to get access 

16  to this evidence, which we  wish to put before the  court. 

17  We are like any litigant in the United States who wants to

 QUESTION: 

It's  prompted  by  Mr.  Waxman's 

2  argument.  Because you  filed a complaint, you say  you're 

3  an interested person.  Is that right?

 MR. LYNCH:  We  can't be  an interested  person

 MR. LYNCH:  We would -­

 QUESTION:  Would you then be interested? 

 MR. LYNCH:  We believe  that -- that the minimum 

15  that would be required is some proceeding underway. 

16

 QUESTION:  So you would agree that there is some 

17  latitude  for  construing  just  the  scope  of  what  an 

18  interested person is. 

19

 MR. LYNCH:  Well, yes.  I think the  interested 

20  person  has to  have  a -- a  place as  of  right in  the 

21  proceeding which -- in which the  aid is sought,  whether 

22  that's a district  attorney, whether it might be  a victim 

23  in Israel, whether it's a  competitor.  But under European 

24  law,  not  just  anybody  can  walk  in  and  file  these 

25  complaints.  You have to be  a competitor or  a consumer.

1  They're  exactly the  same standing  requirements that  we

3  has issued regulations which are quite clear, that -- that 

4  you must have standing to bring such a complaint.

6

 Now --

 QUESTION:  So you have  to -- you would have  to 

7  look to  foreign law to determine whether the person is an

 MR.  LYNCH:  I think  that's a U.S. law question 

10  under 1782. 

11

 QUESTION: 

But  there  has  to  be  a  pending 

12  proceeding, you're saying, because you obviously can't  be 

13  a party if there's no proceeding yet. 

14

 MR. LYNCH:  Well,  again, to  take some  of the 

15  cases like Justice Ginsburg's case in the D.C. Circuit,  a 

16  proceeding could  be in  reasonable contemplation  when an 

17  official file  has been opened  to investigate.  I  think 

18  that's what -­

 QUESTION:  Then -- then  you're saying you could 

20  have come  here even before you filed the -- the complaint 

21  with the commission. 

22

 MR. LYNCH:  I'm saying that until you  file the 

23  complaint  with the  commission, there  is not  sufficient 

24  showing of a  reasonable probability  of a proceeding  for

16  Circuit seemed to feel that although the process in Europe 

17  is different than it is in the United States and therefore 

18  it might not be exactly right to  say we're a party in the

10

 MR. LYNCH:  Well, with all respect,  the rule 11

19  that they can enforce against  you in any practical  sense

2

 MR.  MINEAR: 

Mr. Chief  Justice,  and  may it 

3  please the Court: 

4

 Yes, we would  agree with  the position that  an 

5  interested party does need to have a pending proceeding. 

6

 QUESTION: 

This  interested  person  and  the 

7  proceeding is initiated  doesn't have  to be the  judicial 

8  proceeding or unless I was wrong in --

9

 MR. MINEAR:  If I can go back and -- and try and 

10  clarify my  answer.  There's two  questions here  really. 

11  First  of all, is there a  proceeding in which -- before a 

12  foreign tribunal, and is there an interested person? 

13

 In  our  view,  a  private  person  becomes  an 

14  interested person when there is a proceeding that is going 

15  forward.  The  -- in the case  of the tribunal  itself, it 

16  can,  under section  1782, request  this information  even 

17  though no complaint has yet  been filed and we think  that 

18  that is the way  that we ensure that there are not actions 

19  brought by  people who have not  taken any action  but are 

20  simply seeking  discovery  without  any  proceeding  being 

21  present. 

22

 QUESTION:  And you  say tribunal, you're talking 

23  about the EC because the  court of first instance and  the 

24  ECJ would not be asking for material. 

25

 MR. MINEAR:  Yes, we think  it -- it is  and we 

11  can point to several reasons why that is the case. 

12

 First of all, a textual reason, that the statute 

13  itself,  section  1782,  makes  reference  to  proceedings 

14  before  a 

foreign 

tribunal,  including 

criminal 

15  investigations before formal accusations. 

16

 QUESTION:  Yes,  but that's  -- that's -- there 

17  are criminal investigations  in most countries other  than 

18  Britain and  the  United States  where  the  investigating 

19  magistrate is a judge. 

20

21

 MR. MINEAR:  That's correct. 

 QUESTION:  Of  course, they're a tribunal.  The 

22  key  things here is that the people here are investigators 

23  who do  not think of themselves  as judges.  They are not 

24  judges. 

And  in  addition,  the  proceedings  are  not 

25  adversarial, nor are they adjudicative  in any sense.  And 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

46 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  that is  all the difference in the world between -- you're 

2  talking -- you think you could  bring a -- all we have  is 

3  an investigation in France by the police judiciaire. 

4

5

 MR. MINEAR:  No, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  And suddenly we're  going to -- we're 

6  going to start  getting all  -- I  mean, no.  It's a  big 

7  difference whether  it's a  magistrate, a  -- you  know, a 

8  judge. 

9

 MR. MINEAR:  Your  Honor, I  think part of  the 

10  confusion  here  is the  procedures  that are  actually in 

11  place  by the  European  Commission.  In  that regard,  I 

12  suggest that the Court take heed  of the notice concerning 

13  the filing of complaints that's cited on page 13 in note 3 

14  of  AMD's  brief.  That's  an 80-paragraph  document that 

15  describes  the  procedures  that  the European  Commission 

16  follows -­

17

 QUESTION:  Well,  I read through some,  my clerk 

18  read through  some, and I ended  up by thinking  there are 

19  some  that are rather  like the FTC, but  then there are a 

20  certain number  that are really  very different.  And the 

21  thing  that struck me  as pretty  critical is just  what I 

22  said.  They do not  think of themselves as  judges.  They 

23  are 

--  

do  not  think  of  what  they  are  doing  as 

24  adjudicatory, and they  don't even have  a way of  walling 

25  off, as we do, the investigators from the adjudicators.

1

 Now, there  are certain  similarities too.  But 

2  where we have similarities and major differences, maybe we 

3  should pay attention to what they want to call themselves. 

4

 MR.  MINEAR:  Perhaps, but I would point out the 

5  similarities to an adjudication before  I -- I move on  to 

6  answer that question.  First of all, a party that files  a 

7  complaint does not simply send a letter in.  Instead, they 

8  must  use the complaint form that's  described.  They must 

9  set forth all of the information that they have available, 

10  and they must establish that they are an interested party. 

11  A legitimate  party I think is the term that's used, which 

12  is  essentially  the  same  as  a  standing  requirement. 

13  There's  then proceedings in which they participate before 

14  the  European  Commission,  ultimately  leading  to  the 

15  commission  issuing  a  letter  indicating  a  preliminary 

16  decision.  They're allowed  to respond  to that  as well. 

17  And at that point, the commission then must make a choice. 

18

 QUESTION:  Proceedings in which they participate 

19  before the commission.  How do they participate? 

20

 MR.  MINEAR:  Primarily  by submitting  written 

21  documents,  by  responding  in  written  form. 

It's  my 

22  understanding there is no hearing before the commission in 

23  that  first  stage,  but ultimately  there  is  a decision 

24  that's produced by the commission that is -- must  include 

25  reasons  for  their  decision,  and  that  is  judicially 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

48 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  reviewable. 

2

 Now,  that  entire  process  bespeaks,  to  a 

3  considerable extent, of  an adjudicative type  proceeding. 

4  But even if it's not, it's at least in preparation of what 

5  will  then  be  one  of  two  certainly  adjudicative 

6  proceedings.  One is  the review  by the  court of  first 

7  instance, or in the alternative, if the commission decides 

8  to go  forward with the complaint, a proceeding in which a 

9  statement of objections is then lodged against Intel. 

10

 My  point  in  describing all  this  is  just to 

11  emphasize that Congress  used very broad language  here in 

12  terms of a proceeding before a foreign tribunal because it 

13  realized that there's a vast and uncatalogued variety -­

14

 QUESTION:  It sort of  sloughed over a  point I 

15  think was  pretty critical. 

I mean,  if the  commission 

16  itself is not proceeding -- not a tribunal, which I -- you 

17  dispute, but if I were to disagree with you about that,  I 

18  would certainly  agree with  you that  the court of  first 

19  instance and the further reviewing courts are.  But there 

20  you  run  into the  statement  in that  D.C.  case that  I 

21  referred  to  earlier  which  there  must  be  reliable 

22  indications  of the  likelihood  the  proceedings will  be 

23  instituted  within a  reasonable time.  And  as to  those 

24  further court of  first instance, the reviewing  court and 

25  over  in  the ECJ,  then  -- then 

--  

do  they meet  that 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

49 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  criterion? 

2

 MR. MINEAR:  Well, that's a question,  it seems 

3  to  me,  that  goes to  the  district  court's discretion, 

4  determining  whether or not to allow the evidence.  That's 

5  not a statutory criteria that you're citing to, but rather 

6  I believe  that the D.C. Circ was indicating a matter that 

7  informs the discretion.  The statute -­

8

 QUESTION:  And  it would be within  this statute 

9  even  if the  only indication  we had  whichever  -- there 

10  would ever be a case is there's 1 chance in 50  that there 

11  will be a case 18 years from now. 

12

13

 MR. MINEAR:  Well, it's --

 QUESTION:  That  would fall within  this statute 

14  and it's just some kind of discretion that keeps it out. 

15

 MR. MINEAR:  The district court has to make that 

16  judgment of whether or not the action -­

17

18

 QUESTION:  Even in the example I just gave? 

 MR. MINEAR:  Well, in the example you just gave, 

19  there's been  a complaint that's been filed and one of two 

20  things -- I  can say  one of  three  things will  happen. 

21  Either a complaint  will be denied  -- ultimately will  be 

22  denied, in which case there  will be an action before  the 

23  court of  first instance, or else there will be the -- the 

24  commission will go  forward with  the complaint, in  which 

25  case  there  will  certainly  be  an adjudication  against 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

50 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  Intel, or AMD would withdraw the complaint for some reason 

2  that  we  don't know  about.  Those  are  the only  three 

3  alternatives.  So certainly under the decision of the D.C. 

4  circuit, I think  that a -- proceedings are  in reasonable 

5  contemplation, or at a minimum,  at least that issue ought 

6  to be  placed before the district court in the exercise of 

7  its discretion. 

8

 QUESTION:  You  want 800  judges to review  this 

9  even  in the extreme  case I  mentioned, and unless  -- as 

10  long as  you can find some in your  favor, you can just go 

11  file a  complaint over there and get all your competitors' 

12  documents  and  put everybody  to about  $5 million  or $6 

13  million worth of costs, et cetera. 

14

 MR. MINEAR:  By no means at all, Your Honor.  As 

15  we indicate  in our  brief, we  believe that  rules of 

--

16  supervisory  rules  of practice  can  be developed  by the 

17  courts to contain and channel the district court's -­

18

19

 QUESTION:  And what's our authority to do that? 

 MR.  MINEAR: 

The  authority  is the  type  of 

20  authority that is described in Thomas v. Arn.  It's simply 

21  that  the  Court has 

--  

has authority  to  supervise the 

22  activity and provide  guidance to  district courts in  the 

23  exercise of their discretion. 

24

 QUESTION:  Yes, but how -- how are we  to know 

25  what  guidance  to  provide  without  a  great  deal  of 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

51 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  experience one way or another in -- in the lower courts? 

2

 MR. MINEAR:  Well,  we agree with that as  well, 

3  and we think that type of guidance at this stage  would be 

4  premature.  We  suggested the  Court  take this  case  to 

5  resolve the circuit  conflict on  a question of  statutory 

6  construction. 

7

 QUESTION:  And so  now we  go back  to the  800 

8  district  judges and their discretion even  in the kind of 

9  rather extreme case that Justice Breyer describes. 

10

 MR.  MINEAR:  Well,  Your  Honor,  the district 

11  courts have been at work at this area and  there are about 

12  20 cases  now over  the  past 40  years  in -- that  have 

13  construed section 1782, and they -- those cases do provide 

14  guidance.  We  think  that the  question  -- the  primary 

15  question this Court needs to answer is, is there a rule of 

16  foreign discoverability?  And we  submit that there's  no 

17  such rule evident on the basis of the statute -­

18

 QUESTION:  But  it's -- it's  an odd reading  of 

19  the statute  that we have these  discoveries for use  in a 

20  proceeding in  a tribunal and  the tribunal said  it isn't 

21  for our use.  It's counterproductive. 

22

23

 MR. MINEAR:  Well, Your Honor, I think -­

 QUESTION:  How  can  that be  for  use if  it's 

24  counterproductive? 

25

 MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor,  we need to  pay close 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

52 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  attention to  what the commission said and what it did not 

2  say.  Our view is  if the  commission does not  want this 

3  information,  then  that's  a  very  good reason  for  the 

4  district court  to deny discovery in this case.  The court 

5  has not said -- the commission has not said it  would not 

6  use this information,  which is quite a  different matter. 

7  If the  commission said that it  will simply not  use this 

8  information, then that is a reason why section 1782 should 

9  not apply.  The information would  simply not be  used in 

10  the  proceeding. 

But  we  think  that  the 

--  

the 

11  circumstances here are far less certain. 

12

 I should  point out  that this  matter has  gone 

13  back down.  The issue -- a mandate was issued  while the 

14  petition for certiorari  was pending.  And  the magistrate 

15  judge has  issued a  preliminary order  that the  district 

16  court has not  reviewed yet, which has  limited the amount 

17  of discovery  that would be available.  And in that course 

18  of that decision,  the magistrate judge did point out that 

19  it was not clear whether  this information -- whether  the 

20  commission  had  not  made  clear  whether  or  not  the 

21  information would  be wanted or used  by it.  That  was -­

22  there was uncertainty -­

23

 QUESTION:  Now, given their brief in this, which 

24  seems to me could not be more clear -­

 QUESTION:  -- then what are we supposed to write 

6  that makes real what you -­

7

 MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, first of  all, I think 

8  you 

--  

you  need  to  resolve  the  issue  of  statutory 

9  construction  on  the  rule  of  the question  of  foreign 

10  discoverability.  And we've  explained our  views in  the 

11  brief on that.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Minear. 

 Mr. Waxman, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 The  brief,  amicus  curiae  of  the  European 

18  Commission, states  that what  it wants  is reversal.  It 

19  wants reversal of the decision  that sent this back for  a 

20  discretionary,  1  of  800  judges'  factor-by-factor 

21  balancing. 

22

 Now, everybody considers -- Justice Souter, with 

23  respect to your  question about how difficult  it might be 

24  to  determine  foreign  discoverability,  everybody agrees 

25  that's  a relevant factor.  So  the question is  going to 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

54 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  come  up in even  more instances  if you don't  announce a 

2  rule, either by construing interested person or proceeding 

3  or for use  in, that  somehow channels  the discretion  of 

4  district judges. 

5

 Justice  Kennedy,  pages  36  and  37  and 

6  particularly footnote  18 of  our blue  brief provide,  we 

7  think, the authority  for instances.  But it's  basically 

8  saying  the way  you  do when  you decide  cases involving 

9  discovery  under rule 26.  There are certain instances in 

10  which, since  we know what the statute -- there's no doubt 

11  about  the purpose of  the statute,  it will always  be an 

12  abuse of discretion. 

13

 Now, with  respect to  the  question of  whether 

14  this is isn't  a tribunal or  how soon a  tribunal has  to 

15  occur,  AMD  acquiesced,  and  this  is  a  point  made in 

16  footnote 2 of our reply brief on  page 3.  They acquiesced 

17 

--  

and this  Court  granted cert  on the  second question 

18  presented -- on  the assumption, as the lower court found, 

19  that  there  is  no  proceeding  before  a  tribunal  now. 

20  Otherwise,  the  question of  whether  the D.C.  Circuit's 

21  interpretation of  how soon  it had  to be  or the  Second 

22  Circuit's interpretation would have been presented. 

23

 Similarly, this  morning is the first  time that 

24  -- that  AMD has argued that it  was in -- that  it is, in 

25  fact, a litigant.  It has always argued that you shouldn't 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

55 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  read the interested person to require litigant even in the 

2  private context because it's only in the title.  It's only 

3  showered throughout the legislative history,  but it's not 

4  in the text. 

5

 But the question of when something is a tribunal 

6  or when it isn't may determine, as this Court's  questions 

7  this  morning suggest,  lots of  very,  very fact-specific 

8  determinations that have to be examined perhaps on a case­

9  by-case basis,  although we  would argue  that where  the, 

10  quote,  tribunal itself says  we're not, a  court ought to 

11  accept it. 

12

 But if you simply interpret interested person or 

13  interpret for  use in  in the  context of  a request  by a 

14  private party before  there is any proceeding,  that where 

15  the  request  is by  an  entity  that  has  no  rights  of 

16  discovery at all, not to  documents, not to testimony, not 

17  at the first stage,  not at the  second stage, and not  in 

18  any subsequent judicial proceeding, we can simply cut this 

19  off.  It will always be abuse of discretion to come to the 

20  United States and try and get discovery when you're trying 

21  to aid  a tribunal that doesn't  now and never  will allow 

22  you to get any discovery. 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:  Thank -- thank you, 

24  Mr. Waxman. 

25

 The case is submitted.
