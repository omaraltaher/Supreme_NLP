CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANICE L. BERGMANN 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

please the Court: 

 

 

11 

            

On average, attaching the "career offender"

17 

18

22 

23 

24 

25 

label to a Federal defendant both doubles his sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and increases it by seven years.  At the time Petitioner 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was sentenced, a defendant could qualify as a career 

   

   

 

 

 

 

offender if one or more of his predicate offenses fell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the residual clause of the career offender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guideline, and yet all now agree that the residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause is so unintelligible that it is impossible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discern its meaning. 

 

 

            

Petitioner here submits three things: 

 

 

 

 

First, that invoking a shapeless -- so shapeless a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision to enhance someone's sentence in such a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant way does not comport with due process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second, a ruling that the career offender 

   

 

 

 

 

residual clause is void for vagueness is substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

1 

and, therefore, has retroactive effect in Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

case. 

3 

            

And third, that voiding the residual clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

also invalidates the Guidelines commentary that 

 

 

 

 

 

identified Petitioner's offense as a crime of violence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

As such, Petitioner is entitled to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resentencing without the career offender enhancement. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You would agree, would 

  

 

 

 

 

you not, that, if the commentary counts, if it counts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then there's nothing imprecise about possessing a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sawed-off shotgun; right? 

 

 

12 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Yes, Your Honor.  I agree 

    

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

that there is nothing imprecise about possession of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sawed-off shotgun.  Where the constitutional concerns 

  

 

 

 

 

come into play with the commentary is actually at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point where the Commission was interpreting the residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause in order to identify the possession of a shotgun 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense as falling within the residual clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the reason why that violates due process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in part is because the Commission was attempting to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarify a provision that can't be clarified.  The Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

has held in Johnson that the residual clause --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the -- but suppose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there were a statute -- and this is a -- I don't mean to 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interrupt, but this is part of Justice Ginsburg's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

1 

question. 

2 

            

Suppose there were a statute in Johnson, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

it read just like the residual clause, that -- that an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example of a dangerous offense is -- or an offense which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creates a serious risk is the possession of a sawed-off 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

shotgun.  That was in the statute. 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

9 

valid? 

10 

            

11 

            

12 

            

13 

            

14 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, Your Honor, the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would the statute then be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. BERGMANN:  The -- Your Honor, the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In -- in the shotgun case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. BERGMANN:  In the statute itself --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the shotgun case. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. BERGMANN:  If the statute itself 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

included that language, yes, Your Honor.  But the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

commentary --

 

17 

            

18 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, it would be valid. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. BERGMANN:  If the -- if the possession 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

of a sawed-off shotgun was listed in the statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you didn't answer 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

Justice Ginsburg's question.  Why can't the Sentencing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Commission, the agency, do that? 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, Your Honor, because 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

when the Sentencing Commission was interpreting -- when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Sentencing Commission created the commentary, it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

1 

interpreting the language of the residual clause, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

the --

 

3 

            

4 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we know that for sure? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, yes, Your Honor, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

know it in several ways. 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

One, the sawed-off shotgun offense can only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8

11 

12 

13 

14

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

fall within the residual clause because the text of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines state three exclusive definitions for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term "crime of violence." 

 

 

 

            

Possession of a sawed-off shotgun does not 

   

 

 

 

 

fall within the first definition because there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element of force.  It is not one of the four enumerated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses.  Because the Guidelines states forth these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

three exclusive definitions, the only definition it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could fall within would be the residual clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We also know it because when the Commission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amended the commentary to include the possession of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sawed-off shotgun offense, the reasons for amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stated that it was doing so based on lower court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions concluding that possession of a sawed-off 

   

 

 

 

 

shotgun fell within the residual clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines themselves said that the term "crime of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence" means, among other things, burglary of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dwelling, arson, extortion, involves use of explosives,

involves possession of a sawed-off shotgun, or otherwise 

   

 

 

 

 

 

involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of physical injury to another? 

 

 

 

 

            

Would there be a vagueness problem then? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  No, Your Honor, but that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would be because the -- the offense would be in the text 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Guideline itself. 

 

 

 

            

And here the issue isn't just the vagueness, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it's also the -- the respect that the Court has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give to the agency's interpretation of a guideline. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And with the commentary here, Your Honor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the Commission was not interpreting the -- its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own words -- I mean the text of the Guideline was not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language that the Commission itself created.  It was not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting the enabling statute there.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting the exact same words that the Court was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting in the Armed Career Criminal Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But the Guidelines 

  

 

 

 

provisions are the -- are the Commission's words.  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they borrowed them from a statute, but they didn't have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do that? 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  No, they didn't. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But they did.  So they --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

they were their words, and they interpreted their words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the commentary. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

of the deference that this Court gives to agencies' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretations of its regulations, where a commission 

   

 

 

 

 

is -- I'm sorry.  Where the Commission is interpreting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guideline text, that is not its own words, but it's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words of a -- Congress here.  The text of the Guideline 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the same text as the Armed Career Criminal Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Commission, in adopting the career 

 

 

 

 

 

offender guidelines, stated it was explicitly 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporating the language of the Armed Career Criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act.  And so in this instance, the Commission is in no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better position to interpret that language than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

Court.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Perhaps if we go back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the process here.  The Guidelines were passed, including 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the residual clause at one point in time; correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, the original definition 

  

 

 

 

 

of the career offender guideline did not include, but --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but at some point, yes, Your Honor, the Commission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed an amendment that included the residual clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was it the Commission? 

  

 

 

 

 

Aren't those amendments approved by Congress? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Yes, Your Honor, the residual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

clause, yes.  The text of the Guideline is approved by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress; the commentary, however, is not. 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

the commentary is not approved by Congress, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commentary that added the sawed-off shotgun, was it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simultaneous with the adoption of the residual clause to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

define crime of violence? 

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  No, Your Honor, it was not. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was adopted in 2004.  It was not part of the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guideline that was submitted to Congress for approval. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The commentary was adopted in 2004 without Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

approval. 

11 

12 

13 

14 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me ask you a more -- let 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me ask you a more fundamental question.  And I don't 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

want to unduly shock the attorneys who are here from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sentencing Commission, but imagine there were no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

sentencing guidelines. 

 

16 

17 

18 

            

So you have a criminal provision that says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that a person who's convicted of this offense may be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprisoned for not more than 20 years.  That's all it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

says. 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Now, is that unconstitutionally vague? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  No, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that seems to be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot -- a lot vaguer than what we have here.  So how do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- how do you reconcile those two propositions? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, Your Honor, we submit

Our position is that the use of a vague 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

guideline, in fact, is worse than indeterminate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing because it systematically injects 

 

 

 

 

arbitrariness into the entire sentencing process. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And there is more 

  

 

 

 

 

arbitrariness because of this guideline than there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the Guidelines were passed?  Is there any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of that?  I have a lot of evidence it wasn't. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, I think, Your Honor, 

   

  

 

 

 

it's especially so here because --

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Especially so.  Is it so at 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

all?  There was a system before the Guidelines exactly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

as Justice Alito said.  Moreover, that system is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing today side by side with the Guidelines in any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case in which the judge decides not to use the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

Guidelines. 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

So I don't get it.  I really don't.  And you 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

can be brief here, because it's really the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that has to answer this question for me.  I don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand where they're coming from on this, and you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have to answer more than briefly, but I do have

exactly the same question that Justice Alito had. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, I think here, Your 

   

  

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

Honor, that the Guidelines hold a special -- special 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

place in the sentencing scheme because the court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stated repeatedly that the guide -- the Guidelines are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both the lodestone and the lodestar of Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing, and because of that they are sufficiently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

binding in a way that an indeterminate sentencing scheme 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

is not. 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, less and less, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right?  I mean, there are steadily increasing percentage 

    

 

 

 

 

 

of departures from the Guidelines. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  That's correct, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

there is an increasing number of departures from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines.  But it does not mean they don't have force, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the Court has held several times in recent years --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Peugh and Molina-Martinez, the Court recognized that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the power that the Guidelines have over the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences, the Court has recognized that as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guideline range goes up and down, so too do the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

applicable sentences. 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if the 

  

 

 

 

 

indeterminate sentencing is all right, it would seem to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me that even the vaguest guideline would be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

improvement and so difficult to argue that it's too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

1 

vague to be applied. 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  I disagree, Your Honor, 

    

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

because in -- even in an indeterminate sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme, due process did apply.  The Court's early cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Townsend v. Burke and United States v. Tucker 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicated that there were due process concerns depending 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on considerations that the Court was using.  There, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was material misinformation.  Here, the Court also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

expressed concern about arbitrariness even in an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeterminate sentencing scheme. 

 

 

11 

            

And here, the problem with using a vague 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

guideline is that it injects arbitrariness into every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing decision that relies on that guideline. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you saying there's more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

arbitrariness under this provision than there was under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the pre-Sentencing Reform Act sentencing system, where a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge would pick a sentence between zero and 20 years 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on that judge's personal ideas about retribution, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterrence, and incapacitation? 

 

 

20 

            

And in practice, there were judges who, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

under that system, always imposed a very light sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a particular offense and other judges who always 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed a heavy sentence for that particular offense. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Yes, Your Honor.  But it was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

always an individualized determination.  And I would --

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

1 

2 

3 

the respective for Federal judges make me believe that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was not done in an arbitrary way, whereas the problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the guideline --

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but your argument 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

applies to State systems as well, and you're telling us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the more specific a legislature or an agency tries 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make guidance for the judge, the more chance there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for vagueness.  And the statute, Section 3553 itself of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 U.S.C., they talk about the characteristics of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant.  Okay.  Seriousness of the offense.  Okay. 

  

  

  

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  But, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your argument is sweeping. 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

And you're saying the more specific guidance you give, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the more dangers there is of unconstitutionality. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's very difficult to accept. 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, I -- Your Honor, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

would disagree with your premise that this is more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific guidance.  The Court stated in Johnson that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words of the residual clause were meaningless, were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unintelligible.  And so --

  

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The less said the better 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

in sentencing? 

 

23 

            

24 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're saying that the 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

less said the better? 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

MS. BERGMANN:  No, Your Honor.  What I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You like that system. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. BERGMANN:  What I'm saying, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

saying --

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

is that if the Court is -- if the -- if a court is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided guidance with respect to how it is supposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose a sentence -- and here, district courts are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

required to calculate the Guideline range.  They are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

required to consider the career offender residual clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in every case.  In every case, a court must consider 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether a defendant's predicate offenses qualify him for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this enhancement that both doubles his sentence and may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extend it by a term of years. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  If I go through the 

   

  

 

 

 

Sentencing Guidelines -- I mean, I just opened them at 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

random.  I can see provisions that would generate a --

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

you know, an arguable vagueness challenge if they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a criminal statute. 

   

 

            

How about more than minimal planning?  Do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you think that's sufficiently -- that that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently clear to satisfy vagueness concerns if, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, you're -- you're guilty of this offense if it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved more than minimal planning?  Or the difference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

between a serious bodily injury and a permanent or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

life-threatening bodily injury? 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

And those are just -- I mean, just open this

concerns expressed in Johnson with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's application of the vagueness -- vagueness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine in that case.  Concerns were expressed about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other provisions being ruled vague, and the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined that the -- because the career offender --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, the ACCA residual clause, but here the career 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offender residual clause uses same language, because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used this very specific combination of a significant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

risk standard and an ordinary case analysis that it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not combination that rendered it vagueness in -- vague 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a unique way that wouldn't implicate other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

15 

provisions.

22 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wasn't the essence of 

  

 

 

 

 

our ruling in Johnson that it's one thing to ask a judge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to apply a determination to existing facts, as opposed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to what happens with the residual clause, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're asking a judge to basically fantasize about what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the average case is like? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

That --

 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so Guidelines that 

  

 

 

 

 

you're being asked to apply to specific facts are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

reviewable by a court, aren't they? 

   

 

 

 

2 

            

We can look at the facts and say, was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

judge right?  Was this more than minimal planning or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

not? 

5 

            

Correct? 

6 

            

7 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it's almost 

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

impossible, according to Johnson, to find what an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary case would look like because there was no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard of comparison of what ordinary meant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

And I'm aware of no other legal provisions, no other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines that use this ordinary case analysis that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forces the court to imagine a typical case and then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply the guidelines in that way. 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There are -- there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

circuit courts who already permit vagueness challenges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to provisions, right? 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

The Ninth Circuit has allowed vagueness challenges to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines provisions for decades now, and none has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

successful. 

23 

24 

25 

              

I mean, what's unusual about the residual 

 

 

 

 

 

clause is that it -- it really is unique among 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing provisions, and that was in part why the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

1 

2 

3 

Court was concerned about its application in the Armed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Career Criminal Act in Johnson, and it should be equally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of concerning nature here. 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know why --

    

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

I don't know why you run away from the proposition that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less is better.  I would have thought that's central to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your argument, and it's not.  It sounds bad, but it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.  I mean, maybe less was going to be more 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

susceptible to another challenge, like it's arbitrary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

But you can see that it's not a vagueness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

problem.  I mean, if you -- you know, the coin toss 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposition, if you say the sentence will be decided by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a coin toss, it's not vague.  Everybody knows exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's going to happen.  But it might be arbitrary. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

So in that case less would be better.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

you did not have the provision about a coin toss, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrows the uncertainty, then that would be better. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, Your Honor, I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

arbitrary is -- arbitrariness is the main concern here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the residual clause, and also with the commentary, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the arbitrariness comes into play when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commission is interpreting the vague language of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause to conclude that certain offenses fall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

within it. 

 

25 

            

The Commission was undertaking an effort 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18

that this Court deemed impossible in Johnson.  Prior to

Johnson --

 

3 

            

4 

            

5 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let me --

  

 

 

 

MS. BERGMANN:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let me ask you a question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

that's peculiar to this case, and it's essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the issue we're now debating became moot when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this sentence was reduced to 216 months, which is well 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below the Guidelines range. 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So his sentence, the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

the Guideline range, what was it?  262 to 327 months? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

15 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And he got 216 months. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. BERGMANN:  Yes, Your Honor.  He received 

  

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

a reduction in his sentence based on substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance to the government.  And if Mr. Beckles were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be resentenced without the career offender provision, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at that resentencing the court would establish a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guideline range, choose a sentence within that range, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and then apply the same 40 percent reduction based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his substantial assistance to whatever sentence the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge -- the judge came up with at that resentencing --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was this --

  

 

 

 

MS.  BERGMANN:  -- without the career

offender guideline. 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was this 40 percent 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

normal for this judge?  Did he say he was basing it on a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

percentage?

MS. BERGMANN:  She did, Your Honor.  And it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

was a 40 percent reduction based on his substantial --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  This is -- this is a fairly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

deep question, actually, you're going into, in my mind. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And what is -- before I reached a constitutional 

   

   

 

 

 

 

question, I would ask whether the Guideline falls within 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the scope of the words "Guideline-enabling statute."  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't see why you have to get into the Constitution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But even doing it that way, it then becomes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a matter of the extent to which the Federal courts are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to review the substantive Guidelines, itself an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

open question. 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

So rather than get into that, I might think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about your case like this:  Why was the statute vague? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was vague because with three examples preceding the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause, they tried to apply it, Congress, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands of State criminal statutes that vary in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variety of ways one from the other.  That's what caused 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the problem, I think. 

   

 

            

Now, if that was the problem, that isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present here because these apply to Federal statutes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

20 

Moreover, they don't apply to State statutes.  Oh, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe -- I see.  Yeah, yeah, you're right.  There is. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

You're right.  You're right.  I can't get around it that 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  Thank you for your answer.

(Laughter.) 

6 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But let's go -- let's go a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

step further. 

 

8 

            

9 

day. 

MS. BERGMANN:  My -- my best answer of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

(Laughter.) 

11 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, you're -- you're 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

thinking the right thing. 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  No, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I have -- I have -- I'm 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

conceding, because one way of clarifying the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vagueness that's there in the statute is through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example.  If we'd had twenty examples instead of three, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we might never had to get to that constitutional issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So here, what the Commission did was provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some examples.  That's all.  And one of the examples was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a sawed-off shotgun. 

 

 

            

So why isn't that sufficient?  I mean, there 

    

 

 

 

 

 

was vagueness.  Assume.  Because similar reasons? 

  

  

 

 

 

Assume.  And now we have an effort to cure.  And the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effort to cure is by giving examples.  And why isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21

that good enough? 

 

 

2 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, Your Honor, because --

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

because -- sorry.  I should just keep my mouth shut. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

Because, Your Honor, I believe that the 

   

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

Court has held that the residual clause has no meaning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And because it has no meaning, the Commission is in no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better place to interpret or clarify that language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where language is meaningless, how can it be clarified? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

And the Court struggled with this, as you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

said.  And prior to Johnson and James and Sykes and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Begay and Chambers, the Court attempted to narrow and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarify this language and provide examples.  But for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very reasons that Your Honor states, it was impossible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do so. 

 

 

15 

            

And the career offender provision is even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

broader than the Armed Career Criminal Act because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instant offense also has to qualify.  In the Armed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Career Criminal Act, it was limited simply to felon in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

possession. 

20 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, why is this -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

guess the real question on this last point is:  If what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're trying to do is to regulate the defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct, not possessing this thing or not committing a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime of violence, and he knows because the commentary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells him that if he does possess a sawed-off shotgun, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

1 

2 

3 

he's going to get this enhancement, what's arbitrary at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing for imposing what the defendant already knows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is illegal or will subject him to the greater 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

enhancement? 

5 

6 

7 

              

I buy your argument in terms of it would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrary to the Johnson reasoning to have a judge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine that a sawed-off shotgun --

   

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Here, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- is violent in one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

situation but not in another.  But if the issue of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrariness is the arbitrariness and capriciousness of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement, here the defendant knew that he was going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be subject to the enhancement at the time he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed the crime. 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  But the arbitrary here and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the enforcement here comes into play when it is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commission interpreting the language of the residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause.  The district court -- once the Commission 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interprets the residual clause to include possession of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a sawed-off shotgun, the district court has no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion not to apply that Guideline.  And so it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Commission's arbitrary --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I agree no discretion to 

    

 

 

 

 

apply the Guideline.  But --

  

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  No discretion -- I'm sorry --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

to ignore the Guideline.  Once the Commission states 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this offense falls within the residual clause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district courts have to apply it.  And so it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically directly requiring the Court to apply or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce arbitrary provision. 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is this different 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

from all of the examples the government gave in pages 55 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to 57 or the others where we've had a vague statute and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the administrative agency has narrowed it, or you have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipal ordinance that narrows, that the city narrows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in its administrative processes?  And all of those cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when they are challenged for vagueness, we look at how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute is applied to the individual. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

How is this situation any different?  If the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute was vague, it's vague.  And what we've done 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead is say, no, it's not vague, because the agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has narrowed its application. 

 

 

 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  Well, two responses, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

Honor. 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

With respect to the cases involving State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and local provisions and ordinances, the Court, as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of Federalism, has to look to the clarifying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructions that the State court or agency or local 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governing body has given to that language and accept it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be an interpretation of a statutory provision or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

1 

2 

whatever the provision is and accept that as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarifying construction of the State provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

With respect to respecting the decisions or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4

11

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

the clarifying actions of a regulatory body, a Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

regulatory body, the Court will do that only in certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations.  And here, that kind of deference should not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be afforded to the agency's interpretation of the career 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offender guideline in part because, as I said, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency is interpreting not its own words, but Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words.  And in that respect, under Gonzales, the kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chevron deference is not afforded. 

 

 

 

 

            

The same is true here with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seminole Rock deference, which is what Stinson deference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the Guidelines relies upon or deference, as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court also calls it.  Here, the Commission was not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting ambiguous language.  It was not choosing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

among ascertainable meanings in selecting the commentary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as providing -- I'm sorry -- selecting possession of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sawed-off shotgun as an offense that fell within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause.  Here, the Commission was interpreting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

vague language that had no meaning.  And in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect, it is not entitled to the deference in the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way that other interpretations of the Guidelines might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

be. 

25 

            

And I'd like to reserve my remaining time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

            

Mr. Dreeben. 

 

3 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

 

MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

please the Court: 

 

 

7 

            

The threshold question in this case is one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

of retroactivity, whether the rule that Petitioner seeks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be retroactive to cases on collateral review if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court were to adopt it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In view of the questions from Justice Breyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Justice Alito and others on the bench, I think it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may be useful to start at the outset to describe what we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the Due Process Rule is in this case and why it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not call into question traditional discretionary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing within a broad range that is not informed by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

sentencing guidelines. 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

So I think the starting point for analysis 

   

 

 

 

 

 

here is due process.  Due process does not itself 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require that all provisions of law not be vague in some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customary dictionary sense.  Due process protects 

  

 

 

 

 

fundamental fairness.  And when looking at fundamental 

  

 

 

 

 

 

fairness, the Court examines history and practice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, the history of this country has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included discretionary sentencing within a range without 

   

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

any guidance to the judge since the 1790 Crimes Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And through much of the 19th century, many statutes were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

written that way. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

The idea that due process vagueness analysis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

would somehow invalidate that contradicts cases like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Medina, which take as their touchstone for due process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

historical practice. 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

              

I also think that the purposes of what later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was announced as the vagueness doctrine are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicated in traditional sentencing.  The reason for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that is not that traditional sentencing produces uniform 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or predictable results.  It does not.  It maximizes 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

instead another important value of sentencing, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individualization or proportionality. 

 

 

            

Sentencing involves a large array of facts 

   

 

 

 

 

that are very difficult to reduce to rules.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional sentencing process relies on the judge and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant, in the courtroom with counsel, to examine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the multiplicity of facts that bear on appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing and then to select a sentence within that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

range. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

That is not arbitrary.  We have cited in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote 2 of our reply brief a case from this Court 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the Court described that as conscientious judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than arbitrary action.  It therefore does not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27 

1 

implicate the purpose of the due-process vagueness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

doctrine. 

3 

            

On the other hand, the Sentencing Guidelines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

as this Court has described them in recent opinions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have examined the advisory system that's been put into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place post-Booker, stress that that system injects law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the sentencing process.  The judge must calculate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Guidelines range.  The judge must be cognizant of it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout the sentencing process. 

 

 

 

            

That Guidelines range informs the judge's 

 

 

 

 

 

selection of a sentence because the judge knows that it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reflects the considered expert views of the Sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commission filtered through congressional policy.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

because of those features of the sentencing system in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court, the Court has described the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines range as having an anchoring effect, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tends to influence sentences if intended to do so, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has that effect, and it is continuing to have that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

effect. 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

Since 2011, the rate of within range of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government-sponsored departures in the Guidelines has 

 

 

 

 

 

remained relatively constant.  It has not dropped 

  

 

 

 

 

 

significantly.  It's still at around the 80 percent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

range. 

25 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So basically, your argument 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

28 

is that there's a continuum, so that if you have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete judicial discretion, barring the consideration 

 

 

 

 

 

of some impermissible invidious factor, within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory guideline range, there's no vagueness problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On the other hand, if you have mandatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines, you may have to apply vagueness principles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the mandatory guidelines. 

 

 

 

            

Now, here it -- so someplace in the middle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you get -- you are close enough to the mandatory that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that has to apply.  That's -- that's your argument? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  And we have not taken a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position on the mandatory guidelines in this case.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an advisory guidelines case, but the Court's description 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

of --

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if advisory guidelines 

  

 

 

 

 

are subject to vagueness challenges, then surely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory guidelines would be subject to vagueness --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, for vagueness.  But I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

talking about retroactivity. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So it's for 

  

  

 

 

 

 

21 

vagueness purposes. 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Now, suppose what the Court had said is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines are purely advisory.  Now, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they're -- the Sentencing Commission, very respected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

group, studied the problem; judges, you really ought to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

read them, you ought to take them into account, but in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the end, it's your call, based on the factors that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set out in the Sentencing Reform Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

5 

            

Would the result be the same? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. DREEBEN:  I think it would depend, 

    

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

Justice Alito, on how the Guidelines were implemented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and whether additional rules that were procedural in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

character, designed to reinforce the primacy of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines, were adopted.  It's hard to answer that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question in the abstract. 

 

 

 

11 

            

What we do know today is that, based on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

analysis in Peugh and Molina-Martinez, and the further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refinements that the Court has discussed and addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in cases like Rita and Gall, the Guidelines do have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant lodestar or lodestone effect in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

sentencing process. 

 

17 

            

On appeal, a court of appeals may consider a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

within-range sentence presumably reasonable.  And these 

  

 

 

 

 

legal features of the system lead the Court in the Peugh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case to apply the ex post facto clause to changes in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

advisory range. 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what will happen ten 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

years from now?  Let's say ten years from now when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have -- there's no district judge anymore who even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remembers the mandatory guideline regime and there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

departures in 85 percent of the cases, and the judges go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through the drill.  They -- you know, they calculate the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines and all of that, but then they go on and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose the type of sentence that they think adequately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serves the legitimate purposes of sentencing.  Would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your argument be the same then? 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, we -- we made a version 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

of that argument in Peugh and this Court rejected it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I think empirical evidence is not suggesting that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing courts are drifting radically away from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines, and one of the reasons for that is there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

feedback loop in place where the Commission examines the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines in practice, takes note when district judges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are varying or departing from them, and incorporates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those refinements into the Guidelines. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, maybe not 

  

 

 

 

 

radically departing, but steadily increasing their 

 

 

 

 

 

departures, isn't that right? 

 

 

 

19 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think so, 

    

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Mr. Chief Justice.  I looked at the statistics this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

weekend, and there is a trend line that hovers around 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 80 percent level for within-range sentences, plus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government-sponsored departures, which are 

 

 

 

 

incorporated into the Guidelines and recognized as not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being non-guideline sentence because the government is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

1 

seeking them within the framework of the Guidelines. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

So the Guidelines are continuing to have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

influential role in Federal sentencing, as they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to do precisely because the Commission is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at the same 3553(a) factors that the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court judge does.  The Commission takes into account 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual experience in sentencing and refines the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines in order to incorporate those improvements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into it.  Courts of appeals can presume within-range 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences reasonable on appeal which the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized in Rita --

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

explanation is in conflict and considerable tension with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your argument that this is not -- that this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural.  Why is that substantive? 

  

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

that the --

 

 

18 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So I think, Justice Kennedy, 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It appears that you're 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

taking two different positions on these points. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  And I think that's because 

   

  

 

 

 

21 

there are two different legal tests that are in play. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

The vagueness doctrine is looking at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

potential for lack of notice and arbitrary action.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think arbitrariness is the essential complaint about a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vague guideline that results in something that is little 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

1 

2 

better than a coin flip as to whether a person is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated as a career offender or not. 

   

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but you say the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

vagueness challenge analysis applies because this whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class is affected. 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

inconsistent with saying that they're procedural because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they don't play a dispositive role. 

   

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  They play an important role. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

I think dispositive is not the right statement.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test in retroactivity is much stricter than the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of whether due process should apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

The test in retroactivity, as this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

most recently articulated it in the Montgomery case and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again in the Welch case, is whether a rule alters the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

range of conduct or the class of persons who is punished 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a way such as, effectively, to make the person no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer eligible for the criminal sentence that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government seeks.  And that test is narrow, because it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responds to the very compelling finality concerns in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas context that are different from when the Court is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examining what the Constitution requires. 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Here's a thing I'd like you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

25 

to think about, and -- and tell me what you think.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

1 

2 

is -- this is what's bothering me about the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position.  It's important, the government's position. 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

            

Put in your mind the words that we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

talking about, "or otherwise involves conduct that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presents a serious potential risk of physical injury." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Okay?  Those are the words.  Put them over here; they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appear in the guideline.  Put them over here; they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appear in the statute. 

 

 

 

9 

            

When they appear in the statute, they have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

meaning, and it's fairly limited, and there's likely to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be one.  And eventually there will be an authoritative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

meaning. 

13 

            

When it appears over here in the guideline, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

it could be viewed as having an authoritative meaning or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it could be viewed as leaving up to the district judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the job of interpreting these sensibly in the case, just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like we used to do. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

And then the Commission goes around first to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

review it for reasonableness at the court of appeals, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then the Commission goes through the feedback 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process that you -- that you describe. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

Now, that would mean, one, a system that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

works itself towards a more logical, sensible approach 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in terms of punishment, and it also would mean that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normal words vagueness in the Constitution, or, if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

like, feed it through the statutory enabling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation, it would -- it would mean that it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have different meanings in the two constitutional versus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute versus guideline.  But the purpose of that would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be to get better guidelines. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So, Justice Breyer, I agree 

   

  

 

 

 

with the impulse of that question to the extent that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about the enumerated offenses in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commentary.  I think that those, whether they are viewed 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

as construing the language of the residual clause or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing an independent specification of what is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime of violence, they satisfy due process vagueness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8

concerns. 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Where I part company with that description 

   

 

 

 

 

of how the constitutional analysis is affected is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Commission selected the residual clause language to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mirror the ACCA residual clause. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We know that because this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is -- the words I read you are just one set of what I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bet are hundreds of examples in these Guidelines if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go through and think it doesn't make too much sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think -- no, I'd like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to come back to whether the Guidelines are vague as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general matter, because I don't think they are.  I spent 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

a lot of time going through them this weekend, and I was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

2 

3 

amazed at how specific they are and how they do mirror 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that are customarily elements of offense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Serious bodily injury is a very customary element of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

offense. 

5 

            

The Guidelines were framed to be 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

administrable in factual and judgmental ways that courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administer all the time in criminal law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

What was different about the residual clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

is that the Court wasn't -- Congress instructed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commission to put together a career offender guideline 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that covered people who had crimes of violence or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious drug offenses for their instant offense and two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others and they were older than 18. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

The Commission originally defined crime of 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

violence by borrowing the Section 16(b) definition of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime of violence which Congress adopted in the same act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that passed the Sentencing Reform Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It later switched to the ACCA definition, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the residual clause that this Court later invalidated in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson.  It made one tweak to the enumerated offenses. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instead of saying "burglary," it said "burglary of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dwelling," but it otherwise consciously sought to adopt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ACCA framework, and I think it did so largely to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simplify the administration of complicated criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

history determinations in recidivism cases in Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

36 

1 

prosecutions. 

2 

            

It added to that specifications of 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

particularized offenses, which it had done before when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 16(b) language was controlling.  So it always 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a list of enumerated offenses in the commentary, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it refined those slightly, but it retained them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think the proper way to look at this is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Commission was seeking to model this language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on congressional statutes in the ACCA, and courts across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the country heeded that by interchangeably citing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sentencing Guidelines, residual clause cases, and ACCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause cases. 

 

 

            

So when this Court in Johnson overruled the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two sentencing residual clause cases that had come out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in favor of the government and said that the residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause was vague across the board, sentencing courts no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer had a legal framework at all to interpret the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause except for the commentary.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

commentary provides specificity. 

 

 

20 

            

But the methodology that this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

condemned as producing a shapeless provision, a 

   

 

 

 

 

provision that was a black hole of uncertainty and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusion, that language existed, and the problem with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that from a due process point of view is that it leads 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to arbitrary assignments of classifications, such as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

37 

career offender classification or the firearms 

 

 

 

 

 

guideline, which also keys on prior crimes of violence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the defendant had in his history, and it leads to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the assignment of a range which then serves as the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anchor for sentencing that it provides an arbitrary

The judge thinks that the commission intends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this individual be treated as a career offender or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody who has a firearms offense with a crime of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

violence in his background, but the judge has no way of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowing whether that is arbitrary or non-arbitrary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the commission, having borrowed vague language, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ends with up with a vague statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Dreeben, can we go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

back to Justice Kennedy's question?  In Montgomery, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a rule that appeared procedural, just like this one. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The judge at sentencing could still sentence the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant to life without parole after a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

finding, i.e., that the individual was irredeemable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why is that different than here?  Meaning, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if the Guidelines are procedural in the Montgomery sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they are an anchor on what a judge does, why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't there a substantial risk like in Montgomery that a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant is going to be sentenced because of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guideline and not because of a finding that he or she is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

entitled to that sentence? 

 

 

 

2 

            

And I take that to be -- that substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

risk to be proven by your own statistic.  80 percent of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges sentence within the Guidelines.  But more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

importantly for those circuits that have permitted or --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or have applied retroactive activity to Johnson and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants have been resentenced, the vast majority have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received a much lower sentence. 

   

 

 

9 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So, Justice Sotomayor, let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

try to take the conceptual point and then the practical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point.  Conceptually, Montgomery interpreted Miller v. 

  

 

 

 

 

Alabama as basically requiring a finding to go to a life 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence, a finding of incorrigibility that prior law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

had not required.  And if that finding was not made, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant is not eligible for a life sentence if he's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juvenile homicide defendant. 

 

 

            

So Montgomery, rather than looking at Miller 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and saying, well, is it likely or unlikely that youths 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will get a life sentence, it interpreted Miller as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposing an eligibility requirement.  And that is why it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied habeas, not because there was some likelihood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

analysis. 

23 

24 

25 

            

If likelihood was the test, the Court would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have had to go through the analysis that it did and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focus on the incorrigibility aspect.  And that's what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

1 

distinguishes Miller from a Guideline situation. 

   

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But doesn't a judge 

   

  

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

still have to make a finding that there's a reason to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

give a defendant a higher sentence?  There may be some 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

judges who determine the nature of the past conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualifies this defendant for career criminal status, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absent that, it seems like the vast majority of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges who are now resentencing don't believe that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those -- that prior criminal history justifies the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

higher sentence. 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  We don't doubt, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor, that the Guidelines range is influential. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The question is whether it sets an eligibility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold.  The test is not likelihood of outcome.  That 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would, in effect, collapse one aspect of the test for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

watershed procedural rule into the criterion for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive rule for retroactivity. 

 

 

 

              

A watershed procedural rule both has to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a fundamental effect on accuracy, plus it has to change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our bedrock understanding of the elements of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I just ask 

   

  

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

something?  If we rule in your favor and say it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactive, how much is left of the Johnson ruling? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What effect would it have?  How many cases are there in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, except the -- I guess it's the felon in possession 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

cases would be the one example that the Guideline --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Guidelines haven't already been structured to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take care of all career offenders. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Our position is, as the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

knows from our submission in Welch, that in Armed Career 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Criminal Act cases where the effect of the residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause was to change a defendant from having a maximum 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

of 10 to a minimum of 15, Johnson is retroactive.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have sought and supported retroactive rulings in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases where somebody is no longer qualified for an Armed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Career Criminal Act sentence under Johnson. 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Outside of felon and 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

possessions --

 

14 

            

15 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  We do not --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- can you think of any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

other situations? 

 

17 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  We do not think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

Sentencing Guidelines should be interpreted --

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're not quite 

  

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

answering my question.  What other situations besides 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the felon in possession would Johnson and Welch be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operative?  Because as I understand it, in virtually all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

cases, most others, the Guidelines are within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

statutory maximum. 

 

25 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.  Well, I think

in all cases, Guidelines ranges have to be in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory maximum.  And that is precisely our point. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines ranges function as advice to the judge when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he is sentencing.  The Guidelines do not impose an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insuperable barrier that requires a specific finding of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

fact before the judge can sentence outside the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines.  That was the problem with mandatory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines.  Advisory guidelines allow the judge to look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the totality of the circumstances and to make policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments that may be at variance with the Commission. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, they don't do that all that often 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the Commission is doing its job.  And that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why we are on the side of Petitioner with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due process issue. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The third -- the third 

  

 

 

 

 

 

issue -- you've confused me by your argument.  I thought 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from your brief that if we decide the first issue, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, was there fair notice of the sawed-off shotgun, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no vagueness, and the case is over.  But -- so I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was thinking, well, we could decide that third issue and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not reach either vagueness or retroactivity. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So, Justice Ginsburg, I would 

   

  

 

 

 

urge the Court to decide retroactivity.  There are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands of cases in the Federal system that have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already been filed urging resentencing. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But would you say that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

not necessary if we agree that in this case there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair notice about the sawed-off shotgun being --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, this 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

Court's Teague jurisprudence says that in a collateral 

   

 

 

 

 

 

review case, a habeas case, the threshold question is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity because if the new rule that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner seeks would not be retroactive to cases on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral review, there should be no adjudication of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that prisoner's constitutional claim.  The issue --

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's like jurisdiction, 

  

 

 

 

12 

13 

that we are bound, we have no choice but to decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity before deciding anything else. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  No.  It's not a jurisdictional 

   

  

  

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

limitation.  Teague is a doctrine that this Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

framed, Justice Alito, if the Court wanted to decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something else before then, but the reason why the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government thinks that it would be in the interest of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal justice for the Court to resolve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity issue is that there are thousands of cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waiting in the wings that are being held up today. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

23 

            

Now, Justice Sotomayor, you --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Dreeben, what will 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

happen to all those cases that have been resentenced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

already? 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

1 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  They will keep their 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

sentences.  And the ones that --

  

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even the -- where the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

circuits said no retroactivity -- where they have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

permitted retroactivity? 

 

6 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, no circuit has actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

ruled on retroactivity.  The circuits have ruled on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

vagueness.  All except for the Eleventh have either said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vagueness applies to the Guidelines and the residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause falls.  Or they have said we accept the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's concession that vagueness applies. 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they've been 

  

 

 

 

13 

resentencing? 

14 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  They have been resentencing --

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

88 are pointed to in Petitioner's reply brief, and Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor asked about those.  My view on those is that they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are a tiny, small, and unrepresentative sample of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases that are waiting being held for this one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

The reason that those cases have gone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

forward are most likely because the judge took a look at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that defendant and said, I actually am going to sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him to a lower sentence, maybe time served.  I do not 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to wait for the Supreme Court's decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

Beckles. 

25 

            

The vast majority of cases, however, are on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

hold, which I think could represent a view by the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing judges that they are not so confident that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they will resentence the defendant to a lower sentence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

After all, these defendants haven't had a change in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

their criminal history.  They've had a change in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

advice that the Sentencing Commission is going to give. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If I were a district 

   

   

  

 

court judge and I wasn't going to change the sentence no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter what -- what the reason for the retroactivity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling, I would have just had the sentence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, you 

  

 

 

 

 

would have produced an efficient result.  But I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that for the --

many of the judges that are sitting on hundreds upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundreds of these cases and for U.S. attorneys that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grappling with old records and attempting to reconstruct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencings from many years ago, they are looking to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision by this Court on the retroactivity question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if I think that it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

retroactive, should I stop there, should I go on to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

consider whether it's vague, or should I just accept 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your concession that it's vague? 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

should decide the legal issue.  We have submitted to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court why the Due Process Rule that we think does exist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not be retroactive if the Court disagrees and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinks that it would be retroactive if it is true.  Then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think the Court should go on to say that, yes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vagueness applies to the sentencing guidelines, but in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view of the commentary here that specified the sawed-off 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shotgun, the residual clause is not vague as to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular offense.  And as a result, the judgment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

should be affirmed. 

 

 

12 

            

But I think that the systemic interest of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

justice right now in the wake of this Court's decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Johnson and knowing the pendency of Beckles is for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Supreme Court to pronounce authoritatively on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether retroactivity should apply to the new Due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Process Rule that Petitioner seeks and that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government thinks in light of this Court's decisions in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Peugh and Molina-Martinez is correct. 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

So the sequence of analysis in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

government's view would be first you address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity.  If the Court agrees with the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this is a procedural rule that does not have the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences that Welch and Montgomery attributed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural rules, then the case is over.  If the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

concludes that that Due Process Rule would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactive if it were correct, I think the Court should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go on to decide whether vagueness applies to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines.  I do not agree that any other guideline is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be invalid under vagueness analysis.  Just this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one, except insofar as the commentary has specified in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM K. MORTARA 

 

 

 

 

 

            

FOR COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE 

 

 

 

             

IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW 

 

 

 

 

 

                      

ON QUESTION 2 

 

 

            

MR. MORTARA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

              

I want to start off correcting something 

 

 

 

 

 

that my friend said when he referred to historical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing as not being arbitrary.  The United States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Senate report on the Sentence Reform -- Sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reform Act said:  "Correcting our arbitrary and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

capricious method of sentencing will not be a panacea." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

1 

            

That's in the Senate report on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

Sentencing Reform Act.  Judge Frankel understood 

  

 

 

 

 

sentencing is arbitrary under the old system.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrary.  It may have been individualized, but it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

arbitrary.

16 

            

Now, moving forward --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  It wasn't 

  

  

 

 

 

arbitrary to the judge at issue --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MORTARA:  Correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- meaning, the judge at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

issue always had his or her own reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MORTARA:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What was arbitrary was 

  

 

 

 

 

that one judge could have put different values on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason in one place and -- in New York and different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

values in California.  That's a very different form of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

arbitrariness. 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. MORTARA:  I don't think so, when one 

    

 

 

 

 

 

looks at the sentencing factors in 3553(a)(2), the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of sentencing that my friends both agree are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not subject to vagueness challenges.  These purposes are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

even more vague than the career offender enhancement --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate deterrence, respect for the law, just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment -- yet they result in the calculation in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind of the judge of a single number, a fixed, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

1 

determinate sentence. 

 

2 

            

My friend referred to arbitrary determinate 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

sentencing arising from the career offender enhancement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause.  But think about what 3553(a), the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first sentence says:  "The Court shall impose a sentence 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the extremely vague purposes of (a)(2)." 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But his point, I think, is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

that, yes, all that you say is true, but this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special kind of guideline.  This is like a threshold. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

This is like a rule of law that says, get into this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

career offender business if and only if you satisfy this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  Thus, most rules are telling the judge, Judge, go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to your history of what this is about.  Look at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offender, figure out what he did, and then try to find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an appropriate sentence in light of factors.  This isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

that. 

18 

            

This is off/on.  You either are in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

career offender or you are not.  And just as you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't, even before, have decided the sentence through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a throw of the dice, so you cannot now interpret an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on-off rule to say it's no worse than what you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

talking about. 

 

24 

            

MR. MORTARA:  And, Justice Breyer, that 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

amounts to an argument that because the career offender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

enhancement residual clause isn't quite that vague, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more subject to constitutional vagueness challenges. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, I'm not saying it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

not that vague.  It is that -- it is saying you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely on how sentencing used to work in order to save 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this on-off rule. 

 

 

7 

            

Then what was worrying me in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

conversation is I could think of other parts of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines; for example, the part that deals with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrent versus consecutive sentencing, which, you 

 

 

 

 

 

know, is a nightmare and is also the notion of a kind of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on-off rule, and I'm afraid of what we would do here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

See, that's where I a.m. in this.  I mean, I'm not 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying don't go ahead, go ahead.  But I think he's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to make a qualitative difference in what we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about here. 

 

 

17 

            

MR. MORTARA:  I do want to get back to the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

(a)(2) factors, but I -- I'll address your question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

directly. 

20 

            

My friend said that the problem here is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Molina-Martinez and Peugh and the weight that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines are given.  And that weight in part comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from Rita, which says that -- that an appellate court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can presume a within-Guideline sentence is reasonable, 

   

 

 

 

 

because that reflects the judgment of both the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

1 

2 

Commission and the sentencing judge that the 3553(a) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors have been met. 

 

 

 

3 

            

But that's actually not true with the career 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

offender enhancement, and that's because the career 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offender enhancement exists at the command of Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 994(h).  The Commission is not actually deploying its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expertise when it made the career offender enhancement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's doing something it was commanded to do, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make sure that sentences get at or near the statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

maximum. 

11 

            

So the rationale for the reasonableness 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

presumption of Rita completely goes away with the career 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offender guideline, and that's why the career offender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhancement should not get that kind of weight and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's why it doesn't. 

 

 

 

            

My friend referred to 80 percent of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences being within Guidelines ranges.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

75 percent outside of the Guidelines ranges -- Guideline 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ranges for career offenders.  Only 25 percent of career 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenders in 2015 got within the Guidelines-range 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences.  And some of that is government-sponsored 

  

 

 

 

 

 

departures to be sure.  But an astounding nearly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 percent of career offenders got below Guideline-range 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences without the government sponsoring them. 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

And what's going on there is that judges are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

not giving the career offender enhancement as much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight as Molina-Martinez and Peugh are talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it doesn't come from a Commission's expertise on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 3553(a) factors, and the Rita rationale is gone and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because sentencing judges are commanded to consider the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very facts of the offense and the criminal history that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were deprived of considering under the ACCA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

In Johnson, the Court made very clear that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

the saving construction offered by one of the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinions, the so-called criminal history or record-based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach, was not available as a matter of statutory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation.  But under the sentencing guidelines in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

factor (a)(1), a sentencing judge must consider those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

14 

facts. 

15 

            

So to take the example from Johnson, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

variety in a correctional institution under Connecticut 

   

 

 

 

 

law under the categorical approach, probably a crime of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence, but there might be the rare violence-free 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

riot.  A sentencing judge under the Guidelines can look 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

at what actually happened and look at the severe effect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the career offender enhancement and then sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below the range. 

 

 

            

And that is what is, in fact, happening, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because judges are looking at the facts, and they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not acting like automatons blindly adhering to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

52 

1 

Guidelines whatever their weight. 

 

 

 

2 

            

But coming back to the (a)(2) factors -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

I do want to come back to them -- in 1984, the (a)(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors were enacted.  They are vague by anyone's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition.  And the only answer we get from my friends 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the Sentencing Guidelines require numerical range. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The (a)(2) factors lead to a specific number, a fixed 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

sentence in the mind of the judge.  Which is more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrary or provides less notice?  That's easy. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

The only other explanation we get is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

weight afforded to the Guidelines.  I've already 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned that a little bit, but another way we can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think about it is a district judge is allowed to deviate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the Guidelines if it disagrees with them as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of policy.  That's Kimbrough and Spears.  A 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

district judge cannot declare that they disagree with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the purposes in (a)(2) and say, I a.m. now going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence under my theory of radical over-deterrence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead of adequate deterrence.  That would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reversible error under all of this Court's precedents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So whatever weight Molina-Martinez and Peugh say should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be given to the Guidelines, the (a)(2) purposes have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually equal or more weight, because a district judge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot disagree with them.  They are, in a sense, more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

binding than the non-binding career offender

discretionary sentencing, which I agree historically 

   

 

 

 

we've all accepted as constitutional, and then to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(2) purposes, which may be an attempt to codify that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historical practice, but they are law.  It -- it is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  It says shall impose a sentence, a fixed 

   

   

  

 

 

 

number.  And they are vague.  And if you accept that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary sentencing is constitutional and you 

 

 

 

 

 

accept that (a)(2) purposes are not subject to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional vagueness challenge, it seems extremely 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult to accept that the career offender enhancement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is somehow subject to a constitutional vagueness 

   

 

 

 

 

challenge either because of the numerical range, it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fixed number for (a)(2), or because of the weight for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reasons I've given. 

 

 

 

            

One other thing I wanted to raise, which is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

related to questions Justice Sotomayor was asking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the resentencings.  I'm not aware of the percentage of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those 88, what percentage that is of the total 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resentencing that would come up, and my friend suggested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's an unrepresentative sample.  But there's plenty of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

confounders in this resentencing. 

 

 

 

            

The -- the first is, sometimes it's been a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

different judge.

24 

defendant was originally sentenced under Booker, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre-Booker, so mandatory guidelines. 

 

 

 

            

The third is that in some of these cases --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I've looked at the government's sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referendum -- the United States has gone in and said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, because the Commission has gotten rid of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause, we would like the defendant's sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reflect the way sentences are going to be going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward, so we're asking you to impose a lower sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because we want things to look, in the future, the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are going to look for this defendant today. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

All of those things are confounders on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual effect that the career offender guideline had in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its original form on the defendant's sentence.  And to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take an example of Mr. Beckles, we talked a lot about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Molina-Martinez and Peugh, and some other decisions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are mentioned in Peugh as giving weight to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidelines.  Most of those decisions did not exist when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Beckles was actually sentenced.  Only Rita was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there.  And Mr. Beckles' lawyer told the sentencing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge that all the factors in 3553(a) were equal, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

none of them had any more weight than any of the others, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Mr. Beckles still got his within-Guidelines range 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

sentence.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Ms. Bergmann, you have a minute remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANICE L. BERGMANN 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. BERGMANN:  I'd like to make -- start 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

with a point about retroactivity analysis. 

   

 

 

 

14 

            

Mr. Dreeben states that the rule here is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

procedural rule, and I would disagree in part because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Dreeben misstated Montgomery as an eligibility test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

In both Welch and Montgomery, the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

was eligible for the same sentence so long as the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made specific findings.  And here, just like Montgomery, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it will be the rare case where a court can impose the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same sentence once the defender -- the defendant no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer qualifies as a career offender.  And that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

because the court would have to make additional findings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just was as true in Montgomery.  There it was permanent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorrigibility, but here, the very upward from an

ordinary guideline range to the career offender range 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would require the judge to come forward with specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and compelling significant determination, a 

 

 

 

 

justification that would be so compelling that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow a court to double someone's sentence, and those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations would have to be things that were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already taken into account by the Sentencing Commission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when they determined what the ordinary guideline range

would be.
