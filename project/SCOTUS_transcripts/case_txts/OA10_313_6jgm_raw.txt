                                 (11:07 a.m.)

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

next this morning in Case 10-313, Talk America v.

Michigan Bell, and the consolidated case.

            Mr. Bursch.

             ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

            MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

            Interconnection is the lifeblood of local

phone competition.  That is why, in section 251(c)(2) of

the Telecommunications Act, Congress guaranteed that

competitors would have interconnection at the location

and at the method of their choosing and at TELRIC rates

irregardless of market impairment.  The question in this

case is whether that 251(c)(2) obligation encompasses

the tens of thousands of existing entrance facilities

that even today are interconnecting competitive and

incumbent networks.  And the answer --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did you get -- you get

(c)(2) at TELRIC rates?

            MR. BURSCH:  Yes, you do, Your Honor.  You

get (c)(2) and (c)(3) at TELRIC rates.

            And so, the answer to the question presented

is yes, for three reasons:  First, because the FCC says

so.  And, as the expert agency charged with interpreting

and implementing the Act, that conclusion is entitled to

deference.

            Second, the FCC's conclusion is consistent

with the plain text of the statute and the implementing

regulations.

            And, third, the FCC's conclusion is

consistent with the policies embodied in the Act,

because the practical result of affirming the Sixth

Circuit opinion in this case is that a competitive

carrier, like Sprint for example, will be forced to

either charge its customers more for interconnection or

lay tens of thousands of duplicate entrance facility

cables, and those are precisely what the Act were

designed to prevent.

            I'd like to start with the Sixth Circuit

opinion -- and, specifically, this is at page 20a of the

Talk America cert petition appendix -- because this goes

to the heart of AT&T's position and the Sixth Circuit's

conclusion with respect to the orange plugs and cords

analogy.  You'll recall that the Sixth Circuit said this

was like a situation where a homeowner had a plug in

their garage and a long orange cord extending out to a

park, which the court called the entrance facility, and

then the competitive carrier would be that person in the

park.

            On page 20a of the petition appendix in

footnote 9, about halfway down, this is the key flaw in

the Sixth Circuit's reasoning:  The Sixth Circuit says,

"If you, as the homeowner" -- that's the -- I'm sorry,

that's the incumbent -- "had said that they may plug

into the surge protector, then the big orange extension

cord is just an 'entrance facility.'  But, if you had

said they must plug into the big orange extension cord,

then the big orange extension cord becomes the

'interconnection facility' and, consequently, the park

goers" -- the competitors -- "may plug into it."

            The problem with this is that the Sixth

Circuit was wrong in that the incumbent doesn't get to

choose where the point of connection is.  The statute

and the regulations and the FCC make clear it's the

competitor that gets to choose.  So, if the competitor

chooses the end of the extension cord where it connects

to the CLEC network in the park, then even the Sixth

Circuit agrees with us and the Seventh, Eighth, and

Ninth Circuits that the entrance facility is the

interconnection facility.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have just one small

question on that.

            MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

Official

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose that there are two

competitors and each of them wants to connect, but each

of them wants to connect at a different point and in a

different way.  Must the incumbent accommodate both if

they're technically feasible?

            MR. BURSCH:  Justice Kennedy, the answer is

yes.  The statute gives the competitive carrier the

opportunity to choose the point and the method, all at

TELRIC rates.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Doesn't it say something

about feasible?  It -- it doesn't -- it doesn't give

free choice entirely.  It says -- what are the words?

That the -- the interconnection doesn't have to be put

just anyplace if it's not feasible or it's undue expense

or something to that effect.

            MR. BURSCH:  Justice Ginsburg, the statute

and the regulations make clear that it must be

technically feasible, but there is an almost

irrebuttable presumption that when there are already

facilities in place performing that function, that is

technically feasible.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you -- you want the

incumbent here to -- to build the -- the orange cord and

extend it to wherever you have your switching equipment.

And what they say is, no, you -- you bring your

switching equipment here; we'll -- we'll allow you to

connect at, you know, the end of our facilities; but, by

God, you -- you make -- you make your own connection

to -- to the switches.

            Now -- now, moreover, you're -- you're

making them -- you'll pay them for the orange cord, but

only at TELRIC rates, which are not realistic.  Now, why

-- why are they wrong and you're right, especially when

you have legislation, the purpose of which was to

encourage the independent building of new facilities?  I

mean, it's clear that the Act wanted these new entrants

where -- where possible to build new facilities, and not

simply to glom on to the extant facilities of the

incumbents.

            MR. BURSCH:  Three responses to that

argument, Your Honor.  First, this case is about

existing facilities, not about facilities to be built,

although there's a lot of talk about that.  This isn't a

head-on challenge to the statute or the regulations.

The procedural posture is that this was AT&T trying to

get out of arbitration agreements that it had for

existing entrance facilities.  And so, that's the

posture of our case.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but the logic of your

case, as you described it, would also require AT&T to

build out the orange cord.

            MR. BURSCH:  Right.  And -- and two

additional points, Your Honor, on that.  First, they say

this is a large obligation because we're talking about

miles and miles.  That is not the position that AT&T

took with the FCC when they were commenting on the TRRO.

At page 16a of the Michigan blue brief, in footnote 397

of the TRRO, the FCC acknowledges AT&T's statement that

entrance facilities involve very short distances.  In

addition, we have the FCC's regulation and the Local

Competition Order, paragraph 553 --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, excuse me.

            MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Extant entrance facilities

I assume they were referring to.

            MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  I believe that's correct,

yes.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Well --

            MR. BURSCH:  They're very short distances.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  But if you ask for

a longer distance, they would presumably have to build

it.

            MR. BURSCH:  Well, not necessarily --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And charge you TELRIC

rates.

Official

            MR. BURSCH:  Right, because the FCC has

promulgated in -- in 521, the meet-point obligation,

which is another way that you can have interconnection.

And that demonstrates two things:  First, that sometimes

AT&T as the incumbent is required to build out

facilities, that it's not just a passive obligation.

            But, in addition, when they're talking about

meet point, they say that it's up to State commissions

to decide the appropriate and reasonable distance.

            So, even if we were presented with the

case -- not this case, but a different case -- where

you're talking about what's the appropriate length of

the facilities, the FCC has already acknowledged there

could be some reasonable limits on that.

            And the most important fundamental point,

the fourth point on this, is that Congress already in

(c)(2) said you're going to have interconnection without

regard to market impairment, and so we're not going to

look at the availability of other entrance facilities in

the market.  If a competitor asks to have this location

and this method and it's technically feasible, they do

get the TELRIC rates.

            And the competitive carriers would take

issue with the presumption that TELRIC rates are -- are

unfair.  You know, the regulations do contemplate that

they're going to recover not only their cost but a

reasonable profit.  And we can disagree about the

congressional wisdom of requiring rates like that, but

in the Verizon case, this Court definitively put to bed

the question of the reasonableness of the TELRIC rates.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Where would I read this?

As I read the statute, the statute says the cheap system

here is where they provide -- they have a duty to

provide the incumbent interconnection, okay?  That

requires some physical stuff.

            MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  And they have to --

they -- you have to -- you're not charged a lot for

that; there's a limit on what they can charge you for

the interconnection.

            MR. BURSCH:  Correct.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, somebody is going to

have to decide whether if Pacific Tel and Tel is being

tried to forced to connect with Maine, you know, they

have to pay for a wire across country to get the

interconnection or not.  That seems unreasonable.

Across the street, maybe they do.

            My candidate would normally be the FCC or

some regulator decides that kind of thing, and it's up

to them to say whether this is or is not what's needed

for interconnection.  That would be an intuitive account

I would have, without having read the statute in depth.

            So, now what do I read to find out how this

works?  What is it that distinguishes something that is

ridiculous, like my California example, from something

that makes a lot of sense, like they're next door and

have to make 50 feet of wire.

            MR. BURSCH:  Justice Breyer, if you look at

paragraph 553 of the Local Competition Order, which

appears at page 27a of the Michigan blue brief --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Michigan blue --

            MR. BURSCH:  At least that's where it

begins.  If you flip over to -- to page 28a, this is the

second page of the paragraph.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Where -- where -- 28a,

okay.

            MR. BURSCH:  Very good.

            About halfway down the -- that paragraph

there, it says:  "Regarding the distance from an

incumbent LEC's premises that an incumbent should be

required to build out facilities for meet-point

arrangements" -- so, again, this is in the meet-point

context -- "we believe that the parties and State

commissions are in a better position than the commission

to determine the appropriate distance that would

constitute the required reasonable accommodation for

interconnection."  So, again --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So, it's up to the

State commission.

            MR. BURSCH:  Exactly.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  This is the FCC speaking?

            MR. BURSCH:  The FCC is speaking --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And the State

commission says -- they say it's up to the State

commission.  And the State commission here said?

            MR. BURSCH:  Well, here, the State

commission didn't say anything, because we're talking

about existing facilities.  There's no one requesting a

new entrance facility to be built, for example, from

Lansing to Detroit.  That's not this case.  This case is

about the existing facilities.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Bursch, the -- the key

to your case is -- is that an entrance facility is

interconnection, right?

            MR. BURSCH:  Correct.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have to equate those

two -- those two terms.

            MR. BURSCH:  I do.

equate them?  Because the -- as I read the regulations,

they -- they use them as separate terms.

            MR. BURSCH:  Regulation 51.5 defines

"interconnection" as the mutual -- or, I'm sorry -- as

the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of

traffic.  There is no dispute that an entrance facility

physically links a competitive network with an incumbent

network; thus, when that entrance facility is used for

the mutual exchange of traffic, it is providing

interconnection.  And that's exactly what the FCC has

concluded.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Doesn't -- doesn't the

interconnection -- doesn't it have to be part of the

internal system of the incumbent carrier?

            MR. BURSCH:  It has to be part of their

network.  But in the TRRO, the FCC made clear repeatedly

that entrance facilities constructed by incumbents are

part of their network.  And so, there's really no

dispute that it can be part of the network.  And so --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You say that this is a

link, and your -- the opposition says that it's a --

that it's transport.  Is that correct?

            MR. BURSCH:  It is transport.  By

definition, interconnection has to include transport

because it involves the mutual exchange of traffic from

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the -- but the reg

says interconnection does not include transport.

            MR. BURSCH:  Well, we address that point at

length in our reply brief, because AT&T advances that

argument, and it's really a fundamental misconception or

misunderstanding of the regulation.  51.5 --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have -- I've got it in

front of me.  It says, "This term does not include

transport."  But you -- you say it does?

            MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  Well, the entrance

facilities do include transport.  All interconnection

facilities --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, I'm talking about --

            MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- interconnection.

            MR. BURSCH:  Right.  What 51.5 -- I assume

that's what you're looking at.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.

            MR. BURSCH:  That -- that goes to a term of

art or a phrase of art, "transport and termination of

traffic."  And as the FCC made clear in its regulation

51.701, which is at page 35a of the red brief, what

they're really distinguishing there are the two types of

charges.  You have 251(c)(2) interconnection charges and

you have 251(b)(5) transport and termination of traffic

charges.  And those are two separate concepts.

            The interconnection charge runs from the

competitive network to the incumbent network.  The

transport and termination of traffic charge runs from

the point of interconnection to the incumbent's end

customer, and that's very clear.  The Ninth Circuit

specifically acknowledged that point in note 16 of the

Pacific Bell case.  But common sense tells you that has

to be right because under AT&T's view, the way they

interpret 51.5, there would be no interconnection

obligation because there's always going to be transport,

a mutual exchange of traffic when interconnection is

involved.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that right or --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you read --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there a mutual

exchange of traffic when you're talking about

backhauling?

            MR. BURSCH:  No, there is not, and we don't

take that position.  The mutual exchange is when a

competitive customer talks to an incumbent customer or

vice versa.  Everything else we can call backhauling,

and that's not what's at issue when we're talking about

251(c)(2).

            JUSTICE BREYER:  You see, I would think --

you said, well, this is an existing facility.

            MR. BURSCH:  Yes.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But my intuition would be

that makes no difference whatsoever.  You could have

some kind of mechanism that connects two companies.

Now, half of it is a simple wire and half of it is bells

and whistles.  And so, we have to decide which part is

the part that's necessary for the interconnection and

which part is some kind of -- well, I don't know, extra

bells and whistles, and therefore, since it's not an

impairment kind of problem, they have to pay full price

for it.

            That, again, seems like the kind of job that

Congress would leave up to a commission, but I guess I

want you to tell me:  Who's to decide that kind of

thing, and how do we decide it?

            MR. BURSCH:  Are you talking about the

distance, or what the bells and whistles are--

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know what it is.

Often, these things are not distance.  Often, a

connection is all kinds of complex things, you know?

And some are necessary and some aren't.  But I can --

can't you imagine with me the same kind of California

problem arising, but it just arises in -- in kind,

rather than in distance?

            MR. BURSCH:  Well, as far as --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  My -- if I'm so far off

base you can't get the question, forget it.

            MR. BURSCH:  No, not at all, Justice Breyer.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I might not be able

to get an answer.

            MR. BURSCH:  I think it's a very good

question.  And really --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't have to think

it's that.

            MR. BURSCH:  I'll take it in two parts.  You

know, again, with respect to distance, in the meet-point

context, the FCC has already delegated in LCO paragraph

553 appropriate and reasonable distances.

            With respect to the bells and whistles, it's

really not that complicated.  You've got a cable.

That's your entrance facility, you know, typically a

fiberoptic cable.  And there's going to be a conduit

that it needs to run through.  There might be, you know,

risers or spacers with little twisty ties or something

similar to that, zip cords, that will allow the cable to

be run into a building and up a wall and connect into

interconnection facilities, those are necessarily part

of the 251(c)(2) obligation.

            And unless there are any further questions,

I'll reserve the remainder of my time.

             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

               SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

            MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

            There are a lot of statements by the FCC at

issue in this case, but I'd like to focus on two

statements by the commission in its published regulation

and orders that, taken together, resolve the question

presented here.  And the first is the commission's

determination in 47 CFR 51.305(e), which appears at page

5a of Michigan's brief, that it is the competitor, not

the incumbent, that gets to select the point at which

interconnection takes place.

            Specifically, that regulation says that if

an incumbent wants to deny a request for

interconnection, it has -- at a particular point, it has

the burden of proving that interconnection at that point

would be technically infeasible.  And that undercuts a

key premise of the decision below, which was that as

long as the incumbent provides interconnection at some

technically feasible point that it has selected, then

it's discharged its obligation, and if the competitor

doesn't like it, that's just too bad.  They can build

their own facility if they want to interconnect

somewhere else.  That's --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, underlying that

question is an issue that I think Justices Ginsburg and

Scalia were asking.  Technically feasible is different

from economically ridiculous or economically burdensome.

How does that, "economically burdensome" -- does it get

considered by anyone so that -- because one could

imagine, as Justice Breyer said, that a competitor could

come in and say, now, build me the Taj Mahal as an

entrance facility or as an interconnection facility.

So, is there anyone controlling for that latter issue?

            MR. MILLER:  In terms of the definition of

"technical feasibility" -- that's a defined term in

section 51.5 of the regulations, and it does not include

economic considerations.

            Nonetheless, as the commission explained

when it adopted those regulations in 1996 at paragraph

209 of the Local Competition Order, competitors have an

incentive to ask for an economically efficient means of

interconnection because they have to pay for it.  I

mean, the -- they don't pay as much as AT&T would

like -- because they're paying TELRIC rates -- but they

do still have to pay for interconnection, so they have

incentive to ask for a reasonable method of it.

            And what's at issue in this case, to get to

the second part of your question, is not --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's why it's only

technically feasible, because the economic burden is --

is not on the company.  It has to provide it at the

place if it's technically feasible, but it doesn't pay

for it.

            MR. MILLER:  That -- that's right.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Miller, you

began by saying there were two regulations that disposed

of the case.  You got one.  What's the second?

            MR. MILLER:  The -- the second is the

commission's determination in the Triennial Review

Remand Order in response to the D.C. Circuit's remand of

its previous order, that entrance facilities are,

indeed, part of the incumbent's network because the

statutory obligation, of course, is to allow

interconnection at any technically feasible point within

the incumbent carrier's network.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Where do I find that?

            MR. MILLER:  That's in paragraph 137 of the

Triennial Review Remand Order, which appears at page 10a

of Michigan's brief.  And in the preceding paragraph,

the commission traced the history of its definition of

the dedicated transport network elements in the Local

Competition Order, its revision of that in the Triennial

Review Order, in which it had said that the facilities

are not part of the network.  The D.C. Circuit then

vacated that.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What section are you

referring to?  On page 10a?  Which one is it?

            MR. MILLER:  Well, I've -- I've just gone

back to the previous two pages, but it -- 10a is

paragraph 137, where the court says, "In response" --

excuse me -- where the commission says, "In response to

the court's remand" -- that's the D.C. Circuit's remand

in the USTA case -- "we reinstate the Local Competition

Order of dedicated" -- "Order definition of dedicated

transport."  And that was a definition of a network

element that included entrance facilities.  So, what the

commission was saying there by its reference back to

that definition --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you do not need to

provide unbundled access under (c)(3) to entrance

facilities, right?

            MR. MILLER:  That -- that's correct, and the

court of appeals, I think, perceived a contradiction

between saying that this isn't something to which you

have to provide unbundled access under (c)(3), but it is

something that has to be made available for

interconnection under (c)(2).

            And there is no contradiction there because

these are separate, independent statutory obligations,

and what's particularly significant about the difference

between the two statutes -- statutes is that (c)(3) has

an impairment test.  You only have to make available

those network elements without which the competitor

would be impaired in its provision of service.

            (C)(2) does not have an impairment test, and

that's because Congress recognized that interconnection

is absolutely fundamental to any effective telephone

competition.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So, what's the

definition difference between entrance facility and

interconnection facility?  How do we know which is

which?

difference is.

know which is which?  We see some big lines and stuff in

it; how do we know which is which?

            MR. MILLER:  The -- an entrance facility, as

the commission explained in the TRRO, is just the link

between the incumbent's office and the competitor's

office.  And an interconnection facility is anything --

any part of the network that's being used for

interconnection.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a genus and -- and the

entrance facility is the species --

            MR. MILLER:  It can be.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- in your estimation?

            MR. MILLER:  It -- it can be when it is used

for interconnection.  It could also sometimes be used

for other things, but we're talking about the situation

where the competitor wishes to use the entrance facility

for interconnection.

competitor.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Got it.

            MR. MILLER:  That can be used for a couple

of different purposes, but one of the purposes for which

it can be used is interconnection.  And when it is being

used for that purpose, it is appropriately described as

a -- as an interconnection facility.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Miller, would you,

before you sit down, explain what is the Government's

position when an agency is asked to file a brief?  The

Sixth Circuit asked -- invited the FCC to file a brief,

it did, and then the Sixth Circuit disagreed.  And there

was some suggestion that when an agency files a brief

here in this Court, as opposed to a court of appeals, it

deserves more weight.

            MR. MILLER:  We -- we agree with the view

expressed by Judge Sutton in his dissenting opinion

below, that there really is no reason to distinguish

between amicus briefs, particularly those filed at the

invitation of a court, in the court of appeals, from

question of --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But there may be a -- a

reason to give less weight to briefs in this Court,

different from the briefs filed with a court of appeals.

And you've taken a different position here on -- on the

issue of whether, when backhauling is included, it's

part of the -- it's -- it's part of the interconnection

facility?

            MR. MILLER:  No.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I do not think you made

that distinction below about, you know, oh, it is part

where there is back -- where there is not backhauling,

but where there is, it isn't.

            MR. MILLER:  I think our briefs in -- in the

two cases are consistent.  Our brief here provides more

detail in explaining the commission's orders, but in

both cases, we have taken the view, as the commission

has consistently taken the view since the TRRO, that

entrance facilities don't have to be made available as

unbundled elements for purposes of back haul, but they

do have to be made available when the incumbent seeks to

use them for interconnection.  And I think this is

precisely the sort of case where --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  They have to be as

unbundled elements?  I thought they never had to be --

            MR. MILLER:  No, they -- they --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- made available as

unbundled elements.  That's (c)(3).

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your argument here is that

only have to be made available under (c)(2)?

            MR. MILLER:  Exactly.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is not unbundled?

            MR. MILLER:  Right.  And it's only for

purposes of -- of interconnection.  And I think this is

precisely the sort of case where deference under Auer is

appropriate, given that you have a highly complex

statute regulating a very complex, dynamic industry, and

so the commission's regulations involve not only the

exercise of --

to throw up our hands.  There's no doubt about it.

            (Laughter.)

            MR. MILLER:  I -- another way of saying that

would be that it's appropriate to recognize the

commission's not only policy-making discretion but

technical expertise in the industry that's being

regulated.  And certainly the commission has tried to be

as clear as it can in its regulations, but this is an

area where some level of imprecision is probably

inevitable.  And I think that's why it's appropriate to

defer to --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I don't know why --

why it's so hard.  I mean, I got out my orange cord, and

I --

            (Laughter.)

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I -- I wasn't sure of

if -- if it was a transport or link.  That -- that's my

concern.

            MR. MILLER:  Well, I guess I would say maybe

we need to put the difference between interconnection

and transport in concrete terms.  It would be the

interconnection charge which is at TELRIC rates under

252(d)(1).  There would be a flat fee for setting it up

and then a flat monthly fee just for having the link

there.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, continue.

            MR. MILLER:  Thank you.  And that's

independent of usage.

            Then, separately, each time a call is made,

there is a charge under 252(d)(2) for the transport and

termination of the call.  And that goes both ways.  So,

when the competitor's customer calls the ILEC, the

customer -- the competitor pays the ILEC for terminating

              ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

            In this case, the agency is trying to use an

amicus brief to interpret a few sentences in orders from

years ago to create a new legal rule without ever going

through a process that would result in judicial review.

In fact, in the Triennial Review Orders, where the

agency supposedly announced this new obligation, it

assured incumbents like AT&T that it was not altering

its interpretation of the statutory interconnection

duty.  And the Government correctly concedes here that

before those orders, the Government had never

interpreted the statutory interconnection duty to

require companies like AT&T to sell a fiberoptic cable

at TELRIC rates.  Yes --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I know you're

saying that, but everybody's arguing about what the --

what the TRO and the TRRO say or don't say.  But I go

behind that and I go -- I think the Government's entire

argument is not based even on those.  It's based on the

LCO regulations themselves.  They've cited two, which is

51.305 and 51.321.  They're not relying on those TROs in

their back and forth there; they're relying on the

regulation.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Well, Your Honor, I

actually read their brief differently, and I note that

in the Sixth Circuit, they didn't rely on any

regulations at all.  The argument was entirely based on

paragraph 140.

            But going to the regulations, at the same

time they promulgated those rules, the government did

define interconnection to exclude transport, and when

they defended that exclusion --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, how do you address

their point that there are two different charges at

issue?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  There are --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That one -- that

interconnection by definition includes transport.  It's

hard for me to think of how it doesn't because they've

got to travel from one place to another, so --

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Your Honor, when the FCC

explained this to the Eighth Circuit, what it said is

there are really three things going on.  One is (c)(2),

is the duty to interconnect at a point, not to provide a

whole host of facilities that get you to the point, but

literally the duty to interconnect at a specific point

in the world; selected by the competitor to be sure, but

that only tells you where interconnection occurs.

That's the point.

            The commission then said:  Okay, then there

are other obligations in the statute.  One of them is in

section 251(b)(5), and that's what obligates the

incumbent to accept telephone calls that are sent to

that point and to send telephone calls through that

point to the competitor.

            And then, there's the third thing, and this

is directly from the government's brief to the Eighth

Circuit, where they explain that section (c)(2) --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The Sixth Circuit?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  The Eighth Circuit.  We

cite this at -- from 1996, this is the contemporaneous

view of the agency at the time it promulgated the

interconnection regulations.  It's defending those

regulations against a challenge that they are too

narrow.  And what the agency says to the Eighth Circuit,

which then deferred to this interpretation, is if

section (c)(2), interconnection, included routing and

transmission, (c)(2) would overlap with other sections

that, one, describe a duty to route and transmit

traffic, telephone calls; and, two, a duty to lease

facilities that will be used for routing and

transmission.  Footnote:  Those duties are (b)(5) and

(c)(3).  To the extent there is a duty to lease the

facilities, the fiberoptic cables that competitors are

going to use to get to the interconnection point of

their choice, that duty has to arise, the commission is

saying here, only under section 251(c)(3).

            And we know it doesn't arise under that

section because these aren't things that are bottleneck

elements.  These aren't things that competitors can't

get themselves.  Competitors are interconnecting today.

Wireless carriers, other competitors, everyone in the

State of Ohio has since 2005 not been paying TELRIC

rates, and as the amicus brief showed, there has been no

detriment to competition.  Interconnection is occurring.

            And so, what the Government is trying to do

here is impose this leasing obligation under the

interconnection duty in a way that never gave AT&T and

other incumbents any opportunity to challenge it.  They

never explain how it squares with the text and structure

of the statute, with their prior statements, or why

there's any policy basis for interpreting what they

claim is an ambiguous statute to require TELRIC pricing

for things that are not bottleneck elements.

            Back in the Local Competition Order, Justice

Sotomayor, when they adopted the TELRIC methodology,

they recognized -- this is in paragraph 702 --

interconnection services -- that's what they called it

back then -- are bottlenecks, not things that

competitors can build themselves or buy from third

parties in the marketplace, as the agency has found is

the case since 2005.  They never --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, now you're reading

limitation into the statute.  All the statute says is

you're obligated to provide interconnection services.

It doesn't say how or limit it only to things that are

not bottlenecks or things that are bottlenecks.  It just

says you're obligated to do X.  And that's what the

agency's saying.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  I understand this, Your

Honor.  But if the agency had ever done that through

notice and comment with a rule and published it in the

Federal Register -- which they concede that before 2003

they hadn't done that as to entrance facilities -- and

they claim they had no occasion to address the

question -- and then in 2003 we get a single sentence in

a paragraph of an order where there was no notice they

were considering interconnection duties, no publication

of a new regulation, no publication -- nothing that

would have, you know, told AT&T and other incumbents you

should seek judicial review of this if you think it's

wrong.

            And now we're being told 8 years later that

when they said "facilities" in that paragraph, they

meant entrance facilities.  And we're being told 2 years

later when they said "interconnection facilities," that

they meant entrance facilities, even though when they

were asked that question by the Sixth Circuit they said

we didn't define that term.  And Mr. Miller might want

to say they've just said a little bit more now, but

they've said something radically different.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- in that regard, in

all of these years, are -- you mean to tell me there is

no other incumbent that has provided interconnection

services at an entrance facility and charged TELRIC

rates?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Prior to 2003 and 2005,

when there was an unbundling rule in place -- and the

commission had always recognized when it established

that unbundling rule in 1996 that competitors would use

unbundled transport facilities to connect to incumbent

switches, so to connect to those interconnection points.

And, sure, prior to 2005 when the unbundling rule was in

place, competitors would lease these facilities and pay

TELRIC rates and use them to get to the interconnection

point, but there was never during that time any

statement that even if there was no impairment, section

251(c)(2) would require the exact same thing to get to

the interconnection point.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What happened to the

unbundling rule?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  It got -- it was gotten rid

of.  It doesn't exist anymore.  So, now AT&T has said

those things you used to buy under the unbundling rules,

we don't have to sell them to you at TELRIC rates

anymore.  We have a tariff.  We've always had a tariff.

We'll sell them to you at just and reasonable rates

under the tariff.  You can build them yourself, as

competitors and wireless carriers are doing.  You can

buy them from the third parties that build them and

advertise their offering of them.

            But what you can't do is say all of a sudden

that the interconnection duty had always required the

exact same thing as the unbundling duty, at least not

without going through a rulemaking where you lay out

your policy grounds.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why was the unbundling rule

abandoned?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  It was abandoned because

the record evidence showed unambiguously that

competitors don't need these things from incumbents.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not a bottleneck?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  It's not in any way, shape,

or form a bottleneck.  And I guess that gets to the

second point I'd make, which is that, again -- and I

don't think they rely on the regulations, Justice

Sotomayor, and they've never -- and the Government

concedes in footnote 6 that the regulations themselves

don't get them to where they want to go.  They need

these statements they made in 2003 and 2005.  And even

if you credit their new position that when they said

facilities and interconnection facilities, that was just

an imprecise way of saying entrance facilities, those

statements don't get you to the rule that they're

endorsing.

            What the agency actually said is that

competitors will have access to these facilities -- and

let's pretend that means entrance facilities for the

time being -- will have access to entrance facilities at

cost-based rates to the extent that they require them to

interconnect, and that's paragraph 140 of the Triennial

Review Order and -- remand order, and they said the same

thing, although they used the word "need," not

"require."

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is (c)(3).

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Well, I think the point is

what they -- this is why we think the right reading of

those statements is that the facilities they're

referring to are things they actually do require and

need, which are the things inside AT&T buildings that

they can't replicate, that it's strange for them to have

said you're going to get these facilities you require,

but to have meant something that they don't in fact

require.

            But even if you want to read, again,

facilities and interconnection facilities to mean

entrance facilities, the rule that they're endorsing --

and, you know, Michigan now wants, if it's in the ground

we have to provide it; if we'd have to build it, we

don't have to provide it.  It's the first time we've

heard of that in the scope of this litigation.  The

Government seems to only be willing to -- to talk about

those few facilities that had been gotten under the old,

now-gone unbundling rules, but that's not the

distinction that the commission drew when it said this

thing that's supposedly imposing an obligation on AT&T

and other companies.  It limited it to those things that

competitors require.

provide interconnection -- an interconnection.

obligation, Your Honor, to provide interconnection at a

that it is (c)(3) rather than (c)(2).

has to exist under (c)(3).  That's absolutely right,

Justice Scalia, that -- we think that's the right

reading of the statute, we think that's what the FCC

told the Eighth Circuit, we think it's what the FCC said

sides, I think, that this is not necessary.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's right, and because

it's not necessary, you can't read, as the government

tries to, belatedly, years after the fact, those

statements in their orders from 2003 and 2005, those few

statements in these matching orders --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't help because

it's a network element if it's in (3), and what this is,

is something that's going to be needed to -- to

interconnect.  If it's -- if it's in -- if it's in the

first one.  And I don't know which is which, and I

gather that sometimes it would be tough.  And what

courts use to do with the ICC when they got into this

kind of situation is a doctrine called primary

jurisdiction, and they'd ask them for a brief.  All

right?  So, if that's what we've done hypothetically, we

have the brief.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Well, Your Honor --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, why don't we have to

follow the brief?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Because the brief here

doesn't do what a decision on a primary jurisdiction

referral would do, which is square what the agency is

doing with the text and structure of the statute with

prior statements that contradict --

it doesn't have to be needed to interconnect.

don't have interconnect here; you can interconnect

somewhere else.

absolutely right, Justice Scalia.  They get to pick a

point.  The point has to be within our network.  Rule

51.305 identifies a series of illustrative points, all

of which exist inside AT&T buildings.  And that's what

they've done.  They've picked a point --

et cetera, say that an entrance facility is within your

network?  You haven't challenged that.

the competitors in this case and Michigan have long said

is that the competitor has picked as its point of

interconnection a point inside the box on the right

labeled Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier Central Office.

gap to that interconnection point.  That's how Judge

Sutton understood it in dissent.  That's how Judge

Batchelder understood it in the majority.

            And all the interconnection duty talks

about, all any of the interconnection regulations talk

about, is letting the competitors pick that point.  How

they get to the point is up to them.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's not what the statute

says.  The statute says the carriers have a duty to

provide interconnection.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Right.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, in carrying out a duty

to provide, you say that's just picking a point.

Somebody could equally well say, no, it's a duty to

provide means to get to the point.  Now, either of those

seem equally consistent with the language.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Your Honor, there's more

language that I think forecloses those interpretations.

It's not just the duty to provide interconnection.  It's

the duty to provide interconnection for the competitor's

facilities and equipment --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  -- at a point within the

incumbent's network.  Nothing in that statutory language

says that the duty is to provide the competitor with the

but it doesn't say the opposite.  And, therefore, you

might have an agency reasonably deciding that to provide

-- to fulfill that duty, you must provide equipment

reasonably necessary to allow the competitor to connect.

That's equally sensible.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  And, Justice Breyer, you

might have an agency that did that.

that did that.

agency that never really said one way or the other.

Michigan was wrong when it thought that the agency had

other.  They've said when you have wires and you're

using the wires for communication, then they don't fall

outside this; that's true.  But if you're using them for

interconnection, and they're necessary to use for

interconnection, maybe it does fall inside this.  I

don't --

"interconnection" where they excluded transport from

interconnection and explained to the Eighth Circuit's --

you know --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Excluded -- they excluded

transport -- all transport to the point of

interconnection, where you could not provide the

facility to interconnect unless you had the transport?

Is that what they did?

            What they said is a duty to lease facilities

that will be used for routing and transmission of

telephone calls to the point, that's (c)(3).  That's not

part of the interconnection duty.  When they contrasted,

in their Local Competition Order, paragraph 172, they

said what interconnection does is it lets the competitor

pick the place where they're going to drop the traffic

off.  But it is section (c)(3) that lets the competitor

say:  I'd prefer to use incumbent facilities at TELRIC

rates to get to that point.

            They have made that very distinction.  But

what they're trying to do through their amicus brief

here is to turn (c)(2) into a facilities leasing

provision.

            Now, again, we don't think this Court needs

to say that they could never have promulgated a rule

with reasons that would get you there, but they've never

done it.  If they had done it, we would have had the

opportunity to seek judicial review.  They would have

had to explain themselves.  We've never had that

opportunity.

think it's important, when they put out these sentences

though, in their notice of proposed rulemaking, they

said, should we get rid of entrance facilities under

(c)(3)?  They didn't say, and if we do, what would that

mean for (c)(2)?  They didn't ask the question.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought they said,

moreover, that they were not amending (c)(2),

specifically.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's exactly right.  In

the orders themselves, they assured AT&T and others that

they weren't changing anything with regard to (c)(2).

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But there are -- there are

cases, I think, in primary jurisdiction where what a

district court has done, anyway, is to hold the case

while the ICC went and had a proceeding.  And I'm sure

that hasn't been used in a long time.

invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction; we're not

going to do it; instead, we will adopt an interpretation

of the statute that will suffice for the purposes at

hand.  And as the Court later recognized in Brand X,

that leaves it open to the agency, in a rulemaking, to

actually do the work that, as Justice Scalia noted, the

agency has never done here.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  -- and a chance --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I guess the problem I'm

having is that you tell me on the one hand that up

until, what, 2005, you were always paying the cost plus

profit rates, the TELRIC's rates, for interconnection at

a -- at an entrance facility.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's not quite right,

Justice Sotomayor.  Up until 2005, companies like Talk

America were allowed to get both the actual physical

linking at TELRIC rates and the transport facility at

TELRIC rates, but under two separate statutory

provisions.  They were getting the transport facility

under (c)(3); that's gone away.  They were getting the

linking under (c)(2).

            Now, there were other companies like

wireless carriers.  They were getting the linking at

TELRIC rates under (c)(2), but they were paying full

freight for the transport, because they have never been

allowed to get unbundled network elements.  So, this

notion that there's going to be a price increase to

wireless carriers is a fiction.

            But what -- so, competitors were doing two

things under two provisions.  One of those has gone

away.  And it was only after it went away that anybody

raised this notion that maybe that transport facility

had always been required under (c)(2) also.  But that's

nothing the commission has ever done in a rulemaking.

            It never did that in the proper way in the

Triennial Review Order or the Triennial Review Remand

Order.  As Justice Scalia noted, it assured AT&T and

other incumbents that it wasn't changing the law.  When

it published things in the Federal Register, which is

where it's supposed to publish substantive rules, it

identified specifically the elimination of entrance

facilities as unbundled network elements, and said not a

word about any continued duty to provide them under

section --

Official

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it did in its

footnotes.  It said -- that's what the whole dispute is

about, which is we're not changing the obligation to

provide interconnection services.  So, it said it

clearly.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  It -- it said it --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Its view --

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  -- but then the question,

Justice Sotomayor, is:  Well, what was that obligation?

And the government concedes in footnote 6 that prior to

making those statements, it had never interpreted that

obligation to include the duty to lease that transport

facility.  It claims the question never came up because,

while it was an unbundled element, it didn't matter.

            Now, I think it's quite telling that while

it was an unbundled element and we were having 10 years

of litigation about what the right standard is for an

unbundled element, nobody even thought to say:  By the

way, all of this litigation is beside the point with

respect to the use of these facilities when we attach

them to an interconnection point.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The Eighth Circuit's

decision would have been unnecessary and the revision of

the rule?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Exactly, Justice Scalia.

It's very strange that no -- I mean -- and I think from

the fact that nobody thought to say it comes to what we

view has happened, is that this is a rear-guard effort

to preserve TELRIC pricing for things that the

commission has said should no longer be available as

TELRIC -- at TELRIC pricing.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe the commission didn't

like the Eighth Circuit's decision.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  I -- I think it's probably

a fair statement that the commission does not like the

decisions vacating its unbundling rules, but

nonetheless, that's what happened, and the new rules get

rid of this element.

            Again, what the Michigan commission found

was that the FCC had specifically determined that there

is a leasing obligation under (c)(2).  That never

happened.  The Sixth Circuit was right about that.

There is no leasing obligation that the commission has

ever established.

            I think, Justice Breyer, to go back to your

question, whether they could do it is a separate

question.  I don't think they could.  I think we have an

incredibly good chance to prevail if they were to ever

promulgate such a rule, but they never did it.  They

said things directly to the contrary.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  It all didn't matter

because, in fact, they got the TELRIC rates under (c)(3)

until they changed the impairment part?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Right.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So, who cared?  And now

after that, they care.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  Right, they care.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And now -- now -- now the

other side cares, of course.  And so, now -- now we're

faced with a situation where they're just putting this

in the brief for the first time, but they can't base it

on anything the commission actually did?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  That's exactly right.  And

if the commission had actually --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Amd I'm glad it's right

because I don't know what I'm talking about.

            (Laughter.)

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  I'm glad -- I'm glad we're

at least agreeing with each other, Justice Breyer.

But -- and I think that really is the key administrative

law point here, is that if the agency in the Triennial

Review Order or Triennial Review Remand Order had

actually said what they say in their brief, we never had

occasion to consider this question before.  Now we're

considering it, and here is why we think it's

appropriate to read (c)(2) to impose leasing.

            And despite the fact that, you know --

again, the commission claims that the statute's

ambiguous.  They'd need a policy reason why it's

appropriate to read this ambiguous statute to require

TELRIC pricing for things that third parties are

actually investing in and selling at marketplace rates,

why it's appropriate to undercut those third-party

business models with this TELRIC pricing for something

the competitors can and are building themselves, third

parties are selling --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we accept their

policy arguments, what does that do to your main

argument?

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  I --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because I think they've

explained it to my satisfaction why this is necessary

because (c)(2) requires interconnection.  Congress has

made a judgment that interconnection is the mainstay of

competition in this area.  So, if I accept that --

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  With due respect, Justice

Sotomayor, I don't think they've made that policy claim

here, and in particular this is not a case about whether

interconnection is going to occur.

            Competitors and wireless carriers are

picking their points of interconnection.  They are

interconnecting today.  They have been doing it.  And

wireless carriers never had TELRIC priced transport

facilities, and yet they're interconnected.  Competitors

in nearly a dozen States that have addressed this issue

and disagreed with Michigan and agreed with the Sixth

Circuit are interconnecting today using their own

facilities, using third-party facilities.  And when they

come to AT&T and say we'd like to plug our facility into

this point, AT&T says, absolutely, and does the work

necessary to get those two things connected.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't say it that

happily.  It really doesn't.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  You're right.  It

certainly --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, okay.

            MR. ANGSTREICH:  It's -- it's an imposition

on AT&T.  But the notion that in any way, shape, or form

the price of the cable will alter the interconnection of

telephone networks is simply false.  Yes,

interconnection is an important policy, and Congress

said we have to provide it at points within our networks

selected by competitors.  And we do that.

            But Congress didn't say, and the FCC has

never said, that we also have to provide them whatever

it is that they want to use to get to that point.  And

there really is -- and I think some of the questioning

pulled that out, though they want to say I think because

the Government won't endorse the absolute position the

Petitioners were taking in their opening briefs, that

this is only about things that used to be ordered as

unbundled elements or things already in the ground.

            But their position, their interpretation of

the statute has no stopping point.  It would cover

anything a competitor might ever want to use to get

telephone calls to the interconnection point.  And

they've never defended that limitless reading.  And if

the agency ever wanted to adopt it, we would challenge

it.  And as I've said, I like our chances, but until

they do it, Michigan was wrong to conclude that the

commission had done it, and the Sixth Circuit was

correct to reject that.

            If there are no further questions, I'll sit

down.

            MR. BURSCH:  Your Honors, everything you

heard in the last 30 minutes is premised on the idea

that the FCC is doing something new and that there was

never a promulgated regulation.  That is demonstrably

false.

            If you turn with me to page 32a of the red

brief, this is the FCC's regulation, promulgated all the

way back in 1996, which defined the scope of the (c)(2)

interconnection obligation.  It's 47 CFR 51.321.  And

this goes directly to the points that Justice Sotomayor

was making.

            On page 32a, the FCC says that an incumbent

must provide interconnection at a particular point upon

a request by a telecommunications carrier, such as a

competitor.  "Technically feasible methods" -- this is

in sub (b) -- "include, but are not limited to" -- and

they give two examples:  collocation and meet points.

But this isn't the be-all-end-all of interconnection

obligations.  These are exemplary.

            To take an analogy, assume you had a high

school cafeteria, and the school board said you have to

provide vegetables to students when they ask for them,

and you have to give them the vegetable that they ask

for; those include broccoli and green beans.  And they

don't say anything else.  Then you have a separate

obligation in (c)(3), and the school board says until we

see that the kids have enough nutrition, you must give

them peas.  That's entrance facilities unbundled under

(c)(3).

            So, some time goes by, and the school board

says, okay, the kids are getting enough peas; we're

going to wipe away that second restriction, but the

initial restriction, the obligation in 321, is still

there; and if a student asks for peas, it's within the

scope of 321 because broccolis and green beans were

representative examples, and peas are another one.  And

that's where entrance facilities fit.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why did they fight the

Eighth Circuit litigation?  Why did -- I mean, it --

you're telling me it made no difference whether (c)(3)

allowed them to do what they wanted to do and what the

Eighth Circuit said they couldn't do, right?

            MR. BURSCH:  The premise -- no, that's

incorrect, Your Honor, because if you have an entrance

facility under (c)(3), you can use it for more things

than you can under (c)(2) because under (c)(3) you can

have it for backhauling and still get TELRIC rates.

Under (c)(2), you're limited to interconnection.  So,

it's a different question.

            But the idea that somehow the FCC can --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Very slightly different.

That's not that big a deal.

            MR. BURSCH:  Backhauling is a big deal to

competitors.  And so, to say that they did something new

in the TRRO is wrong.  And to prove that point, if you

look at the comments --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Incidentally, where do

you -- where do you get that backhauling restriction

from?

            MR. BURSCH:  The backhauling --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, yes.  The --

            MR. BURSCH:  From the TRO and the TRRO, and

the FCC discussed that distinction in the Sixth Circuit

briefing at pages 6 to 7.  So, this isn't anything new,

either.

            So, the fact that this is not something new

is demonstrated conclusively by comments in the TRRO

proceedings from Bell South, which is now an AT&T

subsidiary.  And Bell South says, at page 59 of its

comments, fully recognizing the obligation that went all

the way back to 1996 in reg 321:  Because entrance

facilities may be required for interconnection purposes

and Congress explicitly enacted provisions that govern

carrier obligations to provide interconnection in

251(c)(2), it was altogether reasonable for the

commission to exclude these network elements from a

definition of ILEC dedicated transport intended for

unbundled access under 251(c)(3).

            So, even incumbent carriers knew what the

FCC was doing in paragraph 140 of the TRRO, and there

was nothing new there.

            One other small point with respect to the

Network Engineers' map.  This entrance facility right

here on page 19 already exists.  We're talking about

existing facilities.  And it's true, as the Sixth

Circuit said, that if the point of interconnection is

here at the ILEC switch, then that's where

interconnection takes place, and this entrance facility

is -- is truly providing transport, not interconnection.

            But when a competitive carrier chooses its

own switch as the point of interconnection, this is the

end of the AT&T entrance facility, then interconnection

takes place there.  And even in the Sixth Circuit's

view, that entrance facility is interconnection under

(c)(2).  And as Congress has said, that's the obligation

that is immutable because it is so important,

fundamental to competition.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

            The case is submitted.
