 (10:04 a.m.) 

 This case is here from the Sixth Circuit, 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDRA T. SCHIMMER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

1
2
3
4  first this morning in Case 11-218, Tibbals v. Carter.
5
6
7
8
9  please the Court:
10
11  which held that habeas claims can be stayed indefinitely 
12  because prisoners have a statutory right to competence 
13  to assist in their case, but even Mr. Carter now disowns 
14  the circuit's rationale, and the court's indefinite stay 
15
16
17  indefinitely.  Doing so is fundamentally incompatible 
18  with the timeliness concerns underlying AEDPA. 
19
20
21  this is not one of them.  All of Mr. Carter's claims are 
22  record based and, therefore, resolvable without his 
23  assistance. 
24
25

 Second, while we readily acknowledge that 
limited stays will be appropriate in some situations, 

order was wrong for two other reasons. 

 First, habeas claims cannot be stayed 

 Ms. Schimmer. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  What situations would they 

be appropriate in?

Alderson Reporting Company

 So here, for instance, we think that the 

 We don't think that the prisoner's 

to his claim.  And we think that would be true in a 

therefore, even a limited stay would not be appropriate 
because all of Mr. Carter's claims were vetted before 
the state courts and decided on the merits.  And 
therefore, under 2254(d), in this Court's decision in 
Pinholster, the Federal court is limited to reviewing 
the state court record. 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  Limited stays, we think, Your 
1
2  Honor, would be stay -- appropriate in situations where 
3  the prisoner's ability to effectively communicate with 
4  his counsel or to disclose evidence would be necessary 
5
6  case, potentially, where AEDPA does not restrict Federal 
7  review to the state court record. 
8
9  prisoner's assistance would not be necessary, and 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  assistance in that case is necessary.  We don't think 
18  Mr. Carter has made a case for why his assistance would 
19  be necessary in this specific case.
20
21  the rule be that an indefinite stay is -- is never 
22  necessary?  You just proceed based on the evidence you 
23  have? 
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, why -- why shouldn't 

 Sometimes, we have evidence where a witness 

is missing.  We have to go on with the case.  Then it 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And we do not think that it comports with 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  Well, we absolutely agree,
 

appropriate, regardless of the circumstances; that 

these cases, that power is grounded in equitable 
discretion. 

1  could be open to argue in a later case that there was
 
2  new evidence that was not available.
 
3
4  Justice Kennedy, that indefinite stays are never
 
5
6  indefinite stays contravene AEDPA's timeliness concerns. 
7  And to the extent that all of the parties in this case 
8  agree now that, to the extent district courts have some 
9  power to issue stays -- we say only limited stays -- in 
10
11 
12
13  equitable discretion to allow a prisoner essentially to 
14  win his case, to obtain a suspension of his capital 
15
16
17  of -- of the equation?  So, suppose that there's no 
18  stay, that the habeas proceeding is adjudicated against 
19  the petitioner.  He then becomes competent and claims 
20
21  reopen, you think? 
 MS. SCHIMMER:  Well, we think in those 
22
23  situations -- certainly, the State of Ohio wouldn't 
24  contest, for instance, under 2254(b), that if you were 
25

there's new evidence.  Would -- would that be grounds to 

sentence, the ultimate end relief that he seeks --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What about the second part 

incompetent before, that that would be a legitimate 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And would the backstop be 

newly discovered evidence? 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  The backstop would be a newly 

1  basis, potentially, for not having been able to 
2  reasonably discover a new claim, if one had a new claim. 
3
 So we do think that -- moving forward, that 
4  no indefinite stay should be permitted.  And when the 
courts move forward, yes, if someone's competency is 
5
6  later restored, there are backstops.  The person, 
7  certainly in Ohio, can always go back to state court 
8  and --
9
10
11
12  discovered claim, I would say.  I think that would be 
13  what --
14
15
16  circumstances, we would never reach the question of how 
17  much of a stay is appropriate in other circumstances; 
18  isn't that right? 
19
20
21  springboard, the Court could draw the boundary line --
22  could -- could draw one bright boundary line and say 
23  indefinite stays are never permitted, but limited stays 
24  might be permitted in cases where the claims are not 
25

I think -- to the extent that, using this case as a

right that no stay was appropriate in these

one bright line, which says that stays are not 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  Oh. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  In other words, if there was 

1
2  opposite. 
3
4
5
6  appropriate in a record-based claim because there's 
7  really nothing that the client can contribute, then we'd 
8  have no need or cause to reach the second question of 
9  what happens, in a case where a stay might be 
10
11
 MS. SCHIMMER:  That's correct, Your Honor. 
12  I'm sorry, I agree -- I agree with you that the Court 
13  could rule on that ground. 
14
15
16  appropriate; in which case, it would be unnecessary to 
17  decide whether any stay is appropriate where -- for a 
18  record-based claim, right?

 MS. SCHIMMER:  I suppose, yes.  I mean, we 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Am I -- am I 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  That is not our argument, 

 It sounds like what you are proposing -- or 

determining competence, whether it's short or long, is 
permissible.  Is that your argument? 

1
2  would -- we would -- we would urge the Court to, I 
3  think, do both, to say --
4
understanding that your position, in response to the 
5
6  question from Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, is 
7  that, for you, indefinite is any stay whatsoever? 
8
9  in response to them, is that no stay for purposes of 
10
11 
12

14  indefinite stay is a stay that is imposed until the

18
19  Rees, or, really, like the stay the Sixth Circuit has

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You would have to -- to 
22  maintain your position, the Court would have to qualify

incompetent because that's what has happened there.  The

 There are multiple reasons why we -- why we 

 One is the fact that the Court's stay order 

think that Rees does not endorse the power of Federal 

1  court said, find out if he's competent.  The answer was, 
2  he is incompetent.  And then the court just let it sit 
3  until the man died. 
4
 MS. SCHIMMER:  Well, Your Honor, we don't 
think that Rees really has any force or provides any 
5
6  guidance in this case.  That, of course, was a case 
7  where a prisoner was seeking to abandon his further 
8  appeals. 
9
10
11  courts to indefinitely stay habeas proceedings. 
12
13  was completely unexplained and very terse.  It didn't 
14  announce any rule of law.
15
16  Court's stay in Rees was, at most, a judicially 
17  negotiated settlement, meaning far from a demonstration 
18  of the Court's inherent power.  It seemed to be a very 
19  carefully orchestrated exercise of consented-to power.
 The third point is that --
20
21
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I could take objection 
22  to that characterization because the clerk of the court 
23  told the court that neither party was happy with what 
24  was happening, and the court still entered the order.
25

 Second, the historical record shows that the 

 But let me go back to my question a moment.

of stays? 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But under your 

definition, it's never appropriate, really. 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  For -- not in -- not where 

1  Amici say that most competency issues are resolved 
2  within months and that many individuals -- the vast 
3  majority, are restored to competency with proper 
4  medication within months.  Are you opposing those kinds 
5
6
7  it's appropriate, no, Your Honor.  And again, Your 
8  Honor, our definition of an indefinite stay is --
9
10
 MS. SCHIMMER:  No. 
11
12
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You argue -- you argue 
13  two things.  You say, under Pinholster, they -- courts 
14  always have to rely on the record.
15
16  how we would taxonomize the appropriateness of stays: 
17  We would say indefinite stays are never permitted, 
18  meaning a court can never premise a stay exclusively on 
19  the restoration of the prisoner's competency, in saying 
20
21
22  says, it can be done, we have to try? 
23
24  can be done, we have to try, and it's a situation where 
25

 MS. SCHIMMER:  Correct.  We would -- here's 

however long it takes --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even though a doctor 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  If -- if a doctor says, it 

it's appropriate --

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, they can never
 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that's also --

 MS. SCHIMMER:  Right.  So we would say, in 

1
2  say, it can be done.  They can say --
3
 MS. SCHIMMER:  Right.
 
4
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- we have to try.

 MS. SCHIMMER:  There is a reasonable 
5
6  probability that it can be done.  We would say, 
7  Your Honor --
8
9  I'm not sure how they can do that until they try.
10
11  certain situations, yes, that would be perfectly 
12  appropriate. 
13
14  having a competent prisoner is a desirable thing in a 
habeas case and that courts do have some discretion to 
15
16  try to vindicate that goal. 
17
18  come at all cost, meaning --
19
20
21
22
23  proceeded.  There -- there was going to be an end, 
24  right?
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Rees -- Rees was not an 
indefinite stay in -- in the absolute sense, was it? 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  No. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because the trial 

 The State of Ohio certainly agrees that 

 Our point, though, is simply that it cannot 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  Well, the court -- the court

 He comes back in 6 months, and there's been 

1  in the end held up the cert petition for several decades 
2  without deciding the case.  So -- and in the end, 
3  Mr. Rees died and then the cert petition was ultimately 
4  later dismissed.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't understand 
5
6  how your approach works.  We, the defendant, the habeas 
7  petitioner, the allegation is made, I'm incompetent, 
8  there is support for it.  The district court says, okay, 
9  I can't enter an indefinite stay, but you are going to 
be treated; I want you to come back in 6 months, okay? 
10
11 
And we will look at it then. 
12
13  no change.  What happens then?  Another 6 months?  At 
14  what point does it become indefinite?
15
16  playing on the field of equitable discretion, 
17  Your Honor, it's going to be difficult to put forward a 
18  hard and fast rule. 
19
20
21 
22
23
24
25

 (Laughter.) 
 MS. SCHIMMER:  Sure.  A loose and soft rule. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it two years?  Or 

 But Justice Sotomayor rightly points --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, give me a 

loose and soft rule.  I mean, is it --

 MS. SCHIMMER:  Right.  Well, since we are 

is it ten years? 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Schimmer, why 

 So we think, presumptively, a year would be 

1
2  a year.  And we think there is support for that, even 
3  from Mr. Carter's own amici.  The brief of the American 
4  Psychiatric Association, pages 19 to 21, and especially 
footnote 30, talks about how most prisoners who are 
5
6  ultimately successfully restored to competency, that 
7  does happen in a matter of months, 6 to 9 months at the 
8  longest end.  About 90 percent of them are restored 
9  within 6 to 9 months.
10
11  an appropriate period of time for --
12
13  would that be?  I mean, assume a case where you say a 
14  stay would be appropriate.  So it's not a closed record 
case.  It's a case where the client might be expected to 
15
16  provide information that's -- let's -- let's assume it's 
17  necessary to a full and fair adjudication of the habeas 
18  claim. 
19
20
21  fair adjudication couldn't take place in those 
22  circumstances. 
23
24  at the point at which you say that the test for a 
limited stay is however long it takes to restore 
25

 Why would you cut it off at a year?  Why 
wouldn't it be still true in 2 years, that a full and 

Official 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  We would say, presumptively, 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  Well, we think, Your Honor, 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

participation is necessary for a full and fair 
adjudication, then the court's answer should be the 
same, too.  Why isn't that right? 

1  somebody's competency is the point at which we have 
2  returned to the definition of saying that indefinite 
3  stays are proper. 
4
 And the bottom line is that we think that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it's not an indefinite 
5
6  stay.  I think the judge would do what the Chief Justice 
7  suggested, that -- you know, it's not for ever and ever. 
8  We're just going to come back to it periodically.  But 
9  if the answer is the same, which is that the client's 
10
11 
12 
13
14  there comes a point, given the finality concerns 
underlying AEDPA, that a limited stay, when that window 
15
16  expires -- the person has a reasonable period of time to 
17  be restored to competency; that when that window 
18  expires, at some point, the proceedings do have to 
19  continue.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's really -- it's 
20
21  really not the same question when it comes back, is it? 
22  Because there are two questions:  Is -- is reasonable 
23  competence useful for his defense?  But, also, the 
24  second question, is there a reasonable probability that 
25

 MS. SCHIMMER:  Because we do think that 

he can be restored to competence? 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

probability. 

 MS. SCHIMMER:  That's exactly right, 

 The first time, there obviously is that, and 
1
2  you give him a year.  When you come back a second time, 
3  you say, well, it's been a year, they usually come back 
4  within 6 to 9 months, there is no longer a reasonable 
5
6
7  Justice Scalia.  And to the extent that we are balancing 
8  different parties' interests in these cases, after the 
9  preliminary limited stay expires, we believe at that 
point the prisoner's interest in a continued stay has 
10
11 
diminished, and the state's interest in the proceedings 
continuing and moving forward has then increased, and 
12 
13 
that the court should then move on. 
14
15
16  claim, so that would be a threshold question. 
17
18  question, and there seems to be a good amount of 
19  consensus on that point.  It's the test articulated by 
the Sixth and Ninth Circuits and by my colleague here 
20
21  today.  And we're -- we're willing to accept that as the 
22  test for when limited stays can be imposed. 
23
24  questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time.
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And there'd be no stay at 
all, unless it's necessary for just adjudication of the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT MICHELMAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. MICHELMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

stays issue and how long may such stays be? 

 Ohio and the United States have agreed today 

1
2
3
4
5
6
7  that courts have the authority to stay habeas 
8  proceedings when the petitioner is mentally incompetent. 
9  So then the questions for this Court are when may such 
10
11
 The Court's answers should reflect the 
12  important principle that no individual should lose 
13  potentially meritorious claims because of mental 
14  illness.
15
16
17  won't because they can come back with new evidence after 
18  habeas is closed.  Why is that inadequate? 
19
20
21  Justice Kennedy asked as well, and -- and it goes to the 
22  limits on second or successive petitions.  They can't 
23  come back if they are later competent, if they first 
24  lose their claims, because they didn't have the evidence 
25

 MR. MICHELMAN:  I -- I think that's --
that's a crucial question, Justice Sotomayor, that 

 I'd like to begin by addressing --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Petitioner says they 

it please the Court: 

they needed and then try again later.

 They are subject to the bar on second or

 MR. MICHELMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, 

Section 2244(b), the bar on second or successive 

1
2  successive petitions, which requires, not only that they 
3  have new facts, but also that they have new law.  So 
4  that's a very restrictive standard that would not allow

14  his incompetence, it's adjudicated without him, he loses

 MR. MICHELMAN:  Imagine it's adjudicated 
18
19  without him, he loses it.  And then he can't simply 
20
21  hear me out.

24  defendant who was excluded from trial, correct?
25

 MR. MICHELMAN:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that if he comes back 

the old claim that has been adjudicated, correct? 

 MR. MICHELMAN:  Yes.  And, in fact, the --

the record lends some support to this suggestion by 

 MR. MICHELMAN:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But without his 

1
2  and says, I told my attorneys I would behave, and I 
3  wanted to come back earlier, and they never let me back 
4  in, this would not be a new claim, this would be part of

7
8  information?

10
11  showing that counsel frequently put their own safety and 
12  their own concerns ahead of my client's interests, for 
13  example, stating on the record -- and I'm quoting here 
14  from trial counsel -- "I am still worried about him 
behaving during this phase, so the bottom line is he 
15
16  wants to stay where he is."  So there is a question of 
17  whether trial counsel was -- was really looking out for 
18  Mr. Carter's interests at that time. 
19
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

 There's also the question of whether --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that, you could 
see from the record.  The question in my mind would be 
whether he told counsel he would behave, and counsel 
ignored that information, correct? 

 MR. MICHELMAN:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 

There is strong support in the record to suggest that

says now is there some new evidence, which could not 
have been discovered. 

1  Mr. Carter has additional information to provide, both 
2  about his desire to return to the courtroom and about 
3  his competence once he was removed from the courtroom. 
4  Was he hallucinating during the trial?  Could he see it? 
5

5
6  the petitioner had been -- if the petitioner was 
7  competent, the petitioner could provide a lot more 
8  information about what went on during his childhood 
9  years; and, therefore, the -- the proceeding has to be 
stayed indefinitely until the petitioner is restored to 
10
11 
confidence or he dies, as happened in Rees. 
12
13
14  district courts have a wide amount of discretion in that 
matter, and they could say, well, it looks like there is 
15
16  a little evidence here, but based on what I think you 
17  could tell me, I don't think there is enough. 
 Here, by contrast, the district court did

discretion of every individual district judge?

1  to provide it because he is incompetent, then I'm going

3  then that would be insulated from being overturned on

 And as this Court stated in Martinez, the

a capital case, a habeas petition is filed, and counsel 
says, my -- my client cannot -- cannot -- cannot assist 
me.  Oh, yes, he understands why he's being executed, 
but he may have a new claim, he may be able to tell me 
stuff, so we have to stay the execution indefinitely 
until he can assist -- assist me in -- in continuing his 
defense. 

 You've just converted the standard for 

much more difficult one. 

It's not -- it's not an either/or choice.

 Let's assume that the Ford standard -- the

lenient, less -- less forgiving than competence to

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  At least only -- only in 
12  cases where the competence -- the claim of incompetence 
13  is genuine.  I mean, if anyone says, oh, I want to

standard, all I have to do is allege I'm incompetent.

assistance of counsel at the habeas stage, but that

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But not this one because

9  the claim is he was never competent; isn't that so?  He

14  standard is he's got to be competent, the likelihood is 
15
16  according to him, competent at the time he was tried. 
17
 MR. MICHELMAN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  And 
18  this -- this would be a rare case in which a stay might

because most -- most situations, the competency issue

5
6  we set a standard that requires -- we can talk about 
7  what the terms are, suggestive in the record, plausible 
8  in the record, typical sort of situation -- but assuming 
9  that there is some basis to believe that the defendant 
can provide information of importance to the claim, why 
10
11  should that be -- that door be shut?

13
14  his answer that, if the claim is not a new claim, but 
15
16  barred from a successive petition? 
17
 MS. SCHIMMER:  Right.  Well, we still don't 
18  see how that has any traction in a case like this where, 
19  whether competent or not competent, 2254(d) and 
20
21  adjudicated on the merits in state court and, therefore,

 Thank you.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 (Whereupon, at 10:40 a.m., the case in the 

1  State of Ohio's experience in this case has been that 
2  the State of Ohio has been standing ready for 10 years 
3  to defend the judgment of its state courts in this case, 
4  even though all of Mr. Carter's claims are record based.
 There is no right to competence.  Everybody 
5
6  seems to now agree on that.  Indefinite stays contravene 
7  AEDPA, and we don't think that any stay is justified 
8  here because of the record-based claims.
