 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-591, Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts.

 (1:00 p.m.)

 Mr. Fisher.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In Crawford v. Washington, this Court made 

clear that the right to confrontation, at its core, is a 
protection against a system of trial by affidavit.  It 
is an ancient procedural guarantee that requires the 
prosecution to prove its case through live witnesses who 
testify before the jury and who are subject to 
cross-examination.

 Introducing forensic laboratory reports, 

such as the certificates at issue in this case, is the 
modern equivalent of trial by affidavit.  The documents 
are sworn formal statements.  They are crafted 
purposefully for the express purpose of proving a fact 
that is an element of a criminal offense, and, as the 
State forthrightly admits in its brief, they are 
introduced in lieu of having the analyst called as a 
witness to the stand.  They are therefore

quintessentially testimonial evidence.

 Massachusetts --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You say -- you say 

"the analyst."  I suppose it doesn't have to be the 
analyst but whoever they decide to call.  So if you had 
a supervisor who runs the cocaine testing lab and he is 
the one whose report is submitted, I take it he is the 
one who would have to show up.

 MR. FISHER:  That's right.  Our position --
our position is that whoever the Commonwealth wants to 
use to prove the fact that they are trying to prove is 
the person that needs to take the stand.  In this case, 
it would be the analyst.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but you would ask --

if a supervisor did it, what would you ask the 
supervisor?  You'd say, you know, did you -- did you do 
this?  Can you testify to your own knowledge that this 
is what the analysis showed?  And he would have to say, 
no, it was one of my subordinates who did it, but I can 
tell you he was a very reliable person.  How would that 
-- I don't understand how that would work.

 MR. FISHER:  I took the Chief Justice's 

hypothetical to be that the supervisor had actually done 
the testing, but if the supervisor had not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  No.  No.  No,

I'm saying that he would testify, I guess:  I run the 
lab, these are the people I hire, they know you how to 
do these tests, and this guy did the test.  And since he 
was the one that the Government decided to -- on whose 
affidavit they decided to rely, that's the only person 
you could get.

 Now, you could -- to impeach him, you say, 

well, did you do the test?  No.  But you say, well --
but I mean you don't have a right to an analyst at a 
particular level.

 MR. FISHER:  That's right.  There is no 

substantive right.  I think everything you've said is 
right as far as it goes.  It just depends what the 
Commonwealth wants to put in in terms of evidence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose --
MR. FISHER:  If they want to put in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the tests were by 
John Smith, assistant lab technician, and you call John 
Smith, and you say, "Is this your signature?"  "Yes." 
"Do you remember doing this test?"  And he says, "I do 
thousands of tests.  I don't remember.  I'll tell you 
the way I always do them."  I mean, is that what you 
want?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, if that's what -- at a 
minimum, that's what we want, Justice Kennedy.  This

Court has made clear in California --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's what you're 

usually going to get, isn't it?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, we don't know what we are 

going to get.  In some cases, unquestionably --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you know what you're 
going to get by looking, number one, at the States which 
allow this, where this happens all the time.  You know 
what you're going to get in the States where the 
defendant -- where the defense can subpoena the witness.

 Now, if there are new tests, complex DNA 
tests and so forth, I suppose there is a lot to ask 
about.  Standard blood alcohol, not much to ask about.
 MR. FISHER:  But even in a test where the 

analyst doesn't remember and, as you put it, it's a 
standardized test, there are still plenty of questions 
the defendant might want to ask, such as what test was 
performed?  We don't even know from the record what test 
was performed in this case.  What's the error rate on 
that test?  How do your protocols work?  What are your 
experience and credentials in analyzing those?  There's 
plenty of questions the defendant might ask.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You can raise all those 
questions from the fact of the -- from the document. 
Tell the jury, "This doesn't show what tests were

performed."  It's there on the document.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think that's a choice 
that defense counsel could make, as the defense counsel 
always has a choice in a criminal case to decide whether 
to press the prosecution's evidence or to simply stay 
silent and then later argue at closing the prosecution 
hasn't given you enough to prove the case.

 But to the extent the Commonwealth is taking 
the position that cross-examining would be fruitless in 
a situation like this, the very basis of this Court's 
Crawford decision is that's not for courts to decide. 
It is up to the defense counsel to -- if he wishes, to 
insist on live testimony that he can cross-examine and 
then --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then why -- why 
isn't it an adequate substitute to say that, if the 
defendant wants this testimony, the defendant can call 
the analyst and cross-examine the analyst as an adverse 
witness?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, three reasons, Justice 

Ginsburg:  First, if that were correct, then I don't see 
anything that would stop the prosecution in every 
criminal case simply from putting a pile of affidavits 
on a judge's desk and saying it's up to the defense to 
call whatever witnesses he wants and cross-examine them.

But even as a matter of text and structure 
of the Constitution, as a textual matter, the right to 
confrontation is a passive right in the defendant's 
hands.  It requires the prosecution to arrange for the 
confrontation, and that's bolstered structurally by the 
Compulsory Process Clause.  Remember, the Compulsory 
Process Clause gives the defendant the very right that 
you just explained, that the defendant can subpoena 
witnesses into court and ask them questions.  And surely 
the Confrontation Clause adds something on top of that.
 And I think this Court's decision in Taylor 

against Illinois is the best explanation of the 
difference between the two clauses.  This Court said 
that the Confrontation Clause arises simply by the 
nature of adversary proceedings, and it's a -- it's a 
rule that governs the way the prosecution must introduce 
its case.  As I said at the opening here, it's a 
requirement that the prosecution put its live witnesses 
on the stand for the jury to observe them.  The defense, 
of course, has the decision whether to cross-examine 
those witnesses, or if witnesses are not called by the 
prosecution that he would wish to be part of the case, 
he can subpoena them.  But we would vigorously oppose 
any attempt to shift the burden on the defense to call 
witnesses like this.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you would say that 

what they call the notice-and-demand type statute, that 
that's all right?

 MR. FISHER:  There is a variety of 

notice-and-demand type statutes, Justice Ginsburg, and I 
think the law professors' brief lays it out the best of 
what we have before you.  We agree with the Solicitor 
General that a plain notice-and-demand statute that 
requires the defense to do nothing more than assert his 
right in advance of trial to have the prosecution put a 
live witness on the stand would be constitutional, I 
think, under this Court's jurisprudence.  Under the 
Compulsory Process Clause, under the jury right, there 
are plenty of constitutional rights that, with fair 
notice, a Defendant can be required to assert in advance 
of trial.

 Now, there are other types of statutes that 

other States call "notice and demand" that require 
something more of the defendant, whether it be that the 
defendant himself call the witness, whether it be the 
defendant himself make some kind of good faith or prima 
facie showing in order to have the prosecution call the 
witness.  Those types of statutes, I think this Court, 
to the extent in this opinion it would mention 
notice-and-demand statutes, it would want to be careful

to leave for another day, because, again, we would agree 
with the Solicitor General that those would raise more 
difficult constitutional questions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In your answer, you said, 
well, there would be this stack of affidavits and that's 
all the State would have to do.  I think, Mr. Fisher, 
that was not quite responsive because the question here 
is whether or not there is an exception for business 
records.  Nobody is talking about affidavits, witnesses, 
and so forth.  We are talking about business records 
done in the ordinary course.

 It's true that it -- that the core principle 

is whether that confrontation is required, but the 
question is whether or not business records should be 
treated as something that are not testimony because they 
are done based on other protocols with other procedures 
where there is substantial insulation from the facts of 
the particular case because it's a routine scientific 
exercise.

 So I think your answer, I would agree, is 
responsive based on your theory of the case, but as a 
matter of practice and as a matter of the issue that's 
before the Court, I don't think it addresses it.

 MR. FISHER:  Okay.  Thank you.
 I -- I took Justice Ginsburg's question to

be asking whether giving the defendant the right to 
subpoena the witness would be adequate under the 
Confrontation Clause if these documents were 
testimonial.

 Now, your question is whether they might not 
be testimonial at all viewed through the lens of whether 
they are a business record.

 So, as a historical matter, I think it's 
plain that no documents prepared in contemplation of 
litigation were ever considered to be business records. 
And this Court's decision in Palmer v. Hoffman in 1943 I 
think lays that out very, very clearly.

 So there is no historical argument that 

business records would fit -- would be exempted from the 
testimonial rule as a class.  And, of course, this Court 
said in Crawford v. Washington that even if a State 
under a modern hearsay exception, whether it be a 
business-record rule or in the State of Massachusetts's 
case a special, brand-new hearsay rule -- just because 
that might be okay in the run-of-the-mill cases doesn't 
exempt it from the right to confrontation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but the railroad 

case was an accident report.  This is a scientific 
analysis.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think that is best

characterized, with all due respect, as an argument for 
its reliability.  And it may well be that judges and 
juries think that certain scientific processes yield 
more reliable results in terms of reports and testimony 
and assertions.  But we think, again -- and this Court's 
decision in Crawford says quite strongly -- that a judge 
cannot decide just on the basis of reliability to exempt 
a given record or a class of records from the 
Confrontation Clause.

 And I think, Justice Kennedy, another 

analogy that makes it even more clear is police reports. 
Police reports, just like the lab report in this case, 
are -- are sworn documents created by public servants 
who are sworn to tell the truth, sworn to find evidence 
whether it exonerates, whether it incriminates, and to 
write up a report.  And I don't think anyone has ever 
suggested that police reports describing a crime scene 
-- for example, no matter how objective the facts 
relayed, such as there is a blood stain on the carpet, 
there is -- the door was wide open when I got there --
those kinds of assertions would be exempted from the 
Confrontation Clause.

 It may well be that they are likely to be 
correct, that they are assertions of fact that can be 
verified, but we've never understood that to fall

outside of the ambit of the Confrontation Clause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if you had what we can 
call an independent lab, that certainly-- you certainly 
can distinguish that from a police report.  It's a 
line-drawing question, I'll admit, but I think it's 
easily distinguished.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think if you had -- in 
contrast to this case, if you had a laboratory that was 
a private lab being used by the police, that would raise 
the question whether police agents who are private 
individuals but -- but asked by the police to create 
something like this, would generate testimonial evidence 
just as well.  And I think the answer would be yes.

 In fact, in Davis this Court already 

addressed the situation, although it reserved in the 
footnote, but it assumed that the 911 operator in that 
case, who was a private individual working for a private 
company hired by the -- by the police --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Fisher, how many States 

do things the way -- the way you would have them done? 
I mean, how many States don't have these -- these notice 
laws, but in fact bring in the analyst to -- to give the 
information?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, let me give you a few 

categories, Justice Scalia.

There are six States, it is our 

understanding, including big populous States like 
California, Illinois and Georgia, that have no special 
hearsay law whatsoever, that bring in witnesses if 
defendants demand it.

 There is another category of States --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, they bring in 

witnesses if -- if defendants demand, but --

MR. FISHER:  I'm sorry, I misspoke.  I 

misspoke.  That in the ordinary course need to bring in 
witnesses.  Now, that was --getting ahead to my next --
my next category, there are at least nine or ten other 
States that have the kind of bland notice-and-demand 
regime that I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg.  And 
so that's another category.

 And then you have -- since Crawford there is 

another, I believe, five additional States where their 
State supreme courts have held that Crawford applies to 
lab reports like this.  So at least for the past couple 
of years they have been doing it the way that we would 
urge.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I wonder -- and correct me 
if I'm wrong -- if you -- if you didn't state your case 
strongly enough with reference to California.  I thought 
California followed the rule that you advocate here.

MR. FISHER:  That's what I meant to say if I 

didn't say it that way.  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there anything else?  I 

-- I think you're quite right that -- that, look, I 
can't find anything in the history that suggest lab 
reports would be admitted because they would be 
considered being prepared for trial.  But business 
records are kept out.

 So we have here a source that's unlikely to 
be particularly biased, the University of Massachusetts 
labs.  And we have the checks of the discipline, the 
scientific discipline.  On the other hand, it's being 
prepared for this trial.

 So it seems to me some things go one way; 

some things go the other way.  I don't know exactly what 
the predominant things are.  That's what I'd like you to 
address as much as possible.

 And when I look at the definition of 

"business records hearsay exception" today, it seems to 
me that the "hearsay exception" does cover today some of 
the things under "business records" that would be 
prepared particularly for trial.  You could have a 
company that goes and measures lines on the street, or 
tread marks, or a variety of things.  And I guess they 
come in under the "business records exception."  Do

they?  I mean, is that right?

 MR. FISHER:  They might, Justice Breyer, and 
I'd -- I'd be willing to assume for purposes of argument 
that they would.  But to the extent that they would be 
offered by the prosecution in a criminal case, the fact 
that they were a business record would not answer the 
confrontation question as to whether --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, of course, it 

wouldn't.

 MR. FISHER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's why -- and maybe 

you have nothing else you want to say on this point. 
It's the same as Justice Kennedy raised.

 MR. FISHER:  I think I do, Justice --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It seems like there are 
some things going one way, and some things going the 
other on the issue of whether to call it "testimonial."
 MR. FISHER:  But I do want to -- with all 
respect, I did want to add something to what you said 
about the rigors of the lab or of science.  It may well 
be that those add to the truth, the reliability of 
reports.  Let me say two things about that.

 First of all, the Confrontation Clause 

doesn't exempt bishops and nuns, or -- or anyone who we 
know or who we would think just as well would obviously

be telling the truth.  It's, again, for the defendant to 
decide and not for the court to decide whether 
cross-examination would be useful.

 But let me add to that, Justice Breyer, that 

the Innocence Project brief in this case and plenty of 
other sources widely available I think very, very, very 
persuasively explain that lab reports are not quite as 
reliable as we might want to think they are, and not --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There have been bad 

instances.  You are absolutely right.

 MR. FISHER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But what -- what I'm trying 
to work out in my mind is not necessarily what happened 
in the year 1084.  I'd -- I'd be quite interested in 
your views on what's a workable rule.  And when I look 
across the country on this, it seems most States have 
worked with a rule that has allowed the defendant to 
call the witness if he wants.  There is not a particular 
unfairness to that.  If he can get ahold of the witness, 
no problem.  But they said:  We are not going to make 
the State do this because it's a waste of time, for the 
most part.  It just delays the trial, and there is 
really nothing at issue.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, to the extent that is the 

prominent practice, it's one that grew up under this

Court's Roberts jurisprudence.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true.
 MR. FISHER:  I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But if I assume -- I'm 

really uncertain as to whether it has covered 
"testimonial" or not.  And also, I'm not enamored 
particularly of seeing on a close question what happened 
in ancient history.

 MR. FISHER:  I understand.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, is there 

anything else you want to add to me on those 
assumptions?

 MR. FISHER:  Yes, that -- that, again, it is 

-- it is not for the court; it's for the defendant to 
decide.  We think the definition of "testimonial" 
generally speaking ought to be that when a document is 
prepared in contemplation of prosecution, or more 
specifically in this case to prove a fact that is an 
element of a criminal case, because that's what these 
reports say, then they should fall under the 
Confrontation Clause.

 And to the extent that these are in some 

realms and in some places reliable pieces of evidence, 
there is every reason to believe it's not going to cause 
any problem, because defendants aren't going to want to

challenge them very often.  If you look at the 
statistics in the law professors' brief, they say in 
States like California that -- first of all, we have a 
huge category of cases that go away in plea bargains. 
And then even within the category of cases that go to 
trial, it's 10 percent of the time or less --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, a good defense 

lawyer would love to have the guy there.  The first 
thing you say is:  Do you remember testing Mr. Diaz's 
sample?  The guy is going to say no.  Just as was 
pointed out, I, you know, test thousands of samples. 
Well, how long have you been working with the lab?  You 
know, just what -- what was your scientific background? 
When did you -- how does this test work?  You put three 
drops of the acid in there.  It turns color, whatever it 
does.  How do you know that?  What is the chemical?  I 
mean, you spend three hours with the guy until the jury 
just doesn't think there is anything to the case at all.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, the best I can do to 

answer that, Mr. Chief Justice, is to say that 
empirically apparently that just doesn't happen.  And I 
think the reason why is explained in some of the defense 
manuals that we have cited in our brief, which say that 
if your theory of the case has nothing to do with 
whether the scientific report being introduced by the

prosecution is correct or not, very often the defense 
isn't going to do itself any favors by -- by insisting 
that that person take the stand, recite his credentials, 
recite the testing, and recite the damning evidence.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What does that fact support 
-- why does that fact support your argument, that in all 
of those cases you're arguing for what's going to be an 
empty exercise?

 MR. FISHER:  No, I would very much resist 

that it will always be an empty exercise.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  But in -- in the 

instance where the defendant doesn't think it would be 
worthwhile to subpoena the -- the recordkeeper, the 
person who performed the test, but simply wants to put 
the prosecution through the effort of getting the person 
there to testify, it's -- what is achieved?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, as I said, I think that 

through notice-and-demand regimes and stipulations, 
often that is not going to happen.  But if it is 
achieved, what is achieved is the same thing that is 
achieved in any criminal trial where a defendant insists 
periodically that the prosecution be put to its proof.

 After all, we are talking about putting 

somebody away for many years in a typical --

point.  So that - all right, go back to the plea 
bargaining, which is your first thing, which makes me a 
little nervous for the reason that I see this bargaining 
system as a system where the prosecutor makes a charge, 
the prosecutor controls the sentence, then the defense 
bar would like to have an added weapon, and this added 
weapon is if you actually go to trial, I'm going to 
insist that you call these people.  You don't even know 
where they are.  I'm not going to accept the lab report. 
And then maybe the prosecutor will lower the requirement 
or maybe the prosecutor raised it in the first place 
because he thought you would say something like that.

 So I'm not -- is there anything you can say 
about how this works in the presence of plea bargaining? 
Do we know any -- do we have any information on that?

 MR. FISHER:  I don't know of any empirical 

study where you might say what the price of this is.  Of 
course, it happens already every day with other 
witnesses.  You're going to have to bring in other 
witnesses, and this is one more witness.  But again, 
even in a case where that's all that's going on, it's no 
different than all the other legal rights the defendant 
has.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not sure it's one more 

witness.  Labs are backed up with DNA.  You know, the

Federal budget for the courts, for the Federal courts, 
is $6 billion.  Well, $1 billion of that is spent under 
the Criminal Justice Act for experts and translators and 
counsels.  This -- this is a very, very substantial 
burden if we tell every State in the country that 
every -- in every drug case you are -- the State must 
produce the expert.

 MR. FISHER:  Remember, Justice Kennedy, 

that -- that if you look at the States where this 
exists, that's not what happens and that's not what we 
are insisting on.  All we are insisting is that the 
prosecution in a case where the defendant demands it, 
whether it be through a notice and demand regime or 
whether it be because the prosecution simply calls the 
defense on the phone two weeks before trial and says, 
I'd like to do this through documentary evidence -- and 
then these repeat players remember who -- who -- one 
thing I think it's worth keeping in mind in all this, is 
that in the criminal justice system, by and large, 
especially in drug cases like this, we are talking about 
repeat players.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're talking about 

the defendants or the lawyers?

(Laughter.)
 MR. FISHER:  -- by and large, Your Honor. 
They have every -- they have incentives not to, as you 
might say, yank the chain of the other side.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Fisher, I am interested 

in the history since that's what the Court held in 
Crawford, that the content of the Confrontation Clause 
is not what we would like it to be, but what it 
historically was when it was enshrined in the 
Constitution.  As a matter of history, was there a 
business records exception, not from the hearsay rule 
but from the Confrontation Clause?

 MR. FISHER:  Not that I'm aware of.  The 
best -- the best source that I believe exists is the 
Wigmore treatise, which both sides have cited.  It says 
there was a shop-book rule that allowed shop-book 
ledgers and entries at the common law.  But there is 
no -- there's no suggestion that that was --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why isn't that a business 

records exception?  I don't --

MR. FISHER:  It is a business records 

exception, but it's not an exception to the right to 
confrontation because no one would have considered 
ordinary business records created without contemplation 
of litigation to be -- to be testimonial evidence.  What

we have here --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, wait.  You say it's --

that business records would often or usually not be 
testimonial?

 MR. FISHER:  I think all of the business 

records that were admissible at the time of the founding 
would have been nontestimonial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would have been 

nontestimonial.  So they'd come in on that basis, not 
because they were business records?

 MR. FISHER:  In a criminal case -- well, the 
typical regime -- and I'm going to assume that it exists 
at the time of founding, but you need some evidentiary 
rule to get a piece of evidence in in the first place, 
whether it be business records or whether it be just an 
ordinary rule of relevance.  But, yes, they would have 
been admissible at the time of -- ordinary business 
record like a shop book would have been admissible at 
the time of the founding, but would have not raised a 
confrontation problem even in a criminal cause because 
it would have been nontestimonial.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Fisher, I just want to 
be about -- clear about one thing.  We are talking about 
drug cases primarily.  But the rule that we are fighting 
about is not limited to drugs.  Doesn't it apply to

laboratory reports on DNA, blood tests, all sorts of 
evidence?  Isn't that correct?

 MR. FISHER:  That's right, Justice Stevens. 
And you can you look at the Massachusetts own decisions. 
The State courts in Massachusetts already extended their 
rule in their day to ballistics tests, for example, 
which are notoriously unreliable in terms of empirical 
studies that have been -- that have been conducted about 
them.  And my understanding -- I think you're right --
is that nothing in the Commonwealth's rule distinguishes 
one kind of forensic report from another.

 The United States is offering a slightly 

different analysis that appears to ask, to some degree, 
the degree of interpretation involved in a given 
forensic laboratory report.  I don't know how you would 
administer that rule, but I can say that to whatever 
extent interpretation would be required, this is clearly 
on the interpretive side of the ledger.

 And again, if I could point the Court to a 

source for that, the Scientific Evidence treatise by 
Giannelli and Imwinkelried that the both parties cite at 
section 23.030(c) lays out the mass spectrometry way of 
testing for drugs that the Commonwealth tells you was 
the test used in this case and describes in great detail 
the amount of expertise, care, skill and interpretive

methods that need to be brought in that kind of a test.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do we know that 

this was prepared in contemplation of litigation?  I 
mean, let's suppose the lab occasionally does analyses 
for other -- research purposes.  They get a sample, they 
want to know what it's -- they want to test it, however 
they do it.  Are we just assuming that it's prepared in 
contemplation of litigation because it usually is, or --
you can imagine a situation where the analyst really has 
no idea, other than perhaps supposition, why he is being 
asked to test the sample.

 MR. FISHER:  The easiest answer in this 

case, Mr. Chief Justice, is it's required by 
Massachusetts law that -- that these tests be done in 
contemplation of prosecution.  The law itself says that 
the police officer can give it to an analyst, and the 
analyst can certify a report if it's to be used for law 
enforcement purposes.  So there is a statutory 
requirement.  Now, you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the question 
is it could be law enforcement purposes to test it for 
the police to use and educational programs that want the 
rookies to know what the cocaine looks like.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, to the degree it's not 

answer ed in this case by statute, undoubtedly this

Court as it works through this jurisprudence will need 
to ask a question of common sense, whether the actors 
involved -- as this Court did in Davis -- whether the 
actors involved would understand what they are doing is 
creating evidence for a criminal case?

 If there are no more questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- I'm sorry.  Go 

ahead.

 MR. FISHER:  Okay.  I'll reserve my time.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I -- may I just ask, 

you would extend this to a -- a breath test, a blood 
test, fingerprints, urinalysis?  All of those would be 
covered by your position?

 MR. FISHER:  To the extent that the 

prosecution wanted to introduce a report certifying a 
reporting result of a test, yes, it would be covered by 
ours.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you answered the 
question that a supervisor wouldn't be an adequate 
substitute for the analyst.  But suppose the lab says: 
We are very busy in this place; could we schedule a 
deposition; we'll present the analyst at a time mutually 
agreeable to both sides, rather than have the analyst on 
the hook to show up on a trial date?

MR. FISHER:  That would work to preserve the 

evidence in case the analyst became unavailable at the 
time of trial.  And then under this Court's 
jurisprudence that deposition would be admissible.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But only if the analyst 

wasn't there on the day of trial?

 MR. FISHER:  Then you -- then I don't think 

it would substitute for live testimony.

 But let me say one other way that this 

problem can be addressed by States is that they could 
have a supervisor take the stand and rely on raw data --
on raw data and give his or her explanation of raw data. 
It's just that the person cannot take the stand and 
relay somebody else's conclusion to the jury.

 And if there are no more questions, I'll 

reserve.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Fisher.  We'll give you your full rebuttal time.

covered by the Confrontation Clause.  That is, they are 
not the statement of a percipient witness who has 
observed past behavior of the defendant.

 Indeed, what they are are official records 

of objective identified -- it's independently verifiable 
facts that are -- that were admissible at common law.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  What is your answer to 

Mr. Fisher's argument that if that proposition of yours 
is -- is -- is, in fact, sound in response to this case, 
the State can put in its entire case by -- in a 
circumstantial evidence case, by way of affidavit and, 
in effect, satisfy the Confrontation Clause by saying, 
well, you can call the witness as part of the defense 
case and cross-examine there?

 MS. COAKLEY:  Because clearly, the kinds of 
affidavits that are the subject of Confrontation Clause 
analysis could not be submitted by that.  I think this 
is an exception to that.  And so --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, then that's what you 

have got to explain to me.  Why is it an exception?

 MS. COAKLEY:  Because first of all, although 

the Court has not addressed it so far with Mr. Fisher, 
these are really not testimonial statements.  None of 
the cases that have dealt with Confrontation Clause 
analysis -- before Ohio, through Ohio, through in fact

Giles -- deal with the kind of statement that we are 
talking about here.  It's really a report of a scientist 
test.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, what about the -- the 

blue car going down the street statement?  In a 
circumstantial evidence case the witness comes in and 
says yes, I saw a blue car go down the street at 10 
o'clock.  Is that testimonial?

 MS. COAKLEY:  It is, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And the distinction between 

that and the lab report saying the substance that was 
shown to me which I analyzed was cocaine, what's the --
what's the distinction?

 MS. COAKLEY:  In the first instance you have 

a witness to an event in a particular case that can be 
tied to, perhaps, behavior of the defendant that's 
deemed to be criminal.  It's -- it's classic hearsay and 
subject to confrontation, if it's, you know, is going to 
be used by the prosecution.

 In this instance, though, we have a protocol 

set up by a State statute that indeed does test 
substances other than those definitely headed for 
litigation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't see the difference 
between the two.  I mean, the one, he saw the blue car

going down the street, which through other evidence can 
be connected to the defendant; and here the witness says 
this is cocaine, which through other evidence is going 
to be connected to the defendant.  And in both cases 
that -- that connected fact is deemed essential by the 
prosecution for the conviction.  I don't see the 
difference between the two.

 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, I think there are 

several differences, Your Honor, but one of which is 
that it is identifiable and it can be verified outside 
of what the scope of the Confrontation Clause is.  In 
other words, the defendant has a chance to test it ahead 
of time, have his own independent witness.  This doesn't 
change.  Whether it is cocaine before, during or after 
the trial is testable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, why --
MS. COAKLEY:  And it's not true of a witness 

statement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why does that make a 

difference?  In other words, the -- Justice Scalia said 
a moment ago, you know, the -- the statement about the 
blue car is -- is tied in in the hypothetical case by 
another witness who said yes, at -- at 10:01 when I 
heard the gun go off there was a blue car there.  In 
this case the cocaine is tied in by saying, yes, the

cocaine which I delivered to X, about which he has 
testified, is cocaine that I took out of the pocket of 
the defendant.

 There is -- there is a temporal and physical 
path worked out in both cases.  And it seems to me your 
attempt to distinguish them is to say well, the temporal 
path can be extended by one more step in the cocaine 
case because you can take the cocaine or take something 
from the cocaine sample and let the defense expert 
testify to it; which of course is true, but I don't see 
what that has got to do with the Confrontation Clause or 
the definition of testimonial evidence.

 MS. COAKLEY:  I -- I think that that's 

significant, Your Honor, because it can be tested and 
verified and isn't dependent upon a cross examination at 
trial.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But aren't you really 

saying that the confrontation right is therefore not so 
important because you have a greater opportunity in the 
cocaine case of coming up with -- with rebutting 
evidence, if indeed rebutting evidence can be found.

 In other words, if -- if -- if the State's 
witness is wrong, you've got a better shot at proving 
him wrong than in the blue car case.  But if that is 
your argument, I don't see what it's got to do with --

with the basic confrontation right.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think I go back, Your 
Honor, to looking at all the kinds of statements that 
this Court has looked at within the scope of the 
Confrontation Clause.  This kind of public record, 
official record, laboratory report, has never been the 
subject of this kind of analysis and indeed it's not 
sufficient.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, have we ever had --

have we ever had a --
record kind of case in -- in which the record was 
prepared expressly for trial?

a kind of lab report, public 

 MS. COAKLEY:  I think that if you look at 

Dutton, for instance, and the concurring opinion by 
Justice Harlan talking about laboratory reports deemed 
to be whatever the analysis was, a business record, that 
would have been --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but Justice Harlan did 
not take the majority view.  I mean you -- I don't know 
where you get authority for the proposition that the 
public record prepared for the purpose of litigation 
would have come in under the, in effect, the founding 
era -- or would have been outside the founding era 
definition of testimonial.

instance of a coroner's result -- not the coroner's 
verdict that involves Marian-type depositions, but the 
results of a coroner's verdict that says somebody is 
dead and this is the cause and manner and means of 
death -- would have been admissible at the time with --
that kind of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  For the indictment, not --

not as -- not as independent evidence in the 
prosecution.  It would form the basis for the 
indictment, as I understand what the history is.  It 
would not be introduced and -- and -- and shown to the 
jury as evidence that -- that indeed the cause of death 
was thus and so.

 MR. FISHER:  But autopsy results -- my 

understanding, Your Honor, is that autopsy results --
again not a coroner's verdict, which -- in the reply 
brief we believe that counsel has conflated what would 
be a verdict between the fact of an official record, an 
autopsy report of the death, manner and means of 
death -- have been and still admissible.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me -- and tell 

me if this is not the way you want to argue.  It seems 
to me to make your case you have to say of course this 
is hearsay; and the question is whether it's 
testimonial.

MS. COAKLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it's not testimonial 

because these are laboratory protocols, subject to 
ongoing, objective, repeated standards; that's different 
from testimony that it was a blue car, which is specific 
to the case.  That's the kind of framework of the 
argument you have to make.

 MS. COAKLEY:  That's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that as a result of 
that it is not testimonial because "testimonial" is a 
legal term that's subject to interpretation.  I -- I 
guess that's the argument you're making and that you 
have to make.

 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, that's correct, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As I see it.
 MS. COAKLEY:  And I think that that is 

certainly consistent with the way in which this Court in 
looking at the series of cases from Crawford since, have 
looked at what a testimonial statement is.  Admittedly, 
you haven't addressed this kind of statement, and I 
would argue because it doesn't fall within the principal 
evil that the Confrontation Clause is designed to 
prevent.

in -- I think it was Hammond was the companion case to 
David.

 MS. COAKLEY:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the 911 call was 

done for other -- really other purposes.  It wasn't 
testimonial because it wasn't really directed to trial. 
This does seem more directed to trial, so then you have 
to tell us why even if it is, there are some independent 
guarantees of -- of reliability that means that we 
should say it's not testimonial as a legal matter.

 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, I agree, Your Honor.  I 

think that you cannot pull one of these qualities out 
and say that because it's prepared in anticipation of 
trial means that therefore it is testimonial.  There 
have been several criteria that this Court has looked 
at, including -- there are other kinds of analogies to 
this that are akin to this kind of record.  For 
instance, in an assault case, a gun which is the real 
evidence -- remember the cocaine is the real evidence 
here -- the Commonwealth would introduce a certificate 
saying this is a working gun, and that is in lieu of the 
analyst coming in.  When we have to prove public way, 
when we have to prove school zone, when we have to prove 
in some instances --

would extend this to ballistic tests?

 MS. COAKLEY:  If --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you don't have to 

bring in the ballistic expert?  You can just --

MS. COAKLEY:  Not to prove it's a working 

firearm, Your Honor.  In order to make a comparison -- I 
would agree with counsel that once you get into the 
discretionary areas that you need to make comparisons 
and analysis, but this is not that case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that 

difference.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm looking at 

footnote 10 in your brief on page 30.  And you concede 
that some interpretation of the machine-generated data 
ordinarily is required.  Now why isn't that a suggestion 
that there is some leeway and subjective interpretation, 
and you might have different analysts coming out 
differently and so you need to get the fellow there and 
ask him well, how often do you -- how often do one of 
your fellow analysts disagree with your conclusion?

 Or this is subjective; I guess some people 
read it one way or the other one way; which way do you 
always read it?  That kind of stuff.

 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, interestingly, Your 

Honor, that argument wasn't raised in this case below

and really hasn't been raised in this case before the 
Court.  In fact this is one of the straightforward 
objective tests that says you put this material into the 
machine, and the Solicitor General also deals with this. 
The 100 percent accuracy by and large from that result 
says this is cocaine; this is heroin, this is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I didn't -- I 

didn't go back and read the scientific treatise you 
cite, but you say some interpretation is required.  So 
what type of interpretation?

 MS. COAKLEY:  The interpretation that 

because of the way that the machine works, the chemicals 
are separated out.  And so a chemist, if properly 
trained, can say by the separation of the chemicals 
these three, or four or whatever the elements are, equal 
cocaine.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do you have to have 
a machine?  I mean, what about -- what about ballistics? 
"This bullet came from that gun."  Does that involve 
sufficient discretion, sufficient judgment that the 
expert has to be there, while the blood -- blood or drug 
testing doesn't?

 It seems to me that's where you have to draw 

the line.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And to say that that 

wasn't raised in the case, this is precisely the 
question we are going to have to decide if you're going 
to prevail.  I don't think it helps to say it wasn't 
raised in the case.

 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We are raising it.
 MS. COAKLEY:  I agree, Your Honor.  But that 

has to do with how satisfied the Court is whether here 
or in other jurisdictions that is a reliable result, and 
I hesitate to use the word "reliable."  I don't mean it 
in the Ohio v. Roberts sense.  We are talking about the 
scientific test that is or is not reliable, and 
therefore does it require some other test, whether 
Confrontation Clause or not?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  How can we administer 

something like that?  His point I think is, look, you 
can't make any distinction either of something that is 
evidence was prepared with an eye towards trial or it 
wasn't.  And if it was prepared with an eye towards 
trial, well, then call the person and have him testify. 
That's it.  And if that encompasses every test under the 
sun, so be it, because there is no way to draw a 
reasonable line.

their amicus brief is filled with horror stories of how 
police labs or other labs have really been way off base 
and moreover really wrong.  And you say, oh, distinguish 
between a police lab and University of Massachusetts? 
Try going down that road of which one is reliable, which 
one isn't reliable.  How do we know?

 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's his point.  No 

workable way to do it.  There can be horrors on both --
in both areas, and so follow what the history was where 
there was no history on this being admissible.

 MS. COAKLEY:  Your Honor, I disagree because 

the issues around many of those wrongful convictions 
related to suggestive identification procedures, other 
kinds of issues.  I'm not aware of any wrongful 
convictions that came about because --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Aren't there some things I 
read in the paper all the time, about these laboratories 
in various places, and they lost the results, they got 
it all wrong?  That just doesn't happen?

 MS. COAKLEY:  I'm not saying that, Your 

Honor, but I'm saying there are certain evils that the 
Confrontation Clause is designed to prevent.  Either 
abuse at the laboratory stage or misconduct by 
prosecutors prior to trial or analysts is not one that

the Confrontation Clause is either designed to or is 
specifically very good at getting at.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not?  I know I prefer 

one thing, the custody.  It's very important to know 
whether indeed this was the particular substance that 
was taken from the defendant.  And to establish that, 
you have to establish a line of custody.  And you can't 
do that without getting in the person who did the test.
 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, Your Honor, I agree the 

chain of custody is crucial and it relates to the 
careful procedure that a police officer used, who by the 
way is the confrontation witness that you worry about 
because the behavior is the buying, selling, possession 
of drugs.  The element of whether it is cocaine or not 
really becomes almost secondary to the case.  The issue 
is was the behavior criminal?  So the officer who seized 
the drugs is available for confrontation.  The drug is 
then clearly marked so the Commonwealth has to create 
that chain of custody for the court, and indeed if the 
defendant, who is in the best position to think that 
perhaps this is involving something other than cocaine 
or heroin, has all the opportunities that he needs to 
make sure that he gets a fair trial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He says -- the policeman 

says, "And I gave it to the University of Massachusetts

lab."

 MS. COAKLEY:  And they marked it in a 

particular way that identified --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  "And I watched when they 

marked it in a particular way."

 MS. COAKLEY:  And the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do I know that that 

thing is the one that got to the desk of the analyst who 
wrote this report?

 MS. COAKLEY:  I think that whether you 

brought the analyst in or not, you would have the same 
establishment of the chain of custody and, indeed, that 
piece of evidence as to whether it's the same drug 
relates to the officer in this case testified the 
packaging.  He could identify it.  It comes back --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you say you can require 
witnesses to show that, right up to the analyst who did 
the testing, you can require witnesses to testify?  All 
the way up to there but not the analyst himself?

 MS. COAKLEY:  I think, Your Honor, that the 

issue between chain of custody and whether the 
Confrontation Clause is implicated are different issues 
--

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but you say that, it 

seems to me, because you are -- and I think consistently

-- making a distinction between credibility issues and 
reliability issues.  And I think you are implicitly 
saying the Confrontation Clause is there to test 
credibility but not reliability.

 MS. COAKLEY:  I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  The machine is reliable; 
therefore, it's outside of confrontation.  And I don't 
understand the validity of this distinction that is 
implicit in your answers.

 MS. COAKLEY:  I think perhaps if the Court 

looks at accuracy rather than reliability and gets 
outside the realm of the kinds of statements --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, accuracy --
MS. COAKLEY:  -- that we looked at.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- is an aspect of it.
 MS. COAKLEY:  But accuracy goes to what this 
Court has always allowed in referring to, for instance, 
a business records exception or a public records 
exception.  The reason they are admissible is precisely 
because we believe them to be accurate, and more 
importantly in this case --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  No.  They are 

admissible in criminal cases as far as the Confrontation 
Clause is concerned because they are not testimonial.

Your Honor, because the roots of whether it's hearsay or 
not and the Confrontation Clause arguments come from the 
same concern that somebody get a fair trial, that he or 
she has the right to confront the witness --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We are back to Roberts 

then.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I do wish you would 

comment on the argument that the State of California --
a huge state with many, many drug prosecutions -- seems 
to get along all right under the rule that the 
Petitioner proposes.

 MS. COAKLEY:  I did join the amicus brief, 
Your Honor.  I believe and -- though I think it's too 
early to tell because I, certainly from my own 
experience, know that the number of cases that go to 
trial is not an indication of what the work is that is 
involved, and I know that in Massachusetts it would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the State of California 

and other populous States have for, I take it, some 
number of years been able to function quite effectively 
under the rule that the Petitioner proposes, it seems to 
me that's something that you have to address.

 MS. COAKLEY:  And I address that, Your 

Honor, by saying that for Massachusetts it would be an 
undue burden with very little benefit to the defendant.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why would it be undue for 

California and not for -- are you accepting the fact 
that in California it's a workable rule and it's caused 
no problems?

 MS. COAKLEY:  I -- I can't disagree with 

that, Your Honor.  I don't have enough information about 
the way California works or doesn't work.  I know that 
as a practical matter --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, it seems to me it's 

a very important point.

 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, as a practical matter in 

Massachusetts, it would mean that district court 
misdemeanor drug prosecutions would essentially grind to 
a halt, and the value to the defendant -- and this Court 
has looked at in Inadi and in other situations where 
there does not seem to be the real issue involved with 
Confrontation Clause.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then you're predicting 

that grind to a halt, but there are going to be a large 
number that wash out because they are plea bargained. 
So they won't get into the picture at all.  There will 
probably be a goodly number in which defense counsel 
will stipulate that the drug quantity -- the drug type 
was such and such and quantity such and such.  So you 
don't know in how many cases the defendant would take

advantage of this confrontation right?

 MS. COAKLEY:  No, and they often will not 

stipulate, Your Honor, until the day of trial when they 
realize that the chemist is there.  That's from my own 
experience and that's a commonsensical rule.  The 
question is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't these people have to 
appear before the same judge again and again?  The point 
made these are repeat attorneys, and I don't think you 
make friends and influence people among judges by 
insisting upon testimony in criminal cases where it is 
obviously not needed.

 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, two points, Your Honor: 

In Massachusetts, we do have a circuit court and a 
superior court so judges move around.  And the second 
thing is that -- my experience is that defendants, 
whether appointed or otherwise, are extremely vigorous 
in protecting their rights, and if I were defense 
counsel and I had a strategic advantage, I would insist 
on it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Do you see any reason --

did not join the amicus brief.

notice-and-demand statute wouldn't satisfy your concern?

 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, the -- the Petitioner 

agreed that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  A bland notice-and-demand 

statute --

MS. COAKLEY:  We would argue that 

Massachusetts' statute is the functional equivalent of a 
notice-and-demand statute and complies with whatever 
concerns the Court may have about the right to 
confrontation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if it's the 
central issue in the case?  The defense says, "That 
stuff I was carrying was not cocaine.  Either I was 
trying -- you know, I was going to stiff the person I 
was selling it to or whatever."  That's the sole 
defense.  That's not cocaine.  All you've got to do is 
submit an affidavit from the lab guy saying, "I tested 
it; it is"?

 MS. COAKLEY:  Well, from the prosecution's 
point of view that would be a bad strategic decision. 
That's an instance where you would bring in the analyst 
because you want to --

plenty of opportunity to both have an independent exam, 
to subpoena the witness in himself, to make sure that if 
that is a true issue at trial -- in many instances --
most instances it's not, but he will have the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The Confrontation Clause is not implicated 
when a human being merely authenticates for trial the 
instruments-generated result of a scientific test.  That 
is because the direct output of an instrument is not 
testimonial and human assertions that merely establish

the foundation for admitting nontestimonial evidence do 
not themselves trigger Confrontation Clause rights.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, maybe if you were 

just -- if you were just putting in the machine, the raw 
information from the machine.  But here what speaks is 
the certification by the analyst, so you don't have 
simply a machine-generated result; you have a human 
person who seems to be testifying:  I certify that this 
is an accurate report.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  If I could draw an analogy, 
Justice Ginsburg, to a historical example that we think 
illustrates our point, historically records custodians 
-- public records custodians have been permitted to 
certify through, when they have express authority at the 
common law, and -- and into present day that they did a 
records search, that they found a document within the 
public records of an agency, and that the document that 
they are attaching is a true copy of what they found.

 Those are statements by humans that really 

set forth the conditions for -- under which the evidence 
is being presented to the jury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But --
MS. SCHERTLER:  But those have always been 

accepted.

for trial.  It's not material that was generated 
precisely in order to prosecute an individual.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  The underlying material in 
the public records case is not testimonial because it 
was not prepared for trial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.
 MS. SCHERTLER:  In this case, Justice 

Scalia, we would submit that the underlying material is 
also not testimonial, albeit for a separate reason; and 
that is that it is an instrument-generated result and 
therefore not the statement of a witness.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's, let's assume that 
it's critical to a particular murder prosecution what 
time the shot was fired, okay?  And you mean to tell me 
if -- if somebody says I heard the clock strike 12 at 
the time the shot was fired, that would not be 
testimony?  Yes, the clock is a machine, right?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  No.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He is just reciting what 

the clock said.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  My analogy would be, Justice 
Scalia, if that clock had in itself a trigger mechanism 
that would detect when a gunshot was fired; and if that 
clock delivered, as you have in the cases of a drug 
analysis, a result, a reading that one could submit into

court that says shot detected at 12 p.m., that that 
nontestimonial evidence could be submitted consistently 
with Confrontation Clause principles, but it would still 
require authentication.

 Some person may have to establish that this 

clock was set up, it was operating properly, it was 
calibrated the way it had to.  Those all go to the same 
sorts of foundational facts that are akin to the public 
records certificate.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you make me think the 

public certificate.  Let's imagine birth and death 
records.  There is a whole building full of them; they 
are on microfiche.  Now, I am not sure how Massachusetts 
works, but I suppose if you want to introduce one you 
call up the -- the keeper and the keeper looks it up, 
produces it, and has a separate piece of paper or maybe 
written beneath it which says:  "This is a true copy of 
the," and you don't call in the keeper.

 Now that statement on a piece of paper, 

"this is a true copy of the birth certificate of John 
Smith," that was prepared specifically for this trial.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes, Justice Breyer.

the person to make clear that the document that says 
that this is a copy of the document --

MS. SCHERTLER:  Our --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that what -- is that the 

point?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, that is -- that is our 

point.  That it is too -- it is too simplified to say, 
as Petitioner does here, that if it's an affidavit or a 
certificate, and it's prepared for trial, that's the end 
of the analysis.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you have to have some 
boundaries, you have to have some framework, you have to 
have some explanation.  You started talking about a 
machine.  There is no machine in Justice Breyer's 
hypothetical, so it seems to me you have two different 
rationales floating around here and -- and neither are 
tethered to a specific rule.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, Justice Kennedy, this 
is why I would bring those two rules together.  In the 
public records example, what you have is underlying 
evidence going into the jury that is nontestimonial.  In 
that instance, it was because it was a public record not 
prepared for trial but has always been accepted from --
has always been viewed as nontestimonial.

don't have that, but what we do have is an underlying 
evidentiary item that is nontestimonial for a separate 
purpose, and that is that it is a machine-generated 
result.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You're going to work 

either.  Because the person -- Sir Walter Raleigh's 
accusers wanted to testify about something that was 
nontestimonial:  what happened on the day.  So what we 
are looking for -- I mean, I agree with you that it is a 
very peculiar result that's going to have every public 
document in the United States suddenly have the keeper 
of that document having to come into court.

 On the other hand, I'm having a hard time 
figuring out what the distinction is between that and 
all these other things.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well -- yes, Justice Breyer. 

Let me just add that in the public records custodian 
situation, there is always the possibility that the 
public records custodian who is signing that certificate 
was careless, is a liar; and those certificates yet have 
always been viewed as simply foundational vehicles for 
getting to the jury nontestimonial evidence.  The 
defense is not --

clarify one thing for me.  Is the rule you're seeking 
one limited to tests performed by machines?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  The rule that I have 
articulated so far, yes.  It is -- it would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So would you agree the 

Confrontation Clause would apply if it were an 
independent expert's test -- test results and testimony.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Justice Stevens, we also 

have an alternative argument --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Just tell me yes or no.
 MS. SCHERTLER:  No.  I would not.  Because 

we have an alternative --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, then we shouldn't 

talk about just machines.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, we hope to rely on one 
of the same arguments that Massachusetts does, which is 
that there was a broad exception at common law for 
official records, those created by public officers doing 
their duty.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me you have to 
do that because there is all sorts of machines that have 
to be interpreted.  There -- a chromatic spectrum 
analysis; the person has to say what he saw there, what 
she saw there.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  I --

54 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So just because the 

machine is involved it seems to me we cannot make a 
sensible rule based on that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And there was not a broad 
exception at common law for public records created in 
anticipation of criminal litigation.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, we have -- I mean, we 
have looked for that limitation in the authorities and 
we simply have not found it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Have you found cases where 
the material was admitted as a public record despite the 
fact that it was a public record created for 
prosecution?

 MR. FISHER:  The difficulty with that, 

Justice Scalia, is I don't know of equivalent or 
comparable records that were being created at that time 
for purposes of litigation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  These other records, no, 

you haven't found them.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  No.  I have -- I have not.
 Yet, if I could go back to Justice Kennedy's 
question, there is no record here about how this test in 
particular was done, but there -- there -- I can tell 
the Court that actually technology in the controlled

substance area is to the point where an instrument does 
in fact provide an answer to the analyst.  It provides a 
mass spectrum of the unknown and a --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes but the rule, the 

issue is not limited to drug cases.  Murder cases, all 
sorts of cases where there is scientific evidence.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, the -- the narrower 
rule that we are discussing here would be limited to 
those situations in which the underlying evidence to be 
presented to the jury is nontestimonial because it is 
instrument-generated and did not require human analysis.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is your -- what 
is your answer to the question I posed to the Attorney 
General?  The only issue in the case is whether the 
powder is or is not cocaine.  You think you get by if 
the law says you can admit this with an affidavit?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice for 

the following reason.  Just as in the case of the 
records custodians, a defendant may believe that that is 
not an authentic record; and nothing about the rule we 
propose would prevent the defense from challenging the 
authenticity or the circumstances, the correctness of 
the testing procedures that were used.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you can't --

whether -- whether the Confrontation Clause requires 
that that challenge occur in the Government's case on 
cross-examination, or as in these record custodian's 
cases, if the defense wants to challenge the 
authenticity of the underlying nontestimonial evidence, 
he must do so in his case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you comment on the 

California experience, please?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  I would -- I would be happy 

to, Justice Kennedy.

 I -- I don't have information about 

California.  I do have information about the District of 
Columbia.  And I can tell the court that in the time 
period since the District of Columbia Court of Appeals 
held that these sorts of certificates of analysis were 
testimonial, that the court appearances that have been 
required of DEA chemists at the Mid-Atlantic laboratory 
have increased by 500 percent, from seven to 10 
appearances per month to routinely over 50 per month, 
and that the corresponding time that it takes to analyze 
substance has increased.

 Thank you, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you counsel. 

Five minutes, Mr. Fisher.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER:  Let me start, Your Honors:  If 
there is any doubt remaining about the machine-generated 
theory that the Solicitor General was putting forward 
today, again I would refer the court back to the 
scientific evidence treatise.

 The raw data of a mass spectrometer looks --
looks something like a heart monitor.  It's a printout 
of the squiggly line across the page that a person needs 
to look at and then analyze as to what it shows about 
the molecular composite of the substance that the 
machine was operating.  We have no objection if 
prosecutors in criminal cases want to introduce machine 
generated data.  They can do that.

 But what they can't do is introduce --

introduce affidavits certifying as to their -- you know, 
their interpretation of what a machine did or simply 
what a machine says, because there is no difference --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you say they could 
introduce the squiggly line and put on the stand an 
analyst who says what that squiggly line shows is that 
this was cocaine?

 MR. FISHER:  They could do that, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's your distinction

with the recordkeeper?

 MR. FISHER:  Pardon me?
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's your distinction 

from your own theory of the recordkeeper?  Does the 
recordkeeper all have to -- do they all have to testify 
to testify that this is indeed the record?

 MR. FISHER:  My understanding of the common 

law on that, as the solicitor general put it, is that 
that was a foundational requirement that was not 
necessarily considered evidence.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, there's a 

hearsay -- there is a hearsay aspect.  I'm not saying 
it's the only thing.  There is a chain and so forth but, 
there is a hearsay aspect to that which you see, okay. 
The certificate says this is Joe Jones' birth 
certificate.  That's what the -- now, that's that person 
outside of court who made that little piece of paper for 
purposes of this case.  And moreover, the statement that 
it certifies to is directly relevant; indeed, the whole 
thing falls without it.

 So, are you going to say the same thing 

applies, your rule, and you have to call the 
recordkeeper in or not?  And I think you're going to say 
not.  And if you're going to say not, I want to know 
what the distinction is?

MR. FISHER:  As a general matter, yes, our 

rule is consistent.  Now, if you look at Wigmore, 
Wigmore --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You are going to calling 

in -- you're going to --

MR. FISHER:  I'm trying to answer.  What 

Wigmore says is that something like a public 
recordkeeper's seal was not considered evidence, per se. 
It was a foundational requirement to put evidence in. 
And so, in this Court's words in the Dowdell case, it's 
something like a court reporter's transcript that goes 
up to a Court of Appeals and then is looked at.  It's 
not considered evidence against a criminal defendant.
 Now, in stark contrast to this case where 

the document is expressly citing to a statute of 
Massachusetts law and saying this element of the 
criminal charge is satisfied.  It is a very big 
difference.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The graph, spectrograph 

or -- or -- or the -- the chart is introduced.  Chain of 
custody is either stipulated or established.  Can a 
person who did not make the test testify as to what that 
line -- what that graph means, and would that be 
sufficient to convict?

 MR. FISHER:  So long as chain of custody was

satisfied, yes, Justice Kennedy, that someone could take 
the stand and do that.  But remember, the reports in 
this case do not just report -- even if you accepted the 
solicitor's general's version that they are reporting 
what the machine said about the substance, they also 
have a paragraph before that, and this goes to Justice 
Scalia's question, say, these are -- these are the 
substances that were taken from the defendant in this 
case and given to me by this officer, and so, that is 
additional information that is being sworn to in the 
affidavit in this case that is also testimony.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why don't you insist, even 
in that case, on the confrontation right to examine the 
person who actually conducted the test itself and 
generated the papers that the later expert testifies on 
in order to determine the admissibility of the -- of 
the -- the test results themselves?

 MR. FISHER:  I think the defendant may have 
that right.  I understood Justice Kennedy's hypothetical 
to suggest that that chain of custody was stipulated to 
or otherwise agreed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  All I wanted to know 

was whether you were giving that away or not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but chain of custody 
is -- is quite different from the quantitative analysis

and the professional opinion.  My question is only chain 
of custody has been established, that's gone to the 
laboratory, the paper is produced, an outside witness 
testifies to what the paper means.  I thought you said 
that that suffices.

 MR. FISHER:  I did.  So I think I'm --

here's what I'm saying.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let me ask you this.  There 

are -- there are -- there are three possibility 
subjects:  Chain of custody, conduct of test, 
significance or meaning of the squiggles.  As I 
understand it, you have said if the chain of custody is 
established and if the squiggles are admitted in 
evidence, an expert who did not do the test can testify 
about the significance of the squiggles.  But that 
leaves the question of the -- the evidence about the 
conduct of the test itself.

 And I understood you to say to me that you 

were not conceding that you did not have a -- a 
confrontation right to examine the person who did the 
test itself in order to determine admissibility.

 MR. FISHER:  I think what we are doing here 

is disagreeing slightly over where chain of custody 
begins and ends.  To the extent chain of custody gets 
you to the point at which the substance is put into the

machine, and that was stipulated to or otherwise not 
thought about, then, yes, the printout could be 
introduced into evidence and anyone could testify as to 
what that printout means.  But to the extent that there 
was a gap between the drugs getting into the laboratory 
and being put into the machine by somebody that the 
defendant was not stipulating to, then whoever did 
that -- if the State were going to assert this is who 
did it and this is the drugs that we had -- that would 
be something that would be subject to cross-examination.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
