12  for mootness, it is important to remember the underlying 
13  facts of this case.  For 10 months in 2005 and 2006, 
14  more than 36,000 nonmembers, or nearly 40 percent of 
those employees represented by SEIU employed by the 
15
16  State of California, were compelled to contribute to 
17  SEIU's $12 million Political Fight-Back Fund without 
18  being provided the opportunity to challenge the amount 
19  of the fee and to object to its exaction, required by 
20
21
 Adding insult to that injury, the Ninth 
22  Circuit said that nonmembers could never say no to 
23  contributing to SEIU's political expenditures for ballot 
24  propositions, at least Proposition 76.  They have no 
25

right to refuse to bankroll that element of SEIU's

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Young, could I ask you 

 MR. YOUNG:  I was just addressing that. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  As -- as I understand your 

1  political speech.  This defies this Court's decisions, 
2  distorting the political process on a massive scale. 
3
4  to speak to the mootness question first?
5
6
7  brief, you're essentially saying that it's impossible to 
8  moot a claim for nominal damages.  Is -- is that a 
9  correct reading of your position?
10
11  far, Justice Kagan.  I think in this case, the 
12  wishy-washiness, as it were, of the language used by 
13  SEIU when it distributed this pasted-on dollar to the 
14  class -- or dollars, more accurately -- was inadequate 
15
16  judgment that the nonmember class had won. 
17
18  point, right, which is that the notice was inadequate? 
19
20
21  "inadequate," I read you to be saying sort of not 
22  apologetic enough.  And -- in other words, not saying, 
23  look, you had a claim against us, we think you're right; 
24  it was a valid claim; here is your judgment in 
25

satisfaction of that claim.  That it didn't forthrightly 

 MR. YOUNG:  I'm not sure I would go that 

because it failed to represent the importance of the

district court that the SEIU was attempting to comply 
with.  They failed to do so in virtually all of its 
elements. 

1  say that.  But do you think if it had forthrightly said 
2  that, we would be living in a different Article III 
3  universe? 
4
 MR. YOUNG:  Not in this case, Justice Kagan.
 Turning to the adequacy of the notice, of 
5
6  the financial disclosure, that did not comply with the 
7  district court's judgment, either.  If -- if the only 
8  question were the distribution of nominal damages, then 
9  perhaps we would be living in that different Article III

17  that they were satisfying a claim?

20
21  that SEIU's subsequent 2006 financial disclosure was 
22  inadequate to cure the problem that was caused by the 
23  seizure of fees starting in September 2005.  And that's 
24  on 73a of the -- the Petition Appendix B.

anticipated.  The district court specifically determined 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And how is that?  How did 

they fail to comply, other than, you know, the question 

 MR. YOUNG:  The -- the district court had 

 The union in this case merely sent the same

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the reason 

1  financial disclosure in the notice that it sent, to try 
2  to moot the case, that it had sent in June of 2006. 
3  Well, the district court had already said this is 
4  inadequate.  That seems to me to -- to end the inquiry.
5
6  contemplate that the notice that was sent in June 2006 
7  satisfied the obligations of its judgment; else it 
8  hardly could have ordered a -- a useless act in ordering 
9  a new type of notice go out.
10
11  that's important in terms of the content of the notice, 
12  the inadequacy, is what? 
13
 MR. YOUNG:  The reason that is important, 
14  Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, excuse me -- is that the 
SEIU is asserting that the case has become moot because 
15
16  it has now complied with the district court's judgment.

18

21  would have resulted in more members electing to opt out,

that's speculative to some extent.  But since the

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If the special assessment
 

1  purpose of the notice is to provide the information 
2  necessary to -- to object, one of the purposes, then we 
3  certainly anticipate that there would be more objectors 
4  were there to be an -- an adequate notice that complies

17  constitutionally required in that context, would this 
18  case be moot?

22
23  the -- the different requirements, which presumably were 
24  not met here in the context of the special assessment,

have -- we -- we still have the nominal damages question

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. -- Mr. Young --
 MR. YOUNG:  Yes, Justice --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- as I understand, the 

1  would that be enough to preserve this case as a live 
2  controversy? 
 MR. YOUNG:  So long as the union failed to

5

12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
 MR. YOUNG:  No, Justice Ginsburg, and this 
18
19  is why:  The union would remain free to return to its 
old ways, the -- the very type of reason that this Court 
20
21  declined to find mootness in W.T. Grant.  The union has 
22  made much -- much of a showing -- or much of a show, 
23  more accurately, of the fact that it has changed its 
24  internal policy.  It won't do this for 180 days.  But 
that can hardly be sufficient for this Court to find 
25

union recognizes that a consequence of mootness would be 
that the Ninth Circuit judgment is vacated.  Now, if the 
union would also recognize that that means the district 
court judgment stays in place, so if the Ninth Circuit 
judgment is worked out and you're left with the district 
court judgment as the law of the case, then I think it 
is moot, isn't it?

in this case. 

 It is also about the effect of that judgment 

special assessment that is long over. 

 MR. YOUNG:  That is true, Justice Ginsburg. 

1  mootness in this case.  The union made this wonderful 
2  and meaningful policy change on 6 days' notice. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it wasn't -- this --
3
4  this case is about a completed episode.  It's about a 
5
6
7  But it is also about the declaratory relief that was 
8  ordered by -- that was entered by the district court. 
9  It is about the -- which was virtually injunctive relief 
10
11
12  for future activities and -- and how that will affect 
13  the way SEIU operates. 
14
15
16 
17 
18
19  case, Justice Kennedy.  The union set a very short 
time -- well, a relatively short time period, given the 
20
21  length of time a case comes up from the courts as a rule 
22  in this Court. 
23
24  future -- future terms?  Is it a permanent injunction or 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Does it have --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, are you saying that 
this is capable of repetition, yet evading review?  I'm 
not quite sure. 

is it just an injunction that relates to the notice 

 MR. YOUNG:  It would certainly be so in this 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does the injunction have 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. YOUNG:  Yes, Justice Kagan, I think that 

actually phrased as an injunction.  It was an
 

same thing could happen again, it's where an injunction 
has been before us rather than a suit for damages as to 
a past act? 

1  that's required in this case? 
2
 MR. YOUNG:  Just -- just to be clear, there 
3  is -- I'm talking about something that's tantamount to 
4  an injunction, Justice Kennedy.  It's -- it wasn't 
5
6  affirmative -- an act -- ordering an affirmative act.
 
7
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But isn't that important,
 
8  Mr. Young, because usually where we've talked about
 
9  capable of repetition or where we've talked about the
 
10
11 
12 
13
14  has been generally the case.  I -- in my research, I 
could find very few cases where it wasn't clear to me 
15
16  that this Court was addressing injunctive relief. 
17  Hudson itself, it seems to me, did not specifically 
18  discuss the entry of injunctive relief in the lower 
19  court, and Hudson itself addressed a mootness issue.
 I mean, if we -- if we talk about these 
20
21  cases in their -- in their strictest sense, the union's 
22  notices are all annual.  So, by the theory that it 
23  becomes moot when those notices expire, or potentially 
24  moot when those notices expire, this Court would never 
25

address these issues because it would -- I can't imagine 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you make that argument 

 But the -- this Court in Hudson, in -- I 

the policy, the procedure, the acts as they were 

1  one of these cases ever getting up to this Court in as 
2  little as a year. 
3
4  believe it was footnote 12, said that this Court reviews 
5
6  defended in the district court.  And the union's policy 
7  and procedure and acts here were defended in the 
8  district court.  And, therefore, cases like this should 
9  not become moot, because it is capable of repetition and 
would be evading review simply by the mere limits of how 
10
11 
long these policies and procedures are in effect. 
12
13  in your opposition? 
14
15
16  although clearly our main point in that argument is that 
17  this is a -- a paradigm case of voluntary cessation of 
18  allegedly unlawful activity.  Until cert was granted in 
19  this case, until the Petitioners' merits brief was 
20
21  remains free to impose that practice. 
22
23  something quite different than the capable of returning 
24  to old ways, because here we do have a discrete episode 
25

 MR. YOUNG:  It's -- it seems to me, 
Justice Kennedy, it is implicit in our argument, 

filed, SEIU was vigorously defending its practice.  It

 MR. YOUNG:  That's -- that's true, Justice 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, they said that it 

become moot simply because the period was over. 

1  though that -- what was it, in 2005 -- that the period 
2  in 2005-2006, when the special assessment was in effect, 
3  that was long over, but you were -- you were continuing 
4  to litigate it.  And nobody suggested that it would

7  Ginsburg.  Pardon me. 
 This argument -- this argument was not 
8
9  raised until we were before this Court, the union's 
argument that the case had somehow become moot, and 
10
11 
until it issued a notice --
12
13  had become moot because they gave you all the relief you 
14  requested; so, there was nothing left to the case.
15
16  Ginsburg, implies that they had complied with the 
17  district court's judgment.  As to the notice, we believe 
18  that they have not, and we believe that's clear because 
19  of the very fact that the district court rejected the 
20
21
22  point for you to move to the merits. 
23
24  Mr. Chief Justice.

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, "all the relief," Justice

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you attacking the
 
normal system of basing assessments moving forward, 

 MR. YOUNG:  I -- I appreciate the question, 
Justice Sotomayor.  No, we are not attacking the normal 

1  question about the merits?
 
2
3  Sotomayor.
 
4
5
6  based on past accounting and chargeability and 
7  non-chargeability?  Or are you just attacking the 
8  special assessment? 
9
10
11  Hudson procedures.  On --
12
13  articulate for me what's -- borrowing a phrase from one 
14  of my colleagues yesterday, how do we write this 
15
16  Let's presume for the sake of argument that the union 
17  had cost overruns.  Labor salaries went up; printing 
18  costs went up, not for lobbying; but generally there was 
19  a 10 percent increase in their expenses across the board 
20
21  required it.  Would you require a second notice in that 
22  circumstance? 
23
24  would -- we believe -- pardon me -- that a new Hudson 
25

because various contracts that they were involved in 

 MR. YOUNG:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor.  We 

notice is required whenever there is a material 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So, 

opinion?  When is a second Hudson notice required? 

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Articulate that again. 

MR. YOUNG:  A material increase or --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  A material new assessment?
 MR. YOUNG:  A material new assessment. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay. 
 MR. YOUNG:  Yes, Justice --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's -- we're talking 

1  alteration in the obligations that are imposed upon 
2  nonmembers.  The values that this --
3
4  A material change --
5
6  increase in general terms, in the obligation imposed 
7  upon the nonmembers.  In this case, I don't think 
8  anybody would dispute the 25 percent --
9
10
11
12
13
14  about money here, right?
15
16
17
18
19  without regard to the reason for the assessment?
20
21  I would have to say yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  The 
22  nonmember --
23
24  that -- this may just simply be repeating Justice 
25

 MR. YOUNG:  Yes, we are. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay. 
 MR. YOUNG:  Yes.  Certainly --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Without -- but 

 MR. YOUNG:  I think as a matter of principle 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm not sure 

Sotomayor's question, but if they say we have to raise 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. YOUNG:  Well, it wouldn't be so much a 

1  the assessment 10 percent because, as she said, you 
2  know, we estimated the printing costs for the union 
3  newsletter, whatever, was going to be this and it turns 
4  out they raised it, it's going to be that; so, we know 
we're going to have to get additional money, for things 
5
6  that are indisputably chargeable, why do you need 
7  special procedures in that case? 
8
9  special procedure as a new opportunity to object and 
challenge the amount of the fee, Mr. Chief Justice. 
10
11
 Certainly, one of the elements -- and we 
12  recognize, of course, that the primary reason 
13  individuals object is political expenditures, but this 
14  Court said very clearly in Abood that people can object 
for any reason, for no reason, for a good reason, for a 
15
16  bad reason; nobody can inquire as to why someone 
17  objects. 
18
19  there has been a material increase in the obligation 
imposed upon nonmembers, they may choose to make an 
20
21  economic decision that heretofore they chose not to 
22  make.  They may choose to minimize -- particularly the 
23  non-objectors.  They may choose that they want to 
24  minimize the financial obligation that they are paying 
25

 And certainly when a material alteration --

to the union at that time.  And --

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It's peculiar because in 

1
2  the circumstance where the extra assessment is all going 
3  to go to chargeable activities, in fact that means 
4  economically speaking the following year the objector 
will be better off, not worse off, because there is a 
5
6  higher percentage of the total fee that's being paid to 
7  chargeable activities. 
 So, this special assessment that Justice 
8
9  Sotomayor and the Chief Justice were talking about is 
one that will benefit the objector, if he keeps quiet 
10
11 
and says nothing.  So, it's a little hard to imagine the 
frame of mind that would say I need the notice because 
12 
13 
now I might object, whereas I wouldn't have before. 
14
 MR. YOUNG:  Well, Justice Breyer, the reason 
for the notice is these people may not trust the union. 
15
16  They -- they may choose to challenge the amount of the 
17  fee. 
18
19  I ask you -- oh, are you -- you want to pursue that 
20
21
22
23  this example. 
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Let me give you 

 MR. YOUNG:  Sure.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And now I -- but I think I 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, I see that point.  Can 

further, or are we --

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. YOUNG:  Yes, sir. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And normally, under Hudson, 

1  see what your answer is.  Imagine it's year two.  In 
2  year one, expenditures broke down so that it was 
3  70 percent chargeable, 30 percent not chargeable.  Got 
4  that?
5
6
7  that means in year two the deal is the objectors pay 
8  70 percent, right? 
 MR. YOUNG:  Yes.
9
 JUSTICE BREYER:  In the middle of year two, 
10
11  surprisingly, something comes up.  Something comes up. 
12  A surprise to the union, and they want to have a special 
13  assessment.  And you're saying they just can't without 
14  going through this procedure all over again?
 MR. YOUNG:  That would be correct, 
15
16  Justice Breyer.  The -- I'm now talking about --
17
18  they collected? 
 MR. YOUNG:  I'm sorry.
19
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can they take the money 
20
21  that they collected under the first notice, and, instead 
22  of doing the special assessment, in the middle of it, 
23  this campaign gets announced by the governor, and can 
24  they then divert the chargeable amount that they had 
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And take the money that 

predicted and spend it on the non-chargeable amount?  Or 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. YOUNG:  I understand, Justice Sotomayor. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So, this is a 

is that we're going to take money we already collected 
from them and spend it for a totally political purpose, 
we don't give them a special notice and they don't have 
to object. 

1  are you -- or does that require a second Hudson notice? 
2  Without a special assessment. 
3
4  And no, under that case, I don't believe it would.
5
6  peculiar rule that you have asked us to adopt.  The rule 
7  is that where there is a special assessment and it will 
8  make all the objectors better off, they have to have a 
9  special notice that they can object.  But where the rule 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  which you can confirm, is that's the only administrable 
17  system you can think of. 
18
19  going to make them better off?  I would -- I would 
20
21  know whether this new assessment is indeed going to be 
22  divided the way the original one was or not.  They might 
23  want to challenge --
24
25

 Now, that seems totally backwards, but I 
understand why you get there, and my suspicion is --

 MR. YOUNG:  That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- whether -- whether it's

13  unrealistic, but they have 20 bishops and 14 most honest 
14  people in the United States, and they've all absolutely 
guaranteed, and everybody agrees, that this goes to

2  It doesn't work perfectly, but it's as good as any 
3  other, and all we have to say is it's better than yours. 
4  Now, why is yours better than that?

 MR. YOUNG:  Then the problem is, Justice 

Proposition 76, we're going to take 50 percent as 

1  will be the following year.  So, when the union gives 
2  its new notice, it's going to set forth its chargeable 
3  and non-chargeable amounts as audited, and it will say, 
4  as it did -- as it's done in the briefs before us, on 
5
6  chargeable.  And the union members can come in and give 
7  a Lehnert objection, those who want to.  Those who 
8  don't, know it's happened, and they agree to it.

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. YOUNG:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And what's now proposed is, 

 We -- we, and I believe this Court in
 
1
2  Hudson, presume that any reasonable -- reasonably
 
3  competent union management would -- would have
 
4  relatively stable expenditures over the years.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't -- isn't the premise 
5
6  of Hudson that you give the notice before, before -- you 
7  receive the notice before you have to cough up the 
8  money? 
9
10
11  well, for -- if there's an additional assessment, you 
12  cough up the money first, and then later you straighten 
13  it out.  And I -- do you get -- do you get the interest? 
14
15
16  June 2005 notice were left in the dark -- indeed, the 
17  union may have been in the dark -- as to this special 
18  assessment.  But once the union agreed to -- decided to 
19  impose the special assessment, the union was required by 
20
21  perhaps it is less predictive, less accurate, to say we 
22  intend to spend the money this way.  But when you have 
23  an assessment which is purely intended for politics, and 
24  that's what the union said, to create a Political 
25

Hudson's principles to shed some light.  You know, 

 MR. YOUNG:  That seems to me to be the 

problem, Justice Scalia.  The people who got the June --

3  year?  I thought your Hudson notice told you this was 
4  the breakdown for the last year, and as far as we can 
5
6  things could change.  What does the Hudson notice tell 
7  you? 
8
9  with an opportunity to object and some assurance,

13
14  a fair description, Justice Breyer.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do they -- do they 
17  carry over from one year to the next, or do you have to 
18  refile your objection to the union expenditures every 
19  year?

21  require an annual objection.  Now, of course, there 
22  would be nothing -- we find nothing wrong with an annual 
23  challenge requirement if you choose to challenge that 
24  year's figures, because obviously it's a specific event.

MR. YOUNG:  But that's not raised in this

of union activities, in an election year they're going 
to divert more of whatever accessible moneys they have

they'll go back to normal for 3 years.

 MR. COLLINS:  That's correct, Your Honor, 
4  and the reason for that is when the events in this 
5
6  were being challenged, the instinct was we're going to

22  or will they go back to the old system? 
23
24  belabor the term "special assessment" at the moment, but 
25

that the questions presented were really presented, the 
officers of the union, who are not the ones involved in 
the original case, thought about the situation and came 
to the realization that they have no stake in the 
procedures that are at issue here.  This is a local that 
had never done a mid-year increase in the past.  The --
what was contemplated as a temporary increase here 
turned into a permanent increase.  The dues went up to 
1.5 percent of salary a year after this increase ended. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What does this local, and 

what will the other locals, do in the future when 

 MR. COLLINS:  This local -- and I won't

for two reasons. 

 First, when we state that the district court 

1  misunderstanding around that, Justice Alito.  But this 
2  local has put in a procedure which frankly would satisfy 
3  the Petitioners' concerns for the future if future 
4  conduct was legitimately at issue here.  But it is not, 
5
6
7  judgment be reinstated, that's a judgment that was not 
8  appealed by the Petitioners.  That defines the limits of 
9  what they can attain from this case, whatever this Court 
may decide, and that decision gives whatever protection 
10
11 
it gives against future conduct.  Now, it gives 
essentially none for a very good reason.  This was a 
12 
13 
case, as has been noted, brought only about a one-time 
event.  There were no allegations of an ongoing 
14 
practice.  There was no request for declaratory or 
15
16 
injunctive relief to prevent --
17
18  Mr. Young's argument, there is a serious dispute about 
19  the adequacy of this notice, and it might be a dispute 
20
21  satisfying claims, or it might be a dispute about 
22  whether it allowed refunds easily enough, but that Mr. 
23  Young is contesting whether the notice complied with the 
24  district court's order.
25

about whether it was clear enough, about that it was 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Collins, as I understand 

 Now, as long as that's true, don't we have a

in a posture where this Court, in disposing of it, needs 
to grant certain relief or clarification of the status 
of prior orders; and yet, the case is moot on the merits 
such that the Court cannot appropriately reach the 
merits.

1  live case before us?  Somebody has to answer that 
2  question about whether your notice complied with the 
3  order, and if it's the case that a court has to answer 
4  that question, doesn't that depend on the questions 
5
6
7  And the Court's explained in a number of cases, 
8  beginning I think with Walling v. Reuter and also, 
9  obviously, Munsingwear and U.S. Bancorp, a case can be 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  dispute -- and I'll explain in a moment why there really 
17  isn't.  But if there is a dispute, for example, as to 
18  whether an individual failed to get their refund because 
19  the notice was inadequate, that dispute is not affected 
20
21
22  reinstated, then the question of whether we have fully 
23  provided all relief called for by that judgment, which 
24  we believe we have, would be before the district court 
25

by and requires no decision of this Court. 

 If the district court judgment is

for decision, unaffected by --

28

people don't. 

 And I guess I'm following up on Justice 

wayside. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But this is not --
1
2  this is not an incidental matter.  I mean, the whole 
3  point of your friend's argument with the Hudson notice 
4  is they want people to understand what's happening with 
the -- their union money.  And they say this notice 
5
6  didn't let people know that.  And if the case is not 
7  moot and if they prevail, they will have a right to be 
8  heard on what the notice should say.  And that will make 
9  a difference in how many people opt out or how many 
10
11
12  Kagan's question.  That's a very important part of this 
13  case, what the notice is going to say, and if we accept 
14  your view that it's moot, that issue goes by the 
15
16
17  Mr. Chief Justice, for two reasons:  First of all, the 
18  district court required a certain kind of notice to be 
19  given.  We are stating the district court judgment 
should be reinstated.  If the notice we have given does 
20
21  not comport with what the district court judgment, which 
22  was not appealed by the Petitioners, requires, it will 
23  be provided by the district court. 
24
25

 We are -- we are not contesting -- the 
Petitioners are looking a gift horse in the mouth. 

 MR. COLLINS:  I think that's incorrect, 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I don't 

 MR. COLLINS:  No, I don't think that's 

the notice you sent out, the district court doesn't have 

1
2  see how that -- I don't see how that works. 
 The notice is only required by the district 
3
4  court if the case is not moot.  If the case is moot by 
5
6  a case on the basis of which to order a different 
7  notice. 
8
9  correct, Your Honor.  A case can be moot in this Court 
-- and this is what I believe Munsingwear, Walling v. 
10
11 
Reuter, and the other cases, U.S. Bancorp more recently, 
explain.  And, at first, it seems paradoxical, but it is 
12 
13 
not paradoxical.  A case -- there can be remaining 
issues potentially in the district court, such as 
14 
whether the check that the plaintiff paid bounced or 
15
not, that could potentially have to be resolved by a 
16 
17 
district court.  And it -- but it means, at least in 
terms of prudential mootness, there is not a substantive 
18 
merits issue remaining for the court to be deciding. 
19 
And it's really quite simple.  The Petitioners, as I 
20
21 
say, are looking a gift horse in the mouth. 
 The apex, the acme, that they can achieve in 
22
23  this case, is what they got from the district court, and 
24  it was reversed.  We are saying give it back to them. 
25

Take back the reversal, reinstate the judgment. 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 But let me explain the second point, if I 

incorrect.  The district court said that the 2005 notice 

1  Whatever they won, they will have.  We believe we have 
2  already given them everything they want.  If we have 
3  not, the district court will do that. 
4
may, Mr. Chief Justice, which is that there is no 
5
6  legitimate issue here about whether the notice was 
7  adequate.  Mr. Young stated quite incorrectly that the 
8  notice we have provided is the same as the notice the 
9  district court struck down.  That's absolutely 
10
11  issued before the dues increase obviously did not give 
12  specific notice of the dues increase, although it stated 
13  that dues could be increased. 
14
15
16  described the so-called fund and the dues increase, and 
17  the purposes of it, was completely adequate.  And the 
18  notice the district court -- one also has to realize the 
19  district court was requiring the union to refund only 
the non-chargeable portion of activities attributed to 
20
21  this increase. 
 A certain kind of notice would be needed for 
22
23  that to justify how the union was computing what it was 
24  saying with the chargeable portion to refund.  But what 
the union has done here is provide greater relief than 
25

 The district court specifically held, at 

Petition Appendix 73a, that the 2006 notice, which

 So, there's no serious question that the 

notice that the union sent out, which explained what the 

1  the district court ordered.  We have refunded every 
2  penny that anyone who requests had paid during the 
3  increase. 
4
5
6  increase had been spent on, sufficiently informed 
7  individuals as to whether they now want to get back

3  the burden is on a union to give a second Hudson notice 
4  whenever there is a special assessment?  Meaning do you 
5
6  assessments --
7
8
9  incremental cost is to the union of giving such notice?
10
11  extensive answer, I believe, Justice Sotomayor, partly 
12  because --
13
14  wasn't looking to monopolize you.
15
16  I believe the word "special assessment" is being used 
17  here with a meaning that doesn't correspond to what this 
18  union did.  I can say this much:  There's never --
19  there's been only one other case in any Federal court 
that I'm aware of, and only in a district court, there's 
20
21  been no other appellate court, dealing with any kind of 
22  assessment, a temporary dues increase, and how it 
23  affects Hudson rights. 
24
25

 So, this is a -- a non-event in the real 

world.  There are -- there are no challenges that have 

 MR. COLLINS:  That requires a fairly 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Try to summarize it.  I 

 MR. COLLINS:  I understand, but I believe --

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 But unions use assessments in two -- in many 

1  -- that have been made previously to any kinds of 
2  assessments or increases. 
3
4  different ways.  And let me contrast one way with what 
happened here, and I think it will show why there's no 
5
6  serious question here about a need for a notice. 
7
 Some unions have a dues structure which 
8  covers only certain kinds of activities.  And they 
9  contemplate a new kind of activity that they would not 
normally pay for out of dues or fees.  They say often 
10
11 
with -- with a vote, which was not required here.  There 
was -- there was no vote required or taken here of 
12 
13 
bargaining unit members for what occurred in this 
instance.
14 
15
16  to make a kind of expenditure that's really 
17  unanticipated.  It's not what we normally do with our 
18  dues.  We're going to put it to a vote.  If you approve 
19  it, we'll collect it.  We'll probably put it in a 
20
21
22  potential issues, I would acknowledge, under Hudson. 
23  It's worlds away from what we have here because all that 
24  happened in this case was that the union increased, from 
25

1 percent to 1.25 percent of salary, the regular 

 But you may have a union that says:  We want 

segregated fund separate from our treasury. 

 That kind of an assessment can raise

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it incorrect that this
 

was for what was termed a "Political Fight-Back Fund"? 

 MR. COLLINS:  It was -- some union 

basically to fight back at the bargaining table and to 
fight back politically. 

1  membership dues and the fees based on those dues that
 
2  were deducted by employers and paid into the union's
 
3  general treasury --
4
5
6
7  communications described it as having that sole -- that 
8  purpose.  The October 27th letter, which was the most 
9  detailed explanation, said it had two purposes, 
10
11 
12
 But what's essential, Justice Alito, it was 
13  never suggested nor was it ever the case that this money 
14  would be in any way segregated or treated as a separate 
15
16  problem here.  Basically, Petitioners' position is based 
17  on the fallacy exposed in Schermerhorn of trying to take 
18  part of a unified general treasury and treat it as if it 
19  were a distinct entity, because --
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

example, and maybe you'll say that this is different 
from your case and the rules should be different in 
these two cases.  The annual dues for particular -- for 
members of this union are 1 percent of their salaries, 
and let's say that amounts to -- or it's a certain 

entity, so to speak.  So, we have the Schermerhorn

 Now, during the course of the year, the 

exactly reversed:  90 percent is for non-chargeable; 10 
percent is for chargeable.  So, now a nonmember who 
potentially wants to object has $450 at stake.  Now, in 
that situation, why shouldn't there be separate notice? 
Aren't the economic incentives quite different?
 MR. COLLINS:  If I understand the 

1  percentage of their salaries, and let's say that amounts 
2  to $500 annual dues.  And let's say that, in the prior 
3  year, 90 percent of the money collected by the union was 
4  used for chargeable purposes, 10 percent for 
non-chargeable purposes.  So, someone who objected, a 
5
6  nonmember who objected, would be able to get back $50.

20
21  Justice Alito, I don't think one would guess from 
22  anything that has been said today that we're talking 
23  about a period of time when the union's chargeable 
24  spending increased and its non-chargeable spending 
25

 What needs to be explained here, though, 

decreased.  We're talking about a period of time when

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, the problem -- it would 
be a closer question, but I think not, because, again, 

1  objecting nonmembers did not even pay their pro rata 
2  share of the concededly chargeable expenditures, meaning 
3  they did not pay one penny for any political activities. 
4
hypothetical may be very different from what happened 
5
6  here, and maybe it's an unrealistic hypothetical; and 
7  you can answer that.  But if -- if it were to occur, 
8  should there not be Hudson notice?

14  is going to be used to weigh in, in favor of one 
gubernatorial candidate against another, in favor of one 
15
16  slate of legislative candidates against another?  And on 
17  those issues, the nonmembers may have very strong 
18  partisan and ideological objections.  So, why should 
19  they not be given a notice at that time --
20
21
22  not to give what would be at a minimum a -- an 
23  interest-free loan --

3  Justice Alito.  I think in your hypothetical, one might
 
4  be able to say -- there might be more facts needed, but
 
5
6  something that could not be anticipated reasonably by 
7  the person who got the notice. 
 In this case, however -- and this is crucial 
8
9  to this case -- the notice in 2005 told every nonmember 
that, of our $38 million budget, we spent 43.6 percent 
10
11 
of it last year on non-chargeable activities.  And if 
you do not object, we will spend whatever amount out of 
12 
13 
our roughly $40 million budget in the coming year on 
various activities as we perceive the need, including 
14 
specifically ballot initiatives, which were specifically 
15
mentioned in the notice as one of the things the union 
16

spent its money on.

21  initiative.  That's what the literature suggests, that 
22  this was not sort of the normal run in the course --
23  every 2 years, every election cycle, we spend something. 
24  That's why it's a special assessment.
25

 Now --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought your 

point, though -- this was a very special ballot

that, in addition to the money that was attributed to 
the dues increase and spent in opposing these ballot 
propositions, additional money, approximately 
$2 million, was spent on those same purposes from the 
pre-increase dues.

2  it's usually used, to mean a very short-term assessment

22  September -- September.  September of year two, we look 
23  back to year one, and we see what the percentages were.

And we go and get approval or opt-outs on that basis.

 You're making the argument that however you 

 Now -- but there's a new argument that's 

saying?  It's not a special assessment.  It wasn't 
really -- et cetera.  Okay. 

 Now, what I thought coming in here is that 
1
2  the problem was going to be, if you have to have a new 
3  notice in the middle of the year for special political 
4  assessments, you're going to discover that half the time 
you don't know if they're special political assessments. 
5
6  It's an impossible line to draw.  It's really tough. 
7
8  draw the line, we're on the right side of it, not the 
9  wrong side.  Isn't that what -- basically what you're 
10
11 
12
13  come along that I hadn't focused on, that we can avoid 
14  the administrative problem by saying all special 
assessments require a new notice, whether they're for 
15
16  political purposes or not.  Hence the question that I 
17  was trying to get -- I was very interested in your 
18  answer.  If we had that rule, which avoids the problem 
19  of saying which is which, how does that affect the 
union?  Not necessarily yours but unions in general. 
20
21  How often is it that you draw up your budget for year 
22  two in September, you put it into effect, and then 
23  during the year, you discover you need more money from 
24  people for any reason, and, therefore, you change what 
you thought they were going to contribute?  How often,

2  position than I.  Does it happen a lot, rarely, a 
3  little?  What do you want to say? 
 MR. COLLINS:  I -- I --
4
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And a footnote:  And if 
5
6  it happens a lot, how burdensome is it? 
7
 MR. COLLINS:  I will get to that, Justice 
8  Sotomayor.  I have tried to determine how frequent it 
9  is, and I've been unable.  All I've been able to 
determine is there's no litigation over it.  How 
10
11 
often -- and I've been able to determine that so-called 
assessments take many different forms from -- and I 
12 
13 
think there are crucial distinctions -- from funding 
what would -- a kind of charge that would not otherwise 
14 
be funded out of dues for some short period of time, to 
15
the opposite extreme, what we have here and what I don't 
16 
17 
think would be called an assessment frankly by anything 
I've read, a temporary dues increase which became 
18 
permanent and which simply increased the total flow of 
19 
dues and fees into the general treasury and which went 
20
for the usual -- the kinds of activities the union had 
21 
22 
always funded.  And in that regard, there's one --
23
24  my question?
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you please answer 

 MR. COLLINS:  The burden? 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

whereas I've been trying to explain the spending that 

that happened here that is undisputed but hasn't been 
discussed is that collective bargaining costs were up 
six-fold in 2005 over 2004, and they were up six-fold in 
2006 over 2005. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  The burden. 
1
2
 MR. COLLINS:  The burden consists of two 
3  things, Justice Sotomayor.  The -- if a union has to 
4  give a new Hudson notice in a situation like this, 
5
6  went on is really not different from what one would have 
7  reasonably anticipated given the notice, then we have 
8  litigation and disputes about the need for new notices 
9  whenever any number of things happen, because one thing 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
mean, we're dealing with the situation where the union 
15
16  is compelling nonunion members to give them money for 
17  political activities.  We allow, as I understand Hudson, 
18  as I read it, because you can't figure out what that is, 
19  you wait until the end of the year.  In other words, 
20
21  Normally, you wouldn't allow it at all, as -- at least 
22  under the law as I read it, you would not allow people 
23  to take money -- you would not allow the union to take 
24  money from people who don't want to spend it on 
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One reason -- I 

it's a compromise for administrative convenience. 

political activities so the union can spend it on 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

additional charge, there you don't have the 

1  political activities.  But we allow that in the course 
2  of the year because it's impossible as you go on to sort 
3  these things out.  I thought the argument on the other 
4  side was when you have a special assessment, an 
5
6  administrative problem.  You can tell it's .25 percent. 
7  So, you can't take that until you tell them, do you want 
8  to object or are you happy -- are you fine with having 
9  this spent on political purposes?
 MR. COLLINS:  The reason, Mr. Chief Justice, 
10
11  that it isn't that straight forward is quite simply that 
12  all of these questions about it's a special assessment, 
13  we can figure out what it is, we can treat it 
14  separately, flounder when one realizes that the 
15
16  because if I were to try to imagine -- let's try to 
17  imagine the notice that could have been given.  If I was 
18  giving a new notice in the fall of 2005 to explain to 
19  all nonmembers how things look now compared to what 
20
21  was given, I would say the following, completely 
22  consistent with all the facts of record in this case as 
23  revealed in the audits.  I would say:  We've determined 
24  we need more income.  Part of this is because we 
25

so-called special assessment is simply a dues increase, 

they -- how they may have looked when the Hudson notice 

anticipate $3.7 million in fight-back expenses this 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 On the Petitioners' theory -- and this is 

why Schermerhorn is the complete answer to their 

1  year.  Another part is we expect more than $3-1/2 
2  million of additional bargaining costs this year, and we 
3  expect a lot of other changes in our costs. 
4
5
6  theory -- there's a constitutional violation if the 
7  union says we're going to view this increase as paying 
8  for our additional political costs, and it's going to 
9  free up our bargaining -- our general treasury for the 
bargaining.  That's a violation.  But if you say we're 
10
11  going to treat this increase as covering those new 
12  bargaining costs we told you about, that's going to free 
13  up our general treasury for the political costs --
14
15
16  this assessment would be used -- and they're quoting 
17  from union material -- "for a broad range of political 
18  expenses, including television, radio advertising, 
19  direct mail, voter registration, voter education, and 
get out the vote activities in our work sites and in 
20
21  communities across California."  And it further said, 
22  quote, "The fund will not be used for regular costs of 
23  the union such as office rent, staff salaries or routine 
24  equipment replacement."
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But on the -- I'm 
reading from the district court opinion.  It said that 

 MR. COLLINS:  But two points, 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But, as Schermerhorn points out, 

that is why -- my point to you, Mr. Chief Justice, is 

Schermerhorn says even if you specifically say this part 

1  Mr. Chief Justice:  First, as the court of appeals 
2  pointed out, there were other statements that said the 
3  money would be used for both purposes. 
4
5
6  of our dues income is going to be earmarked for this 
7  purpose, it's artificial when you're dealing with a 
8  general union treasury, not a separate segregated fund, 
9  to give that separate legal status.  And that -- because 
10
11  nothing in the world would have changed here. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose that the --
12
13
 MR. COLLINS:  If --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose that the proponents 
14
15
16  said, would you please give us an interest-free loan for 
17  money because we want to use this money to -- to 
18  persuade the electorate to enact these; but don't worry 
19  because we're going to pay it back right after the 
election, when we've achieved our electoral ends.

money back -- we're going to use your money to achieve a 

1  doubt that you -- that they would.  But what's the 
2  difference?  If you look at this from the perspective of 
3  a nonmember who doesn't want those ballot initiatives to 
4  be defeated, saying that we're going to give you your 
5
6  political end that you oppose, but don't worry because 
7  we're going to give it back to you next year after we've 
8  achieved our political end -- how does that solve the 
9  problem?
 MR. COLLINS:  That's not the situation here, 
10
11  Justice Alito.  The nonmembers were told in June 2005 in 
12  the Hudson notice that if you don't object, we may spend 
13  millions of dollars on political activities, including 
14  ballot initiatives.  If a person didn't want to support 
that, they merely need to object.  What then happened --
15
16  and this is what gets lost in the messaging about the 
17  dues increase.  What actually happened in the real world 
18  in the period that followed is that, compared to the 
19  numbers in the 2004 Hudson notice, the union spent less 
20
21  matters.  And the only reason there's a case here in the 
22  Court is that the union, for whatever PR purposes, 
23  whatever it may have been, instead of saying we're going 
24  to treat the increase as covering our vastly increased 
25

on non-chargeable matters and more on chargeable 

bargaining costs, thereby freeing up money for politics,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It -- it seems to me that 

1  we're instead going to describe this increase as being 
2  attributable to our political costs, thereby freeing up 
3  money for bargaining.  But what the union is spending 
4  its -- its money on is bargaining.  More money --
5
6  this answer is -- is so confusing that the Court 
7  probably should consider whether or not an opt-in

90 percent political.  And the point there was that 
you're taking someone's money contrary to that person's 
conscience.  And that's what the First Amendment stands 
against.  And you simply wouldn't answer that question.

 My point is very simple.  Anyone reading the 

1  believe -- I was not meaning to avoid it, 
2  Justice Kennedy.  What I thought I said is, if you are 
3  springing something on someone that's not anticipated in 
4  the notice that gave them their rights to object, then 
5
6
7  2005 Hudson notice, if that person was asked -- if I 
8  don't -- if you -- if I don't object, might the union 
9  spend $3.7 million next year on ballot initiatives that 
I may not want to oppose?  The answer would be yes.  The 
10

notice made it perfectly clear.

17  that the governmental employer has fiscal stability?

19  yes, by unions.

22  bargaining involves a core political judgment?

9
it does require some forced loans, that's true, but it
