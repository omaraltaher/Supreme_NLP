 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-295, Travelers 
Indemnity Company v. Bailey, and Common Law Settlement 
Counsel v. Bailey.

 Mr. Ostrager.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In 1988, the Second Circuit decided in two 
separate decisions that a bankruptcy court exercising 
its core jurisdiction had properly confirmed the plan of 
reorganization that resolved present and future claims 
against Johns-Manville and the insurers who funded 
Manville's reorganization plan.  Last year, despite its 
decades-old rulings to the contrary, the Second Circuit 
sustained a collateral attack on the confirmation order 
and held that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter 
jurisdiction back in 1986 to enjoin direct actions 
against Travelers, quote, "based upon, arising out of, 
or related to," close quote --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Ostrager, you have 

characterized the Second Circuit's decision in a way the

Second Circuit did not.  The Second Circuit said:  The 
confirmation of the 1986 order stands, but that order 
did not encompass what was added in 2004; that is, that 
order dealt with the debtor, with Manville and the 
insurer's obligation to cover Manville's liability.  The 
Second Circuit said:  Now, this 2004 order, which 
concerns independent actions against insurers for their 
own wrong, was never encompassed in the order that they 
affirmed.  So I think it's quite unfair to say it's a 
collateral attack on the 1986 order.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Justice Ginsburg, the 

bankruptcy court judge, interpreting his own order, 
explicitly held that the 1986 order was intended and was 
always intended to enjoin direct actions against 
Travelers based upon, arising out of, or relating to the 
insurance policies Manville purchased from Travelers.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  At the time of the 1986 

order, had these independent actions started?  I thought 
at the time of the 1986 order the concerns were suits 
involving Manville's liability and the insurers' 
derivative obligation to cover.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Justice Ginsburg, at the time 
of the 1986 order there had been various forms of direct 
action filed against Manville, and the bankruptcy court 
concluded, and the Second Circuit recognized, that a

settlement with the insurers was essential for the 
reorganization and rehabilitation of Manville --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The insurers, to the 

extent of the insurance proceeds.  That's what created 
the pot that made the settlement fund.  But what I'm 
trying to get at is this extra piece, because the only 
information we have is that Manville -- there was the 
conversation that's reported in the Chubb brief.  This 
question came up, well, what about actions against the 
insurers for their own wrongs?  And the answer was, oh, 
those aren't covered.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  The plan of reorganization as 

ultimately confirmed contained the language to which I 
directed the Court.  It -- a plan of confirmation 
included all aspects of the resolution of the Manville 
estate.  The confirmation order was all about ensuring 
fairness to all claimants.  It was all about expanding 
the value of the estate, and it was all about 
rehabilitating the debtor for the benefit of its 
employees, suppliers, and local claimants.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, Mr. Ostrager, is --
help me out, because this is an issue of fact, and I 
don't have the record in front of me now.  But didn't 
the 1986 order expressly include permission for certain 
actions alleging insurer misconduct to proceed, those

that had already been filed?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  It did.  It did, yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I drew the implication from 

that that the -- that the bankruptcy court thought its 
order would be barring such actions if they had not 
already been filed.  Am I right on the -- on the -- at 
least on the record point?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  You are right on the record 

point.  However, Judge Lifland in the hearings that were 
associated with his clarifying order was very explicit 
that he use the words "based upon, arising out of, or 
related to" for the express purpose of granting 
Travelers the broadest relief that could be afforded to 
Travelers post-confirmation.  And --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But he was saying that --

in effect, that was simply articulating rather more than 
he had done the first time around and what he intended 
the first time around.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Well, he certainly intended 
to make the cornerstone of the Manville reorganization 
work.  And as the Second Circuit itself held, in a 
subsequent collateral attack, the O'Malley case --
reported at 100 F.3d 944, a 1996 case where there was a 
challenge to the bankruptcy court's reaffirmation and 
continuation of the '86 order, Second Circuit held in

1996 that such an injunction is essential to the success 
of the settlement, and its continuation was well within 
the discretion of the trial court.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Was the Second Circuit's 

decision based on an interpretation of the confirmation 
order or was it based on subject matter jurisdiction?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  The Second Circuit order was 
explicitly predicated on the theory that the bankruptcy 
court lacked subject matter jurisdiction back in 1986 to 
enjoin these direct actions.

 Now, we submit that the Second Circuit 

clearly erred, because it conflated the entirely 
distinct concept of the court's subject matter 
jurisdiction and the propriety of the court's exercise 
of subject matter jurisdiction.  This was a distinction 
that this Court expressly recognized 75 years ago in the 
Continental Illinois v. Rock Island Railroad.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, there is a 

distinction between jurisdiction and whether the action 
taken by the bankruptcy court comes within the statute. 
But at some point, at some point surely the two overlap. 
I mean, suppose -- you know, you say simply because it 
is a bankruptcy action it comes within the bankruptcy 
clause and there is jurisdiction.  But what if the 
bankruptcy court in connection with the bankruptcy

decrees that a totally unrelated company has to pay a 
certain amount of money and it's conceded that this 
company has no relation to the bankruptcy, but the court 
says, this is a national problem and this other company 
ought to contribute.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think that would be 

within the bankruptcy power?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Justice Scalia, clearly the 

Congress in fashioning over the years expansive 
safeguards facilitating growth and change in the 
bankruptcy law as our nation's commerce has grown has 
done that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They can do anything under 

the bankruptcy law?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  No.  Subject to appropriate 

safeguards.  Now, in order to confirm a plan of 
reorganization a -- a debtor must meet all 16 
requirements of section 1129.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay, that's fine.  I'm not 

arguing about that.  I'm arguing about the principle 
that you are asking us to accept, to wit, that this 
challenge cannot possibly be based upon jurisdiction. 
Surely there are some things that simply do not fall 
within the bankruptcy power.  Isn't that true?

MR. OSTRAGER:  I would agree that that is 

so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  And that --
MR. OSTRAGER:  This is not our case.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what you are saying 

is this does fall within the bankruptcy power.  But 
don't tell us that it is not a challenge based upon the 
jurisdiction of the court and based exclusively upon the 
statute.  It could be based upon both.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Justice Scalia, I would say 
that the bankruptcy court in this case unquestionably 
had jurisdiction over the Manville reorganization under 
28 U.S.C. 1334(b) as the Manville reorganization was a 
civil proceeding arising under Title 11 of the 
Bankruptcy Code.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Second Circuit's view 

was that the bankruptcy court has no authority, no 
subject matter jurisdiction, when the debtor -- debtor's 
liability is not in question.  The Second Circuit 
thought, rightly or wrongly, that when the liability is 
between two- the question is between two nondebtors, 
Travelers on the one hand, the claimants on the other, 
Manville is not in the picture.  That's what the Second 
Circuit said, it falls outside the domain of the 
bankruptcy court, and that could be wrong or it could be

right.  But in the Second Circuit's view the bankruptcy 
court lacked authority to deal with the nondebtors' 
liability to the claimants.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  There were, Justice Ginsburg, 
60 pages of findings of fact indicating that the direct 
action suits against Manville was an end run around the 
--

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The direct actions 

against Travelers.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Against Travelers, were an 
end run around the discharge of Manville, and that all 
of the claims against Travelers arose out of and flowed 
to the insurance relationship.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Ostrager, may I ask 

this question.  I -- I was unable to find the complaints 
in the voluminous filings here.  Do any of the 
plaintiffs' cases seek recovery from assets of the 
estate that would reduce the payments to creditors of 
Manville?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Well, the reason that this is 

so critical is that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you answer my 

question?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  They do not seek assets of 
the estate, although Travelers would potentially have

contribution claims against Manville because all of the 
claims --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why does the 

bankruptcy court have jurisdiction to enjoin third party 
actions against some creditor of the estate?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  The Respondents actually 
concede that bankruptcy courts have subject matter 
jurisdiction to enjoin actions against non-debtors in 
appropriate circumstances.  That's the Chubb brief at 
pages 22 and 40.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if those actions won't 

affect the estate at all, I just don't understand sort 
of the basic theory, and I don't really understand the 
theory of the plaintiffs' cases, either.  I don't 
understand -- I can't figure out what anybody expects to 
collect from Travelers for what they did.  The fact that 
they defended cases certainly was proper for them as an 
insurance company.  This is mysterious case to me.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Justice Stevens , you are 
absolutely right that these direct action cases have 
never been sustained because they all relate to the 
discharge by Travelers of Travelers' obligations as 
Manville's insurer, and that's one of the reasons why 
the bankruptcy court judge issued the injunction.

 Now, the Second --

12 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  These were cases in the 

State courts and, as I understand it, so far none of 
them have succeeded.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  That is correct.
 The Second Circuit also completely ignored 
the enactment by Congress of sections 524(g) and (h) of 
the Bankruptcy Code, which are modelled on the Manville 
reorganization, and expressly grandfather the Manville 
injunction as a final order that could not be revoked.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How could you say they 
ignored it when they had several pages devoted to 524, 
and they said it was -- it didn't cover these so-called 
direct actions, which really aren't what we generally 
call direct actions.  But the Second Circuit did address 
what Congress did to codify essentially the Manville 
device.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  I would respectfully 

disagree.  524(g) specifically says that asbestos --
asbestos channeling injunction "shall be valid and 
enforceable and may not be revoked or modified by any 
court except through direct appeal."  And 524(h)(i) 
specifically says that the pre-1994 asbestos channeling 
injunctions shall be considered to meet all of the 
requirements of 524(g)(2), which is in our appendix at 
page 471, which means that they automatically meet

524(g)(3)(A)(i) and may not be revoked or modified 
except through appeal.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  How do -- how do these 

pending actions have any impact on fulfilling the 
objections -- objectives of the channeling instruction 
or affect the disposition of the assets in the estate? 
I just don't understand it.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  The essential issue here, 

Justice Stevens, is that there would have been no 
Manville reorganization --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but there has been 

one and it's been a success.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  It's been a remarkable 

success.  Asbestos claimants have received -- 660,000 
asbestos claimants have received --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  None of whom would be 

affected --

MR. OSTRAGER:  -- more than $2.8 billion.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But none of whom would be 
affected if these suits go forward, as I understand it. 
I'm missing something very important, I think.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  The point is that there 
couldn't have been have a Manville reorganization 
without the insurance settlements.  The Second Circuit 
recognized that.  The Second Circuit further recognized

that these direct actions violate the express terms of 
the injunction that Judge Lifland, the bankruptcy judge, 
granted in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why isn't it harmless 

error?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  The 524(g)(4)(A)(2)(iii) 

specifically authorizes asbestos channeling injunctions 
that bar any claim against the third party to be 
directly or indirectly liable for claims against the 
debtor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if part of the 
settlement -- I mean, Travelers says, we need to get 
more out of this before we're going to put in all the 
policy funds; the bankruptcy judge says, well, you are 
going to be immune from any traffic accident liability; 
and there is a traffic accident and Travelers said: 
Well, the bankruptcy court said I don't have to pay.  Is 
that all right?  It's within the jurisdiction as you 
read it because it involves Travelers it's related to 
the funds they submitted into the trust account.  Is 
that --

MR. OSTRAGER:  Mr. Chief justice, that would 

not be covered and that is certainly not what the 
bankruptcy court intended or said.

didn't intend anything with respect to traffic 
accidents.  But my question is how far does your theory 
reach?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  This Court has recognized in 

the Katz case that bankruptcy extends beyond the res.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So there would be 

jurisdiction in the hypothetical that I posed?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Not in the hypothetical you 
posed.  On direct appeal that would clearly be excluded 
because it wouldn't meet --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right, on direct 

appeal.  Are you suggesting it would be barred -- that 
Travelers would have protection under a collateral 
attack?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  I don't think we need to 
reach that issue in this case.  There is no question 
that in connection with exercising its subject matter 
jurisdiction over the Manville reorganization the 
bankruptcy court had the power under section 105 of the 
Bankruptcy Code to issue any order, process or judgment 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of 
Title 11.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but it seems to me 

you --

that's not true.  You acknowledge that they couldn't 
have issued the hypothetical order that the Chief 
Justice proposed, even if that was necessary, even if 
Travelers said, we will not kick in the money up to the 
limits of our liability unless you make us immune from 
all traffic accidents.  You acknowledged that that's no 
good, right?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  In this order the -- the 

limitation on the injunction was based upon arising out 
of or related to.  I would submit that the traffic 
accident falls outside the scope of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is that?  It --
it involves one -- it involves the insurance company, 
its coverage of Johns-Manville.  And the Travelers is 
saying:  Look, we are not going to do it unless you give 
us this -- this broader immunity, and the bankruptcy 
judge does it.  I don't know why it would be outside the 
jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.  It is clearly 
related to allowing the settlement to go forward.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Well, I -- I think we have an 

act of Congress, 524(g) and (h), which --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I interrupt you 
there?  Because you told me that the Second Circuit 
ignored 524(g), and I'm looking at page 33a of the

524(g), and its discussion continues for a couple pages. 
I don't see how that's ignoring the issue.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  With -- with respect, I 

believe that there are express findings of fact that the 
bankruptcy court made which were adopted by the district 
court, which were embraced in full by the Second 
Circuit, and we have a -- a pure issue of law here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And may I -- may I have 

an answer to my question about the Second Circuit 
ignoring 524(g) when they devoted two and a half pages 
to it?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  I believe that they clearly 

misinterpreted the intent of 524(g) and (h).  They 
clearly misperceived the fact that Congress had 
expressly grandfathered the Manville injunction in 
524(g).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Another mystery in this 

most mysterious case:  If it was so clear that the 
original order, the 1986 order, insured Travelers that 
it would have no liability for asbestos claims, period, 
then why did it put up $400 million, much more than it 
had put up originally, in order to settle with people 
who were bringing precisely that kind of claim?

case was referred to mediation before the Honorable 
Mario Cuomo.  And in connection with that mediation 
there was a business decision made to secure releases 
much broader than the injunction that was contained. 
Travelers would in connection with the mediation process 
participate in a settlement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the difference 
between the release that you say flowed from the 1986 
order and the releases that were obtained with the 
$400 million?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  One was a general -- one was 

a general release and the other was a release based 
upon, arising out of, or related to the Manville 
insurance policies that Travelers purchased --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, specifically what was 
not included in the 1986 release that was included as a 
result of the settlement negotiations?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  It -- an absolute, broad 
general release by 80,000 people.  Now, I want to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I would like to know 
the difference.  What would -- what would Travelers be 
liable for under the 1986 order as you read it, that 
they got freedom from as a result of this settlement?
 MR. OSTRAGER:  Potentially -- potentially 

the traffic accident that Mr. Chief Justice referenced.

I want to reserve --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So then -- so that the 

2000 clarification order did exonerate them from traffic 
accidents?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  It's a general release.
 I -- I want to conclude and reserve the 

balance of my time by noting that "Redefining the scope 
of a long-final confirmation order unravels intricate 
transactions so as to knock the props out from under the 
authorization for every transaction that has taken 
place."  That's a quote from the Second Circuit's 
decision in Chateaugay Corp., 10 F.3d 944.  And that 
creates an unmanageable, uncontrollable situation for 
courts and litigants alike.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I have one question 

before you reserve the rest of your time.  That is, you 
said this is -- this is a sweeping release that 
Travelers got in settlement for the claims of many 
parties.  But some people were not there and those are 
the people who still want to bring their claims.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  I would say that the --

question.

-- what notice did the people who were left out of the 
settlement, who were not part of the settlement, who 
say, so we want our day in court -- what notice did they 
have and what opportunity to be heard?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  There was broad notice to the 

people who would be affected by the issuance of the 
injunction.  This Court has recognized --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  How did they get the 

notice?  You say it's broad notice.  What exactly was 
done?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  There were newspaper blasts 

repeatedly, all sorts of public notice, radio 
announcements.  But we are dealing with a special 
remedial scheme that expressly forecloses successive 
litigation by non-litigants and in the bankruptcy 
context --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How can it be successive 
when they didn't even get their -- I mean they -- these 
people haven't had a day in court.  They may have a 
claim that's no good.  All State courts so far have said 
their claim is no good.  But they have a right --

MR. OSTRAGER:  This is what Congress has 
made provision for in 524(g) and (h).  This is what I 
believe the Court contemplated in Ortiz at page 846, 
also in Martin v. Wilks, also in Taylor v. Stargell.

And I think this rule was foreshadowed as long ago as 
Mullaney v. Central Hanover Trust Company.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The rule -- the 

particular rule that I am asking you about is that 
people who have not had their day in court can be 
precluded --

MR. OSTRAGER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- on the basis of 

newspaper notice and radio announcements?

 MR. OSTRAGER:  As the court said in 

Mullaney, beneficiaries whose interests are either 
conjectural or future, although they could be --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was the best 

possible notice, which included regular mail notice.

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Not -- not with respect to 

future claimants who haven't had any disease.  There has 
to be finality.  That's what 524(g) and (h) says.  A 
confirmation order has to be final.  As the Court said 
in Stohl, there has to be a beginning of litigation and 
a place to end litigation.

 I would like to reserve, if I may, with 

respect, the balance of my time for rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 CASCINO ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 As the Court has indicated, this is a 

question of jurisdiction, and the issue is whether a 
bankruptcy court may enter an order that goes to a 
nondebtor, offers a release against independent State 
law claims.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, as to the 1986 order 

it seemed to me that the counsel for the Petitioner 
might have answered the question posed by the Chief 
Justice with the traffic accident hypothetical:  That is 
an interesting question of subject matter jurisdiction, 
and maybe there is subject matter jurisdiction, maybe 
there isn't, but that issue as to the 1986 order is 
final.  Now, that brings us to the -- the later order, 
2004, 2006.  And then the question is whether or not 
that's just a reiteration of the earlier order or a 
further expansion of jurisdiction that could be reached.
 Why couldn't the counsel for Petitioner have 

given that answer?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Well, the counsel for 
Petitioner can't give that answer for two separate 
reasons.  The first has to do with the subject matter

jurisdiction limitation of a bankruptcy court:  That as 
soon as the release is outside the debtor's estate and 
impact on the debtor's estate or the debtor/creditor 
relationship, that places it beyond the power of the 
bankruptcy court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, putting aside 

questions of notice, if these parties had been 
represented in the appeal of the 1986 order, maybe the 
subject matter jurisdiction ruling was correct; maybe it 
was incorrect; but it's done.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  If -- if these parties had 

been present, if they had been appealed, if this had 
been in effect a settlement orchestrated through the 
bankruptcy court, then there might be the -- the ability 
to liquidate the class action.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So then it's just a 

question of personal jurisdiction and notice.  It is not 
a question of subject matter jurisdiction, because 
subject matter jurisdiction can be concluded in an 
earlier order and there can be no collateral attack if 
you've been a party.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Justice Kennedy, it is a 
question of subject matter jurisdiction if it is not to 
be a consensual agreement.  If there is not to be -- the 
purpose of notice is to give you the opportunity to opt

out and to object --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't think there's a 

notice question.  I thought there were 5,538 plaintiffs 
here and -- that you represent, and every one of them 
has already gotten money from the trust except for two 
who have filed claims against it.  So I imagine if 
that's so, they certainly know about it.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  They do know about it.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, so there is no notice 

problem.  If there were a notice problem I guess there 
would be a due process problem.  So, I don't see what 
notice has any more to do with this than the NCAA 
tournament.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Justice Breyer, I 

misunderstood Justice's Kennedy's question to be about 
1986, not about the present.  And in 1980 -- in the 
original confirmation, these people had not filed suit, 
had not made claims at the time.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, in the original 

confirmation there are problems in asbestos cases, like 
other bankruptcy cases, of giving people notice. 
Bankrupt people often give notice to many who aren't 
there.  And I don't know that -- maybe there is a 
constitutional problem with some of them, but I would 
have thought jurisdiction under the statute is clear.

MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Well, the question is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What is -- is this about 

notice?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  No, I don't believe it is 

about notice.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't think so.  I 

thought this was about the case of the meaning of the 
words in the statute that they have authority in the 
bankruptcy court to issue any order, process or judgment 
that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the 
provisions of the title.  And we've said that the test 
is whether the outcome of the proceeding -- this is the 
other State proceeding -- could conceivably have any 
effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy. 
So, as I understood it, that's the test.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  I agree.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what -- that's what 
this Court said.  Now, they may be few and far between, 
an order like this, but where there are special reasons 
for it -- suppose it's a pension fund and you want to 
reorganize the company and this is the employees' --
they're -- the employees' pension fund's worried about 
claims which are related directly.  Or suppose it's an 
officer, or suppose it's a worker, and to reorganize the 
company you must cut the claims off.  And otherwise, it

is down the drain for everyone, no more money in the 
fund, no more jobs for the employees.

 Now, what is it here that would say there is 
no special circumstance such that a bankruptcy judge can 
ever do it, no matter what?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  In -- in your example, 

Justice Breyer, you rely upon this Court's decision in 
Celotex, which adopted the Pacor test from the Third 
Circuit.  And in each case that has applied that, the 
question is whether there is a potential impact upon the 
estate of the bankrupt.  The critical issue in this case 
is that not a single one of the claims that is presented 
ir seeks to be enjoined here has any potential impact on 
the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is what you are saying also 

true of the various other asbestos cases that have, I 
think, done this?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  There is no asbestos case 
that I am aware of that has released third party claims 
that have no impact on the debtor.  I am not aware of a 
single one.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, of course, this has 
enormous practical impact on the debtor.  If not him --
not this one, because it's already a done deal -- you 
will never get insurance companies --

MR. ISSACHAROFF:  No, I don't --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- to go into this kind of 
thing if they are going to be sued for the very act of 
helping the debtor defend the asbestos cases.  And so, I 
can't imagine an insurance company in its right mind 
going into that when in fact all these suits are still 
open.  That presumably is why the bankruptcy judge cut 
it off.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  I think that the facts of 
record indicate that Travelers went into this particular 
deal full well knowing that it was not getting this kind 
of release because that kind of release was not 
available.  And I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What do you -- what do you 

make of the provision of the 1986 order to the effect 
that, as I understand it and as I asked your brother a 
moment ago, existing claims based upon misbehavior of 
the -- of the insurance company were not cut off?  The 
reasonable implication, I think, of that is that any 
future claims based upon insurance company misconduct 
would be cut off by the terms of the '86 order.
 What -- what do you say about that 

implication?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Justice Souter, I would 

say two things.  First of all, that the record speaks to

specific negotiations between Travelers and Manville and 
between all the insurers and Manville on prospective 
liabilities of the -- of the insurance companies, so 
that the bankruptcy court can be read to be just 
cleaning up what had happened retrospectively up until 
that point.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but it was prospective 

liability based upon misconduct of the insurance 
company, not merely derivative of -- of its insurance 
contract in -- in the conventional sense.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  I -- I understand that. 

But it's also important -- I think that there was a 
question raised by Justice Alito a minute ago about what 
exactly had happened in 1986 and whether the Second 
Circuit was making findings of fact or findings of law.
 In 1988, in the MacArthur case, the Second 
Circuit relied on section 1334(d) as the jurisdictional 
basis for upholding the district -- the bankruptcy 
order.  Section 1334(d), which is now recodified as 
1334(e), has to do only with the disposition of the 
assets of the estate, the property of the estate.

 And so, the Second Circuit order in 19 -- in 

1988, which is the controlling legal authority on what 
the scope of the release was, went only to the property 
of the estate.  And so, I don't think that there was any

understanding at the time by anyone that there was a 
release of claims that were independent of the property 
of the estate or made -- or had no hold upon or 
potential impact upon the property of the estate.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why does it say -- it 

doesn't say that.  What it says in the release is it 
says:  We are releasing or everybody is enjoined from 
bringing a suit for policy claims against Travelers, and 
a policy claim is any and all claims based upon, arising 
out of, or relating to any insurance policy.

 And then the bankruptcy judge, in thousands 
of findings, I guess, said that your lawsuits do relate 
to the relevant insurance policies.  Indeed, the claims 
are based upon the joint -- the obligation of Travelers 
to defend those very policies, given the obligation to 
defend Johns-Manville.

 So the relation is exceedingly close, and 

the language covers it, and there are thousands of pages 
of findings, I guess, that show that.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Well, Your Honor, some of 

the releases that are in effect in this case go to 
conduct that occurred after 1986.  Some of them have to 
do with claims.  For example, the Wise claim which is 
referred to in the Second Circuit's opinion has to do 
with claims that have nothing to do with the coverage of

Manville.  They have to do with actions taken with 
regard to other insurers.  This is an exceedingly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Settlement clauses often 

release future claims; standard stuff in a release 
clause.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 

Contract clauses do it and class actions do it, 
consensual agreements, when there is notice, the 
opportunity to opt out, and there is volition; they 
often release much broader.  But a bankruptcy court is 
an extraordinary proceeding.  A bankruptcy court is an 
obligation that rights are terminated without any 
consensual --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that is subject matter 

jurisdiction and that is foreclosed.  Now, if you are 
talking about personal jurisdiction that may be 
something else.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  No, I'm not talking --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you're talking about 

subject matter jurisdiction and that has been foreclosed 
by the earlier Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion.  And 
the court of appeals' opinion that we are reviewing now 
seems to conflate that issue.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  I don't believe so, Your

MacArthur case, the Second Circuit was quite clear that 
all that was being released was claims against insurance 
proceeds that had been delivered and had become property 
of the estate, whose depletion could affect the estate.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  If that is -- if 

that is the case -- let's assume that that is -- that it 
was that narrow.  The fact remains, however, that at 
this point, as Justice Kennedy has suggested several 
times, my understanding is at least that you cannot 
collaterally attack the jurisdiction of the court who 
entered the order it did.  And the only claim that you 
can make now is that the order by its terms did not 
cover your cases.

 Do you agree?
 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  I agree that that is the 

general rule, that is correct.  I agree further that the 
Second Circuit expressly held at page 31a that the error 
of the bankruptcy court was that it subsequently 
interpreted the order more broadly than the Second 
Circuit had affirmed in 1988.  I think that that's the 
heart of the case, because --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  So it's a question of the 

scope of the order?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Yes, it is.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay. 

32 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Yes, it is.  There is a 
question which this Court has actually not addressed, 
which is about the prospective application of an order 
that is entered without subject matter jurisdiction.  I 
don't think there is any case squarely on point.
 Certainly there are cases that allow 

prospective collateral challenges to an order entered 
without personal jurisdiction.  I don't think the Court 
has addressed the subject matter jurisdiction, but it 
doesn't have to --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But didn't this --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I didn't mean to cut you 

off.  I'm sorry.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  I don't think the Court 
has to address this here, Your Honor, because in this 
case, the initial order only went -- as affirmed by the 
Second Circuit, only went to the property of the estate. 
And second --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I then raise a question 

there?  I mean, I think there is a legitimate question 
about that, given the -- given the rather general terms 
of the -- of the scope of the order.  And I would like 
your response to this.  It seems to me as a background 
consideration that we should have in mind in 
interpreting how broad that order was.  It's been raised

a couple times; Justice Breyer raised it a moment ago. 
And it's this:  It is one argument to say that the 
bankruptcy court does not have jurisdiction, and 
derivatively an order that it issued should not be 
interpreted to cover, any claim that does not affect or 
cannot deplete the bankruptcy estate taken as a given 
fact at the time this later case is brought.

 Another view of jurisdiction would be that 

the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction and hence an order 
might be interpreted to cover any cases which, if 
contemplated, would have precluded the settlement that 
created the bankruptcy estate.  If Travelers had thought 
that it was going to be liable for these cases of 
insurer misconduct, it might very well have said:  We're 
not forking over X hundred millions of dollars, leaving 
this exposure open.  So that the bankruptcy estate would 
never have attained the size that it attained if the --
if the insurer and everybody else had not understood 
that these later claims would be -- were being cut off.
 Is that argument a relevant -- number one, 

is that a legitimate jurisdictional argument?  And 
number two, is it a relevant argument that we should 
bear in mind -- in trying to figure out how broad the 
'86 order really was?

alternative definitions of jurisdiction.  The first one 
we have no problem with.  Obviously that's our 
argument --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Everybody accepts at that 

much.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Right.  The second one, I 

think that this Court has to go back to the Syngenta 
case, which I think is quite instructive on this point. 
In Syngenta there was a settlement in a Federal court 
action.  There is no question that the parties settled, 
that the monies were paid, everything was done pursuant 
to that settlement.  Then one of the parties goes into 
State court and files a claim that was clearly subsumed 
within the settlement.

 The district court tried to issue an order, 

saying:  I have to have power over this, because 
otherwise there could never have been a settlement.  And 
this Court unanimously reversed on the grounds that that 
had to be brought through the State court system, 
because you could not get jurisdiction simply because of 
the expediency, the necessity, any of these terms do not 
afford an affirmative grant of jurisdiction to the 
Court.  So I think --

didn't have this broader liability?  They say without 
global protections they never would have contributed to 
the trust fund.  And I would like you to answer that 
question.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  We don't know that, Your 
Honor.  We know that the record indicates that they did 
not believe in 1985, when they signed a letter among all 
the counsel that was submitted to the court, that they 
were getting any such release.  So there's nothing in 
the record that indicates that they would not have gone 
into this deal, and in fact, there have been many, many 
asbestos workouts since that time, none of which have 
releases that do not affect the debtor's estate.

 So I don't know that the factual premise is 
there.  But let's assume that it was, for the purposes 
of the question.  Let's assume that no insurance company 
would go -- go into this, unless they get releases that 
go far beyond normal jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court. 
I think that under Syngenta that has to be given to them 
by Congress.  Congress in 1334 gave specific forms of 
jurisdiction.  It gave the "arising under" and "arising 
in" which pertained to the activities of the bankrupt, 
of the debtor; and it gave "related to" and "related 
to," as this Court interpreted in Celotex, adopting the

Third Circuit standard, "related to" means that it has 
an impact upon the estate of the debtor.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't that what the Congress 

gave them in the 1994 Bankruptcy Act?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  No.  The Bankruptcy Act 
actually has very interesting language on point.  The 
Bankruptcy Act says, in 524(g)(4)(ii), says that the 
relief is for demands on the debtor, that flow from 
demands on the debtor, and by reason of the demands on 
the debtor.  That is the trigger language before we get 
to Roman numeral (iii), which has to do with insurance.

 So if one actually looks at the statute, the 

form of the statute is that there is releases to the 
extent that there is a claim of derivative liability.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you dispute the 

proposition that that statute was passed in large part 
for the purpose of codifying what was done in this case?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  I do not --
JUSTICE ALITO:  The sort of thing that was 

done in this case?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  I do not dispute that at 

all.  But what was done in this case was not simply what 
Judge Lifland did, but what Judge Lifland did as 
affirmed by the Second Circuit.  The bankruptcy court 
does not have stand-alone powers to make determinations

as pertain to, particularly, common law actions.  That 
goes back to the Marathon Pipeline issue that this Court 
had to -- had to address and that Congress sought to fix 
by maintaining a tight hold on the "relating to" 
jurisdiction of the Court and making sure that that's 
reviewable by the district court and by the court of 
appeals.  So the -- yes, Congress codified the -- the 
Manville deal in -- in 1994, but they did so as it was 
interpreted by the controlling courts.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  In your view, if Smith has 

a 2 or $4 billion claim against company X and the 
pension fund together, company X is in bankruptcy, and 
so the judge says:  "I want to enjoin this claim, we 
will settle it," you know, but the pension fund --
doesn't -- doesn't the bankruptcy judge -- if in fact 
without the pension fund you couldn't reorganize, 
wouldn't the bankruptcy judge have authority to cut off 
the claim against the pension fund?

 It's a question of whether the company goes 

down the drain or whether it doesn't.  And --

MR. ISSACHAROFF:  The rule --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the pension fund is all 

mixed up in this together.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  The rule of thumb, Justice 

Breyer, is that if there is an automatic indemnity

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, there is nothing here

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Then our position is that 

it does not have authority.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And that would be true of 

all the workforce and they have claims against the 
individual members of the workforce?  They have --
it 
seems to me it would be an unusual case, I agree with 
you on that, but to say never -- to say never is what is 
bothering me.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Well, I think that it 
comes down to two questions, Justice Breyer.  One is 
whether the constitutional authority under Article I 
reaches beyond --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why not -- because 
there is a good constitutional protection; it's called 
the due process clause.  If the bankruptcy judge goes 
too far, it's a due process violation.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  No, I don't -- I -- I 

disagree with that, Justice Breyer.  I think that the 
bankruptcy court has to point to statutory authority.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there's language, 

broad language.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Broad language.
 MR. ISSACHAROFF:  Yes, in the statute, yes. 

Yes, there is broad language in the statute.  The 
"relating to" language is quite broad.  But the 
"relating to" language has been interpreted, and every 
court that has looked at it, this Court and -- this 
Court and every court of appeals, without any dissent in 
any court of appeals that has looked at this issue --
has decided that "relating to" means an impact on the 
estate.  Without that, the bankruptcy power has no 
tethers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Cohn.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACOB C. COHN
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 CHUBB INDEMNITY INSURANCE COMPANY
 MR. COHN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 A discharge in bankruptcy wipes away a 

debtor's liability for its prepetition conduct.  Yet 
Travelers' interpretation of the 1986 orders gives 
Travelers broader protection than even Manville could 
obtain because it gives Travelers immunity for its 
knowledge.  Bankruptcy discharges do not erase a 
debtor's knowledge.

If Manville started making asbestos products 

again after its discharge, it would not be immune for 
claims that it acted with the knowledge that asbestos is 
dangerous.  Yet, that is precisely the protection that 
Travelers argues that it is entitled to here.

 And to take, for example, the Wise 

complaint -- which The Travelers, Petitioners, put forth 
as a typical claim here -- and you look at the class 
they purport to represent, they purport to represent a 
class of disappointed claimants against three companies, 
Combustion Engineering, AC&S, and A&I, none of which are 
Manville.  They claim that they are not seeking even to 
recover for asbestos bodily injury claims.  Instead, 
they claim that they settled their claims too cheaply 
with Combustion Engineering because, for example, in the 
1990s allegedly, decades, 15 years after the 
confirmation and discharge of Manville, Travelers in 
defending Combustion Engineering, with the knowledge 
that asbestos is dangerous or whatever from working with 
Manville, provided false interrogatory responses on 
behalf of Combustion Engineering.  That is how far 
afield the proffered interpretation of the 1986 order 
goes.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it not the case that most 
of the claims are claims based on -- based on Manville?

MR. COHN:  Are they claims --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Relating to what Travelers 

did in relation to Manville, rather than other 
companies.

 MR. COHN:  I don't think it's related to 

what they did.  I think the distinction here is relating 
to what they know.  The point is --

JUSTICE ALITO:  You're -- you're making the 
argument that some of these claims concern things that 
Travelers did in relation to the defense of other 
asbestos manufacturers.  Now, maybe that means that the 
-- the bankruptcy court interpreted the order too 
broadly or -- in that respect.  But what does that have 
to do with the main issue here?

 MR. COHN:  If an asbestos claimant, an 

independent action plaintiff, is seeking to recover from 
Travelers for Manville-derived liability, it's barred. 
That was the purpose of the remand by the Second Circuit 
having provided the appropriate measuring stick to the 
bankruptcy court to go look at these complaints and 
figure out whether or not in fact somebody's trying to 
take money out of Travelers' pocket for Manville's 
liabilities.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But isn't it the case, to 
make sure I understand it, the Wise complaints are the

-- are the exception.  They are the only complaints, as 
I understand it in this current round of litigation, 
that claims that the actual harm to them resulted from 
actions other than actions of Manville.  Is that 
correct?

 MR. COHN:  The statutory -- not exactly. 
The statutory direct actions, which account for 400 
million of the half billion dollars they'd like to pay 
to these alleged contemnors, all have to do with claims-
handling practices of Travelers with respect to other 
insureds besides Manville.

 The Common Law independent actions allege 
that the insurance industry as a whole learned of the 
dangers of asbestos.  It has a free-standing duty to the 
world to warn the world of the dangers of asbestos. 
Chubb Indemnity Insurance Company was not a Manville 
insurer, yet Chubb is alleged to have been in cahoots 
with the rest of the industry in failing to warn the 
world, and, therefore, they along with the rest of the 
insurance industry face unlimited liability unrelated to 
insurance policies for this --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, I understand -- or 

maybe I don't -- maybe I don't understand the -- every 
step in the liability claim.  My only question was, 
among the plaintiffs, is it correct that the only

plaintiffs who claim they were hurt physically by 
asbestos as a result of the actions of somebody, the 
only ones who are claiming that the somebody was other 
than Manville are the Wise plaintiffs.  Is that correct?

 MR. COHN:  I think not.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No?
 MR. COHN:  I think that every asbestos 

claimant by and large has a claim against Manville, but 
that doesn't mean they are not --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Simply because of 

Manville's position in the --

MR. COHN:  The ubiquity of Manville asbestos 
and their activities makes practically everybody, if not 
everybody, a Manville claimant, at least --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  So -- so that you are 
saying in effect everybody ultimately is claiming 
against Manville, the Wise plaintiffs and every other 
set of plaintiffs in this -- in this group of direct 
liability claimants, right?

 MR. COHN:  Well, is or can.  But that 

doesn't mean that they are attempting to assert 
liability against an insurance company because of 
Manville's own conduct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- I understand your 

cause of action.  Okay.  I don't want to --

MR. COHN:  So, getting back to the next 

point I would like to make is, as Mr. Issacharoff has 
stated, the Second Circuit was presented and the 
bankruptcy court was presented in 1986 with a plan and 
with an order that was stated to be premised upon the 
derivative liability of Travelers for Manville.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Who stated it?  Who stated 
that?  I mean, when I -- I read what the judge said at 
the time.  I've read language of the order, and I 
haven't found there anything that said that.  What it 
talked about was policies that were seriously 
intertwined with the liability of Manville.

 MR. COHN:  Well, the insurance settlement 
order, which is what is at issue here -- which is not 
the channeling injunction order, by the way; it was 
entered before that -- was premised upon the policies 
being property of the estate.  That was --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is this the confirmation 

order?

 MR. COHN:  The confirmation order is 

actually not directly at issue.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's different.  Okay. 

So the confirmation order --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But there's another piece 
of paper called "the insurance settlement order," which 
says that the confirmation order and all these other 
definitions and the injunction just refer to derivative 
liability?

 MR. COHN:  The --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes or no?
 MR. COHN:  -- definition of -- yes --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes?
 MR. COHN:  No.  The definition of --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No?  Okay.  All right.
 MR. COHN:  -- of "policy claims" is 

contained in the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then I don't see what 

has to do with it.

 MR. COHN:  Well, the definition of "policy 
claims" is contained in the settlement order, which is 
December 18, 1986.  It was a free-standing order that 
was entered --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  That's a 

different definition than the definition of "policy 
claims" in the injunction, presumably.

 MR. COHN:  There are two injunctions, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  I have a 

46

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

confirmation order, an injunction.  It defines "policy 
claims" in both as a lawsuit relating to any or all of 
the insurance policies.

 MR. COHN:  That is the injunction in the 

insurance injunction.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And your other piece of 

paper says what?

 MR. COHN:  The other piece of paper is even 

clearer.  That's why they don't rely on it.  It says, 
you may not seek to recover asbestos health obligations, 
which are the future Manville-derived asbestos claims 
from Travelers, from a settling insurance company.  They 
don't even try to argue that the channeling injunction 
gets them there.  They're arguing that the insurance 
policy buy-back order, if you want to call it that, the 
insurance settlement order pursuant to which they 
retired their insurance obligations was -- the 
definition of "policy claims" was --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You go on.  Don't worry. 

I'll look it up.

 MR. COHN:  Thank you.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why doesn't the Due 

Process Clause fully protect you?  If the bankruptcy

in particular cases if you can establish it, a due

 MR. COHN:  Chubb, Mr. Chief justice, in fact 
has an alternative argument that was never reached that, 
as a non-Manville insurer, it was in a position of an 
unrepresented future claimant, and in fact it cannot be 
constitutionally bound by res judicata to the 1986 
order.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I saw in the -- I 

guess it was in the Travelers' reply brief, the 
suggestion that there was a future -- somebody 
representing future claimants.

 MR. COHN:  Future tort claimants, not future 

insurance defendants.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is that?
 MR. COHN:  Cause of action claimants.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is that 

limitation spelled out?

 MR. COHN:  Well, if you look at the order 

that -- that appoints the future claims representative, 
it is to represent the interests of people who have been 
exposed to Manville asbestos but have not yet been --

asbestos injuries.

 MR. COHN:  It's not a description of Chubb, 

Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know, but I'm 

asking about the claimants.

 MR. COHN:  The claimants presumably were 
people that were -- the individual independent action 
plaintiffs presumably were represented by the future 
claimants' representative in 1986 and were at that time 
future claimants or else their -- you know, their harm 
would have arisen well before and they wouldn't be in 
these cases in this decade.

 If there are no further questions, Your 

Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, in the -- at the 

time of 1986, there were many claims against Manville, 
of course, for Manville's liability.  These later suits 
in State court about the insurance company's independent 
obligation -- I asked this to counsel on the other side 
-- to what extent was there such litigation in 1986?

 MR. COHN:  May I respond?

of any claim like that.  There were claims by other 
Manville coinsureds.  There were claims by Manville, and 
there may have been some direct actions.  I'm just 
simply not familiar -- we didn't come into this case 
until 2004, when our rights were impugned.  So I don't 
know the answer to whether or not there was anything 
just like this, but I doubt it.

 Five minutes, Mr. Ostrager.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OSTRAGER:  Thank you.  I have five quick 

points I want to make.

 First, the Second Circuit upheld the core 

factual findings that, quote, "the instant claims 
against Travelers arise out of its provision of 
insurance coverage to Manville," close quote.  That's 
from the Second Circuit opinion.  It's in the appendix 
at page 33.

 Second, there is no use of the word 

"derivative" in either the confirmation order, the 
settlement order, or 524(g). 524(g), about which we 
haven't spoken enough, clearly and unmistakably reflects 
Congress's intent to allow channeling injunctions that 
bar claims against a debtor and those, like insurers,

who are directly or indirectly liable for claims against 
the debtor.  That is 524(g)(4)(A)(ii) and Roman (iii). 
524(g) expressly provides an asbestos channeling 
injunction shall be valid and enforceable and may not be 
revoked or modified by any court except for an appeal.
 We cite in our reply brief the fact that a 

Senate report accompanying an earlier version of the 
bill clarified that 524(g) is -- quote, "is not meant to 
give the bankruptcy courts authority which they do not 
already possess and simply codifies the court's ability 
to issue supplemental permanent injunctions which are 
irrevocable except on appeal."

 There is a final judgment in this case 
confirming the plan of reorganization.  The Second 
Circuit issued that -- confirmed that judgment twice, 
once in the MacArthur case and once in the Cane case. 
And then in the O'Malley case, which is a 1996 case, the 
Second Circuit rejected a collateral attack on the 
confirmation order on two grounds.

 First, they found that the performance of 

the futures representative that Judge Lifland had 
appointed and which was incorporated in 524(g) and 
modelled on the Manville reorganization proceeding --
the Second Circuit found that the legal representative, 
quote, "took an active and aggressive role in protecting

future claimants in this litigation."

 And, secondly, the Second Circuit rejected 

the challenge to the continuation of the 1986 order 
enjoining the suits against insurers as being without 
merit because such an injunction was essential to the 
success of the settlement, and its continuation was well 
within the court's discretion.

 As respects Chubb, Judge Koetle in affirming 

Judge Liflin's 2004 order, specifically found that 
Chubb, a multinational insurer that has paid more than a 
billion dollars to resolve asbestos-related claims, was 
clearly on notice of these proceedings.  We cite in our 
reply brief on pages 10 and 11 several 524(g) 
injunctions that have run to the benefit of Chubb which 
contain the exact same "based upon, arising out of, or 
related to" language that appears in the original 
Manville order.

 We didn't cite -- but it's a matter of 

public record -- that Chubb paid $550 million to resolve 
through a bankruptcy proceeding with Fibreboard 
liabilities relating to Fibreboard receiving the same 
"based upon, arising out of, or related to" protection.

 The Manville plan carries out the core 
values of bankruptcy.  The Manville trust has made 
payments to 660,000 asbestos claimants -- that's at

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there anything you want 
to say about the practical thing I have in the back of 
my mind which may be false?  That language permits your 
position, but it certainly has rarely been implemented, 
if ever.  And I see that, but in the back of my mind is 
the fact that if we start mucking around and give narrow 
meanings to these things now, there are going to be 
hundreds of thousands of people who won't get 
compensated who have asbestos --
