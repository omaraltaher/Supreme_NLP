CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next in Case 16-605, the Town of Chester v. Laroe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Estates. 

            

Mr. Katyal. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Had Laroe filed the lawsuit against the Town 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Chester, it would have been dismissed for lack of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing.  However, Laroe claims that because it sought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervention under Rule 24(a)(2), that things are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  That's wrong. 

  

 

            

An intervenor of right is a full-blown party 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and can invoke the full suite of powers of the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judiciary, from subpoenas to summary judgment.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

standing is not dispensed in gross and those indications 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of judicial power must be grounded in Article III, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is particularly so because of two key facts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First, Rule 24(a)(2) situates intervenors who are in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different position from regular plaintiffs.  Insofar as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

intervenors only must show that the existing parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't adequately represent their interests, so it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

absolutely foreseeable that an intervenor will adopt a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

different position than the parties in the case and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invoke Federal judicial power. 

 

 

 

And, second, like here, when the party challenges the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing of an intervenor in district court, that court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not abuse its discretion when it conducts the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing inquiry.  This rule is efficient, it avoids all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorts of contingent derivative interests --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It sets up a difference 

   

  

 

 

 

between intervening on the defendant's side and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff's side.  Intervening on the defendant's side 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under your scheme, that's easy, but not on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff's side.  And why should there be that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disuniformity? 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Yeah, I don't know that there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is any sort of disuniformity.  The first thing I'd say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, Justice Ginsburg, is this case involves a plaintiff 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor and some of the defendant intervenor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards and stuff does get a little meta, and I don't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

know that you have to reach it here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But if you were to reach it and you were to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask, I'd say that the inquiry would be essentially the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same.  This Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry basically 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave us the test for what that is, and it said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hollingsworth, ordinarily we think of standing as

something about plaintiffs, but it's also true about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants too.  And when a defendant on appeal is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

trying to bring an appeal or something like that, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is, how -- is the judgment below creating some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of concrete harm to them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And we think that same test applies here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It applies to both plaintiffs and defendants.  Agreed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that sometimes it gets a little bit difficult in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application.  It's very easy to see how it applies for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs, little more difficult for defendants, but we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't saying that the rules should be different. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're saying the 

  

 

 

 

intervenor must have the same standing as a plaintiff 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have.  And that hasn't been the understanding in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the courts or the commentators. 

 

 

 

 

            

You're probably familiar with the 

 

 

 

 

intervention commentary by David Shapiro in which he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, it should go without saying, it must be understood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there is a difference between the -- the question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether one is a proper plaintiff in the -- or defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in an initial action, and the question whether one is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to intervene. 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So -- so we think with respect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to (a)(2) intervenors, they are full-blown parties. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what this Court in Eisenstein said.  And for

those folks, they do have to show the same type of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing as a plaintiff. 

   

 

            

That doesn't mean that they have to show the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exact same standing.  They could have a different injury 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

than a plaintiff in a given case, but they are going to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise, Justice Ginsburg, their full suite of powers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it doesn't make sense to say that they should be off 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hook for --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about permissive 

  

 

 

 

intervenors? 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Permissive intervenors are 

  

 

 

 

absolutely different, as our brief explains, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24(b) allows Federal courts to impose all sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions on them.  And so a good example is this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's decision in Stringfellow, in which the whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint by the intervenor before this Court was, hey, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, I want to exercise the full-blown rights of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party.  This district court only gave me 24(b) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissive intervention and imposed restrictions on, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, discovery.  And they said -- they -- they came 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the Court and said that wasn't fair, we should have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a full party, and this Court rejected that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And Justice Brennan's opinion tracked 

 

 

 

 

that -- his concurring opinion tracked that of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority in saying, essentially, courts have -- Federal

courts have all sorts of powers over permissive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenors, that they don't.  They can restrict 

  

 

 

 

 

 

discovery, they can restrict claims, all sorts of that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's not true for full-blown party status. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

Now, one last piece, Justice Ginsburg.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is the case that some permissive intervenors under 24(b) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do have standing; and for those folks, they can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise, again, the full suite of powers, as long as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no restriction on them put on them by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court, but there's no Article III problem with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- wrong with doing this. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Say -- think if a -- a party wants a court to do 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something.  Now, you can't invoke a court's power to do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something, including an appellate court, unless you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing.  To say an intervenor, who wants the court to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do no more than what the plaintiff, or in an appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, the defendant, wants them to do does not need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing. 

            

But where an intervener wants a court to do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something different, then -- then he does need standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In which case, it would save the court lots of trouble. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If there are many interveners, you wouldn't have to look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the standing -- or you would, if, and only if, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want the court to do something different.

MR. KATYAL:  So, Justice Breyer, we agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

with much of that.  So the -- the question is, though, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in your -- in your question about what an intervenor is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we agree that everything you said makes sense for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissive intervenors.  But for an (a)(2) intervenor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the reason they're coming to the court, as I was saying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the outset, is because they disagree with what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties are doing. 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  They may disagree --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  Put the two and a half --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- perhaps with the 

  

 

 

 

 

argument.  The lawyer, amazingly, thinks he's a better 

   

  

 

 

 

 

lawyer than the one who's already there, and so he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinks he can make a better argument. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  Correct, but --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But if he doesn't want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything different than what they've already asked for, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why does Article III insist that he have standing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Breyer, I'm unaware of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anyone who thinks that they're -- that they're somehow a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better lawyer than someone else who doesn't think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would have a different take with respect to claims, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief, discovery --

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  This case --

JUSTICE BREYER:  This very case.  This very 

  

  

 

 

 

 

case, he may want nothing different.  All he may want is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the town gives the plaintiff the money, and then he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will make his own case to say, I'm equitably entitled. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, let's take this very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case.  So the sole petition at page 5 said, look, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery, subpoenas, these are all very important parts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of civil litigation.  Our entire blue brief is all about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  They don't disclaim anything except claims in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief. 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why is there --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  Even that, I think there's an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

asterisk about, but -- which I'll explain in a minute, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but everything about the trial strategy, any -- they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't disclaimed any of that. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why --

  

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  And that's true about --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- do you think there is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real difference, Mr. Katyal, between claims in relief on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the one hand, in which case, yes, you need standing too, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and everything else on the other hand, in which case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's somebody with standing who has those claims, who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeks that relief.  So the court is doing exactly what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court has authority to do, but this intervenor can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contribute to the way the court is thinking about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

case. 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So for two reasons.  One is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

this Court's decision in United States Catholic in 1988, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which the Court said, quote, "The subpoena power of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court is subject to those limitations inherent in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the body that issues them," because of Article III. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is to say that subpoenas, all the discovery, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things -- the only way a court can act is with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III.  That is particularly so when you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking about discovery.  There have been opinion after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion of this Court, from Iqbal to Twombly to Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer's opinion in AMD, that say that discovery is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becoming the ball game in litigation.  And if you don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confine Federal courts to their lane, as Article III 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does, and allow bystanders, sometimes idealogical 

 

 

 

 

 

bystanders who don't have Article III standing, you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposing that they use the massive power of the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

--

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr Katyal, I am totally 

   

  

 

 

 

confused with the permissive and -- or automatic.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's okay to do all of this with permissive intervenors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and all of the discovery and other burdens that you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about, why isn't it okay to do it with automatic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenors who are limited to only the claims of relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the plaintiff has asked for?

MR. KATYAL:  So Justice --

  

 

 

 

11 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why -- why is there some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of added burden with respect to automatic that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't exist with respect to permissive? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I might not have been clear. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

It's not about the label.  It's about the function. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is, if a permissive intervenor is seeking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

discovery, is seeking subpoenas, is seeking to invoke 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal judicial power, they must have standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

My only point is the types of people that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer is positing, the people who say, hey, I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just a better lawyer.  I'm going to do the exact same 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stuff, claims, relief or so on, those are permissive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenors or they are amici, and they don't need to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show standing in order for them to participate in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lifecycle of the case. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  That's often how --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But does it matter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to you what -- at what point the Article III 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination you say is required is made?  I mean, I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would think that -- why would it be necessary to do that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the outset?  Why wouldn't it be when you get an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor who decides -- certainly if he is going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raise a different claim, but also is the one and the

plaintiff is not the one imposing particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burdensome discovery, can you wait until then, when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other party objects, and say, well, now I've got to look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at your Article III standing, because you're doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that changes the litigation? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Mr. Chief Justice, we -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think we have to win that by any stretch.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly think that the "what" matters more than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"one;" the "what" being that whenever Federal judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indications of power, be it subpoenas or summary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment, is invoked, that's when Article III standing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is required. 

 

             

With respect to timing, we do think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the best course of action for a bunch of reasons is to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that at the outset.  But, you know, you don't have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach that here.  Here, the district court did, and my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend on the other side would have to convince you that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's somehow an abuse of discretion, which I think is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a very hard thing to do, in order for you to reverse the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision below. 

 

             

But here are some reasons why I think that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold inquiry makes sense at the front end.  One, is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal Court is already reviewing 24(a)(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards at that point, and it's a very closely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogous, if not exactly identical, set of questions.

And so it makes sense to do it all in one piece rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

than doing it separately. 

 

 

 

            

Second, as my friend on the other side's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief admits, there's no guarantee that that later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry will even happen.  Indeed, his brief at page 30 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admits that they kind of hope it doesn't happen, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some extra related claims will come in.  And that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly so when it comes to, for example, Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule of Civil Procedure 45 subpoenas, as to which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court doesn't often even find out about.  They are just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued and the power of the Federal court is invoked. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so there might not be that later testing that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occur, unless you do it right at that front end. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could Congress -- could 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress enact a statute that provides for intervention 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of right for someone who doesn't satisfy Article III? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are -- there are several statutes that do provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for intervention of right. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So -- so I think that it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

depends on what intervention means.  If a -- if a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute provides for full-blown party status for someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who lacks the components of Article III, that, to me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every day of the week, is unconstitutional and that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely what they are advocating for.  That's what we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's got to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

conditioned on there being a party with standing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

remaining in the suit. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  And I think the fact that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

there's a party with standing remaining --

   

 

 

 

 

            

problem. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That will solve that 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  I don't think it totally does, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy.  It may solve part of the problem, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent that that person in that statute is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invoking Federal judicial power in a way different from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what that party with standing in the suit does, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drops Article III. 

 

 

            

This Court had said in DaimlerChrysler 

 

 

 

 

 

standing is not dispensed in gross.  And the idea that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just because you have one plaintiff with standing that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows someone else, an intervenor, to invoke the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal judicial power in all sorts of other ways, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that would be a pretty --

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So putting -- putting 

  

 

 

 

 

intervenors aside, suppose ten plaintiffs got together 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and brought a suit, so they were all joined in the same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit.  And the district court satisfied itself that one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of those plaintiffs had standing, that there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper case in controversy before the court, that nobody

else was asking for anything else or making any other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims. 

            

Does the district court have to go plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by plaintiff by plaintiff by plaintiff, sua sponte, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

decide whether each of them has standing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  They do not, Justice Kagan. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And the reason why, and this is what I was saying at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outset, is that intervenors -- (a)(2) intervenors are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situated differently from those plaintiffs, because 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs generally march in lockstep.  They file the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

same complaints; they're all on it together.  They don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to certify to the court and prove inadequate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation of the existing parties. 

 

 

 

 

            

And so if you look, for example, at their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, the one case they had --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think it is very odd that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can be an actual party.  And presumably, you can do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of these things, you can do -- do your own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery, you can do -- and -- and that's fine with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you, but if you're named as an intervenor, then it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes not fine. 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So -- well, I think that, you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

know, to the extent that some party didn't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing, it might be tested at that point.  I just 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the case for threshold standing inquiries, akin to

what I was saying to the Chief Justice, I think it's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

different for parties precisely because you can presume 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that parties do march in lockstep. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And here's a very good example:  The only 

   

  

 

 

 

 

case that they cite in their brief for when plaintiffs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't march in lockstep is a case called Archer.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you go back and look at that case, those parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have filed the exact same discovery requests, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally how civil litigation unfolds with 

 

 

 

 

 

co-plaintiffs. 

            

It's very different when you're talking 

 

 

 

 

 

about intervenors.  The Solicitor General, the nation's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

largest litigant, at pages 2 and 18, say -- and 23 --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that intervenors -- it's extremely likely that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenors do deviate in terms of their indications of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial power from the existing parties.  You can't say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that about co-plaintiffs. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Katyal, I was trying to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

understand the -- the universe of cases in which a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party -- someone seeking intervention would be able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come in under 24(a)(2) by claiming an interest relating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the property or transaction, but would not be able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim injury in fact.  And I -- I found it difficult to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify that universe of cases.  And then I said, well, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is one of them; this case must be one of them.  But

actually, it doesn't seem -- it seems to me that Laroe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

has Article III standing. 

 

 

 

            

Now Laroe may not be the -- may -- may not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be entitled to recover under the Takings Clause, but why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is there not Article III standing here?  If -- if it --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in fact, Laroe has a mortgage where an -- is an

injury in fact? 

 

 

            

two points. 

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  We don't think it is.  So -- so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why not? 

  

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  First is, we do think that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule tracks Article III, and they basically move 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coextensively.  And second, with respect to the facts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, a contingent interest, like this one, contingent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

on zoning approvals and so on, isn't enough for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III, just as it wouldn't be -- and if you adopt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their position, you are -- I could take out a derivative 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the outcome of the case that you heard today in the

allow me intervenor status under the rule, and under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this view of Article III.  That -- and then allow me to

almost as if -- I had the same trouble with -- as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito did.  I don't know why this party doesn't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

have standing, because at the end of the day, if there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a regulatory taking, he can say, and incidentally, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking award is mostly mine. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, do we just take this case on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption that there's no standing? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I do -- I do think that's the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

way the case comes to the Court.  And, you know, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this kind of contingent speculative interest would flunk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court's precedence about Article III, particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clapper. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On Justice Alito's point, 

  

 

 

 

 

if, as a practical matter, you have an interest to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect, that almost sounds like a shorthand for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

standing. 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Completely agree that the --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON 

 

 

 

 

 

             

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

MS. HARRINGTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

The best reading of Rule 24(a)(2) is that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires an intervenor, as a right, to demonstrate that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

he has Article III standing by showing that he has a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cognizable interest cognizable under Article III, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it could be impaired by the disposition of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pending lawsuit. 

 

            

I'd like to start where Justice Ginsburg 

 

 

 

 

 

 

started by focusing on how it works, sort of how you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish standing when you're talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenors, and particularly, defendant intervenors. 

 

 

 

 

            

Like Justice Ginsburg, most of the courts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals that have held the other way have held that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing is not required, have focused on whether an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor can establish standing to initiate a lawsuit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

But in our view, that is not the appropriate focus. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What the rule itself focuses on is whether an intervenor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be injured by the disposition of the pending 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit. 

             

And so the -- it's -- it's much more like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking whether a party has standing to appeal than it is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like asking whether a party would have standing to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

initiate a lawsuit.  What you look at is whether there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a particular outcome of the lawsuit that one of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties is trying to obtain and you ask if that outcome

happened, would it injure the intervenor, the potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor, such that that person, the intervenor, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have standing to appeal. 

 

 

 

            

And so it's the same whether you're talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about a plaintiff or a defendant.  Now, they have to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

have an interest that's related to the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute, but their injury comes from the disposition of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lawsuit. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In -- in what sense, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any, is your position different from that of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's? 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  I think it's not 

    

 

 

 

particularly different.  You know, I think they take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

sort of, you know, a stronger line than we do on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional question.  Our view is that you could --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think everyone here agrees that there are some things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a party -- a litigant would do that don't require 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing, like presenting oral argument, filing briefs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are some things that do require standing, like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking damages, filing a new claim. 

   

 

 

 

            

There are -- in our view, there are some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other things in the middle that are kind of fuzzy.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our view, as a theoretical matter, you can imagine a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system where a person could easily obtain the label 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"intervenor," and then a court could later inquire into

that intervenor's standing, if and when they did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

something that would require standing. 

 

 

 

 

            

We think, as a matter of reading the rule, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the rule -- that the drafters of the rule have --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have required that inquiry up front.  We think the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements of -- of Rule 24(a)(2) are best read to map 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

onto the Article III requirement --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why did they bother? 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  Why did they --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- if -- if the only 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue is standing, totally different language was used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the rule drafters.  And I don't think they track very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, because to require standing, you need immediacy of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect.  And in a lot of these intervenor cases, it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very clear that part of the interest in the property is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a contingent one.  If the person loses the property, my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest will be destroyed.  That's very contingent and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not likely to permit standing in a lot of situations. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  So there are sort of two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

parts to your question.  The first, on the text, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's true that the text doesn't track the modern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parlance of standing, but this rule was drafted -- was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- was adopted in 1966, which is before this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases in like Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife --

given that that's true, do you think -- are you saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

that Congress had it in mind to track the requirements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of standing, whatever they turned out to be?  Because, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of course, the Standing Doctrine in 1966 was nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like what it is now. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  It was different, but the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

-- but the Standing Doctrine and intervention rules have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always required that an intervenor or a party have an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest. 

            

And this Court, going back to the beginning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the 20th century, has said that you -- that an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest that is contingent or hypothetical is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient for intervention, just like it had said it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not sufficient for standing. 

 

 

 

            

Now, the predecessor to the 1966 version of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the rule allowed intervention as a right if a party 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

would be bound by the judgment, or if a party had an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual interest in property that was going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distributed by the court.  I think it's clear that both 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of those sets of -- of people would have had standing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so that's kind of the people that I think the rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafters had in mind.  There's certainly --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What kind of rule --

  

 

 

 

 

 

probably not -- I -- I don't know.  Where I draw --

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

begin to get a kind of blank is defendant's standing.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

can see defendant's standing on appeal, et cetera, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

forget it.  What about on the initial -- when does --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are there any cases?  Are there -- is there a good 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article?  When does a defendant have or lack standing? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Justice Breyer, that's 

  

 

 

 

where I tend to start, that I think the -- the focus of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the rule is on injury from the disposition of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit.  And so what you would ask is -- when you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about a defendant -- if the plaintiff gets what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it wants, will that harm the defendant?  And I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's natural to say, will it harm it in a way that would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give it standing to appeal. 

 

 

 

 

            

And so what the defendant is trying to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, instead of waiting until that point, is trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come in and prevent the injury.  This goes to the second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of Justice Sotomayor's question about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imminence.  And the Respondent said --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That gives the defendant 

  

 

 

 

 

standing to --

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  It doesn't give --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- take position to 

  

 

 

 

 

issue -- ask for subpoenas and so forth. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.  So if the 

  

  

 

 

 

intervenor could be harmed by what the plaintiff wants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in such a way that the -- this intervenor would have

standing to appeal, then the intervenor sees this injury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

coming down the road -- this is an actual -- it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pending lawsuit, and so there's an imminent injury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's -- that's coming the way of the defendant -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the intervenor, pardon me -- and so the intervenor wants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to get involved --

 

 

 

            

            

interest. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see your point. 

    

 

 

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  -- and protect his 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Ms. Harrington, I really 

   

  

 

 

get confused when you invoke the Doctrine of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitutional Avoidance. 

 

            

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So as I understand it, 

   

  

 

 

 

you're saying, well, all right, Rule 24 is old and Lujan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is new, but let's match them up, and any ambiguity we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ought to just ignore or construe in your favor because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Doctrine of Constitutional Avoidance.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

upshot of applying the doctrine here to avoid the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question whether intervenors have to have Article III 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing would be that we would have to ask the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III question effectively through the guise, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admittedly, of Rule 24 in every single case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So to avoid the constitutional question 

 

 

 

 

 

once, we have to ask it every single time hereafter.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- for applying that 

  

 

 

 

 

doctrine in quite that way? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Let me, if I can, take the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

air out of something.  I will concede that my friend, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Dvoretzky, has very ably pointed out the flaws in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our constitutional avoidance argument, and I'm not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testing --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I appreciate the candor of

MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes. 

  

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  He is a very capable lawyer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

and has proven himself with respect to that argument, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not pressing that -- that argument here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A couple of --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can I ask you the same 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question that I asked Mr. Katyal?  Could Congress pass a

someone who would not have Article III standing?

MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  I mean, I think 

    

   

  

 

26 

Congress has done that in -- with a number of statutes. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think in those cases, the intervention would be -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those intervenors would not be permitted to do something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would require standing without a subsequent 

   

 

 

 

 

assessment of -- of the standing of those intervenors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, you know, in this case, as in many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, I think the point of the intervenor that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempting to intervene is that he -- it wants to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages.  Well, you can't get damages if you don't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing.  And so even if he prevailed here, there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to have to be some showing at some point down the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

road that he has standing to get damages. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I'm not sure I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood your answer to the question.  You said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this person does not have to show standing, Article III 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing, in the first instance, but if she tries to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something different than what the plaintiff is doing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she does? 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  I mean, I thought the 

    

   

  

 

 

question was, if there was a -- setting aside 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 24(a), if there was a statute that authorized 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervention --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There are -- there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

several statutes. 

 

27 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  So our view is, as a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional matter, again, you could have a system 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where you could easily get the label of intervenor, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then a court could later inquire into your standing if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and when you did something that required standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We think Rule 24(a)(2) is best read to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require that standing upfront, and for some other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons that Mr. Katyal was saying.  That's because the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule requires an intervenor to show that their interests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not adequately represented by existing parties, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they're going to be injured --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so you think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is satisfactory to -- it satisfies the constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement of standing if Congress says you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing? 

            

            

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  No. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No. 

  

 

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  No, the question was, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress says a party can intervene as of right, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't require a showing of standing.  We don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that is a violation of the Constitution, as long as you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't let that intervenor later do something that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires standing --

MS. HARRINGTON:  -- without then asking for

JUSTICE BREYER:  We don't have to go into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  No, you don't have to go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

There have been a couple questions about 

   

 

 

 

 

sort of piggyback intervenors.  And I think you have to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

keep in mind that there's Rule 24(b), which is -- allows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissive intervention.  And permissive intervention 

  

 

 

 

expressly contemplates that a party has claims, has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

legal questions, or factual questions in common with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing parties. 

 

            

And I think if a person just wants to come 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

in and say, oh, yeah, I have the same kind of claim you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do, they can seek permissive intervention, or they can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just file their own claim.  The point of Rule 24(a)(2) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that there's a potential injury from the disposition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the lawsuit to the person who is trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervene --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there's --

  

 

 

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  -- and has that incentive. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that step that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

keep referring to which doesn't make any sense under

party is adequately protecting your interests. 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

            

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  That's right.  The rule --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- let's assume 

    

 

 

 

they've hired the best lawyer in the world, and they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made every conceivable argument, but you're still a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract vendor or -- with the kind of potential injury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the others assume would give you standing.  Why is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it that we then read Article III into Rule 24? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, tell me if I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting your question right. 

 

 

 

            

In our view, Rule 24(a)(2) requires a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

showing of Article III standing.  And in addition, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to show timeliness and inadequate representation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so in those two ways, it's a higher hurdle than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III is. 

 

 

            

But that's -- that's appropriate because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a person trying to come in and sort of intrude on an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing lawsuit.  And there you need to show that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you really need to be able to come in, because, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise, your interests are going to be impaired by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lawsuit. 

 

            

So we think the ultimate question under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III is really the same as the ultimate question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Rule 24(a)(2).  And under Article III, if you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking whether a person can initiate a lawsuit or can 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

appeal, what you're asking is, do they have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

substantial enough interest in the outcome of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual dispute? 

 

            

And it's really the same inquiry under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 24(a)(2).  Do they have an interest that's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's -- this Court has said it has to be an interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's legally cognizable, that's a significantly 

   

 

 

 

protectable interest.  That's the same language that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has used under Article III.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Petitioner's effort to turn every 

 

 

 

 

intervention motion into a constitutional question is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

solution in search of a problem.  Article III requires 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

only a case or controversy.  It does not speak to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of who can join an existing case or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversy. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So somebody who has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

no connection, other than that they're very interested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the subject -- it's an environmental case, the Sierra 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Club wants to be involved.  It's all right to allow them

to intervene as a party?  Because there is a case or 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

controversy.  They don't -- you know, they wouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy Article III standing, but they don't have to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

according to you.  So their views are valuable, their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participation in, you know, depositions, discovery, all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might help the Court, so why not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

Rule 24(a)(2) would not allow the party that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, I know.  But 

   

  

  

 

 

 

I'm asking a constitutional question, putting aside 

   

 

 

 

 

exactly what the rule is. 

 

 

 

 

            

If you say, all there has to be is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing case or controversy, and once there is, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't care whether the person has standing, Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could pass a statute saying anybody who the Court thinks 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is appropriate -- you know, an expert in the area, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualified with a record or whatever, they can jump in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and participate as a party, and you would say that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay. 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Article III would not speak 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to that particular bad idea by Congress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, I can't tell 

   

  

 

 

 

whether that's a yes or a no. 

   

   

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  That is a yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That type of 

  

 

 

 

 

proceeding is okay. 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Constitutionally, it is 

  

 

 

 

32 

okay.  Rule 24 does not authorize that.  If Congress 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were to do something like that, district courts would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have ample tools, the same as the tools they use now, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manage multiparty litigation and to prevent these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical intervenors from --

MR. DVORETZKY:  -- taking the case and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- I hope I haven't 

   

   

  

 

 

given Congress an idea, but --

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, is that 

    

 

 

 

 

consistent with what we've said, that Article III 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing plays an essential role in the separation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powers? 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Absolutely, because the 

  

 

 

 

purpose of Article III, its core purpose, is to prevent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts from issuing advisory opinions about the actions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the political branches, absent a need to do so, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absent a case or controversy. 

   

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if it's

33 

I -- I'm still going to litigate against the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sierra Club.  Is that okay? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  No, because at that point, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there would no longer be a case or controversy for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sierra Club to participate in, absent its own injury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it was pursuing relief for. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the key -- the key point under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III is that its purpose is to prevent the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial machinery from being mobilized in the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance, and opining on the actions of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political branches --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you give me a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical example of a case where an intervention 

   

 

 

 

 

 

should be allowed, because it's important, but there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no Article III standing?  Maybe outside of the context 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this suit?  I think there may be Article III 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing.  What -- is there a practical illustration you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

can give us for why it's very important to allow this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor under -- under the rules, even though there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no standing? 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  I think defendant 

    

 

 

intervenors are the best example of that.  And it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't make sense to ask whether a defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor, whether it's an environmental group

defending an EPA regulation, whether it's white

defend the employer's promotion practices --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Here, of course, we have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff intervenor, correct? 

 

 

            

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes.  But --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you give me an example 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that out -- outside of the context of this case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Sure.  So an example might 

  

  

 

 

 

 

be the plaintiffs in Clapper did not have standing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there was no evidence in that case that their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in not being surveilled was actually being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringed. 

            

If, hypothetically speaking, you had a 

 

 

 

 

 

resident of a house who was being surveilled or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plausibly alleged that -- that he was being surveilled, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps the roommate of that individual whose cell phone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not presently being wiretapped, whose movements were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not presently being tracked, would have an interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Rule 24.  That interest might well be impaired or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impeded if the wiretapping program as to the house were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judged constitutionally --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'll -- I'll look at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clapper.  As I recall, they -- they said that they --

intervene, even though the union has all of the claimed

MR. DVORETZKY:  In the Trbovich case, that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 

  

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  What the Court recognized in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Trbovich was that the union member could intervene, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to assert separate claim or relief, but to present 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments, to potentially present evidence, and to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect the union members' interest in that case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And would they lack 

  

 

 

 

 

Article III standing? 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, the union member in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Trbovich would lack Article III standing, because of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular statute at issue there, in which Congress

union member's particular harm --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I come back to Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Kennedy's question? 

 

            

Can you give me a real case, where there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- where -- where you believe that the requirements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of 24(a)(2) are met, but there is not -- there was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III standing? 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  So, again, I think the 

   

  

 

 

 

defendant intervenor examples are --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Plaintiff.  Plaintiff 

  

  

 

intervenors. 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  So -- so let me talk for a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moment about this case.  We absolutely have standing in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case because we were the purchasers of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property.  If you actually go through all of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreements and go through New York law about ownership

interests, it does get complicated.  Again, we -- the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the interest that we have is not a contingent one, as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Second Circuit recognized.  We're actually the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

equitable owner. 

 

            

But let's say that in parsing through all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these agreements and all of these facts it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined that legal title is the key to having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing to pursuing a regular takings claim.  Again, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't believe that that ought to be the outcome here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But if you had such a situation, we would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a sufficient interest.  Even if as a technical 

   

   

  

 

 

 

matter we lacked legal standing, our equitable ownership 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest would be a sufficient one to be protected under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 24, it would be impaired if we were absent from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this litigation, and we ought, in that situation --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

intervene. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But --

  

 

 

 

MR. DVORETZKY:  -- to be allowed to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Second Circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

has assumed otherwise, right?  It decided this case on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the assumption that there wasn't Article III standing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  It -- it didn't -- it did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not decide the question on that assumption.  It simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not reach the question of whether there was

Article III standing or not. 

 

 

 

 

38 

                 

The district court had held, 

 

 

 

 

incorrectly we believe, that we lacked standing, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the Second Circuit held was that the district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was wrong, as a matter of law, to require that inquiry 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the first place. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Well -- so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

now you're arguing before us that, in fact, you do have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III standing, so that if we agree with you, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the Second Circuit decision that it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary would -- would stand, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  It would. 

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The -- the question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you want us to decide is a real estate law question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under New York law. 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, I'm -- I'm not asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you to decide that question.  I was trying to respond to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the hypotheticals about a plaintiff who would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

lack standing, and --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  How does a defendant have 

   

  

 

 

 

standing?  How does that work?  What the government says 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a defendant has standing because the judgment in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case may affect an interest of the defendant, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant interest.  Is that right? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  That's not an Article III

standing inquiry.  And, in fact, the Article III 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

standing --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I don't see any 

    

   

 

 

 

more with the defendant, how you can find a defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without standing on that basis?  I mean, the reason I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find it relevant is because I think the other side is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing that an intervenor has to have standing in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense that a defendant has to have standing, at least 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you intervene on the side of the defendant, as most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do. 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  So, first of all, it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

make sense to speak about whether a defendant intervenor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has standing because a defendant intervenor is not the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

one who is alleging an injury and invoking the authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the court. 

 

 

            

            

Second of all --

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Can we write an opinion and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say the only people that have to have stand -- I mean, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know how to write this opinion unless you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about standing in general.  Yes or no on that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And why can a defendant invoke the court's power on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal -- for example, subpoenas, discovery -- where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants all the time invoke the court's power, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how can they do that if they don't have -- I don't even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know how to phrase the question but you see what I'm

driving at. 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  I think what you're driving 

    

 

 

 

 

at is the difficulty of writing an opinion that applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

a standing --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, not the difficulty of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

writing an opinion.  I want to know is there such a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think as defendants having or not having standing, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if there is such a thing, why and how.  And if you don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know the answer right away, have you ever read anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the topic, and what would you recommend? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  The only sense in which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there is defendant standing does not apply here.  Courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have recognized defendants' -- defendants' standing in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two circumstances:  Where defendants are appealing and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thereby invoking the jurisdiction of a new court, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where defendants are asserting counterclaims and 

 

 

 

 

 

thereby acting --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about when they ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for a subpoena to be enforced?  I can't go in and -- you 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't -- people can't just go in randomly and say I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like to have a subpoena enforced against so and so. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  No, of -- of course not, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a defendant can do that as part of an Article III case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or controversy once there already is an existing case or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversy.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's put aside the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question of intervention.  How can a defendant not have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

41 

standing?  I mean, I'm -- somebody sues me, so they are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dragging me into court.  I don't want to be in the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  I'm there because I'm the defendant.  And then 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court is going to turn around and say, well, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to leave because you don't have standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.)


            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  How can that possibly be?


  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Most defendants would be


  

 

 

 

 

happy to accept that, and the anomaly that you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointing out is defendant --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But then the case would go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on without me. 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  The anomaly that you're 

  

 

 

 

 

pointing out is precisely why it doesn't make sense to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask the question whether defendants have standing.  Once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a case or controversy, the judicial power 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

extends to all of it.  That includes discovery requests, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subpoena requests, and whatever else by participants in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that case or controversy. 

 

 

 

            

To get back to Justice Breyer's question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reason that standing as an inquiry did not work in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular for defendant intervenors is that there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two contingents before a defendant intervenor can even

be said to be injured. 

 

 

 

 

42 

            

The first is that the district court has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule in a way that the defendant intervenor doesn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

want, and the second is that then the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor has to actually be harmed by that, as opposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the defendant intervenor simply having an interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that may as a practical matter --

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  That brings me back 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to my original question.  Fine.  A defendant can go and 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

get subpoenas and so forth, but if he has a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counterclaim, that's different, then he has to show 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing. 

            

So why don't we apply the same standard to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the intervenors?  The intervenors have to be like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants in respect to intervening on the -- on either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side.  They can get subpoenas, et cetera, but if they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want something that somebody else doesn't want in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, then they have to have standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  I think this goes to the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

question of what is the standard for having standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In other words, what is it that you might want to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently that would require you to have standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the only thing that you might want to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently that would require standing is asserting a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different claim or seeking a different form of relief.

Not making a different argument, even potentially 

   

 

 

 

 

injecting a constitutional argument the way amici do, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

43 

and not seeking discovery or subpoenas, because those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not a claim or form of relief with which Article III 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is concerned. 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, on -- on that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

score, why isn't that exactly the case we have here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Plaintiff in this case, by way of relief, seeks a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money damages for the taking.  All right.  That's his 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint, page 122 of the Joint Appendix.  Your client, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 162, wants damages for itself.  That's something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Plaintiff could not have had standing to obtain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for your client. 

 

 

            

Why isn't that a form of additional relief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where an intervenor wishes a judgment against the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defendant directly in its favor that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable through all the mechanisms of post-judgment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

garnishment, liens, et cetera, and would offer your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client claim preclusion effect, not just nonmutual issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclusion, for example?  Seems to me like that is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different form of relief, isn't it? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Gorsuch, the way in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which this case has been litigated, and trial counsel

only in our name. 

 

 

 

44 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, except for the 

  

 

 

 

 

complaint expressly says that. 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  The -- the complaint says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that, but oftentimes the complaint says one thing and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over the course of the litigation the theories might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

develop differently.  And the -- the way in which we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at this point seeking relief here is relief to recover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for Sherman. 

 

            

We will at a later date need to figure out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how we'll get that money from him, and we would either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to potentially settle that claim or have standing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to bring our own claim in Federal court or in State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court to get the money from him. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But the reason --

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So you're disclaiming the 

  

 

 

 

 

relief sought in your complaint. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  We are disclaiming --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Is there any relief you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

seeking at this stage? 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  The relief that we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

seeking is to maximize Sherman's recovery because we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a stake in that recovery, and it's a stake that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 24(a)(2) protects and gives us an ability to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervene --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Would you agree though 

  

 

 

 

 

45 

that if an intervenor did seek relief in its own name, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that would be relief beyond that which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff would be entitled to provide? 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, after all, plaintiff normally 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have standing to seek a judgment in someone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

else's name.  So would you agree in the normal case that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'd have a problem here? 

   

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  If -- if by the normal case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you mean a situation where an intervenor comes in and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asks for either additional money or money to be paid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separately --

 

            

favor. 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Or just a judgment in its 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. DVORETZKY:  So whether it's a judgment 

   

  

 

 

 

in its favor I think depends really on the scope of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment. 

            

This Court has repeatedly affirmed judgments 

 

 

 

 

 

in favor of plaintiffs without inquiring into their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing once it had assured itself that at least one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff in the case had standing.  So just the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issuance of a judgment is -- would be an inconsistent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard with this Court's settled jurisprudence. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, under the Petitioner's theory of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, every exercise of judicial power --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'm sorry for 

  

 

 

 

46 

interrupting, counselor.  If you would just answer my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, I would be grateful. 

   

 

 

            

If a plaintiff seeks a judgment in its own 

   

   

 

 

 

 

name, can't seek it for an intervenor, agree? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  If the -- the question is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the judgment requires --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  The question is whether a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff can seek a judgment against a defendant in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

someone else's name.  Generally not, right?  That --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's not a trick question. 

   

 

 

            

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  No, generally not.  But --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  So if an intervenor 

  

  

 

 

 

 

then seeks a judgment in its name, generally speaking, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's asking for relief beyond that which the plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has standing itself to provide, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Not -- not necessarily and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not the way this Court has considered the question in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numerous cases where it's affirmed judgments in favor of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties without standing, or at least without inquiring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into their standing. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I'll let you go. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I -- I may 

   

   

  

 

 

not.  What -- what is the -- the legal case you have

47 

that aside. 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  In -- in Department of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives, Clinton v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New York, Bowsher v. Synar, these are all cases where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court has expressly said, we satisfy ourselves of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jurisdiction -- of the standing of one plaintiff and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need not inquire further. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no.  No.  No. 

  

  

  

 

 

 

I know that, but that's -- that's -- those cases are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinct, in that the Court is saying they need not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquire further because those are separate parties, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're all seeking the same relief.  It may be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary at some point for the Court to inquire further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it determines that the party is seeking to exercise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority beyond Article III. 

 

 

 

            

Sure, you don't have to decide cases that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might never come up or issues that might never come up, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I don't see how that helps you. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, no.  And we agree that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

if, in fact, an intervenor -- if we ourselves came in at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a later date, filed and amended pleading and said now we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are seeking additional damages in our own name.  Then, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at that point, an Article III inquiry would be required.

48 

this Court's cases support. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no.  But then 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the question becomes if you are, then, exercising the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority to issue subpoenas with respect to other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties, you're exercising the authority of the court in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a way that expands beyond what the particular plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was seeking. 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  You -- you are, but you are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not exercising the authority of the court in a way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's relevant to Article III, because you're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking a separate claim or a separate form of relief. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

What Article III is --

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that just seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to me to be circular.  I guess I was looking for a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why that is so. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  The reason I don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

it's circular is the purpose of Article III is not to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

micromanage the conduct of litigation and how litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is conducted; it's to prevent courts from interjecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves into a controversy in the first place. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's the 

  

 

 

 

argument -- your argument in your brief, you focus on

49 

Article III standing is an element of the case or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversy requirement.  And so I don't know how you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

can put Article III standing to one side, while -- while 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying it's okay, because we still have a case or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversy. 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Article III standing is an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

element of the case or controversy requirement or an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of the case or controversy requirement, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but the requirement that this Court has imposed in order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have standing, is an -- an intervenor's that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured, imminently, or concretely has been injured, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traceability, and redressability, all with respect to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular claim and a form of relief, not with respect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to things that happened along the way in litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  With respect to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

a particular party, you don't -- you don't just ask is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there an injury.  You say, has the plaintiff been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured?  You don't just ask is there redressability? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

You say is -- is his injury redressed?  I don't see how 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can just carve off one part of the -- of the test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for standing. 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, I think the -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

reason for carving it off, again, goes back to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of Article III, which are not to police every

single exercise of judicial power.  When an amicus comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into court, it potentially introduces a new issue, a new 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional question.  In this case, the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has introduced a Rule 24 issue that -- that we've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responded to. 

 

            

Each of those is a form of -- of asking the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court to use its power, power to resolve the case a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain way.  That --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but we're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about mandatory intervention.  The district --

  

 

 

 

 

intervention must -- the -- the court must permit anyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to intervene.  And then there's this requirement of --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of there be a practical interest and so forth. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It seems to me you're going to have to -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order just to protect the courts against parties coming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in, you're going to have to make an inquiry that looks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very much like standing, anyway. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  I think this goes to a key 

    

   

 

 

 

 

premise of the Petitioner's argument that I want to make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure to clarify.  The Petitioner is arguing that once an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor comes in as an intervenor of right -- as of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, there can essentially be no limits on what that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor can do.  And that's simply not true.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory committee notes make clear that restrictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be placed as of right.

51 

            

We cite numerous cases in our brief, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which courts have recognized that had they can limit the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery of -- of intervenors as of right; certainly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they can limit them from asserting claims in additional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forms of relief.  And, in fact, courts are used to doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this in multiparty litigation all the time, including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preventing multiple plaintiffs and multiple intervenors 

 

 

 

 

 

from seeking any unilateral discovery at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So this notion that once an intervenor is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed in, that the intervenor will simply be able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do whatever it wants and take the judicial power in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different directions, this is why I started out by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying this is -- this constitutionalization of every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervention motion, is a solution in search of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  This is simply not a problem in real-world 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

courts. 

            

District courts have ample tools to deal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the parade of horribles of having an intervenor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come in and potentially take the case -- take the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in different directions 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose somebody was a 

  

 

 

 

 

plaintiff and was dismissed for lack of standing.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same person could come back into the case as an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor on -- on -- that's your position. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  In theory, if the person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

satisfied the requirements for an interest that may be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

impaired and so forth under Rule 24, then, yes, but not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just any plaintiff could, then, come back in as an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You would have to meet 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the 24(a) requirements, of course. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Which are stringent. 

  

 

 

 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Exactly, Justice Ginsburg. 

  

 

 

 

The -- the Petitioner's contrary theory 

 

 

 

 

 

here, that Article III polices every action of every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, is contrary to a number of settled principles. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One, I mentioned it's contrary to the 

   

 

 

 

 

one-plaintiff rule, which this Court has applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeatedly.  If it were not possible for a court to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue a judgment even in favor of a plaintiff without 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

standing, then this Court has been wrong for decades to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be doing exactly that. 

 

 

 

            

Second of all, and I think this goes back 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to Justice Breyer's point earlier, it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require constructing an entirely new defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor standing doctrine that, whatever it is, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not standing as we think of it.  A defendant intervenor, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first of all, will be injured only if there's a judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that goes a certain way, and even then, will not

necessarily actually be harmed by the judgment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53 

depending on whether his or her interests actually are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impaired. 

            

The -- the standard for Rule 24 intervention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is simply whether the -- the interest may, as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical matter, be impaired.  That is not standing. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Standing requires an actual or an imminent injury, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this conjectural injury --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  On the defendant's side --

  

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, on the -- why can't we just say simple?  It's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants are there because the court might affect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their -- their behavior, do something they don't want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do or -- or affect their property in a way they don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want.  And an intervenor on the defendant's side, why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not just interpret the rule that way?  That's what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government says.  It has to show the same. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

An intervenor on the plaintiff's side 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have to show anything, unless they want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something -- other than the rule, I mean, you have --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless they want something that the plaintiff doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want.  That's where I started.  The government is saying 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

interpret the rule this way and you object to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because? 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Because Rule 24 and

Rule 24's distinct language.  With respect to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

purposes, Article III is about ensuring that Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts do not intervene in controversies, absent a live 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute.  Rule 24 ensures that once there is a live 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute, once there is a case or controversy, parties 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

whose interests may be affected can participate in order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to protect their interests, and in order to avoid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional litigation later on.  So these are different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes, and they are reflected in the language of Rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24, which does not speak in terms of standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the key point is that Rule 24 allows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an intervenor to intervene, if the intervenor's interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may, as a practical matter, be impaired or impeded. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is different than the stringent requirements for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing, which require an actual or imminent injury, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not just may as a practical matter. Traceability and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

redressability, likewise, do not track on to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language of Rule 24. 

 

 

 

            

For Article III standing purposes, you need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have an injury that is traceable to the defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct.  For Rule 24, it simply needs to be related to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the subject matter of the litigation. Likewise with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redressability.  For Article III purposes, there has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be an ability by a court to directly redress the injury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and thereby -- and bind the defendant to a legal

judgment.  For purposes of Rule 24, again, it's not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the nexus is not -- is different than that.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply whether the intervenor might potentially be aided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in its ability to protect his interest. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

            

These are all looser standards than 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III.  Congress has -- has enacted Rule 24 in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1966, but has amended it four times since then, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including as recently as 2007.  So -- so there has been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ample opportunity for Congress, the advisory committee, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court reviewing the rule, to take account of modern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing doctrine.  Yet, the language of Rule 24(a) has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been allowed to stand using very different terms than --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than the standing inquiry.  And so the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume, for the 

  

 

 

 

 

sake of argument, that -- because I think, as I read the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court's opinion here, they assumed you were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking for judgment in your name, because they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treating you as a contract vendor or vendee, and they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were saying, you don't have the right to have a judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in your name. 

 

 

            

Would that holding have been wrong, absent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your current concession that -- that you are not seeking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money in your own name, but just a payment of money? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Sotomayor, that --

  

 

 

 

 

that was not the state of play before the Second

56 

54 of our brief -- and this is just a quote from the --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the appellate lawyer in the Second Circuit.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, quote, "exactly one fund, and the Town doesn't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do anything other than turn over the fund."  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's why the Second Circuit correctly found, and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is Petition Appendix 9A, that -- the Laroe, quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Asserts the same legal theories and seeks the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief" as --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have asked a different 

    

   

 

 

hypothetical.  I don't know that the court below 

    

 

 

 

 

 

understood your claim that way.  So when it ruled, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruled understanding that you were following your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint and seeking a -- money in your name.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disavow that in the Second Circuit.  They accepted that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disavowal, and they've ruled a slightly different way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

I'm saying, if you hadn't, would this be the same case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  If we hadn't, it would be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different case, but I think the court --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what would happen if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it were a different case? 

   

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  If it were a different case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

and we were asking for -- for money in our own name, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think an Article III standing inquiry would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate in that situation, and for reasons that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your rule is always 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on a motion to intervene, there is a standing inquiry. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

The standing inquiry is whether or not you're asking for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

relief different from someone with a case or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

controversy. 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  I would put it slightly 

    

 

 

 

 

differently, which is whether or not there needs to be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing inquiry depends on whether the intervenor is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking relief or asserting a claim different than the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing plaintiff. 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Let's use a hypothetical. 

   

  

 

 

MR. DVORETZKY:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  A -- a number of federal 

    

   

 

 

 

prisoners are similarly situated with respect to a claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they're not being provided food consistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their religious beliefs.  One -- one brings a claim.  He 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

wants relief as to him, because that's what he can seek 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief for, right? 

 

 

            

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  Then we have 80 

  

  

 

 

 

 

join him.  Can they join him, so long as they simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, we want him to get his meal, or if -- if they seek 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meals in their own name, a judgment running as to them, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do they have to show standing at that stage? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  I -- I think it depends on

what relief the initial plaintiff is seeking.  If he is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

seeking a declaratory judgment or an injunction 

   

 

 

 

 

invalidating the prison's entire meal program, then I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think they can join.  If he is seeking an injunction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, he, individually, is entitled to a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

type of food and they would like that judgment to extend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to them, they need at that point standing, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're asking the defendant to do something different, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not only to provide him with particular food, but also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to provide it to them, whereas otherwise the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not be free to do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think it requires a careful parsing 

   

   

 

 

 

at -- at the -- either on the papers or at the time --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  To the extent he's seeking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

relief only in his own name, an as-applied challenge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  To an as -- if it were an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as-applied challenge, then an additional plaintiff would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to show standing because the question, again, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what is the court ordering the defendant to do.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the touchstone for the relief.  And if an additional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff is asking for different relief, then it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires standing.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Three points.  First, a 24(a)(2) mandatory 

   

  

 

 

intervenor is a full party and can send thousands of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subpoenas or document requests without the court ever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding out about them.  In two --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are there cases in which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

courts have controlled 24(a)(2) intervenors? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  There -- there are not. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Indeed, the court cannot restrict -- and this is, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, what Stringfellow says, it's what --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did your -- I think we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

were just told that we think we have -- in fact, these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts have limited 24. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  They can limit it in the sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they limit parties, but they can't ban discovery 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

altogether from a party --

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course not.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

-- but they can say, now, counsel, we have lead counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking these depositions.  We're not going to let you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take the same depositions.  The courts do that all the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time. 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Sure, they can do that.  Or 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

they could say -- but at the point where they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restricting a full party, like an intervenor, from doing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

anything independently, they are no longer an (a)(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor.  At that point, Justice Kennedy, they are a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 

permissive intervenor at best, or they are an amici. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They are not doing anything.  And that gets to, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a fundamental point, Justice Kennedy --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I don't want to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

take up your time, but it does seem to me that district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts have very substantial control over what mandatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties can do in the way of -- of duplicative and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oppressive discovery.  It happens all the time. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, we don't disagree with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that.  Our only point is that they have much more power 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over 24(b) than they do over (a)(2).  And at the point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where they are coming in and saying, we're going to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything exactly the same way, either because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court has imposed that restriction on them or otherwise, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they aren't at that point an (a)(2) intervenor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that gives rise to -- you asked, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy, my friend on the other side, what --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what are we giving up?  When do we ever need these kinds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of interventions?  And he gave you two answers, neither 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of which dealt with the fact that amici and permissive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervention provide for that participation. 

 

 

 

 

            

His first answer was Trbovich.  Trbovich is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a case in which that union member had Article III

standing.  So, you know, that would have -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61 

wouldn't be screened out by our rule anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The second thing he gave you was Clapper, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a long thing about a -- a roommate that, you know, 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

might want to have a grievance here.  That, to me, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

boomerangs.  That shows exactly what our point is.  He 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants them to -- intervenors -- (a)(2) intervenors to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raise stuff that parties legitimately can't raise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of Article III standing. 

 

 

 

 

            

And the only support he can have for that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no support in the Constitution -- the only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support is page 30 of his brief, where he is admitting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what he wants intervenors to do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And Justice Breyer, that is what intervenors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are doing right now.  The National Counties brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

explains that ideological intervenors are coming in now, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned bystanders like the Sierra Club or Club For 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Growth.  It doesn't matter ideologically, but it's just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- the point is that that's happening right now, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of (a)(2) intervention status.  And that's why you need 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some sort of upfront restriction on a threshold inquiry. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then this is my last point, which it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets to the Chief's question about, why would you need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have a threshold inquiry?  And I think the best 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

reason is what the answer to Justice Gorsuch was given, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

at Joint Appendix page 162. 

 

 

 

 

62 

            

Joint Appendix page 162 says, "They are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking a pot of money for themselves."  That's what the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint says.  Now, my friend now has disclaimed that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before this Court.  That, by the way, is not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclaimer before the Second Circuit.  The disclaimer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

before the Second Circuit is, we want the same pot of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money, but we still want a court order for ourselves. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that is an indication of judicial power.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what (a)(2) intervenors do all the time.  And if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- and if you accept his rule and you don't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that threshold inquiry, you allow for this protean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shifting of a case to the point where -- and I'll just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read to you from Joint Appendix page 162.  This is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the complainant asks for.  The road prays -- this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prays that this Court grant judgment against the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants, awarding it damages and other appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief as follows:  A, an award of compensation for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking of awarder's interest, and, B, such other and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further relief. 

 

            

He's disclaimed A.  I don't know what B is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

anymore.  This can't be the right way for courts to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed.  The right way for courts to proceed is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold standing for a defendant which confines them 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to party status.
