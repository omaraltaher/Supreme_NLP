 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-10245, Freeman v. United 

 (10:14 a.m.)

States.

 Mr. Heft.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. HEFT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 William Freeman's plea agreement, his 

presentence report, and the sentencing record all show 

that his term of imprisonment was based on a crack 

cocaine guideline that was retroactively lowered by the 

United States Sentencing Commission.  This case asked 

the Court to decide whether the fact that a sentencing 

court accepted a plea agreement under Criminal Rule 

11(c)(1)(C) precludes eligibility for a sentence 

reduction under section 3582(c)(2).  We submit that 

Mr. Freeman is not barred from eligibility for a (c)(2) 

sentence reduction for several reasons.

 First, under the ordinary definition of 

"based upon" and in the context of this particular 

statute, since the subsequently lowered guideline was 

used to determine Mr. Freeman's term of imprisonment,

that term of imprisonment was based on the subsequently 

lowered guideline.

 Second, the categorical ban on eligibility 

adopted by the Sixth Circuit and advanced by the 

Government frustrates the purpose underlying section 

(c)(2) and finds no support in the plain language of the 

statute, of the rule, and under the terms of 

Mr. Freeman's plea agreement.

 Third, a record-based analysis that reviews 

the plea agreement, the presentence report, and the 

sentencing record to determine the basis of the sentence 

is -- is best suited to correctly implement section 

(c)(2), and it's -- that record-based analysis supports 

the conclusion that Mr. Freeman's sentence was indeed 

based on a retroactively lowered guideline.  The -- the 

Sixth Circuit -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If -- if we issue an 

opinion and we analyze the statute's language, the 

statute's purpose, and the statute's legislative 

history, would the opinion, the judgment be based on 

each of those or -- or not?  In other words, does 

everything that goes into the final determination, would 

you say that determination is based on each of those 

factors individually?

 MR. HEFT:  Yes.  Certainly, it is based -­

the determination certainly would be based on the 

statute, Your Honor, but, as we've -- we've argued in 

our brief, we've asked the Court to take what we believe 

to be a record-based analysis and look at -- look at the 

record in this case, look at the terms of the plea 

agreement, look at the -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  My -­

MR. HEFT:  I'm sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think my question 

goes in a different direction.  This plea agreement, I 

think, could be said to be based on the sentencing 

guidelines, but it is also based on the agreement.  In 

other words, the combination of the two of them is what 

gives you the -- the sentence.  So how can you say it's 

based on only the sentencing guidelines when it may not 

have been imposed in the absence of the plea agreement? 

Probably wouldn't have been.

 MR. HEFT:  Mr. Chief Justice, we don't 

believe that that's mutually exclusive.  A sentence can 

be a guideline -- a sentence based on the guidelines, 

and it can be a sentence based on a C plea agreement.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You quote one definition 

of -- the noun "base" in your brief uses a point from 

which something can develop, but you omit another 

standard definition of the term, the principal element

or -- or ingredient of anything, considered as its 

fundamental part.  Why do you do that?

 MR. HEFT:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I think 

the dictionary definition that we've given encompasses 

the definition that Your Honor has just -- just 

described.  The -- and our position -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's two -- there 

are two different definitions.  One is something that 

provides a starting point for analysis.  The other is 

the fundamental thing on which something is -- it rests.

 MR. HEFT:  Well -- well, our contention 

is -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, if you use the latter 

definition, you have to decide which is more fundamental 

here, the agreement between the parties or the 

sentencing guidelines, which certainly provided the 

starting point for the analysis of the sentence by 

the -- by the district court.

 MR. HEFT:  Justice Alito, that's correct. 

The guidelines certainly were the starting point, but 

they were also the principal foundation of this 

agreement because what the agreement is -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't it enough for you 

to say -- or based not in whole, but in part -- based 

on, something could be based on several things, and one

of them is the guidelines that then existed?

 MR. HEFT:  Certainly.  Certainly.  And this 

-- this plea agreement reflects that it was based on the 

guidelines.  If you -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then are you 

saying the plea agreement was based on the fact that he 

was caught with -- with two guns rather than four guns? 

Would you be willing to say that?  In other words, 

everything -- your position, it seems to me, could be 

criticized for saying everything that contributes to the 

final 106 months, that that sentence is based on every 

one of those things -­

MR. HEFT:  Well -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- which makes the 

-- which makes the statutory language largely mute on 

this.

 MR. HEFT:  Well, Your Honor, the -- the 

sentence is based on a number of guidelines.  Each -- no 

sentence is based on just one guideline, as this plea 

agreement reflects.  It's based on a compilation of 

guidelines.  It's -- it's based on the crack guideline, 

and as prior -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's also 

based on things that are not reflected in the 

guidelines.  You've got a particular U.S. attorney who

is more lenient in prosecuting these types of crimes 

than another one.  The fact that you got the minimum 

under the guidelines might be based on that.  It's based 

on the fact that this person felt he could handle 106 

months in prison, and he wasn't willing to risk whatever 

the top -- what was the top sentence under the guideline 

calculation?

 MR. HEFT:  It would have been 117 months.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So he figures it's 

better for me to get -- it's based on his decision that 

I -- 106 months is better than the risk of 117.

 MR. HEFT:  Well, certainly there are a 

number of factors that go into plea bargaining and 

negotiation, but what -- I think what the court has to 

look at is what is said in that plea agreement.  And I 

think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out a minute ago, the 

definition of "based on" -- if a guideline sentence 

is -- if a sentence is based in part on the guidelines, 

that would be adequate under the -- under section -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What sentence would 

he have gotten if he were just sentenced under the 

guidelines, no plea agreement?

 MR. HEFT:  He would have got the -- he would 

have received the same sentence, Your Honor.

we know that?

 MR. HEFT:  Well -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The guidelines give 

you a range.  The judge might have given him 117 months.

 MR. HEFT:  But -- but the plea agreement 

here was for the bottom of the guidelines.  The parties 

calculated -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I know.  I'm 

putting aside the plea agreement.  What would he have 

gotten under the sentencing guidelines?  We --we don't 

know, right?

 MR. HEFT:  It would have been left -­

left -- well, assume it depends upon the nature of the 

plea, Your Honor.  You're talking -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's no plea.  He 

is convicted at trial.

 MR. HEFT:  It would be somewhere within that 

guideline range.  That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So how can you say 

that this is based on the guideline range when the 

guideline range would not have been determinative?

 MR. HEFT:  Well -- well, we're looking -­

we're looking at the content of the plea agreement, Your 

Honor.  The -- the plea agreement says -­

hypothetical is in a different context.

 MR. HEFT:  But even -- even at that, Your 

Honor, if -- that sentence ultimately is going to be 

based on a guideline range, and if that guideline range 

is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, 

then the -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, could you -­

maybe it would be easier if you would describe to us the 

situations you don't think would be based on the 

guidelines.

 The Solicitor General claims that since 

every plea negotiation has to start with the guideline 

calculation as a starting point for departure and/or 

consideration by the judge under 6B1, that every C plea 

agreement would be considered based on.  Are you taking 

that position?

 MR. HEFT:  No, Your Honor.  Absolutely not.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So I'll give 

you a couple of examples, but you give me more.  Would a 

plea agreement that doesn't mention the guidelines at 

all but picks a sentence within the actual guideline -­

is that based on the guideline?

 MR. HEFT:  Possibly, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  And how 

about one that departs or varies from the guideline, the

range, whichever word you want to use?

 MR. HEFT:  Your Honor, the -- the Sentencing 

Commission, in 1B1.10 note 3, says that a 

below-guideline sentence can be based on the guidelines.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So there -- the 

Solicitor General is right; there really isn't any 

situation that you're claiming is not based on?

 MR. HEFT:  Oh -- oh, no, Your Honor.  There 

are -- there are C pleas.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Give me the examples.

 MR. HEFT:  All right.  Well, first of all, 

we've cited cases in our brief where circuit courts have 

determined that a C plea was not based on the 

guidelines.  But let me give you another example.

 Let's just assume the guideline range is 

something like 151 to 188 months, and then -- but the 

parties agree to a sentence of 60 months, and they do 

that for several reasons.  First of all, maybe the 

defendant is elderly.  Maybe the defendant has serious 

medical conditions.  Maybe the defendant has -- was 

sexually abused as a child.  If those are the factors, 

if that's the reason why the defendant got that -­

received that 60-month sentence, that sentence is not 

based on the guideline range.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, wouldn't the

guidelines, even in that situation, provide the starting 

point for analysis?  Isn't the district court obligated, 

and isn't the -- doesn't the presentence report have to 

go through the guidelines calculation before the 

sentence is imposed?  So you start out with the -- the 

guideline sentence of whatever the figure was that you 

mentioned, and then you go from there, and maybe you 

depart downward.

 MR. HEFT:  That -- that's true.  The -- the 

guidelines would be the starting point of any 

negotiation, but -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  So why wouldn't that be 

based on the guidelines?  Just because there's such a 

big downward departure?

 MR. HEFT:  It -- Your Honor, it would not be 

based on the guidelines if those other factors were the 

motivating reason for the imposition of the sentence.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Sorry, I don't understand 

that.  Don't the guidelines provide for departures?

 MR. HEFT:  They do, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well -- and aren't you 

giving a guideline sentence, if you give your reasons as 

is required by the Sentencing Commission in 6B1.2 and 

you say -- the judge says, I think this is a special 

case and, therefore, I am giving a lower sentence?  Just

as he's required to do under the guidelines in order to 

accept a C type agreement.

 MR. HEFT:  If the parties can show that the 

sentence is tied to the guidelines.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, how could it not be? 

Wouldn't the judge have to say it's not tied to the 

guidelines, because I am varying and I no longer wish to 

apply the guideline?  If he doesn't say that, isn't he 

applying the guideline?

 MR. HEFT:  In that instance, he would be -­

he would be applying it.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Whether he gives the 

specific robbery 3-point whatever it is, 17 months, or 

whether he says, I have a special case and I depart 

under section 5 of the guidelines.  Both of those are 

guideline sentences, aren't they?

 MR. HEFT:  If the -- if the judge were to 

take -- were to actually apply those guidelines and say, 

based on that guideline, I am going to depart, that 

sentence is based on the guidelines.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So from what base does a 

judge depart downward?  From the crack cocaine range or 

from the downward departure range?

 MR. HEFT:  I think it would depend on the 

nature of the agreement, Your Honor.  It may very well

depend on -- the judge may depart from the crack 

cocaine.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So aren't you just 

asking us to permit district court judges to make up 

their own C agreement, to decide what the parties would 

have done in the absence of a higher range?  And don't 

we fall prey to sort of just asking district court 

judges to create their own agreements?

 MR. HEFT:  No -- no, Your Honor.  I don't 

believe that's -- that's not what we are asking the 

Court to do at all.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Heft, are you relying 

on -- this was -- this is a plea agreement that said, 

specifically, defendant agrees to have his sentence 

determined pursuant to the guidelines, and then the 

judge says that he was adopting the probation report and 

the application of the guidelines as set out therein, so 

both the -- the defendant says, I agreed to a 

determination pursuant to the guidelines, and the judge 

says, I'm going to apply the guidelines in giving you 

your sentence.

 So the hypotheticals we're talking about are 

quite far afield from where you have a specific 

statement by the defendant and the sentencing judge that 

the guidelines are being applied.

MR. HEFT:  That is correct, Your Honor, and 

that's why we've asked the Court not to take a 

categorical approach to this issue, but to take either a 

case-by-case approach or a record-based analysis, to 

allow the district judge to determine, as Justice 

Ginsburg pointed out, what our -- you know, what is the 

--

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Heft, would you require 

those kinds of statements in the agreement or in the 

colloquy in order to satisfy the standard?  Suppose 

those statements just didn't exist.

 MR. HEFT:  That's certainly problematic, 

Justice Kagan.  If those -- if there was nothing in that 

plea agreement to tie the sentence to the -- the 

sentence -- the agreed sentence to the guidelines, that 

certainly would be problematic.

 But that doesn't resolve the issue one way 

or the other, because the judge would have to consider 

the presentence report to see if there's a connection or 

correlation between the agreed sentence and the 

guidelines, and also the judge could look at the guilty 

plea colloquy and sentencing transcript to see if the 

attorneys actually expressed their intent about where 

this sentence came from.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Heft, that seems very

complicated.  You have to look at everything and you're 

not giving us a lot of guidance as to what you do when 

you -- when you see these things.  I mean, this sort of 

case-by-case, all-things-considered approach just seems 

as though you're going to get a lot of inconsistent 

decisions.

 MR. HEFT:  Respectfully, Your Honor, I 

disagree.  I think this is what district judges do all 

the time, not just in the context of a C plea, but a B 

plea as well.  They have to look at the nature of the 

plea agreement.  They have to look at the PSR.  They 

have to look at the sentencing transcript to -- to 

determine whether or not the defendant is -- is eligible 

for that sentence reduction.

 So judges are doing this routinely.  They're 

doing this -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in every case, they 

have to go through the guidelines calculation, and the 

parties have the opportunity to object to the 

calculation, right?

 MR. HEFT:  Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So what does paragraph 12 of 

the plea agreement contribute here, other than with 

respect to the fine and things besides the sentence that 

we're talking about?  It doesn't seem to me to add

anything substantively.

 MR. HEFT:  I -- well, Your Honor, I think it 

does, Justice Alito.  I think it does add -- it adds 

substance, and it adds meaning to that plea agreement 

because in paragraph 11 where the parties very 

meticulously go through the offense level, tie that to 

the guidelines, and then -- then they state in paragraph 

12, the -- the defendant agrees to be sentenced pursuant 

to the -- to the guidelines.  That's very clear that the 

review in the guideline calculation is what the sentence 

is based on.  And -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can a -- can a sentencing 

judge be found to have abused his or her discretion in 

approving a plea -- a C plea agreement which provides 

for less than the minimum guideline sentence and gives 

no -- no particular reason for that?  Would that be 

appealed as an invalid sentence?

 MR. HEFT:  Well, Your Honor, under -- under 

section 3742, the government could -- could appeal an 

incorrect application of the guidelines if that's what 

Your Honor is referring to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But now you're talking 

about a plea agreement, which the government has 

consented to whatever this agreement is and whether -­

whether -- sometimes a plea agreement will say okay, if 

you take a plea, we'll drop certain charges or we'll 

charge a small amount -- value of the drug.  Was there 

any of that in -- in this plea?

 MR. HEFT:  No, Your Honor.  Mr. Freeman 

pleaded guilty to all charges in the indictment.  The 

parties stipulated the amount of -- of drugs that were 

found on his person when he was arrested.  So there were 

no dismissed charges, no amended charges in this plea 

agreement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let -- let me ask my 

question a different way.  In deciding whether to 

approve the plea agreement, doesn't the judge have to 

consider whether it is an application of the guidelines, 

whether it is wildly inconsistent with the guidelines, 

whether it does not take into account valid reasons for 

departure from the guidelines?

 MR. HEFT:  Yes.  The judge would have to 

consider the guidelines.  Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then, if that's the case, 

then every plea agreement is based on the guidelines, 

every single one, because the judge always has to 

consider how do the guidelines apply to this plea 

agreement.

 MR. HEFT:  Well, Justice Scalia,

consideration of the guidelines alone is not enough to 

determine whether or not that sentence is actually based 

on them.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't understand why you 

resist that.  I mean, that's precisely what the 

guidelines say.  The only ones that aren't guideline 

sentences are -- are dismissal charges, where it's an 

agreement to dismiss.  But a type B, type C -- the 

guidelines themselves say that the judge, here's what 

you do.  Judge, you look and see if the guidelines 

sentence is there.  Is it a guideline sentence?  If it 

is, you can approve it.  If it isn't, you can't.

 I mean, that's my reading of what it says. 

So -- so why do you resist that conclusion?

 MR. HEFT:  Well, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  And, of course, the judge 

now could depart from the guidelines -- I mean, "vary," 

whatever that word -- technical word, is -- "vary."  He 

can say, I'm not going to apply the guidelines at all. 

But if he is going to apply the guidelines, isn't that 

what they tell him to do?  I've always thought that. 

You may tell me I'm mistaken.

 MR. HEFT:  They -- they do; obviously they 

do consider the guidelines, but then the other question 

is whether or not the sentence is based on those

guidelines -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, how could it not be, 

since the judge has no power if he is to apply the 

guideline -­

MR. HEFT:  Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- to accept any agreement 

other than agreement that corresponds with the 

guideline?  That's what it says.  It says the court 

should accept a recommended sentence or a C -- the 

specific sentence -- only if the court is satisfied 

either that it is within the applicable guideline range 

or if it's based on a departure under the guidelines. 

That seems to me what it says.  Isn't that what it says?

 MR. HEFT:  That is what it says, Your Honor, 

but -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then if that's so, 

every sentence is -- you're going to say no?

 MR. HEFT:  No.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I thought that was 

helping you, but if you want to say no, go say no and 

explain why that is.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. HEFT:  Your Honor, to go back to the 

point that Justice Sotomayor made -­

guidelines.

 MR. HEFT:  Well, the example -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Give me an example.

 MR. HEFT:  Well, the example that I gave --

I gave previously.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What?

 MR. HEFT:  There's a guideline range.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

 MR. HEFT:  But the judge bases his decision, 

his or her decision, solely on other -- factors other 

than the guidelines.  As I mentioned earlier -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are we supposed to 

psychoanalyze the judge?  The judge says on his writing, 

checks the box:  This is a guideline sentence.  It is 

robbery.  It is precisely within the robbery range.  But 

I -- I am going to give it the low end of the range 

because I believe that the -- he has a lovely mother and 

family and so forth.

 Okay?  You're saying that isn't based on the 

guideline.  No?  Okay.  Is that the point?

 MR. HEFT:  Well, it depends what the judge 

does at sentencing, Your Honor.

the guideline sentence.  He has to do that.  Now, within 

that range, he has applied the guideline sentence, he 

got the information.  He says, I am satisfied it 

applies -- done.

 Now are we supposed to look further and say 

what his true reason is?  Is that what you're saying?

 MR. HEFT:  It would -- Your Honor, I would 

submit it would depend on the nature of the -- the plea 

agreement, whether or not that sentence is -- is 

actually based -- going to be based on the guidelines.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I suppose -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Incidentally, and it sort 

of bears upon this discussion, are the guidelines 

mandatory when they are applied in approving a plea 

agreement?  In other words, does Booker/Fanfan not apply 

to the application of the guidelines when a judge is -­

guidelines are mandatory in that situation?

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So it's quite 

possible the judge wasn't totally -- but I mean -- I 

agree; it's much more complicated after Booker.  I don't 

know how to treat yours.

 MR. HEFT:  That's true.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It's on the cusp.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if there had been 

evidence here of that?  What if the government in 

connection with this plea agreement had dropped counts 

or had decided not to seek a superseding indictment 

adding counts?  Would -- would the situation be the 

same?

 MR. HEFT:  Yes.  Your Honor, I think it 

would; it would be the same.  Because the court would 

have to look at, again, what the terms of the plea -­

plea agreement was and what the parties determined. 

Now, the -- I think what I should emphasize is that 

we're only talking about eligibility here; and if -- if 

those -- if those concessions that the government has 

made would -- would perhaps result or at least in the 

government's view, result in an unjustified windfall, 

that -- that's -- that is not a critical factor in 

determining eligibility.  That's not factor at all in 

determining eligibility.

 That could come into play after eligibility

is determined and the judge -- district judge determines 

whether or how much.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How would that possibly 

work?  Let's say the government drops count -- agrees to 

a plea on count 1 with a guideline range of 60 to 65 

months; drops count 2, which would have increased the 

guideline range to, let's say, 100 to 105 months; and 

says this is our deal, you know, you agree to -- to 65 

months and we're going to drop count 2.  All right?

 MR. HEFT:  Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And then the guideline for 

that is lowered, and you say in determining whether the 

defendant is eligible, what -- the government would then 

have to have a mini-trial and prove that the -- prove 

count 2?

the defendant is eligible, the case is remanded to

reduced, and then, as the judge said in this case said, 

if you have objections, let me know; file your 

objections.  That's where the government could file -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  The government files 

its objections and says, well, we dropped count 2.  And 

the defendant says, well, I wasn't guilty of count 2.

 MR. HEFT:  That's -- that's up to the 

district judge's discretion, whether or not to -- to 

reduce that -- that amended guideline sentence.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How is the judge going to 

decide that?

 MR. HEFT:  Well, the -- I think that's 

something that district judges decide every day, whether 

or not -- because the judge presumably has -- has 

been -- is familiar with the case, with the presentence 

report, with the terms of the original plea agreement, 

with the facts of the case; and the -- and the judge can 

make an assessment based on those factors whether or not 

the sentence reduction should be granted and, if so, how 

much of a reduction should be granted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But Justice Alito's 

hypothetical points out -- points up the fact that even 

though the agreement may mention the guidelines, it may 

do that just for the purpose of enabling the -- the 

judge more readily to approve the agreement, but there's

no reason to believe that the government is interested 

in the guidelines, as opposed to being interested in 

putting this person away for a certain amount of time, 

especially when another count is dropped and the 

government says, well, I'll -- you know, I'll drop it 

if -- if this guy goes to prison for 2 years.  But if 

the government had known he's not going for 2 years, he 

is only going for a year and a half or a year, the 

agreement might not have been concluded.  So it 

really -- I mean, it doesn't further the intent of both 

parties, at least, to say when the guideline is changed, 

the agreement changes.

 MR. HEFT:  Well -- well, the agreement 

certainly has been -- was modified by the amended 

guideline, and that's where the district judge has to 

exercise his or her discretion whether or not to grant 

that reduction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in that event, the 

sweet part would be open to reconsideration too.  I 

mean, you can't say, I want the good part, the lowered 

guideline, but I also want to keep that certain counts 

are dropped and that a certain quantity of drugs was 

agreed upon.  You would have to reopen the whole thing.

think the judge could look at the presentence report, 

the government could make its objections saying here's 

why we gave that particular sentence, and the judge 

could exercise his or her discretion to say whether or 

not the defendant is going to get that sentence 

reduction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 MR. HEFT:  Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Gannon.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 When a criminal defendant and the government 

agree to a specific sentence and that agreement is 

binding on the sentencing judge by virtue of Rule 

11(c)(1)(C), the resulting sentence is based on the 

parties' agreement.  It is not based on the advisory 

guideline range that would otherwise have been used at 

sentencing, even if the sentence corresponds to that 

range.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, here the agreement 

at various points says that the parties agree on the 

calculation of the guideline.  I think it's paragraph 11

and 12.  They say that the sentence is according to the 

guidelines.  So there's reference to the guidelines 

throughout, and the court made the guidelines 

calculation.

 MR. GANNON:  The court certainly made the -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it seems to me fair 

under the statute to say that it is based on the 

guidelines.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, the question -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And there are other 

provisions in the agreement you might argue about.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think the statutory 

question here isn't just whether the sentence is based 

on the guidelines.  The language under 3582(c)(2) is 

whether the defendant was sentenced to a term of 

imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has 

subsequently been lowered by the Commission.  So it's 

not just whether the guidelines played a role; it's 

whether this particular sentencing range was what was 

driving the sentence.

 And, Justice Kennedy, you point out pages 

25, 26 of the plea agreement in the Joint Appendix.  And 

I think it's instructive that the agreement deals 

differently with the fine component, as Justice Alito 

referred to earlier, than it does with the term of

imprisonment.  At the bottom of page 25, the agreement 

says that a fine will be at the lowest end of the 

applicable guideline range.  And then if you go over to 

pages 27 and 28 in paragraph 11, that's where the 

guideline calculation occurs.  And notice it is an 

incomplete calculation.  The parties don't actually come 

up with a final calculation because they don't come up 

with a criminal history.  They don't -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, they do come up with 

a recommendation, which is three levels below the 

otherwise applicable guideline.

 MR. GANNON:  They -- they come up with a 

recommendation for purposes of determining the offense 

level, the base offense level of 22 and then reduced to 

19.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, but that's all based 

on the guidelines.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, that aspect is based on 

the guidelines, but then the guideline application 

computation is incomplete because the next paragraph, 

paragraph B, says we aren't agreed on what the criminal 

history is going to be.  And to the next paragraph, 

paragraph C specifically says that the foregoing 

statements of applicability of sections of the 

sentencing guidelines are not binding upon the court.

The defendant understands the court will independently 

calculate the guidelines at sentencing; that is -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that doesn't mean that 

the court can't base its conclusion on his 

independent -- on its independent judgment on the 

guideline.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think what I'm trying 

to say, Justice Kennedy, is the agreement expressly 

contemplates that the judge needs to determine the 

applicable guideline range for purposes of determining 

what the fine will be.  And that's different from the 

way the plea agreement deals with the term of 

imprisonment because if we go back to page 26, it does 

not tie the -- the term of imprisonment to a guideline 

range.  That's completely different from the way it 

deals with a fine.  It specifically says there's an 

agreement that the sentence of 106 months of 

incarceration is the appropriate amount.  And so that 

happens to have been at the bottom end of the guideline 

range that would have been applicable if the parties' 

agreement -- if the parties' prediction about the likely 

criminal history calculation turned out to be the right 

one.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you're talking about 

what "based on" means, and that's an important part of

your argument.  If I could just, while I've got you, 

jump to this question of what happens on remand if you 

lose the case.  On remand, I take it, you're not bound 

by the agreement because of the last -­

MR. GANNON:  Well, I -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- the last of section 24 

says the defendant argues for any sentence other than 

the one to which he has agreed to and breached the 

agreement.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, at that point the remedy 

for the breach would be that the United States is 

relieved of its obligations under the agreement.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you -- what would 

that mean?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that's -- that's 

part of the problem in a case like this where there was 

a specific sentence agreement, that it's impossible for 

government to get back the things that it gave up at the 

time, that were agreed to under -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's got guilty 

pleas on all of the counts.  We know that.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that's if -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of any obligation.  I see 

what you mean.

 MR. GANNON:  Now that the sentence has 

become final, I think 3582(c)(2) has opened a narrow 

window for ways in which the otherwise final sentence 

could be modified.  It only contemplates that the judge 

will have the discretion to reduce the sentence if it 

is, first, a sentence that was based on the relevant 

guideline range that's subsequently been amended and 

made retroactively applicable.  But also, second, then 

the judge would need to comply with a policy statement

point?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that the remedy 

that the agreement contemplates of the government being 

released from its other obligations in the plea doesn't 

really leave us much of an option at this point.  We're 

not going to be able to go back and argue that he should 

have been sentenced at the upper end of the range that 

we're talking about.  We're not going to be arguing that 

the criminal history should have been a higher or that 

the criminal history substantially underrepresented the 

seriousness of his history where he had 10 years of 

offenses preceding this one.  There may have even been a 

potential career adjustment that -- that went by the 

boards.  That's mentioned on page 162 of the Joint 

Appendix.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Gannon, you assert that 

the -- within the language of the statutory provision, 

the sentence here is not based on the guidelines, but 

it's based on the agreement, and the agreement arguably 

is based on the guidelines.

 MR. GANNON:  I think the agreement is 

arguably -- I mean, I don't think the face of this 

agreement proves that it's based on the guidelines, but 

I -- it is obvious that the parties negotiated in the 

shadow of the guidelines.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  If -- if you take that 

position, that "based on" means determined by 

absolutely, then I don't think any sentence would ever 

be based on the guidelines after Booker/Fanfan.

 MR. GANNON:  Well -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The guidelines form part of 

the consideration of the judge, but the judge's decision 

is not based on the guidelines.  Just as here, the -­

the agreement -- the guidelines form part of what 

produces the agreement, so also they form part of what 

produces the judge's decision.  And it seems to me, if 

that's going to be enough for the judge's determination, 

it ought to be the same for the agreement.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think it's not clear 

that the judge needed to be considering the guidelines 

in the course of deciding whether to accept the plea 

agreement.  And Justice Breyer earlier had a colloquy 

with Mr. Heft about guideline 6B1.2, which, even before 

Booker, was a nonbinding policy statement.  And so, to 

be sure, when 3582 was enacted, the guidelines were 

binding, and, therefore, it -- they would have been 

expected to have played a larger role in most sentences.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but let's -- let's 

assume there is no plea agreement.

 MR. GANNON:  Yes.  And -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you have a judge who 

sentences post-Booker/Fanfan.  Now, his sentence is not 

based on the guidelines any more -­

MR. GANNON:  I think -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- any more than this 

agreement is based on the guidelines.  The guidelines 

are one of the things that he must take into account and 

does take into account in determining the sentence.

 Now, if that is enough for purposes of 

determining whether this statute -- statutory provision 

applies to a sentence imposed directly by a judge, it 

seems to me the same analysis ought to apply to a 

sentence imposed through a plea agreement.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that there's a

3582(c)(2) inquiry, which is asking the judge to -- to 

go back and redo the aspects of his analysis that would 

have been different had the -- the relevant guideline 

range been changed at the time he engaged in his 

analysis, and -­

 MR. GANNON -- a specific sentence rendered 

under type C that -- on page 28 of our brief, we 

acknowledge that in most contexts, it's -- it's open to

 MR. GANNON:  It is -- the test that we state 

in the subheading of that section of our brief is 

whether they're of legal consequence in the 

determination.

the overarching test is whether it is of legal 

consequence, and the phrase that you're talking about on 

page 27 of our brief, Justice Kagan, is when we know 

that there is something that was of binding legal 

consequence and was controlling, we know that that is 

the thing that the sentence was based on.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that's not your test. 

What is your test instead?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, that is -- in -- when 

something literally is controlling the analysis -- the 

parties' agreement here binds the district judge -- we 

know that that is what the sentence is based on.  There 

isn't any -- any -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but is -- is there some 

other instances in which you would say that something is 

based on, even though it's not of binding legal 

consequence?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, it would be of legal 

consequence even if it weren't controlling.  This Court 

has -- has made clear even after Booker that under 

3553(a), courts still need to go through the relevant 

guidelines analysis.  They apply the guidelines.  It may 

turn out that the sentence turns out not to be based on 

the relevant guideline range because the judge -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, then I'm back with 

Justice Scalia, because if it's only of legal 

consequence, not of binding legal consequence, if it's 

something that somebody considers rather than something 

that is determinative, it seems to me the same in the 

non-plea context and in the plea context.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I don't think that's true

in the context of a specific sentence agreement under a 

type C plea because of -- and this is reinforced by the 

language in the policy statement, 1B1.10, which the 

Court last term in Dillon held is binding and controls 

what needs to be done during the sentence reduction 

proceeding.  And it specifically refers to the guideline 

provisions that were applied when the defendant was 

sentenced.  And that's something that happens in the 

process of the 3553(a) factors applicability.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why doesn't this line of 

questioning lead logically to the conclusion that no 

sentence after Booker and Fanfan is based on the 

guidelines?  Because, today, a sentencing judge can 

engage in the same analysis that the Sentencing 

Commission may engage in when it decides that a 

guideline range should be lowered and that that should 

be retroactive.  The judge can do that at the time when 

the sentence is imposed.

 We roll the clock back on the crack -- on 

the crack cocaine guidelines.  Under the authority that 

judges now have under Booker and Fanfan, a judge could 

say, well, I see that this is the crack cocaine 

guideline right now, but I think it is too harsh for all 

the reasons that were later persuasive in lowering the 

range, and therefore, I am sentencing below the range.

So it seems to lead logically to the 

conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the 

Sentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old 

pre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that 

that is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the 

whole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I understand the 

point that the analysis has certainly changed since 

Booker, but it is still the case that the defendant can 

appeal an error in application of the guidelines after 

Booker.

 If the judge were to -- to misapply the 

guidelines before he engages in the analysis that you're 

talking about, Justice Alito, that would be grounds for 

an appeal.  In retrospect, if the judge is asked whether 

the sentence was based on the guidelines, he -- he may 

say that particular sentence wasn't, because I ended up 

disregarding the guidelines under 3553(a).  I did the 

analysis.  I was exercising my sentencing discretion the 

first time around under 3553(a), and the guidelines 

ended up not being the basis of the sentence.

 And that is not something that is an option 

in a type C plea agreement, because there, the defendant 

cannot appeal when the judge agrees to the sentences in 

the agreement.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I find it hard to -- I 

find it hard to understand the analysis that would 

require courts to decide whether some (c)(1)(C) plea 

agreements are based on the guidelines and some are not 

based on the guidelines.  Maybe they are all based on 

the guidelines, and then the obligation would be on the 

government to put a provision in a standard plea 

agreement requiring the defendant to give up the 

opportunity to move for a sentence reduction if the 

guideline range is subsequently lowered.

 Or maybe none of them are based on the 

guidelines because -- for the reasons I just mentioned: 

This whole mechanism is now needed no longer as a result 

of Booker and Fanfan.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think in the context of 

an actual specific sentence plea agreement, that is the 

one that we think is off the table, because that is what 

is going to control the sentence.  And some type C plea 

agreements affirmatively contemplate application of the 

guidelines, as this one does with respect to the fine.

 And so when you have a plea agreement that 

tells the district judge, you are bound to apply a 

guideline provision once you've accepted this agreement, 

we haven't taken the position that the resulting 

sentence there is not based on the relevant guideline

range, but that is not what is going on here.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  You want us to 

decide this case.  I completely agree with what Justice 

Alito is saying, Justice Scalia, that maybe the world 

after Booker is different.  And I have not thought that 

one through.

 I am thinking this case is a pre-Booker 

case.  It is not real.  I am thinking it is on the cusp, 

so how am I to treat this case?  If it is a case where 

the guidelines apply, if it is such a case -- and I 

think maybe everyone here has assumed throughout that it 

was.  Am I right about that?  Were you saying this is a 

case where the guidelines do not apply, where they are 

not binding?  I mean, where pre-Booker doesn't count?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  How do you want us to take 

this, pre-Booker or post-Booker?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that the answer 

is, it's different.  But this is a -- this is a 

post-Booker case.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I know, you think the -- I 

think it is completely different regardless.  So let's 

avoid that controversy at the moment, and you tell me 

whether you want me to take it pre-Booker or 

post-Booker.

MR. GANNON:  The sentencing proceeding 

occurred six months -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I want you -­

MR. GANNON:  -- after the Booker opinion 

came out.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So you want to 

-- you want to set aside this post-Booker?

 MR. GANNON:  Yes, but.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Then perhaps we should have 

the pre-argument.  If we are taking this pre-Booker, I 

would have throughout it is QED.

 MR. GANNON:  I disagree, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, imagine that the 

that the Sentencing Commission -- imagine.  It is not 

true, but imagine that the Sentencing Commission had 

written the following words:  "Plea bargaining over 

sentences is above," as many argued they should.  They 

write those words.  Then they write the next word, 

"exception."  There is an exception, however; you are 

permitted to plea bargain about a sentence insofar as 

you argue about the range, where, within the range, it 

applies.  And of course when you apply the guidelines, 

as when you always apply the guidelines, here or 

elsewhere, departure is an unusual case.

 Now, suppose those were the words that the

Commission had written.  Could -- how -- is it possible 

under those circumstances you would still be arguing 

this sentence under the -- plea bargaining abolished 

except over where within the range -- is it possible you 

would be arguing that this is not based on the 

guidelines?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that had the 

Sentencing Commission adopted such a position, and if it 

were binding on the sentencing judge -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, it is, because of 

(a)(4).  It used to be -­

MR. GANNON:  Which is -- well, because -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- because it says in the 

sentencing guidelines, Judge, you will apply the 

guideline, unless you find a circumstance the Commission 

did not adequately take into account and in respect to 

that, you may and must consult policy statements, but 

guidelines and other materials.  That is what it says. 

Okay?

 So take I am right on that.  Assume I am 

right.  You can disagree with me, and I will look into 

it.

 MR. GANNON:  Before Booker was decided, 

it -- several of the circuits had already concluded that 

a judge could accept a type C plea agreement that had a

sentence outside the range, and that that wasn't a 

guidelines-based sentence.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I want an answer to my 

hypothetical, because I am trying to figure out how to 

think about it, and you will help me if you answer my 

hypothetical.

 MR. GANNON:  I think in those circumstances, 

the Commission effectively would have repealed type C 

plea agreements, because -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, that's right.  That's 

what they wanted to do.  Okay?  Now, that is correct. 

But you can still have them.

 MR. GANNON:  In your hypothetical, that is 

what they wanted to do.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You could still have them, 

but they allow them only for the purpose of where within 

the range the sentence will lie.  Okay?

 MR. GANNON:  In those circumstances I think 

that it would be fair to say that the sentence was based 

on the guideline range -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.

 MR. GANNON:  -- because the agreement hadn't 

given any reason for the judge to -- to leave the 

guidelines.

agree it would be based on the guidelines.  Now what I'd

 MR. GANNON:  It is on the last page of the 

government's appendix which is the 16A of our brief. 

And I think that it differs in two regards.  First of 

all, it -- it was a policy statement that even before 

Booker was not binding on the sentencing judge.  The 

Commission determined that -- that this particular 

guideline was not binding on judges the same way other 

provisions in the guidelines where.

anymore.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- but the question is 

whether the judge even had to apply it at all, and the 

judge did not need to.  And -- the second point that I 

was going to get to is that, unlike the colloquy that 

Justice Breyer had with Mr. Heft earlier on, it doesn't 

say the court may accept the agreement only if the court 

is satisfied that it is within the guideline range.  It 

gives the court permission to accept the agreement. 

This is a policy statement that gives the court 

permission to accept the agreement when it is within the 

guideline range or when there is a justifiable 

departure, but it does not then say that everything else 

is prohibited.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It's only if.  The words 

there are "only if."  It said should accept the 

recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring 

imposition of a specific sentence only if the court is 

satisfied either that such sentence is appropriate 

within the guidelines, or departure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're reading a different

JUSTICE BREYER:  I am?  I'm reading 6B1.3, I

 MR. GANNON:  I've been looking at a text of 

6B1.2 itself, which leaves out the word only.  But I 

think that here, even if you go back to the pre-Booker 

practice, I think it was clear that judges were able to 

depart from the guidelines to accept type C plea 

agreements that imposed the sentence that was outside 

the guideline range, and they -- and it wasn't 

considered an abuse of discretion.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I think you're right.  You 

see that is why I am having such a hard time.  I am 

having a hard time because first I put myself back in 

the Commission days, and there the Commission did want 

to abolish C.

 MR. GANNON:  Well-­

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then that is what it 

intended to do and that is what it said it did, but for 

what we are talking about.  Now, you first raised the 

question of did they have the authority to do that and I 

agree with you that that is a legitimate question.  I

question.

 Now we have the additional question of how 

Booker/Fanfan changes that and for what and when.  Do 

you see why I am puzzled and why I was asking you rather 

harshly to start with my hypothetical?

 MR. GANNON:  I -- I do think that -- that 

this gets puzzling as -- as you get further down, but I 

think that this is the simplest case.  It is a narrow 

category of cases.  We are dealing with a subset of one 

particular type of plea agreement.  It is distinct from 

every other aspect of Federal sentencing.  It's unlike 

what happens when somebody goes to trial; in those 

circumstances the judge clearly has the discretion to 

apply the sentencing guidelines at the time of 

sentencing.

 It is different from regular type B plea 

agreements where the parties have come up with an 

agreement and the judge notwithstanding the agreement is 

still free to determine the sentence that he or she 

wants to determine.

 This is a unique -- this uniquely gives a 

high level of certainty to the parties about the 

specific sentence that they negotiated.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't -- I am not in 

disagreement with the point you're making, but I think

that going back to what had bothered Justice Alito and 

Justice Scalia on now that the guidelines are not 

mandatory, is any sentence even under C really based on 

the agreement?  Because even a C agreement has to be 

approved by the judge.

 The legal consequence is not the agreement. 

That doesn't sentence the defendant.  It is the judge's 

decision as to what the sentence should be which he 

denotes in accepting the agreement that binds.

 And I think -- I may be making Justice 

Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement 

and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge 

feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a 

sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the 

guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not 

the guideline sentence?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, because I think that the 

relevant question for purposes of both 3582(c)(2) and 

the policy statements that the court said in Dillon 

controls the -- the process of implementing 3582(c)(2), 

is what did the judge do at the time of imposing the 

sentence?  And so although it is true that the judge 

generally will consider how the type C specific sentence 

that the parties have agreed upon corresponds to a 

guidelines analysis at the time of deciding whether to

accept the plea agreement, the relevant phrase in 

1B1.10(b)1 which is -- which is on page 8A of the 

government's appendix is that the judge is supposed to 

go back and look at what --

to only make substitutions 

for the corresponding guideline provisions that were 

applied when the defendant was sentenced.

 And so when you have a type C plea agreement 

that has a specific sentence even under the terms of 

this agreement, the only thing that the judge considered 

when he decided the sentence was going to be 106 months 

with respect to the term of imprisonment was the binding 

plea agreement.  That is what rule 11(c)(1)(C) required.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- no.  Because you're 

assuming that the agreement was automatically binding on 

the judge.

 MR. GANNON:  It was -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The judge was always 

capable of saying at the time of sentence I won't accept 

the 106.  If he had calculated the guidelines and if it 

turned out that the guidelines called for 240 to 360, he 

could have said easily no, that is so far outside of the 

guideline range with no justification that I am not 

going to accept -- impose the sentence.  You could 

withdraw your agreement and do whatever you're going to 

do.

MR. GANNON:  And had he not done that the 

proceeding would have occurred differently and it may 

not even have right occurred then, and -- and I think 

because under Rule 11 if he was rejecting the plea 

agreement and -- and the 106 months that the parties had 

agreed to, he would have to give the defendant the right 

to withdraw the plea at that point.  So the government 

would have been released from its obligations; the 

parties -- the defendant could have gone to trial.  He 

could have -- he could have continued to plead guilty. 

The parties could have come up with a type plea -- B 

plea agreement.  The parties may have asked for time to 

renegotiate a different type C agreement.  We do not 

know what would have happened in those circumstances.

 And as you pointed out before, Justice 

Sotomayor, this is not about asking the judge to step 

into the shoes of the parties and renegotiate what the 

agreement would have been had the judge decided to 

reject it the first time around.  Instead 3582(c)(2) 

contemplates a limited process by which the judge will 

reapply those provisions of the guidelines that he 

applied the first time around and -- and make the 

substitution that is now called for by the retroactively 

applicable change.  But here because the judge didn't 

actually make that application at the time of

sentencing, the judge did not actually have to apply the 

drug quantity table.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I am not following that 

argument for this reason.  It seems to me if you ask 

what did the judge apply at the time he imposed the 

original sentence, well, it has got to be the 

guidelines, because first the agreement provides for it; 

then he says I am going to wait for the probation report 

so I can see what the calculation is, whether I agree 

with it; and then he gives him a sentence that is 

precisely within the guidelines.

 So if you asked me to describe what that 

sentence was -- of what was it, 46 to 106 days -- I say 

that was a guideline sentence.  It was right there 

within the brackets that -- the guidelines.  So why 

wasn't it a guideline sentence?

 MR. GANNON:  Because for purposes of the 

term of imprisonment the judge was not actually applying 

the guidelines at that point.  He did so for purposes of 

the fine.  He ended up actually waiving the relevant 

fine, but those type C plea agreement here called for 

the judge to apply the guidelines with respect to the 

fine and did not call for the judge to apply the 

guidelines with respect to the term of imprisonment.  He 

knew that it was within what the PSR had calculated as

the guideline range and he concluded that that was the 

applicable guideline range which he needed to do for 

purposes of calculating the fine and other things, but 

it wasn't actually the basis for the sentence.

 The basis for the sentence was the plea 

agreement that he accepted, and there it was the 

parties' agreement.  And there are all sorts of things 

that went into the parties' agreement that the judge 

does not have the wherewithal to reconsider in 

retrospect.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought one of the 

things in the plea agreement was that the -- that the 

judge would have the right to himself calculate the 

guideline range.

 MR. GANNON:  Yes.  And that specifically 

contemplated in Rule 11(c) and in the guidelines, that 

the judge may postpone acceptance of the plea agreement 

until after the presentence report is prepared.  And the 

judge did do that here.  So he was aware of what the PSR 

recommended, but once, and had he decided that he did 

not like the 106 month sentence and he wanted to 

preserve his sentencing discretion, the option at that 

point was to have rejected the plea agreement, at which 

point the parties would have been free to do different 

things.  And among other things, the Government could

then have then argued for a higher sentence within the 

range.  Could have argued that the criminal history 

failed to represent the seriousness of the defendant's 

criminal past.  Could have argued for an upward 

departure even, but the Defendant got the benefit of the 

106 month agreement of not having the Government raise 

any of those other arguments at that time.  And now he 

is asking for essentially another bite of the apple and 

we think that because the basis for the sentence was 

indeed the negotiation and the agreement between the 

parties, that the court of appeals decision was correct.

 If there are no further questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Gannon.

 Mr. Heft, you have three minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. HEFT:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Just a 

couple of points.  First of all, the record here leaves 

no doubt that the judge based his sentence on the 

guidelines.  The sentencing transcript specifically 

states that the judge and I'd like to quote this, this 

is at page 47 of the joint appendix and I quote, "the 

court will adopt the findings of the probation officer 

disclosed in the probation report and application of the

guidelines as set out therein."  On page 48 of the joint 

appendix the judge says, having considered the advisory 

guidelines, he went on to impose that sentence.  So it 

is quite clear that the judge and even in his statements 

of reasons on page 95 of the joint appendix, again 

reaffirmed that this sentence was based on the 

guidelines.

 Now, the other point that I'd like to make 

is that the Government acknowledges that it has carved 

out a very small exception to its argument that C pleas 

regarding specific sentences and sentencing ranges are 

not eligible for (c)(2) relief.  But it seems to me that 

reading, taking the Government position into account, if 

this plea agreement had not stated 106 months, then 

Mr. Freeman's under the terms of this plea agreement in 

the Government's view and under the Government's 

argument of what exception exists under the C pleas for 

purposes of 3582, Mr. Freeman would be eligible for the 

relief that was granted.  And we would simply urge the 

Court in this case to adopt a rule that does not exclude 

specific sentences and C pleas for eligibility in 3582. 

Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
