CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 00-799, the City of Los Angeles v. Alameda


Books, Inc.


Mr. Klekner.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. KLEKNER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KLEKNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Following its 1977 pioneering study, the City of


Los Angeles enacted a, in 1978 a comprehensive zoning


ordinance regulating the location of all types of adult


business activities in the city.  The ordinance defined


eight business activities and required that they each be


separated from each other by 1,000 feet.


Notwithstanding the clear intent of the city's


ordinance in 1978, it became apparent that the ordinance


could and was being interpreted to permit more than one


adult business in the same building.  This has been


described by plaintiffs as a drafting error inadvertent


loophole, but it was an ambiguity, and it became necessary


to amend the ordinance in 1983 to remove that ambiguity,


thereby --


QUESTION:  Do we know if, at the time the

ordinance was enacted -- 1977?


MR. KLEKNER:  '78, sir.


QUESTION:  '78.  Do we know if, at that time,


there were businesses like the one at issue here, i.e., a


place where they have both sale and rental and viewing --


MR. KLEKNER:  I presume --


QUESTION:  Do we know if those businesses


existed in that form in 1978?


MR. KLEKNER:  I believe they did.  I don't


believe --


QUESTION:  All right.


MR. KLEKNER:  -- that the study specifically


analyzed specific combinations in one building.


QUESTION:  All right.


MR. KLEKNER:  That wasn't the purpose of the


study.


QUESTION:  Well, your clients didn't have


businesses like that.  Your clients just had one or the


other, wasn't it?  What did they start off with?


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.


MR. KLEKNER:  Our clients are innocent.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  The businesses regulated here did not


offer both.  Which did they offer when the ordinance was


initially passed?

 MR. KLEKNER:  I'm sorry, I did not hear the


question entirely, sir.


QUESTION:  When the ordinance was initially


passed, which of the two types of business did they offer?


MR. KLEKNER:  Well, these businesses started in


the late eighties, early 1990's, either as a bookstore or


as an adult arcade.


QUESTION:  That's what I'm asking, which --


which?


MR. KLEKNER:  But it was well after the adoption


of the ordinance.


QUESTION:  Which did they start as, a bookstore,


or as an arcade?


MR. KLEKNER:  My recollection is that each -- I


think it was Highland Books started as a adult arcade, and


the reverse was true for Alameda Books.  It started as a


bookstore.


QUESTION:  Did your evidence in '78 or any


evidence since then specifically address the question of


whether the combination of more than one form of business


at one location has any measurable effect on, you know,


the deleterious effect that you measured?


MR. KLEKNER:  No.  The studies did not


specifically look at combination of adult businesses in


one place, or in one building.  They looked at the

clustering effect in the city's various communities.


QUESTION:  Am I wrong in thinking that the study


which you rely on, the 1977 study, did have as one


category bookstore/arcade.  It had as discrete entities


the massage parlors, the adult theaters, and the adult


motels, but it was my understanding that the arcade plus


bookstore, or video sales shops, that those were together


in that 1977 study.


MR. KLEKNER:  The answer is yes and no.  That


phrase appears several times in the study and in certain


conclusions, but if you look at the -- at certain of the


questionnaires that were sent out to various businesses,


community groups, the individual businesses were


separately identified.  In other words, a bookstore, peep


shows, movie theaters, theaters, massage parlors.


QUESTION:  Well then, is there nothing to what


we're told, that the -- this combination of video sales


plus viewing is common and, indeed, an arcade can't


survive as a stand-alone business, that the combination


of, you can see it, and if you want it you can buy it, was


common?


MR. KLEKNER:  Well, the issue of separateness,


and whether a business, an arcade and a bookstore can,


could, or should survive separately is off the table.  It


was not part -- there was a stipulation that the -- that

that would not be considered.  That's not before the


Court.  As the record now stands, I guess the Court would


have to presume, as did the trial court and the court of


appeals, that survivability, economic viability of


separate businesses or combined isn't an issue for this


Court' --


QUESTION:  Well, each of these businesses was


one or the other of those things and operated on that


basis alone for how long?


MR. KLEKNER:  Several years.  I can't --


QUESTION:  Do you know whether they operated at


a profit or at a loss?


MR. KLEKNER:  We never did any discovery on


that, so the answer is, we have no way of knowing.


QUESTION:  But they did it for a couple of


years, anyway?


MR. KLEKNER:  Correct.


QUESTION:  They were only an arcade and there


was no selling going on when they were initially launched?


MR. KLEKNER:  It's my understanding that they


might have sell -- excuse me, sold some books, or what-


have-you, but their primary business was having a series


of video booths where you could watch adult movies.


QUESTION:  I get the opposite impression.  Maybe


I was misled by the briefs.  I thought they had always

operated as a combined business.  You say that's wrong?


MR. KLEKNER:  Not based upon the facts as I


understand them, sir.


QUESTION:  Pardon?


MR. KLEKNER:  Not based upon the facts as I


understand them, that -- and I believe in 1991 it was


Alameda Books that became both, and it was I think 1992


that Highland Books became both.  I might be off by a year


or so, but there was a point in time where both -- where


each location became both adult business activities.


QUESTION:  I'd like to ask you -- I'll assume


with you for the moment you don't need any evidence.  I


suppose you don't imagine -- forget the evidence question. 


All right, I take it that this ordinance -- and I'm also


assuming it, assuming this, you could have a particular


place, 5,000 feet of books, or you could have 5,000 cubic


feet of books, or you could have 5,000 cubic feet of


arcade, but you couldn't have 5,000 cubic feet of both,


all right.  Now, my question is, what's the theory behind


that?


MR. KLEKNER:  The theory is the solution, not


the facts.  If you go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,


the facts tend to support the same conclusion, that


concentrations of adult businesses cause secondary


effects. 

How do you solve that problem?  And the city's

decision was, because of the clustering effect, we termed


it like a farmer's market type of effect for adult


businesses, that dispersal was the solution.


Square footage, you could have 5,000 square feet


of this, or maximum, is a different solution, based upon,


New York did that in their solution.  They decided that


the space limitation, square foot limitation was


appropriate for New York.  That was not part of the


solution for Los Angeles.  It was a complete dispersal


of --


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, if, in fact, there


is no space limitation, I would repeat my question, that


it seems a fortiori if you can have a bookstore of


gigantic size, or an arcade of gigantic size, but you


can't have the two together, even of a little size, so I


don't -- I'm not talking about evidence.  I'm assuming,


though, you have to have some theory, and the theory has


to be a reasonable one, and it can't just be we want to


censor everything, so what's the theory?


MR. KLEKNER:  The theory is simply the solution


adopted by the city of Los Angeles was to disperse.  If,


in fact, we were faced with the megastore concept that,


you know, the Wal Mart of adult bookstores, then that


would be a different problem, that we could address in the


future, at least as I understand this Court's precedent,

but that's what we were faced with in 1977.  We were faced


with the need to protect the city's neighborhoods from a


lot of smaller businesses, if you will, and the solution


was, we'll trade size, if you will, for dispersal.  New


York, for example, said 500 --


QUESTION:  But it still doesn't answer the


question, exactly.  If the city wanted to address the


concentration of adult businesses, certainly the 1977


study likewise addressed that, didn't it?


MR. KLEKNER:  Correct.


QUESTION:  But now we're talking about an


ordinance that doesn't focus on the concentration of adult


businesses but, rather, the combination, because the city


doesn't want the business to break into two parts, even


though it tried to operate as one business, and I guess


the 1977 study didn't address the combination, the effects


of a combination of focuses in a single business, whereas


your ordinance does.


MR. KLEKNER:  Well --


QUESTION:  As opposed to a concentration of


businesses.


MR. KLEKNER:  There are several responses to the


question.  The first is that, as you -- as I understand


how you use the term, business, you're talking about a


corporate organization or a single proprietorship.  That

is not what the city's ordinance deals with.


QUESTION:  -- operated as a single store, a


single business.


MR. KLEKNER:  From the city's perspective, it is


illogical, or not reasonable to say, for the city council


to say, you know we have a problem here, on LaSeneca


Boulevard, because we have two many adult businesses


together, so we're going to require them to disperse. 


There is no issue as to how we define these adult


businesses.  That's not before the Court.


QUESTION:  Well, what if the ban were, you can


sell adult VHS tapes but not Beta tapes in the same store?


MR. KLEKNER:  We haven't done that, and --


QUESTION:  Well, it's the same thing.  Can you


break it down any way you want and say, it's fine because


we're concerned about the --


MR. KLEKNER:  Because we are concerned with the


overall effect we have broken down the ordinance to its


local components.  We have not tried to somehow slice and


dice definitions so that you have several different types


of retail adult establishments.


QUESTION:  Do all of the categories that you


have in the ordinance exist in the real world out there,


video arcades only?


MR. KLEKNER:  Yes.  They did in 1977.  They did

QUESTION:  Adult bookstores only --


MR. KLEKNER:  Correct.


QUESTION:  -- without arcades in them --


MR. KLEKNER:  Correct.


QUESTION:  -- and so forth, every one of the


categories, adult movies only?


MR. KLEKNER:  Correct.  Each of these


definitions, if you will --


QUESTION:  When you started out, though, there


weren't all that many tapes.  There were books, adult


bookstores.  Now, isn't the video much more prevalent


today --


MR. KLEKNER:  Actually, it's my under --


QUESTION:  -- and you seem to say that the


combination of this list, you think of a bookstore,


nowadays one can browse, one can even go to a cafe and


have coffee, and all that, or go to a record shop and


listen to the tape and then buy it.  That combination of,


I view it and then buy it or not, that seems to be a


natural combination, unlike having half of my


establishment a massage parlor and the other half a book


shop.


MR. KLEKNER:  The problem with your real-world


description of a Barnes and Noble is, it doesn't exist in

the adult entertainment world.  The evidence that was


before the trial court was that the books, the magazines,


the sex toys, the novelties, are all shrink-wrapped.  You


cannot go into an adult bookstore, sit down and have your


Starbucks, and browse through the material.


QUESTION:  And you don't prevent them -- you


don't prevent these stores from allowing customers to


preview the films before they decide whether to buy them,


the stores that sell adult films.  The ordinance doesn't


prevent them from allowing customers, at no charge, to


view the films before they buy them, does it?


MR. KLEKNER:  If I understand the correct -- the


question correctly, no.


QUESTION:  Under the ordinance, can a customer


come in and say, before I buy this film, I would like to


see it, and the store manager says sure, go ahead, look at


it first, then you can decide whether to buy it?


MR. KLEKNER:  For free?


QUESTION:  For free.


MR. KLEKNER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  The ordinance permits that anyway,


doesn't it?


MR. KLEKNER:  We are talking about --


QUESTION:  But they want to charge for it.


MR. KLEKNER:  And the machines that allow you to

view up to 60 clips, if you will, from various adult


movies, or you go to another machine in another booth, you


can -- I want to see that entire movie right there, as


opposed to the clips.


QUESTION:  What is your principal argument in


opposition to the rationale in the court of appeals?  I


have the feeling we're not letting you make the principal


argument here that you wanted to make.


MR. KLEKNER:  The principal problem with the


court of appeals decision is, of course, how it


requires -- what it requires, the use of secondary effects


and how it is discounts, if you will, or disregards this


Court's precedent, is effectively what the court of


appeals has said.  Not only must we have empirical


evidence of secondary effects in general, which the city


does have, but you must also show that in this particular


case this combination contributes to that secondary


effects, which I submit is going to be, on an empirical


basis, next to impossible to do.  The third --


QUESTION:  If it's next to impossible to do, why


should you be allowed, under the First Amendment, to do


it?  I mean, it sounds as though you're kind of making an


argument from spectral evidence here.  You're saying,


well, the evidence that we've got doesn't demonstrate the


problem that we're addressing, but we ought to be able to

address it anyway.  I mean, isn't that what it boils down


to?


MR. KLEKNER:  The problem we were addressing


was, is there a correlation, to use the term you used, the


word you used in Barnes --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. KLEKNER:  -- between the adult businesses


and secondary effects, do they cause a problem.  We have


documented that.


QUESTION:  And you've documented it, but as I


understand it, you've documented it with reference to


adult businesses which were not at the time defined or


identified as necessarily being businesses that offered


only one service, as opposed to a business like these,


that offers two, so that the evidence, as I understand it,


did not address the issues that is before us now.


MR. KLEKNER:  But it did address that issue,


because it is not reasonable to assume that if you have


two businesses side by side in the same block, causing


secondary effects, that it can require them to disperse,


which is entirely --


QUESTION:  Yes, but we're -- I think we're


playing with words.  You're talking about two businesses


side by side, and you were measuring the effects back in


'78 of businesses side-by-side.  This is one business.

It's not side-by-side.  It's one business that sells two


things within the same storefront.


MR. KLEKNER:  But there's no evidence one way or


the other --


QUESTION:  Isn't that your problem?


MR. KLEKNER:  I don't believe it is -- it should


be a problem.


QUESTION:  You measured -- you measured the


effect of a video store -- what do you call these, arcade


store, and a bookstore side-by-side, and you found that


that was deleterious, and the problem is that you did not


measure what the different effect would be if you knocked


down the wall between them.  Is there any reason to


believe that that would make a difference?


MR. KLEKNER:  That's the whole point that the


city's been trying to make all along.  There's no


difference in effect.  You can't assume --


QUESTION:  Well, you don't know --


MR. KLEKNER:  -- less or more.


QUESTION:  How do you know that, any more than I


know it?  I mean, I see your point when you say, look, if


there are two different entrepreneurs on a block, each of


them doing whatever they can to draw in clientele, the


odds are they're probably going to draw in a greater


concentration of people than one.  I mean, I will accept

that, as at least intuitive.


Here, we're talking about one entrepreneur, and


what seems at least intuitively arguable in the first


place doesn't seem to be so obvious in the second


instance.


MR. KLEKNER:  But you are describing this in


terms of business organization.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. KLEKNER:  Which is not how the city's zoning


ordinance works.  The zoning ordinance does not really


care whether you're an L.L.P., a corporation on-shore or


off-shore, or a sole proprietorship.  Under the reasoning


that you're putting forward, I could open up at a location


just because I have one company, as many adult businesses


as I wish, or alternately, in order to get around the


city's ordinance, the two side-by-side companies,


businesses form a new corporation, they merge, now we have


one corporate entity, ergo, we're home free.  That's


not --


QUESTION:  And the -- but the likelihood that


your 1978 evidence is going to bear on these various


possibilities depends on more specific facts.  If the two


side-by-side entities that merge are, on the one hand, a


massage parlor and a bookstore, it seems sensible to say

people that they would have as separate entities.


But when you're talking about combinations like


books and video, it isn't obvious that you're going to be


drawing different concentrations of people, and I think


what we're stuck with here is that your evidence, through


no fault of Los Angeles in '78, but your evidence just


doesn't address the question as specifically as we have it


before us now.


MR. KLEKNER:  If you look at the nature of the


businesses, you come to an arcade to stay there and look,


and when you leave that arcade, you have a different frame


of mind than if you went to the bookstore, got your


shrink-wrapped magazine, put it in a brown paper bag, and


went home, so that's one logical deduction you can make


from all of the evidence that's before you.


QUESTION:  Isn't it an equally logical deduction


that by looking at the cover of the shrink-wrapped


magazine and watching part of a video clip, or a video


clip of something that you ultimately buy, you're going to


be left in about the same frame of mind in either case?


MR. KLEKNER:  No.  I think after watching 60


clips from adult business, from adult videos, as opposed


to the cover of a shrink-wrapped magazine -- the only


reason --


QUESTION:  Aren't the -- maybe the magazine

covers are dull, but I --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- assumed they were pretty racy, and


if you look at 60 covers and 60 clip -- I don't know,


that's cutting it pretty fine.


MR. KLEKNER:  Justice Souter, they're not live


action.


QUESTION:  Mr. Klekner --


MR. KLEKNER:  That's the difference.


QUESTION:  Mr. Klekner, your question presented


seems to be quite narrow.  It says, is a city zoning


ordinance which prohibits the operation of more than one


adult entertainment business at a single location,


including an adult bookstore and an adult arcade, invalid


because the city did not study the negative effects of


such combination?


MR. KLEKNER:  Correct.


QUESTION:  It seems to assume the city did not


study the combination but, rather, relied on judicially


approved statutory precedent from other jurisdictions.  I


assume that's some reference to the Hart case from the


Carolinas.


MR. KLEKNER:  Correct, North Carolina.


QUESTION:  Because the Ninth Circuit said that


wasn't suitable reliance, is that right?

 MR. KLEKNER:  Well, basically what the --


QUESTION:  The Ninth Circuit, I thought, thought


that wouldn't do it because Hart addressed the health


effects --


MR. KLEKNER:  No, what the Ninth --


QUESTION:  -- of the arcades, rather than the


effects on crime.


MR. KLEKNER:  What the Ninth Circuit effectively


said was, there was some doubt whether Hart would survive


scrutiny under this Court's Renton decision, but we are


certainly confident that under Ninth Circuit precedent


it's not a valid law.  The purpose of Hart --


QUESTION:  I don't know, it just struck me in


reading the question that it was pretty much limited to


whether they were right about whether you could rely on


the Hart decision.


MR. KLEKNER:  Hopefully not.  The city in 1983


specifically relied on its findings in 1977, the study


that led up to the original ordinance, which as I said is


not at issue.  That ordinance is reasonably --


comparatively reasonable, according to plaintiffs.


The problem is -- well, the issue with Hart is,


Hart was decided in 1979.  It said that the city's '77


study, just as we --

amendment?


MR. KLEKNER:  That's correct, that in 1979, our


study supported a North Carolina statute prohibiting more


than one adult business in the location, that that was a


sufficient evidentiary basis.  Confirming what the city


council thought --


QUESTION:  The Ninth Circuit thought that Hart


relied on the negative health effects of the arcade.


MR. KLEKNER:  We are less -- we, the city, is


less concerned with the factual differences than with the


legal reasoning and the fact that it fully supports, and


should have been considered for that purpose by the Ninth


Circuit, as validating the intent and purpose of the


original ordinance and '83's amendment.


QUESTION:  Well, what we're getting down to is


just how precise a particular study or a particular


decision has to be.  I mean, does it have to be word for


word what the city is talking about, or can the city draw


reasonable inferences, if it affects A, it also affects B?


MR. KLEKNER:  That's what hopefully the -- well,


that's what the city has been trying to do, but again, it


goes back to, you know, if you look at your precedents,


when a city has these problems, the logical -- the logical


thing for the city to do is say, ban them.  We can't. 


It's a violation of the Constitution.  We accept that.

That's what Renton says.  If you can't ban them, you


should be entitled to a reasonable opportunity to


experiment.


QUESTION:  And where I'm a little confused is,


at the beginning of this segment of the argument, when we


began focusing on this question, I thought you said


something to the effect that we can't show this


empirically, and I was surprised.  I thought you would


say, look, this isn't rocket science.  If you have just a


shoe store, and the shoe store all of a sudden starts to


sell clothes, you're going to get more people.  That's the


end of it.


MR. KLEKNER:  But --


QUESTION:  I thought that's what you were going


to tell, but you --


MR. KLEKNER:  When you -- well, maybe I


misspoke, but when you want to get into the empirical


evidence of, are you a bad actor, this particular business


is a bad actor, it's a very detailed nuisance type of


analysis, and when you have these combinations of adult


businesses, or side-by-side adult businesses, and you try


to do that same analysis, the immediate thing that is


going to occur, the first thing that is going to occur,


it's not me, it's my neighbor, it's not me, it's this


other part of the business.

 We can't be expected to provide for a


legislative scheme that detailed particularization of each


possible permutation and combination of the problem. 


That's exactly what Young and Renton stand for.


QUESTION:  Let me ask you --


QUESTION:  Why doesn't --


QUESTION:  Go ahead.


QUESTION:  No, please.


QUESTION:  Let me ask you just one general


question.  We often have said, the cities can rely on


general experience of other cities and other studies, and


so forth and so on.  Are there a lot of ordinances out


there that follow the pattern of this particular


ordinance, that would prohibit a single business from


operating both a video arcade and a bookstore in the same


location?


MR. KLEKNER:  There are some, Justice Stevens. 


There are others that would permit such combinations,


depending upon how the city that's -- a particular


jurisdiction analyzed the solution.


QUESTION:  But there are a substantial number


who are similar to the one that we're talking about today?


MR. KLEKNER:  I won't use an adverb to describe


the amount.  There are some.  I don't know if it's


substantial or not.

 QUESTION:  That's an adjective.


MR. KLEKNER:  Excuse me, yes.


QUESTION:  May I go back to Justice O'Connor's


question, because she asked how the Hart facts could help


you.  As I understand it, the facts in that -- number 1,


the basis for municipal action in that case was public


health, and it was public health based on the sexual


activities that were going on inside the booths, and as I


understand it, Los Angeles in effect has an ordinance that


requires open booths, lights on, freely seen -- the booths


can be freely seen from the front of the store, and so on,


so it seems to me that Los Angeles has taken steps to


preclude the health problem that that earlier case


addressed and, if that's so, how could that earlier case


support the Los Angeles ordinance?


MR. KLEKNER:  Well, again, the Hart reading of


facts in that decision, again go to the fact that these


combinations cause problems, and that the city's


ordinance -- excuse me, the city's study supported the


inference that it's okay to -- the solution is to separate


these businesses.


QUESTION:  Yes, but the Hart -- as I under --


maybe I'm wrong, but I thought the basis for the


governmental action in Hart was public health based on the


activity that was going on in these booths.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. WESTON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. WESTON:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:


At the time we filed our briefs, we knew of no


ordinances similar to Los Angeles prohibiting the


simultaneous inclusion of an arcade and retail sales


within one establishment, other than the one that was in


Hart v. Edmisten.  At the time the city adopted it, it


itself -- let me rephrase that.  At the time the city


adopted it, the only one that apparently existed in the


United States was the one in North Carolina and,


subsequent to the city's adoption, as far as we knew,


there were no additional ones throughout the United


States.  This is an enormously unique and unusual approach


to a problem apparently not supported or shared by the


experiences of other cities.


QUESTION:  Do you know of any other cities that

had the experience of businesses such as the two involved


here, which were originally involved in one sex pandering


activity, and then, after the ordinance was passed, went


into a second one instead of opening up a separate store?


MR. WESTON:  Justice Scalia, you'll --


QUESTION:  I mean, you know --


MR. WESTON:  You'll --


QUESTION:  -- they may be unique, but the


situation that they confronted may be unique as well.


MR. WESTON:  You'll pardon me for not adopting


the reference of the Court in phrasing the nature of the


business, but in fact the opposite is quite true. 


Respondent's businesses at all times, as is made clear in


the joint appendix at pages 19 and 20, as discussed at


great length at page 6 of respondent's brief, particularly


in footnote 6, at all times operated their arcades in


addition to retail distribution, retail dissemination on


the premises, in the same establishment of sexually


oriented materials.


QUESTION:  That's not how I read those pages.


Shall we turn to them, page 20 of the appendix?


MR. WESTON:  Please.


QUESTION:  Highland Book was issued a picture


arcade police permit.  Prior to June of 1991 the only


adult type of business use of Highland Books was its

picture arcade, which at all times exhibited exclusively

MR. WESTON:  Right.


QUESTION:  This is the affidavit of the owner of


both of these businesses.


MR. WESTON:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Mr. Wiener, right?


MR. WESTON:  Yes, that's correct, Justice


Scalia, but the point, the use of the term, adult


business, was in the way that Los Angeles defined a use,


and that if the Court will continue a little bit


further --


QUESTION:  But that's the only thing that's


relevant here.


MR. WESTON:  No, with all respect, Your Honor. 


Up until sometime in 1989 -- well, let me phrase it this


way.  For a considerable period of time in California, law


existed such that the term, substantial numbers of retail


materials -- that was the operative term which separated


a -- an adult bookstore from a nonbookstore.  In other


words, if one -- one could operate the bookstore and carry


a certain amount of adult material and not be denominated


adult. 


business?

QUESTION:  It was ancillary to the other


business?


MR. WESTON:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. WESTON:  Up until a very recent time in Los


Angeles history, one could carry up to 49 percent of


materials in one store and not be deemed to be an adult


bookstore.


QUESTION:  This was a Los Angeles County


ordinance --


MR. WESTON:  No --


QUESTION:  -- you're referring to now?


MR. WESTON:  No, what I'm referring to is


California court decisions which had interpreted the


phrase, substantial number, amount of retail stock in


trade.


QUESTION:  In the county ordinance?  We're not


talking about a State law, we're talking about a county


ordinance?


MR. WESTON:  It wasn't a law, Your Honor.  In


other words, the California courts of appeal had construed


the term, substantial portion of the stock in trade, to


mean anything less --


QUESTION:  Why did they -- why were they  -- why

did they construe that term?  Where did the term come


from?


MR. WESTON:  The term came -- was an identical


terminology utilized in many, many, ordinances throughout


the State of California.  There was a vagueness challenge


brought to it, and the court construed the term to mean a


preponderance, more than 50 percent of stock in trade in


order to avoid the vagueness.  That --


QUESTION:  This was a phrase used in a number of


different city and county ordinances --


MR. WESTON:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- in California?


MR. WESTON:  Absolutely, and in fact it's


interesting to note, because we've spoken about Hart this


morning, that the North Carolina statute in Hart was one


that pegged the definition of a retail bookstore as a


preponderance.  In other words, unless the store carried


51 percent of its stock in trade as adult materials in


Hart itself, it would not qualify as an adult bookstore,


and --


QUESTION:  And that's what you think Mr. Wiener


meant when he said in his affidavit, prior to June of 1991


the only adult type of business, the only adult type of


business use at Highland Books was its picture arcade


which at all times exhibited exclusively adult videotapes?

more than 49 percent of other business was --


MR. WESTON:  If I may read --


QUESTION:  That's what the next sentence says.


MR. WESTON:  Yes.  Thank you, Justice Stevens. 


The next sentence, Justice Scalia, prior to June of 1991,


the majority of items available for retail sale at


Highland Books were of a nonadult variety.


QUESTION:  That's why the only adult business he


was doing there was the other one.  They were of a


nonadult variety.


MR. WESTON:  But that's --


QUESTION:  He's not saying we were selling adult


books, but selling less than 50 percent of adult books. 


He said the only other business we had was a nonadult


business.


MR. WESTON:  Justice Scalia, forgive me, I can


only tell you what the circumstances were.  The


phraseology that was utilized tried to use the


terminology, the confusing terminology that Los Angeles


used in terms of its description of what a use is, and Mr.


Wiener at the time sold and displayed vast quantities of


sexually oriented retail materials in the same stores, but


under the L.A. ordinance at the time, it did not

constitute an adult use.


QUESTION:  Well, I appreciate your testimony to


that effect, but what his affidavit clearly says is that


the only adult business he did prior to 1991 was the


exhibition of adult videotapes.  The majority of the items


available for retail sale were of a nonadult variety.


MR. WESTON:  Forgive me, Justice Scalia, I don't


want to belabor the point --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. WESTON:  -- but that's not a fair reading of


it.  Prior to June of 1991, the only adult type of


business use, the type of business use at Highland Books


was its picture arcade.  That is defined exclusively, that


term refers exclusively to 1270 of the Los Angeles zoning


ordinance which defined a use and labeled a use a


business, and the only way that one became an adult


business and therefore a separate use was if one's stock


in trade was 51 percent or more adult.


Mr. Wiener's was not.  It was substantial, but


it was not a preponderance, and therefore the notion that


this existed as an arcade bereft of and separate from any


retail use is simply neither accurate factually nor


supported by the declaration that was offered.


QUESTION:  I don't understand what this 51-49


pertains to.  Does it pertain --

 MR. WESTON:  Stock in trade of the retail


establishment.


QUESTION:  Well, and it means that if 49 -- if


less than 51 percent is adult material, you're not --


MR. WESTON:  It's not -- at the time, in Los


Angeles, it was not characterized as an adult use --


QUESTION:  As an adult business.


MR. WESTON:  Adult use or business, that's


correct.


QUESTION:  Right, okay, but it doesn't mean that


if you have 51 percent in one adult business and 49


percent in another adult business, the 49 percent is not


an adult business?  Does it mean that as well?


MR. WESTON:  That is correct.  The 49 percent of


adult retail material did -- acted to -- let me -- if I


may phrase it the other way.  51 percent of stock in trade


at a business in Los Angeles, if it was adult, made that


store adult, even if it was 20,000 total items, and


virtually, and nearly 10,000 of them had nothing to do


with sexually oriented material.


QUESTION:  Mr. Weston, I understand that that


division, that that was by inventory not by sales.


MR. WESTON:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.


QUESTION:  Because one of the problems was, you


had lots of books, dull books that nobody was going to

buy, and that you had -- that was what you had for 51


percent, and then you had the stuff that people bought,


and that was the 49 percent.


MR. WESTON:  The record does not reflect that,


Justice Ginsburg.  That may have been the fact although,


of course, the opposite may have also been true.


QUESTION:  But it's true that it would not have


been considered an adult bookstore so long as they


maintained that 51-49.


MR. WESTON:  That's correct, and if I may, as in


Hart, Mr. Wiener's initial businesses, as they were


initially constituted, did not conflict with the multiple


use provision, notwithstanding the fact that 100 percent


of the videotapes viewed in them were adult, and 49


percent or up to 49 percent of the retail items available


for sale were also adult.


QUESTION:  But can I --


MR. WESTON:  That did not constitute two adult


uses under California law at that time, and that is


exactly what the law was in Hart, that it was perfectly


permissible to have 100 percent adult arcade material, and


49 percent retail books, videos and so forth, and that


would not have conflicted with the prohibition in Hart.


QUESTION:  Could you -- can you explain -- I'm


just trying to get back to the main point here, at least

detail that you know.  I want to start this naively, so I


take it what they're saying is, look, we have a zoning


ordinance.  We have to have some way of defining what's a


single business.  If it were a liquor ordinance and we


said, selling liquor wholesale is one thing, selling it at


a bar is another, so that's two uses, not one.  If it were


a meat store which said, over-the-counter is one thing, at


the restaurant is another -- of course we could do it a


million ways.


MR. WESTON:  Certainly.


QUESTION:  But we have to do it some way, and so


forget whether there's evidence or not.  Just let us do


what's reasonable here, and this is one, and by the way,


if it were a different kind of ordinance, if it were a


cubic foot limitation, the fact that they counted it as


two separate things rather than one, would cut in your


favor, but here it happens to cut against you.


MR. WESTON:  Well --


QUESTION:  But they say, either way, we're just


trying to have a reasonable definition.  All right, now


your response is what?


MR. WESTON:  Well, initially. I think Your

Honor -- Justice Breyer, you have characterized fairly in


some sense the city's position, because the city basically


says, so logistically, if it's an adult business it


generates secondary effects, and if there is secondary


effects and there is adult business regulation not


amounting to a ban, we can do anything we want, and courts


are directed not to look meaningfully at it, and it simply


gets dealt with as a valid ordinance.


But the problem with what Los Angeles has done


is that, unlike what would be logical, or unlike what most


zoning agencies do, which is to take a combined business


such as Your Honor posits and zone it according to the


most intense of the combined uses, Los Angeles, for


example, makes reference to the fact that it deals with


service stations and auto repair places differently, but


the remedy that Los Angeles selects for that is not to


say, an auto repair place must be here, and 1,000 feet


away there must be a place where you -- I've said it


poorly, but that you cannot have an auto repair place


here, combined with a place that pumps gas, even though


there are separate uses.  What Los Angeles logically does,


as every city does, is permit the combination and then


zone the combination use according to the most intense of


the combined uses.


QUESTION:  No, but that's a bad analogy, because

auto places are not -- try liquor.  Try thinking of it


liquor, and probably they could.  They'd say, we only want


one liquor license in 1,000 feet, and if you have a bar


you don't have a shop, and it then becomes less obviously


unreasonable on its face.


MR. WESTON:  Let's take a --


QUESTION:  So let's assume it in their favor


that way, and then argue against it.


MR. WESTON:  Sure.  Let's take a look at that


one.  But what does Los Angeles do?  It doesn't ban the


combined use, it simply again -- I don't mean Los Angeles. 


In your hypothetical, in the bar-restaurant, the zoning


regulation would be appropriate for the more intense use,


I assume --


QUESTION:  But this whole question is something


that's secondary.  I thought the question before me is


whether or not Los Angeles is reasonable in saying that


the combined use draws more people without having a study. 


I fully understand that you have an objection to the


Government bifurcating your business.  Leave that off the


table, so the only question is whether or not this whole


business draws more people, and whether or not there's an


empirical basis for it.  Isn't that what I'm supposed to


decide here?


MR. WESTON:  I'm not quite sure about drawing

more people.  I don't think that that was what the -- that


was not the focus of what Los Angeles was concerned --


QUESTION:  You mean, you had the arcade because


it didn't draw any more people?


MR. WESTON:  No, it wasn't more people, it was


the notion for a variety of reasons, and if we return to


Young v. American Mini Theatres, there is at least --


there's some indication in Young that it's not simply a


question of people, but rather, what is the perception


from the outside world?


QUESTION:  Well,  but not simply a question of


people, but surely the kind of secondary effects that have


been spoken of in cases depend upon people's activities,


and the people aren't 10 miles away, they're somehow


associated with the business.


MR. WESTON:  Certainly.  I -- that's


unquestionably reasonable, Mr. Chief Justice, but the


articulation by Los Angeles in its statement of


legislative purpose, which appears at -- it's at page 74


of the appendix to the petition for certiorari, and I'm


truncating it, but two or more adult entertainment


businesses, operated as a single commercial enterprise. 


This concentration of adult entertainment businesses tends


to have an adverse impact on the neighborhood in which


they are located.

 The hypothesis, the asserted harm, was from a


combination of adult businesses, and what was the evidence


on which Los Angeles relied for this proposition?  The


sole evidence was a study that measured not, as has been


brought out earlier, whether there were harms unique,


there were special harms that developed from a combination


of two businesses within a single unitary establishment,


but rather, whether there were secondary effects that


resulted from the clustering of a dozen, or 15 or 20


unrelated adult businesses.


QUESTION:  At some point, Mr. Weston, don't you


think the legislature is entitled to draw what might be


common sense inferences from the studies that it made, and


that it doesn't have to have empirical evidence for every


single thing that it does in the ordinance?


MR. WESTON:  Of course not, Your Honor, and for


example, if the city, as it suggests, which we do not


agree with, really thought -- I don't mean to cast


aspersions on the city.  If, in fact, the city's sense


that this adult bookstore-arcade combination was so unique


and so unusual, even though there's no evidence in the


record of an arcade standing alone anywhere int he United


States, except as part of an adult bookstore, but if it


was so unique that they really hadn't dealt with it, one


could understand that it would be appropriate, as the city

has, to accord zoning treatment to this combined use,


which is exactly what was done here.


The combined use is not free from the zoning


requirements of the City of Los Angeles.  This combined


use is 1,000 feet away from any other adult use.  It's 500


feet from any of the protected sensitive areas, and it is


within the limited commercial zones which the city says it


has to be.


QUESTION:  Mr. Weston, incidentally on the other


point, I reviewed your footnote.  I tend to read footnotes


quickly.  You were right on our other point.


MR. WESTON:  Thank you, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  On --


MR. WESTON:  I'm going to go home now.


(Laughter.)


MR. WESTON:  I thank the Court for its courtesy.


(Laughter.)


MR. WESTON:  This is a memorable day for me.


QUESTION:  It seems to me that if you're


objecting to the municipality's use of this other study,


which didn't treat combined stores, you -- it seems to me


you have to tell us why it would be likely that combining


the diverse businesses under one roof could make any


difference.  I mean, you have situation 1.  You have a


whole block full of adult businesses, a video store, a

movie house, a bookstore, blah, blah, blah, okay, the


whole block full.


Situation 2, you have the same block.  They're


just not different stores.  It's just one big -- you know,


it's just Adult, Inc., and on one side there's the, you


know, the arcade, and then the next part of the store


there's the movie house, and so forth.  Why in the world


would there be any difference in the two situations as far


as its impact upon the community is concerned?


MR. WESTON:  There are a number of responses to


that, and they require a bit of articulation.  They're a


little bit different, and as I was starting to say before


in terms of Young v. American Mini Theatres, the sole


evidence, essentially, in Young v. American Mini Theatres


was an affidavit submitted by a man by the name of Mel


Ravitz.


In that case, one of the things that Ravitz


stressed -- and this was, of course, the first


concentration zoning, the first case that upheld


discriminatory zoning in a sense of motion picture


theaters according to the nature of the content of the


materials exhibited there, and the basis was, of course,


that the reason for the legislation was not because of the


materials but, rather, because of some unique secondary


effects associated with them, and this was a very unusual

ordinance.  It was an anti-Skid Row ordinance originally


to which Detroit, long after the original ordinance had


been adopted, added adult businesses, and Ravitz' point


was this, that there's a self-fulfilling prophecy that


develops in a neighborhood when residents or prospective


new residents or business people or whatever come into a


neighborhood and they see lots and lots and lots of


different storefronts, let's say soup kitchen, a rescue


mission, pawn shops, adult bookstore, Sam's Adult Arcade,


or even your excellent idea, the adult emporium --


(Laughter.)


MR. WESTON:  -- and as a result, this then


becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of the imminent decline


of a neighborhood.


So from the Young perspective, from the sense of


declining property values, it becomes very different from


having the eight or nine adult businesses to which Your


Honor referred to close proximity in one block, or two


blocks, which all of a sudden says tenderloin, or red


light district, or whatever, as opposed to one single


storefront that says, Highland Books, and which does not


cause the visual --


QUESTION:  But it doesn't have to say that.  I


mean, they're entitled to, you know, to divide the


storefront into each of its components and have a sign on

one that says, you know, adult videos, and then in the

MR. WESTON:  But that's no different --


QUESTION:  I don't see any difference between --


MR. WESTON:  But that's no different, Justice


Scalia, from a single 7-11 store that says, bananas for


sale, 99 cents today, rutabagas a dollar and a half, and


Coca-Colas on sale here.  It's --


QUESTION:  Mr. Weston, in that respect, would


you be making the same argument that you are now making


for tapes plus arcade, sales of tapes plus arcade, if the


combined uses were a massage parlor and an adult hotel?


MR. WESTON:  That's a very fair and good


question, and I've been thinking about that one for a


long, long time, and I think the easy answer to it is


simply that with respect to the massage parlor there would


be no First Amendment interest to protect, and therefore


it wouldn't raise the question.  Now, that's a cute


lawyer's answer.  It doesn't really help, I know, what


you're, obviously what, Justice Ginsburg --


QUESTION:  Well, I guess you'd say the same


thing about the adult motel.


MR. WESTON:  Absolutely, and --

that expression.


MR. WESTON:  Absolutely, and in fact I did say


that in FW/PBS v. City of Dallas, when one of the three


components was an adult motel, but interestingly -- and


I'll try to address the combination question, but


interestingly, and this is one of the things that makes


the L.A. study suspect to begin with, is that of the 88


adult uses that were focused on by the police department


and the planning department in Hollywood, 41 of them -- I


beg your pardon.  Of the 9 -- of the 88 uses, 41 of them


were either massage parlors or adult motels.


QUESTION:  Well, I don't think that question is


fairly subsumed in the question presented.  I mean, I


don't think there was any challenge below to the validity


of the '77 study so far as it went.


MR. WESTON:  No, you're exactly right, Mr. Chief


Justice, there wasn't a challenge specifically to it, but


as we --


QUESTION:  There wasn't a challenge specifically


to it.  Are you suggesting there was some unspecific


challenge to it?


MR. WESTON:  The specific challenge that was


made was whether the study supported the city's stated


purpose that combining a bookstore and an arcade in one


establishment, in one physical structure, caused the kinds

of problems, the only problems which the study evaluated


and found and, in fact, in the city's own papers it makes


clear, and we set this forth in page 2 of the respondent's


appendix, we note to it, rather, in joint appendix 109,


that on the contrary, the --


QUESTION:  Respondent's --


MR. WESTON:  I beg your pardon.  I've been


confusing.


QUESTION:  The red brief, in page 2?


MR. WESTON:  Forgive me, Mr. Chief Justice. 


I've misspoken.  At joint appendix, the beige document,


page 109, there is language from the study that points out


several respondents commented that the adverse effects,


secondary effects, are related to the degree of


concentration, and that one freestanding business may 


have no effect, and that's really what we're talking


about.


Justice Ginsburg, with respect to your question,


could there be some issues with respect to combined uses,


our great fear in terms of the parsing argument that we


have made is that if the city's novel and rather


adventurous piece of legislation is upheld, that the next


step, as inevitably as night follows the day, will be to


parse these business into smaller and smaller kinds of


subcomponents that --

tapes, those come under the First Amendment.


MR. WESTON:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Massages don't.


MR. WESTON:  Right, and I --


QUESTION:  Yes, but what about combining a


motion theater and a bookstore?


MR. WESTON:  I would -- one would think that the


same kind of analogy as we have offered here would be


present, that with a motion picture theater and a


bookstore there would appear to be no logical suggestion


that the two of them would generate any greater secondary


effects than the motion picture theater alone.  When we


got into area --


QUESTION:  Well, look at it a little


differently.  I understand your argument about arcades and


bookstores being functionally connected, but with


bookstores and motion pictures, I think the outburst


argument has quite a lot of appeal.  If you had them


separately owned and it would violate the ordinance, why


should it not violate the ordinance if you combine them?


MR. WESTON:  Well, I'm not sure that the


separate ownership is what constitutes the vice aimed at


at the ordinance.  It's rather that by the city's unusual

definitional situation of calling different media


presentations or different uses different businesses, in


the same sense like at a 7-11 the dairy section is a


business and the --


QUESTION:  It seems to me if you have a 7-11 and


an A&P next door, it's the same problem as if they're


owned by the same owner.  I don't follow the argument when


you get to motion pictures and bookstores.


It seems to me that those two businesses


operated by separate owners would have precisely the same


secondary effect as a single business operating both a


motion picture and a bookstore.  Why am I wrong on that?


MR. WESTON:  I'm not aware of any data that


would suggest that the combination would -- the


combination in, Justice Stevens, in your hypothetical that


a theater and a bookstore together, I'm not aware of any


data that would lead one to reasonably conclude that the


combination of a retail use in a motion picture theater


would generate more secondary effects than what I assume


would be the more intense use, the motion picture theater


operating alone.


QUESTION:  Well, you conceded a moment ago --


QUESTION:  That may be true -- go ahead.

secondary effects as just this look that the neighborhood 


has by having the businesses strung along the block, but


secondary effects is also the number of people come who


loiter, who drive around, who concentrate outside.  Then


that is a secondary effect that it seems to me would be


increased by the two uses.


MR. WESTON:  I think that's fair, Justice


Kennedy.  Certainly, if secondary effects is nothing more


than patronage, then I'm not sure that I could argue, but


that's not what the identified and hypothesized secondary


effect is on the part -- from the city, and in analyzing


these ordinances, as I understand the Court's doctrine,


one looks at the specific legislation and the asserted


stated purpose, asserted statement of purpose, which in


this case is whether the concentration of -- I should say,


the combination of adult businesses within a single


unitary establishment causes the same kinds of secondary


effects found by a clustering of 12 or 15 or 20 unrelated


adult businesses in a very small area in terms of the


neighborhood.  That was the city's hypothesized,


hypothesis.


QUESTION:  Yes, but isn't one way to pose that


question to pose it the way Justice Kennedy did?  The


question is, does the particular combination increase the


degree of clientele, because we know that the greater the

clientele, the greater the crime rate is going to be, so


there seems to me to be a factual basis for saying that


the clientele is a kind of a surrogate measure for those


very effects that the city can legitimately try to


counteract.


MR. WESTON:  With all respect, Justice Souter, I


must question the hypothesis that it is the clientele that


will cause the problems.  I would --


QUESTION:  The amount of clientele is associated


with the problems.  It may be that that clientele is


preyed upon by other people who come in, but the fact is,


I think, that the study shows an association between the


number of people concentration to come to these businesses


and the secondary effects of crime, et cetera, that the


city can do something to prevent.


MR. WESTON:  I --


QUESTION:  That's the hypothesis that I'm --


MR. WESTON:  I really don't think so in this


instance, because if that were, in fact, the hypothesis of


the city, surely, with all of the thought that they have


given to this, there would have been an absolute size


limitation or a square footage limitation that was part of


the legislation to deal just with that problem, but they


haven't.  As one of the questions before inquired, suppose


it was a 50,000 square adult bookstore or an arcade or a

cabaret.


QUESTION:  Maybe they could do that.  You know,


we have a one-step-at-a-time principle, that the State


doesn't have to do everything it possibly could in order


to validate what it has done.  Maybe it should prohibit


any more than 250 arcades showing sex videos at one place. 


It just hasn't done that yet.  It will get there when that


becomes a problem, I assume.


MR. WESTON:  And I suppose we'll be back here


then having to address that.


QUESTION:  You seem to be arguing that we should


decide this case on the assumption that the city's


evidence, as it now exists, would not be a sustainable


basis for an ordinance saying, you can't have two -- you


can't have 25 different adult uses in one arcade.  Do you


want us to decide -- are you saying that you're going to


go for broke, that we've either got to sustain that


proposition, or you lose?  Because I'm suggesting -- I


mean, my question was mean to suggest that there's a


factual difference in degree.  It may be very intuitively


obvious that if you put 20 of these uses in one business,


you're going to bring in a lot of people, going to have a


lot of problems.


It may not be intuitively obvious, and you may


need some specific evidence simply by combining videos and

books, it may not be intuitively obvious that that is


going to create the problem, so I'm suggesting a


difference of degree.  Do you reject that?


MR. WESTON:  Not at all, Justice Souter.  Of

Mr. Klekner, you have 2 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. KLEKNER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KLEKNER:  Thank you.


In our reply brief we cite heavily -- in our


reply brief we cite from the appellee's brief in Young v.


American Mini Theatres.  Footnote 7 to our brief quotes


the purpose for clustering, which is to attract people.


Basically, you're attracting unattended males on a frolic


on their own.


Mr. Wiener, in his, one of his declarations at


joint appendix 230, why does he combine businesses?  To


attract patrons.  Typically, unattended males on a frolic


on their own.  There is no qualitative or quantitative


difference in the effect.


QUESTION:  Well, if you combine buying, they get


out of the store.  If you have only the arcade, they'll


linger longer.


MR. KLEKNER:  Well, that's -- they're -- you

cannot expect an ordinance to solve everything in --


QUESTION:  I'm just questioning whether there's


going to be more of a problem if you have the stand-alone


arcade, where to see the film to the bitter end you have


to stay there, but you really like it, so you buy it, and


you get out quicker.


MR. KLEKNER:  Well, but that's an argument to


getting rid of the arcades.  The purpose of these


ordinances is to spread out --


QUESTION:  But you can't --


MR. KLEKNER:  -- spread out the patronage, to


make sure that you don't have this clustering, this magnet


effect.  You know, if you want your sex toys and your


videos and your books you go to Third and Alameda because


that's where everybody goes.


You want to avoid that. 

That's the whole


purpose of this, so it makes no difference, inferentially,


one way or the other if they're side by side or in the


same building, and inferences in this Court's precedent


doesn't require that we have conclusive evidence,


empirical evidence.  Paris Adult Theaters, Nixon v.


Shrink, case after case says you can rely on inferences,


and if the issue is fairly debatable -- this is a


debatable issue, you draw -- you give deference to the


legislative judgment because you can draw different

inferences from the same evidence.


That is what's been done here.  We are -- thank


you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Klekner.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
