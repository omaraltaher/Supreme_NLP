ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY B. EISENHAMMER 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, 

 

 

 

 

8 

               

AS APPOINTED BY THIS COURT 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

              

I would like to make three initial points. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

First, what this case is about is whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

the Petitioner may bring a Fourth Amendment claim for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful detention pursuant to legal process. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

Second, this case is not about whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

decision to prosecute is governed by due process, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment, or any other amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

And third, this case is not about whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

there's some constitutional tort named malicious 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution.  All we ask the Court to do is to affirm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your numerous -- numerous suggestions made in Albright 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Fourth Amendment supports this cause of action, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and bring the Seventh Circuit in line with all other --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the Tenth Circuit ruling on this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you need 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

1 

2 

3 

to get past the statute of limitations problem and to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, you need to characterize it, as I understand it, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a malicious prosecution claim.  Otherwise, it's 

   

  

 

 

 

4 

time-barred.

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  What -- what I need --

   

  

 

 

 

 

what we need to do is determine the -- not the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of limitations, which is two years, set by State --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State -- by the State, but the accrual period.  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wallace, the Court has said that we -- you normally look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, not the State law, but it's a Federal question, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you normally look in reference to the common law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in Wallace, they did say that that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be malicious prosecution that does have as an accrual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period favorable termination. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But favorable 

  

 

 

 

termination has nothing to do with the Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim, right?  And whether your prosecution is just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorably terminated or not, the Fourth Amendment claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, it seems to me, the accrual begins when your Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment rights are violated with, say, an illegal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

search. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Whether you eventually are convicted or 

 

 

 

 

 

acquitted, really, you have a claim for an illegal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

search if there's been an illegal search without regard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to favorable termination. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  But our claim, 

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

technically, here is it is detention without probable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause, not the search that occurred when he's -- when he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

was arrested. 

 

5 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But I mean, 

   

  

  

 

 

6 

regardless, whatever the Fourth Amendment claim is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Right.  And that detention 

  

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

went through for 48 days after he -- after he became 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to legal process.  I guess --

    

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was he subject to proper 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

legal process?  If legal process is corrupted because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there isn't -- I always understood legal process as used 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Wallace and earlier of our cases as an independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intermediary, generally a judge or a grand jury or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

someone who looks at the facts as they exist and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independently makes a determination whether probable 

   

 

 

 

cause has happened. 

 

 

18 

            

If you have a corrupted legal process where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

what the independent adjudicator is looking at is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true because it's based on false information, have you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received legal process -- proper legal process? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  You haven't received 

  

 

 

 

23 

24 

proper legal process.  You're -- you're correct.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

been corrupted because --

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so I thought if 

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

you've never received it, then doesn't your time to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accrue for the improper detention occur when you're no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer detained?  Here, it was the not guilty; correct? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

5 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's not a question 

   

  

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

of whether -- when it starts.  The question is:  When 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does the illegal detention finish? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Correct.  Correct. 

  

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And because you have --

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's been no intermediate force, no intermediary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stepping in and breaking the chain of causation; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

correct? 

13 

14 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Correct.  That's correct. 

  

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Am I understanding your 

   

  

 

 

15 

argument correctly? 

 

16 

17 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Yes.  You are, perfectly. 

  

  

 

 

 

I wish I could take credit for that, but --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

(Laughter.) 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but I'm -- I -- I --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

the only way I could think of it was thinking of it in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this way, because you're not claiming malicious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution or not. 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Right.  Right.  You know, 

  

  

  

 

 

Wallace talked about malicious prosecution.  And this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a larger issue of 1983 jurisdiction, which is, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

2 

what is a proper accrual period for a constitutional --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

a constitutional violation.  We don't -- we're not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

4 

probable --

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So detention without

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  -- cause.  Right.  And you 

  

  

  

 

 

 

don't -- you're not -- you're not straightjacketed into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a particular common-law provision.  You're -- you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the right to fashion one that does justice, and this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the one that does -- does justice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was confused.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

thought there was a malicious prosecution claim here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

mostly because the question presented says, "Whether an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

Fourth Amendment." 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Yes.  But that's -- that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

just a label, and that's what -- what the court, at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least in Wallace, has used as a label for talking about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these type of claims, and in other -- in Gerstein, too. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's just -- it's just a label to, in a sense, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish this case from detention without legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

process. 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me give you a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical.  This is actually close to this case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

Officer fabricates evidence in order to arrest and book 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant.  Then there's a Gerstein hearing within 

   

  

 

 

 

 

48 hours.  Evidence is still fabricated; same fabricated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence is introduced.  He's held for three months. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then there's a pretrial suppression hearing.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

evidence is still fabricated, and he's still held for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two more months.  Then there's a trial.  Evidence is 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

still fabricated and he's convicted and he's held for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

six more months.  Then there's an appeal filed, and then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suddenly they find out the evidence was fabricated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and the charges are dismissed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Fourth Amendment violation for the entire

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  No.  We would say the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment -- at least based on your cases -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth -- the Fourth Amendment claim ends at conviction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay. 

  

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  And then the due process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

claim or whatever. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why is the trial on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conviction any different than the Gerstein hearing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're -- they're both a legal process.  There's an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry.  Why is it that the Fourth Amendment applies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after the Gerstein hearing but not after the conviction? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  One reason is that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

Gerstein -- the Gerstein hearing is a non-adversarial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

hearing, so it would be a -- a grand jury proceeding. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

While a -- a conviction, in a sense, presumes that 

   

   

   

 

 

 

you're -- you're -- you -- you are -- you are held with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable cause, and then you really have a due process 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim after that.

7 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under malicious 

  

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

prosecution law in the States generally, just as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general principle, would there be a malicious 

   

 

 

 

 

prosecution claim for the fabricated evidence in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gerstein case or in the pretrial suppression? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  I believe -- I believe so. 

    

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So then they would be over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with, so at least there's a legal recognition that there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be a malicious prosecution claim in the Gerstein 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

hearing. 

17 

18 

19 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  No.  It's really a 

  

  

 

 

 

Fourth -- well, here, it's a Fourth Amendment claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're not -- we're not raising --

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm asking if, under State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

laws, the tort law generally, you can bring a malicious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution claim if there's fabricated evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

produced at the Gerstein hearing that results in --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  In your release?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's why there's damage 

  

 

 

 

 

and they're suing. 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Right.  But you have to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

be -- there has to be a favorable termination in order 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for you -- it's an element of -- of State court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malicious prosecution, so you need to be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay.  It's terminated six 

  

  

 

 

 

months -- or six weeks later. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  It would be a malicious --

   

  

 

 

 

 

that would be a malicious prosecution claim under State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

law.

24 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why do you make the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cutoff conviction?  If it turns out, even on habeas, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the police have lied all along and there was never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any basis for holding this person, why doesn't -- why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't you have your Fourth Amendment claim until the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point where you're released from this unlawful custody? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  You -- you could if you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you ruled that way.  Generally, this Court has ruled 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that after conviction, there is -- there is due process, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your trial rights have been violated, so that has been a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different amendment that you've gone under.  In this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

case --

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's the same right. 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

It's the right you had from the very beginning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  It could be a -- it could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

be a Fourth Amendment right.  You could have more than 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one amendment cover more than one -- the same set of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

facts. 

7 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but there's 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

just a different consequence to whether you terminate a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment right or a due process right under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Parratt v. Taylor. 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Well, we're claiming it's 

  

 

 

 

 

a Fourth Amendment right. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know.  But 

   

  

  

 

 

you just answered in response to the question that one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be both.  But if it's both --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Yes, it could be both. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

Usually -- or at least reading Justice Kennedy's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrence, it appeared that the due process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision -- the due process claim dealt with the issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of whether to prosecute, as opposed to this issue, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the decision to hold somebody, detain somebody, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pending a decision to prosecute or a trial.  So it's the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment that really covers this rather than due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

process. 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens to the 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

12 

1 

2 

person who's let out on bail?  Are they out of luck 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under your theory? 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  No.  No. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you defining 

  

 

 

 

5 

"detention" as broadly as Justice Ginsburg was? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Yes.  And in Gerstein --

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

and in Gerstein, the Court did make recognition that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that detention could go beyond being released, depending 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the conditions of the release.  So it's not just -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would say it's not just Justice Ginsburg's concurrence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was this Court's opinion in Gerstein that that was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

possibility.

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain why, even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if we accept your theory that -- that the unlawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention continues until he's released, why shouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute of limitations trigger the -- when he is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initially arrested?  Why -- why should the trigger for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute of limitations be different just because we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

label this Fourth Amendment --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  I think there's -- there's 

    

 

 

 

 

some good reasons for that.  They were expressed in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Heck, which applies in this particular case, too.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want to have parallel -- parallel litigation.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want to have conflicting decisions between the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State and the criminal court, and you don't want to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

you don't want to have a collateral attack.  That 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

collateral attack works to the detriment of -- of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution and to the defense in the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think Justice Kagan's opinion in Kaley 

 

 

 

 

 

illustrates the harm that could happen to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution if you allow someone to collaterally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attack -- use a sophisticated attorney to collaterally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

attack the decision on probable cause while the case --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while the criminal case is pending.  If it works to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detriment of the prosecution --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Eisenhammer, why should 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

we even get to these questions?  As I understand this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, the Seventh Circuit does something, says something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that no other circuit does, which is to say that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that there's no Fourth Amendment claim under Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1983 at all, full stop. 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

If we think that that's wrong, oughtn't we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

to just send everything else back to the Seventh Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide what they think the Fourth Amendment claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks like?  In other words, what elements it has, what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accrual date it has, anything that they think about this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment claim, send it back to them, having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told them that they're wrong about whether this Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment claim exists.  Why isn't that -- I mean, all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this other stuff, the Seventh Circuit hasn't told us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

1 

2 

3 

4 

what they think about it.  Circuits are split on it.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't really been briefed because the principal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question has been whether there is a Fourth Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  Why shouldn't we just send it back to them to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

decide? 

6 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  I would be in agreement 

    

 

 

 

 

7 

with that, because --

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

10 

with that. 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You would be in agreement? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. EISENHAMMER:  I would be in agreement 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I wasn't sure.  I thought 

    

    

 

 

12 

that you were arguing. 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  I only -- only -- only in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

response to the question.  So I think the question we've 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised is solely the issue of does the Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cover detentions pursuant to legal process? 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

18 

I'm sorry. 

 

19 

            

20 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But don't we have to know --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Without legal process. 

  

 

 

 

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Without -- I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

With -- no, with.  With legal --

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're saying it's 

  

 

 

 

23 

improper legal process. 

 

 

24 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Yes.  But it's still a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

25 

legal -- it's still a legal process.  It was corrupted, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

but it was still started with that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Don't we have to know what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

kind of a claim it is to -- before we can say whether it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

exists? 

5 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Yes.  And the starting 

  

  

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

point is the Fourth Amendment.  If you answer the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question on the Fourth Amendment, because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initial question --

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  You want us to say there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

some kind of a Fourth Amendment claim, but we -- we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- we don't know what it is, but there's some kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a claim.  Now, you go back and tell us what kind of a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim it is? 

 

 

14 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  No.  I'm saying the Court 

  

  

 

 

 

 

15 

can say that this is a Fourth Amendment claim.  It's --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

detention. 

18 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  A claim for unconstitutional 

    

 

 

 

MR. EISENHAMMER:  There's no -- yeah.  Just 

  

  

 

 

 

 

19 

as if -- if they had brought it up in Albright. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, what the statute of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

limitations is on that claim or what the accrual period 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is on that claim is something that we don't have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide in order to say, yes, you have a claim under the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution for improper detention. 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Correct.

10

the alternative that is argued is that it's a due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process claim.  And whether or not they coexist or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the particular period that you're complaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about is properly characterized as detention without due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process as opposed to a claim under the Fourth Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would certainly be pertinent in deciding whether or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say there is a Fourth Amendment claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  No.  I -- I think you can 

    

   

  

 

 

 

decide whether there's a Fourth Amendment claim or a due 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

process without referencing the statute of limitations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That issue is, in a sense, before you.  You can answer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

it. 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

            

We're not talking about -- as I said before, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not claiming that the decision to prosecute, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be a due process claim, has been violated.  All 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about is the detention -- the detention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to legal or corrupt legal process.  That's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only claim that we're asking for.  The Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

indicated --

 

21 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is it a detention --

   

  

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

you've described this in various ways.  Is it a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention without constitutional probable cause?  Is it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a detention with -- with no proper legal process?  Where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly is the Fourth Amendment violation?  Because in

false arrest and false imprisonment claims, according to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wallace, as soon as you get legal process, there's been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an intervening end to the false imprisonment because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone else has imprisoned you. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

So what remains in this case?  How do we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

define the constitutional violation so --

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  All right.  May I reserve 

   

  

  

 

 

time after just some more questions? 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think this is a Fourth Amendment claim 

   

 

 

 

 

that you can -- you can describe as being corrupted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by -- you know, a corrupt Gerstein hearing.  You would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim that it prolonged a detention beginning at -- at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal process the way County of Riverside -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rodriguez, where it was extended just for -- the traffic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stop was extended just for seven minutes to do a dog 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search, and this Court found that there was -- it was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seizure, an improper -- improper seizure. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This is exactly what happened here.  The --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the seizure was extended improperly because of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fabrication by the police.

it please the Court:

We think that this Court should locate the

6

10 

constitutional right at issue in the Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the reason that the Fourth Amendment does apply to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretrial detentions as this Court has long held.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment requires any prolonged period of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention to be supported by, one, valid determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of probable cause at the outset of that -- at that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period of detention. 

 

 

11 

            

The Seventh Circuit error here was to find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

that the Fourth Amendment stops operation once criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charges are filed.  And this Court has long recognized 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well that there's a variety of ways to make that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable cause determination, including by the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure used to bring the criminal charge itself.

evidence, just was the information available to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police sufficient to -- to make the arrest, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court wrongly determines that there was probable cause

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, there may be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

Fourth Amendment violation, but there may be no one to

sue under those circumstances under Section 1983. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why is it a Fourth 

   

  

 

 

 

3 

Amendment violation?  If it was close, then the decision 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

was reasonable. 

 

5 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, of course, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

Honor.  I think I took Justice Kennedy's hypothetical to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

pursue it was wrong in the sense of wrong and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable.  I think a wrong --

    

   

 

9 

            

10 

reasonable. 

11 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, it's wrong but 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, then, Your Honor, no, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

I don't think it would be a Fourth Amendment violation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

at all. 

 

14 

            

(Laughter.) 

15 

            

16 

detained. 

17 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why?  He's -- he's being 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, because, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

I think that --

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

Amendment. 

21 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Violation of the Fourth 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, because I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

think that --

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's why it seems to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

me that there's a good argument that we should be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about malicious prosecution, not the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

Amendment. 

2 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

that the Fourth Amendment does afford reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistakes of fact and law, for that matter, in -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowing someone to be detained.  So it's not that.  In 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, the probable cause standard itself allows for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual errors in the determination. 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

But here, the allegation that Mr. Manuel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16

20

22 

23 

24 

25 

claims is that he's detained on drug charges that relied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely on fabricated evidence.  And we think that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim is a claim of detention without probable cause 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Fourth Amendment. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's unreasonable.  And 

  

  

 

 

the -- the defendant wouldn't have qualified immunity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it's not corrupt.  There's nothing malicious about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  Would there be a claim? 

   

  

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, I think it 

   

  

 

 

 

depends on what the causation would be in terms of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer's role in bringing the charge. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So if the officer puts forth and has -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the one pressing to bring a charge that is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable, objectively unreasonable under the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment, subject to qualified immunity and other bars 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to suit, he may be liable.  But to the extent to which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the error falls with the magistrate or the prosecutor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

1 

2 

those kinds of claims would be foreclosed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolute immunity that those individuals --

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

4 

agent? 

5 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it's an F.B.I. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

6 

7 

that the measure of liability for a Federal officer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

follows the same sort of immunities and rules. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I thought you said in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

your brief that the standard for State and local law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement officers might be different from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard for Federal law enforcement officers. 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  If I did, Your Honor, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

don't -- I don't believe we were referring to -- if you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could clarify which standard you mean, the standard for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualified immunity or -- or --

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  On page 30 of your brief. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

30 to 31 of your brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

that in those particular instances, that relates to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that piece of our brief relates to special factors that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could potentially account for hesitation on a Bivens 

   

 

 

 

 

 

claim that don't necessarily apply to Section 1983. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, and that's what I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

saying.  So you think that there should be a remedy for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations by State and local police officers, but not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

1 

under identical circumstances, possibly, if it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

Federal officer. 

 

3 

4 

5 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Not in this instance, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  We wouldn't draw that distinction.  And -- and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd also --

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, then what were you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

saying in your brief?  I don't understand it. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  I think that there may be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

other circumstances not presented by this case, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented by a -- a case of fabricated evidence or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable pursuit of a wrongful criminal charge that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

may lead to a different result under 1983 under Bivens. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I don't think we have to -- we just wanted to make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure that the Court understood that the Bivens claim may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have different ramifications. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's right.  I mean, I 

    

  

 

 

 

may be missing something, although this is quite a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simple case.  A policeman makes an unreasonable stop and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

an unreasonable search, thereby violating the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.  Now, you can sue him, assuming you overcome 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

other hurdles. 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Now he takes you off and puts you in prison, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either with a magistrate or without a magistrate, and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

you are therefore being unreasonably detained.  It's an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable search/seizure pursuant to the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

1 

Amendment; therefore, it's a violation. 

   

 

 

2 

            

Then you have a trial, and using the same

20

22 

23 

24 

25 

rotten evidence, you are convicted.  There you don't, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

though you could.  But the reason that you don't is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because you are viewed as, by the law so far, being in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jail now as a result of your conviction.  And the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason, I guess, is practical.  We don't want to look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into all those convictions and their different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards.  Now, that's the -- the framework in my mind. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is it right? 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

That is exactly the framework that the government puts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward, that it's not just the mere fact of being held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in jail, but that the constitutional right depends on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what process was infringed. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So let's 

  

  

 

 

 

stop.  I understand you so far. 

    

 

 

 

            

The question presented was, I think -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

don't have it -- I do have it here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

"So whether an individual's Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond legal process so as to allow a malicious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution claim based upon the Fourth Amendment." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Chief Justice was right.  The question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

presented is, does the Fourth Amendment consonance house 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

a malicious prosecution claim, which is something very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different than what you're describing as a Fourth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment seizure and detention without legal process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

Because in our view, the constitutional inquiry is step 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one, but step two is to determine the elements and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accrual date and other prerequisites to suit under our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1983 tort.  And in that instance, the accrual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may be governed by the closest common law analogy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

When the challenge at its core is arguing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

that the wrongful prosecution and the wrongful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institutional process led to the detention without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable cause, in our view, the closest analogy is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malicious prosecution suit, and that that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But are you suggesting 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

we have to take every element of the -- whatever the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements are?  Because from what I understand from the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

briefing, malicious prosecution is defined differently 

 

 

 

 

 

from State to State. 

 

 

 

            

So if that's the case, what are the elements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you see for a 1983 claim?  Does it include malice? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Your Honor, we do not think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a constitutional tort under 1983 simply adopts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

common law or State tort elements of malicious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution.  Only the accrual rule is -- as based on

2 

this Court's decision in Heck and Wallace are taken up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the common law analogy. 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

In terms of malice, no, Your Honor, we don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

think malice, as it's known in common law or most State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts, is an element of this kind of claim.  We do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocate that this Court treat a probable cause 

   

 

 

 

 

 

determination underlying a criminal charge the same way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it treats a probable cause determination underlying a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

search warrant, which includes the Franks standard.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think of that as a malice standard of common law, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but rather, an extension of the Franks doctrine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I nearly said 

   

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

that it inspired examples we take to flesh this out, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it does seem to me to be just pretty result-oriented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cherry picking.  If once you say, well, here's a claim, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

now we'd like the statue of limitations part, so we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't take that in.  We -- we don't want to have to show 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malice, so we take that.  I mean, I don't know if we're 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still holding true to the approach in Wallace, if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just start picking things in and out depending upon the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demands of the particular case. 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

that Wallace did say that Federal accrual rules in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular were governed by the common law analogy.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that that's as far as it goes in terms of choosing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

2 

from the common law.  The statue of limitations, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, is barred from State law. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

But here, the Seventh Circuit's view of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

accrual flowed from its error as to the scope of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment.  So to Justice Kagan's proposal that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this go back, in many ways we think that's absolutely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate, because the Seventh Circuit erred by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding that since the Fourth Amendment stops at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time criminal process begins, it thought you can't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a malicious prosecution analogous claim, because there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is no such Fourth Amendment claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you peel that error away, we think that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even under Seventh Circuit jurisprudence, they would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree that a favorable termination requirement would 

   

 

 

 

 

apply in such circumstances. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When does the Fourth 

  

 

 

 

 

Amendment claim stop?  I -- I think co-counsel said if 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

you're convicted, it stops.  In -- in response to my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, suppose none of this comes out until habeas, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then we find out the police have lied from day one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  So, Your Honor, we do see 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those as distinct phases, and that when you're held --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an individual is held pursuant -- before trial, pursuant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a finding of probable cause by a magistrate or a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

grand jury, that that is a Fourth Amendment claim.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27

2 

3 

once the person is held pursuant to a finding beyond a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable doubt at trial, that due process and other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional protections take over.

pretrial suppression hearing in which both parties are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represented, and the court reaches a wrong result with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference to the admission of the evidence.  Does a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment violation still continue? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. EISENSTEIN:  May I answer, Your Honor? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

Your Honor, I think that it -- it may be a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment violation, but whether a plaintiff 

   

 

 

 

 

could bring those kinds of claims would be governed by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclusion principles and other similar bars, once that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue had been actually litigated in a State court. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In a State court 

   

  

 

 

proceeding, the State analogue, what would be the rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of accrual ending?  You get convicted; you don't find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out about the false testimony until habeas, State or

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. SCODRO 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court: 

 

 

              

I think it's very important to frame what is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the Court this afternoon.  And to begin, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's essential to note we are not disputing at any point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this litigation that misstatements made that result 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a finding of probable cause at a Gerstein hearing is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Fourth Amendment violation, nor does the Seventh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

Circuit disagree. 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

            

The reason this came up to the Seventh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit as it did -- and this may be important in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding the context -- this is on a motion to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismiss for statute -- for violation of the statue of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations.  All of the claims were dismissed but one, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the one that was appealed, and that one survived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

momentarily in the district court because Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claimed that that one claim has a favorable termination 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

element because it is malicious prosecution. 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

He reiterated that claim before the Seventh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit reached two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

conclusions. 

24 

            

One, you have a Fourth Amendment claim which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

25 

they discuss, and that the only claim before them was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

based on the lie at the Gerstein hearing.  You have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment claim, but it is already accrued; it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accrued too early; it is untimely. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now you're asking us to recognize a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different breed of Fourth Amendment claim, namely, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malicious prosecution Fourth Amendment claim, because 

 

 

 

 

 

you'd like to overcome the time bar.  We do not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize that Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4

9 

claim. 

10 

11 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Scodro, I -- I just have 

   

   

  

 

 

 

to say I read this differently, so you can tell me why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

I'm wrong. 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

            

But I'm -- in the last column of the Seventh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's opinion, so there are twice where the Seventh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit says what it thinks.  The first time it says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when after the arrest a particular person is not let go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when he should be -- so it's after the initial seizure, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then the person is not let go, the Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives way to the due process clause as a basis for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenging his detention. 

 

 

21 

            

And then in the last paragraph it says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

"Once detention by reason of arrest turns into detention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by reason of arraignment, the Fourth Amendment falls out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the picture." 

 

 

25 

            

So it seems to me that twice, the Seventh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

Circuit says very clearly that you have this Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment claim until arraignment or legal process, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after that, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

picture. 

5 

            

And at the very basic level, before you get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

into these questions of what's the accrual date or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything else, it seems that that's the thing that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner is saying is wrong, that the Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim continues after arraignment or after legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process.  Now, when it accrues, when it doesn't accrue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a different question, but it's still a Fourth 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Amendment claim, and -- and -- and that's what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seventh Circuit rejected. 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Your Honor, I think I would 

   

   

  

 

 

direct the Court to the top of JA 103 as well, where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court also notice -- notes the fact that they have found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment claims, even in terms of false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information in an incident report, even at a preliminary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing, which comes long after the initiation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

process. 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

What the Court in context has read -- and by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way, this is consistent with past statements by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seventh Circuit, the -- the fundamental statement the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has made -- and this comes from Newsome, the 2001 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision from which this jurisprudence has blossomed in

the Seventh Circuit -- relabeling a Fourth Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

claim as malicious prosecution would not extend the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statue of limitations. 

 

 

            

This has been the nature of the battle.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on page 21 of the cert petition in this case, Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes clear why a question presented doesn't end halfway 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

through.  It doesn't ask merely whether there's a Fourth 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment right that survives the initiation of process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If, by "process" they mean Gerstein hearing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we agree.  And I think the Seventh Circuit would agree 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well.  But it goes on to say, "so as to allow for a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malicious prosecution claim."  And on page 21 of their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cert petition, they explain to the Court what they mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by that when they say that, "The fate of this appeal to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court turns on whether the Court does or does not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt a favorable termination element," and that that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

why this makes an ideal vehicle, to answer Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alito's earlier question, which is:  What are the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements of this claim? 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't think that was a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

difficult question.  I thought that everyone agrees that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

if a policeman wrongly arrests you -- you know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

maliciously arrests you, et cetera -- and there you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in his custody and he brings you over to the jail, puts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you in jail, up until the point you see the magistrate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

1 

you have a claim for false arrest. 

   

 

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And we said that that claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

for false arrest is a constitutional claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

5 

            

6 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It violates the Fourth 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13

15

Amendment.  What time limit applies?  The false arrest 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

time limit, because that's the most analogous. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Then we get into the next 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage.  Now you're in front of a magistrate, and the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

magistrate says, stay in jail for two more months.  Does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that violate the Fourth Amendment?  Not malicious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution.  Does it violate the Fourth Amendment? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

The reason that we tend to think it does is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because all the circuits have said it does; that is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge Higginbotham said that in the Fifth Circuit.  A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of the circuits picked that up.  I'm not saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every one.  But they said that, too, violates the Fourth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.  Now we have a problem. 

   

  

 

 

21 

            

What statute of limitations do we use for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

that one?  And there, the circuits seemed to have picked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malicious prosecution not because they're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow every element, but because it's the State law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that provides the closest analogy. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

1 

            

And that seems to me where we are in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

case.  You don't have to go much further than that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

Am I right so far? 

   

 

 

MR. SCODRO:  You are correct.  The issue 

  

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

before the Court is which accrual date for limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

periods should the courts be --

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So you will accept -- or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

will you accept for purposes of this argument that once 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this individual is brought by the policeman to jail and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they go before a magistrate, and the magistrate using 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same bad evidence says, stay here in jail for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several -- for a while -- for a week, anyway, until we 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get to trial, that that period is a violation of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment, assuming that they were all lying, et 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

cetera. 

16 

            

17 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Your Honor, yes. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Then the question is: 

  

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

Do we use the malicious prosecution as an analogy, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the elements?  And so now the question, great, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is fabulous, I get to the narrower question I have, why 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't it a good analogy? 

   

 

 

22 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Your Honor, let -- let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

answer it why it's not a good analogy, and I'll also 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer -- I think flesh out just slightly whether or not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this remains -- the moment in time when the police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

officers lie to -- to submit an affidavit with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

falsehoods to a magistrate at a Gerstein hearing, and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

the magistrate finds probable cause, what we do not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute, and what we do not think the Seventh Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would dispute, is that that is a violation of the Fourth

17 

18 

19 

            

Now, the question of whether or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malicious prosecution is the proper analogy, the answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is absolutely not, and Wallace tells us why not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wallace tells us -- now, the Petitioner has shifted just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

slightly from a reliance on common law favorable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

termination, which is what most of the circuits on their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side of the split have done.  This also goes, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Your Honor's question and to your point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Most of the circuits on the other side of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the split have used favorable termination, but they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done so by adopting it as part of the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four-element common law tort, and they think if that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we're calling it, then it's going to have favorable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

termination. 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

              

A smaller number have relied on an 

 

 

 

 

 

extension, a drastic extension, of this Court's decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in Heck.  And that's the request now made by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner in the reply brief, that Heck ought to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expanded to apply here. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

            

But Wallace was very clear.  Heck only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

applies -- the delayed accrual principle and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable termination element that comes with it apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only where you have an extant conviction.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't exist here. 

 

 

6 

            

The court went through a mental exercise. 

   

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

They said, look, if you can realize that you have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment claim before you're convicted, if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements can be in mind, you know you've been wronged in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Fourth Amendment way before you are convicted, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is not a claim that is entitled to the delayed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accrual principle of Heck. 

 

 

 

            

And the reason was very simple.  Because as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court said in Gerstein, Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplates that you can have bad arrests and good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions.  And nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

protects the innocent as well as the guilty.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expanding Heck to apply the circumstance where all you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have is an ex parte requirement, or finding rather, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable cause, requiring that civil plaintiff to then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove vindication at the end of the day would close the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

door on a potential universe of Fourth Amendment claims 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

and instances. 

 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think you can have 

    

 

 

 

 

discrete claims.  One wrong is you never should have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

36 

been arrested, so you have a Fourth Amendment claim for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  Another wrong is they kept you in detention. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They extended that arrest.  So I don't see why you have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one wrong which ends on arrest, but then if you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuing to be held based on trumped-up false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, why isn't that like a continuing tort?  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it continues until it ends. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Well, Your Honor, just to make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure that I've been clear, again, we do agree that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lie -- the second lie Your Honor has described, the lie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the magistrate, is actionable under the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.  If the question is why then doesn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accrual period run from when one is ultimately released, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I would make a couple of points in response to Your

Honor's question. 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

First, Petitioner has been very careful not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make that argument.  Indeed, the continuing seizure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea would be inconsistent facially with the cert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition, which claimed they need the benefit of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable termination to prevail.  They, of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't need it if they were instead arguing for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period of a continuing seizure. 

   

 

 

23 

            

Lower courts have rejected the notion of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

continuing seizure, and they're not raising it here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I think the reason may be twofold.

The first is that it runs into -- it runs in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

the face of traditional accrual principles that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has said, cases like Ricks and others, that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not the period of harm that matters for accrual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes.  It's when one first experiences the harm and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thereby has all the elements needed to proceed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

And a case like Morgan, which was a hostile 

   

   

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

work environment case, is really the exception that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proves the rule.  In many ways it tells us why or how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowly the Court has -- has construed the exceptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to this typical accrual principle.  Hostile work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

environment does require precisely what Your Honor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describes because it's impossible to know precisely when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a hostile work environment begins.  Is it the second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comment or the fifth or the tenth that someone has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

endure in the workplace, and therefore, the Court is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willing to consider it as a monolithic whole and treat 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it that way for accrual purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

But again, that's the exception that proves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

the rule.  As Wallace itself concluded, there can be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cutoff, which Wallace imposed between the initial arrest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the post-process arrest, and Wallace itself in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regard, I think, breaks through the notion of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

continuing seizure. 

 

25 

            

The final point I would make -- and I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

this comes out in one of their amicus briefs; namely, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the brief by Professor Alschuler -- taken to its logical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion, the logic of continuing seizure may lead one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to conclude that the seizure doesn't end until the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate period of incarceration concludes.  And what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that means is now you have potential civil plaintiffs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bringing claims 10, 15, 20 years down the road without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any prior notice to the would-be defendants, no ability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to maintain evidence and so forth. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why do you need to give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence to somebody who's fabricated the reasons why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're in jail?  And -- and I don't know why you would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that it's important to cut off recovery against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the police officer who bases an arrest solely on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fabrication.  It doesn't seem so horrible to me.  Years 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

later or immediately, if you've done something as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untoward as that, as unconstitutional as that, why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should it matter?

MR. SCODRO:  Your Honor, two points.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

first is, and this is a point of clarification, we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not suggesting that damages arising from lies at a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gerstein hearing, for lack of a better term for it, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not run subject to traditional common law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate causation principles through part or all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the pretrial period.  There may well be interrupting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

events, but that I just want to make clear.  We're not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting that those damages may not be available, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, had the claim been brought timely for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full 48 days, depending on how those common law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate cause principles would shake out. 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

The other point -- and this is one that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

States made in their amicus brief in Wallace.  They've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made it again as have the municipalities as amici. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They've made the point that early notice to the State as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer of agents who are engaged in bad acts is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinarily important.  Government is intent upon 

  

 

 

 

 

learning sooner rather than later that they have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals in their ranks that are violating the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

Constitution. 

15 

            

And this Court in Wallace, in turning aside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

basically the same extension of Heck that is recommended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the Court, or the Court's invited to take in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very case, when they turned it away, they said one of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reasons is we need notice to the would-be defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in those cases.  They can preserve evidence to ensure --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, counselor, 

  

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

it's not as if most States don't receive that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice in these situations.  The defendants are just not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believed in most, until some independent evidence is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovered long after the conviction.  In my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

experience -- and you can point to one that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different -- I've never come across any of these cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where any defendant falsely accused of a crime hasn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

vigorously announced his or her innocence and vigorously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tried to tell the authorities this police officer is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

corrupt. 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

            

So I'm not -- I don't know what extra notice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you need other than that.  The situation is unique. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're talking about total fabrication.  You have so many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other ways out of liability, qualified immunity, Franks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are so many other protections against the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and individual officers for -- for errors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But why should we worry about you not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

receiving notice? 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

MR. SCODRO:  The reason, Your Honor, is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case, when the later accrual principle that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner requests under Heck or as a matter of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common law element, is purchased not only at the price 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of delayed notice to the would-be defendant, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchased at the price of closing the courthouse door on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a number of potential Fourth Amendment claimants, those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who are subject to unlawful arrest, but are later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

validly convicted. 

 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Scodro, can I ask -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

might be misunderstanding this, so you'll tell me if I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

am.  But it seems as though the position that you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking now is diametrically opposed to the position that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you took in the Seventh Circuit.  So I'll just read you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something, and this is from oral argument, but my clerk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells me that this is what happened.  I think it is not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a transcript, but maybe there is.  But at least this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what my clerk tells me happened at oral argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Judge Rovner says there are ten other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits that have now recognized this kind of claim, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this kind of Fourth Amendment claim.  And she said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's just assume that we do what those ten other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits have done, which, of course, they didn't do, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but she says let's just assume it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

            

At what point would you think the statue of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

limitations would begin to run?  And then you -- or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe not you, but you --

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

(Laughter.) 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You say, well, if you were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to recognize such a claim --

   

 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- the accrual is the time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at which the proceedings are terminated in favor of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

individual. 

24 

25 

            

So in this case it would be -- I think the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

date would have been May 4, 2011. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

1 

            

And then Chief Judge Woods says, so you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

assuming that the constitutional tort would follow the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same pattern that State law does and require the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable termination, because if there's no favorable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination for all the policy reasons the States have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered, there's no injury. 

 

 

 

7 

            

And again, whoever the lawyer was said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

that's correct. 

 

9 

            

So am I misunderstanding this, or are you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

10 

saying that's not correct; that's wrong? 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. SCODRO:  I think that that is correct 

    

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

insofar as what the lawyer was being asked, as I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand it, having also listened to the argument, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor, is that --

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

this? 

17 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is there no transcript for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SCODRO:  I am not aware of a transcript. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

The Seventh Circuit may especially -- part of that quote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeared in the reply brief in support of the cert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition.  And what that quote makes clear, it seems to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me what the lawyer is being asked is, if we are to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow suit, what -- again, taking it back to what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- this was on a motion to dismiss on limitations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grounds.  The -- if -- if they're not able to establish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they have an accrued claim or a claim with a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

delayed accrual sufficient to satisfy the limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period or under a traditional Fourth Amendment theory, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

can we overcome this limitations period by virtue of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these common law elements.  What the attorney was being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked, as I -- as I heard that argument, what the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney was being asked is, isn't -- do you agree that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what they are trying to do here is join what every other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit has done.  And if we join what every other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit has done, they would have a favorable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

termination element.  Or --

8 

9 

10 

11 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Oh, I don't think that 

   

  

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

that's -- I mean, maybe, I guess.  I mean, it seems to 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

me that the much more natural way of understanding this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is to say, look, if we do what every other circuit has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done in the sense that we acknowledge that there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment claim here, post-legal process, 

 

 

 

 

 

something which you yourself have now acknowledged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today, that if we acknowledge that, what would the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accrual date be?  And then the lawyer says the accrual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

date would be the date of termination. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and now you're saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

it wouldn't be.  And I actually don't know whether it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be or it shouldn't be.  I don't think the Seventh 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit for a moment considered that question.  And I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

guess it's -- it's another reason why I think we should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just send the whole thing back.  The Seventh Circuit can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure out whether you forfeited this claim.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seventh Circuit can figure out, if you didn't forfeit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this claim, what the right answer is.  But to me, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language -- and I have not listened to the tape myself, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so I have to admit that -- but to me, this language 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests that you forfeited this.

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

again, in context, I think what the lawyer was being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked is, if they get the benefit -- and I believe the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote in the reply in support of the -- the part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote that appears in the reply in support of the cert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition includes a reference to, well, along with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

common law elements, the lawyer is saying, yes, if they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were to get the benefit -- this is what they're trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do.  I mean, no one denied it.  What they were saying 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the briefs was we want the benefit of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four-element tort recognized in other circuits, most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they're just adopting wholesale the tort; a few, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they seem -- they cite Heck in lieu of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common law element.  And the question was, if we give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them what they're asking for, that is, if this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follows those other courts, would they have a May 4th 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accrual date?  And the answer is yes.  Because that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

what they've been seeking all along.

magistrate listening to the policeman detained him, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the magistrate and everybody was very unreasonable, da, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

da, da.  Okay? 

  

 

            

Now he's there.  Day one.  Can you bring a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case?  Yes.  Why not? 

  

  

 

            

He's been under -- day two.  Yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And he's been held for 90 days.  And I can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say the same thing, but I won't, up to each of the 90 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

days.  90th day, he's released.  It's now the 91st day. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Can he bring it?  Yes.  But now we only have two years. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why only two years?  Because we're looking for an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogous statute of the State to give us a -- a limit, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the analogous one, though not perfectly fitting, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malicious prosecution, and that had two years, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's why.  Two years after the release date is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longest.  You had better bring it before then, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's two years since you were unlawfully held. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, what's wrong with what I just said? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Well, Your Honor, two points in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

response to that. 

 

 

            

The first would be Wallace says or holds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if you have the claim on day one, then that -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

is -- it's accruing on day one.  We're not going to give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- there's no extant conviction. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's a different 

   

  

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

claim.  One claim is for arrest, and the other is for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prolonged detention.  Two different claims.  That's why 

  

  

 

 

 

 

I took issue with you when you said if you hold for this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner, then people who are falsely arrested but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly convicted will have no claim.  I don't -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't see that.  They have a false arrest claim.  They 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't have a prolonged detention claim. 

   

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Well, Your Honor, I think what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

would happen, they wouldn't have a claim based on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

misstatements at the Gerstein hearing if, in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make out that claim as Petitioners contend, they would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to show that ultimately their criminal litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terminated in their favor.  That's the request.  If Heck 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is extended or the common law element is extended -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is why it's not the best analogue, Your Honor.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it -- if it would be helpful to have a common law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point of guidance on this, in Footnote 12 of our brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we provide a list of common law cases, an example of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common law cases in which the Court addressed a question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

like this. 

 

24 

            

We have an ex parte proceeding in which a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

magistrate has issued -- I'll take the Stewart case,

which is the third of the three cited.  The person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serves six months in jail on the warrant, but there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never a prosecution.  It never blossoms.  He's released, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

and he sues for malicious prosecution.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant in the malicious prosecution contends that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're not -- that they're unable to show successful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

outcome --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What's your -- what's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

best one?  What's the best analogy? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  That it's -- this form of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

malicious prosecution where you didn't have to prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable termination, because all that was against you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at that point was an ex parte determination with State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law like that.  This was --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is your opinion?  What 

  

  

 

 

 

 

is the State law that does apply the best analogy? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  I think the closest analogy 

    

 

 

 

 

is -- is false arrest. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  False arrest.  Okay. 

  

  

 

 

            

So now, what is this -- what is the -- what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the statue of limitations for false arrest? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  The State law, it's still the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal injury limitations period of two years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Fine.  So he was 

  

  

  

 

 

 

being detained for up to, let's say, the 90th -- 90th 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

1 

2 

3 

day.  He's still being detained.  So now we'll count the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

90th day as the beginning of the two-year running.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so now we run it for two years, and it's still May 12th 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

or whatever. 

 

5 

            

MR. SCODRO:  But, Your Honor, a false arrest 

   

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

claim under Wallace accrues once process begins.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not running for that 90 days.  It would include --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

10 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not? 

  

 

 

MR. SCODRO:  Well, as we --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Either he's being 

  

 

 

 

11 

held under -- isn't he being held unlawfully on the 41st 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

day? 

13 

            

And after all, we're not -- we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

copying the State law.  All we're doing is trying to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find an analogous period of time. 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. SCODRO:  But, Your Honor, by imposing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

the favorable termination element of the common law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim, it would run headlong into the Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aims; what the Fourth Amendment is geared to vindicate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

The Fourth Amendment, this Court has held, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

is there for the guilty and innocent alike.  And in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, what -- what -- the cost of borrowing that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable termination element and importing it into a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim based solely on lies and an ex parte proceeding, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is what we're talking about with the Gerstein 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

hearing, doing so would mean that if you're the victim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of lies at a Gerstein hearing and you're detained, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately you are constitutionally convicted as 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence amasses against you, the need to show favorable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination, it will be impossible for that plaintiff. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so the Fourth Amendment right will not be something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that plaintiff can vindicate.  That's the reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Wallace didn't allow Heck to expand to instances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like this where you're not challenging the wrongful

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

conviction itself. 

 

11 

            

And what they have asked, their claim is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

narrow, and the way to resolve this case is -- is now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equally narrow.  The way to resolve the case is to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclude that whenever this -- your Fourth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim could run through the arraignment after indictment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case, which still -- which was still out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-year limitations period.  But it doesn't -- it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not entitled to that favorable termination element which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have the effect of closing off the courthouse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doors to a universe of claims in order to buy extra time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case.  And that is what we urge the Court not to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do.  And that is the simplest way. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What you're saying is if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

you're falsely arrested, you have a good claim for false 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrest.  It doesn't matter that you were properly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

convicted.  But if you are not only falsely arrested, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but if your detention continues, then you have a claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the continued detention. 

 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  For violation of the Gerstein 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hearing, Your Honor.  And -- and I do -- for lies, under 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

Gerstein.

14 

15

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

              

I do want to be clear in saying that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closest analogous tort is false arrest, that is treating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it the way I think the Seventh Circuit has, which is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it runs up until what we call the first appearance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you have the initiation of adversarial process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

By no means does the limitations period, or is there a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling that runs from the period of the lie at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gerstein hearing through the pretrial period. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As I said at the outset, that is subject to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional tort common law principles of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate cause.  And there may well be damages 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

recoverable for that period, but it's based on the lie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the Gerstein hearing.  And as Wallace held, Heck 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot be extended to apply to a claim that exists 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before you have an extant conviction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just one more time. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Suppose you have arrest; Gerstein hearing --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- filing of formal 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

charges, either information or indictment; pretrial 

 

 

 

 

 

suppression hearing, at which both parties are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

represented --

 

4 

            

5 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- and the false evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

is -- is not -- its falsity has not been known and so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're detained.  And then trial. 

  

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

end? 

10 

            

When does the Fourth Amendment violation 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SCODRO:  Sure.  You would have it --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

this returns to Justice Ginsburg's point.  You would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a Fourth Amendment claim for the initial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

warrantless arrest.  You would have a Fourth Amendment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

claim for misstatements at a Gerstein hearing that then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

led to ongoing pretrial seizure.  And the damages from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that claim may run throughout the period of pretrial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

seizure. 

18 

            

But with regard to the nature of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

constitutional violation that occurs at subsequent 

 

 

 

 

 

processes, be they grand jury, bail hearings, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preliminary hearings, those are traditional due process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims consistent with this Court's holding in Mooney --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frankly, in Brady, which has applied due process to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutorial duties and police duties during that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

period. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

52 

1 

            

So I -- I hope that answers Your Honor's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

question.  Whether or not those damages run throughout 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that period, or whether they're reduced by virtue of an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervening cause would be a question -- application of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional proximate cause. 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand.  Opposing 

    

  

 

7 

counsel or defendant's counsel ever present in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

Gerstein hearing? 

 

9 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Generally, in this case, yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

Often they are because the Gerstein determination is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frequently made as part of the first appearance, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is to say -- which is the moment in time which this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court held you have a Sixth Amendment -- your Sixth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment right attaches. 

 

 

            

May I complete the answer, Your Honor? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. SCODRO:  May I complete the answer? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You have more?  Go 

  

  

 

 

 

 

19 

ahead. 

20 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Thank you. 

  

 

 

21 

            

(Laughter.) 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Thank you. 

  

 

 

            

So I want to return to the point I was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

making, which now -- I apologize.  I don't know if I've 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

answered Your Honor's --

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

53 

1 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 

 

  

2 

about that the --

 

 

 

You were talking 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 

 

  

-- Gerstein hearing 

 

 

5 

is often combined --

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. SCODRO:  Yeah.  It's often combined with 

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

the first appearance.  And the reason -- actually, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has contemplated that in Rothgery and Gerstein 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself.  It's often a matter of convenience that at that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, it's when the individual's informed of the


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charges, their Sixth Amendment right attaches and bail


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is set as well.


 

 

 

13 

            

Thank you.

3 

            

4 

decision --

 

5 

            

With respect to the Seventh Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But there's still a Fourth 

   

  

 

 

 

6 

Amendment violation? 

 

7 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  There's still a Fourth 

   

  

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

Amendment violation, but he would have qualified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity if it -- if he acted with objective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness.  Because it's a Fourth -- Fourth 

   

  

 

 

 

Amendment doesn't have any intent.  You either violate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it or not violate it.  There's either probable cause or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.  And then you could superimpose qualified immunity. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

The Seventh Circuit would have said that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

there is -- there's no Fourth Amendment right, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not the Petitioner filed his claim three years, four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, a million years ago, or the day after he was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

released.  That's -- that's their position.  So that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

why we're here on the question, whether this is a Fourth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment violation.  We reject the -- the Seventh 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's view that it's a due -- due process. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you -- you don't care 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

that we don't reach the statute of limitations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Correct.  But I do want to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

note that the Seventh Circuit, with respect to the

statute of limitations to the accrual point -- point, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uses favorable termination in their due process cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What happens in this 

  

 

 

 

 

situation?  The person is -- is initially arrested and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held for a period of time based on fabricated evidence, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but then before trial, shortly before -- before trial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other valid evidence is gathered and the person is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted at the trial.  Now, does that person have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of claim that you are asserting?  And if so, when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would -- when would the claim accrue?  Would the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable termination defeat the claim? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  The -- he would -- at that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, if you use Heck as the case that covers this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular issue, he would not -- since he was convicted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Heck, he would not be able to bring the claim if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that claim attacks the conviction. 

 

 

 

 

            

If it doesn't attack the conviction, as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court sort of pointed out in, I think it was in Footnote 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 on suppression hearings or on evidence --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I'll say it attacks -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

attacks the unlawful detention. 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  So it wouldn't have the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's not the conviction.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

would not be defeated by --

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Then -- then I would say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

56 

under Heck, the Heck exception, they could bring -- they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could bring then suit.

3

accrue? 

5 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Then when would the claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. EISENHAMMER:  I think it would accrue at 

    

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

that point, at the conviction, as I read Heck.  Because 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think it would be -- it would be -- in this particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, it would be unfair to the -- to the individual to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculate on whether -- what evidence comes out at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- at the trial to determine whether or not that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really -- that probable cause determination may or may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not attack the -- the --

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if the outcome of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

the -- of the trial is irrelevant to the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment claim, as it would seem to be in the case of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an unlawful detention, then why should the claim not --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why should the accrual of the claim be tied to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination of the prosecution? 

 

 

 

19 

            

MR. EISENHAMMER:  Because at the -- at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

time it -- it has occurred, you -- well, two reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You don't know at that time whether or not it does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attack the conviction. 

 

 

23 

            

And second, you don't -- you don't want --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

because you don't know whether that evidence heard at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- at the -- at the -- at the Gerstein hearing may

or may not -- some of it may come in; some of it may


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.


            

And then the other issue -- the other issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that you don't want parallel litigation going on,


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or -- or collateral attack for many of the reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that was stated in Kaley.
