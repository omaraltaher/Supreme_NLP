CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  15­7,  Universal  Health  Services  v.  The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  and  Massachusetts  ex  rel.  Escobar  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Correa. 

            

Mr.  Englert. 

 

          

 

 

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ROY  T.  ENGLERT,  JR. 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  entire  case  turns  on  four  words  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute:  "False  or  fraudulent  claim."  "False"  and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

"fraudulent"  have  been  unchanged  since  1863  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  "Claim"  is  defined  by  statute. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

I'll  come  back  to  those  words. 

 

 

 

 

 

Three  separate  State  agencies  investigated 

 

 

 

 

the  facts  of  this  case  in  detail.  All  three  agencies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

produced  lengthy  reports  and  proposed  remedial  measures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  certain  alleged  regulatory  violations.  No  agency 

  

 

 

 

 

 

asked  for  any  money  back.  No  sanction  at  all  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed  on  the  company.  One  individual  was  fined  $1,000 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  claimant  director  was  given  two  years  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervision.

implied­certification  theory  under  the  False  Claims  Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  very  same  facts  have  now  been  recharacterized  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud  on  the  government. 

 

 

 

            

The  First  Circuit  focused  on  a  single 

   

 

 

 

 

alleged  regulatory  violation  involving  a  regulation  not 

   

 

 

 

 

cited  in  the  complaint,  not  cited  in  any  appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief,  not  cited  in  the  amicus  brief  of  the  Commonwealth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Massachusetts.  That  is  not  what  "fraud"  means. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  coming  back  to  the  four  words  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter,  "false  or  fraudulent  claim." 

 

 

 

 

            

"False"  means  false.  This  Court  construed 

  

 

 

 

 

that  word  in  Williams  v.  United  States.  Footnote  3  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents'  brief  unsuccessfully  tries  to  distinguish 

 

 

 

 

 

Williams.  The  Solicitor  General  ignores  Williams. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  It  can't  mean  misleading, 

  

 

 

 

 

then? 

            

So  "false"  can  only  mean  false?  It  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  deceptive,  misleading? 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  It  cannot,  Justice  Ginsburg. 

  

 

 

 

 

Because  the  body  of  law  that  covers  deceptive  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misleading  statements  is  not  falsity.  It's  the  law  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud.  And  the  law  of  fraud  is  stated  in  Section  551  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Restatement  (Second)  of  Torts. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Suppose  you  have  a  private 

   

  

 

 

 

contract.  In  the  private  contract,  it's  for  medical

services.  The  written  part  does  not  actually  use  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  "doctor,"  but  the  circumstances  are  such  that  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  person  would  assume,  would  believe  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  contracted  for  medical  services  provided  by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctor. 

            

This  is  an  ordinary  contract  case.  Could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  jury  or  the  judge  find  that  that  implicit  term  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  contract  that  the  services  would  be  provided  by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctor  was  breached,  it  was  a  material  breach,  and, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  the  implicit  statement  was  false? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Two  responses,  if  I  may, 

   

  

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer. 

 

            

First,  the  whole  problem  here  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tortification  of  contract.  Yes,  that's  a  good  contract 

   

  

 

 

 

 

case,  but  it's  not  automatically  a  good  tort  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

The  second  answer  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  no.  What's  the  second? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  ENGLERT:  Section  551(2)(e)  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Restatement  deals  with  that  exact  situation,  facts  basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  transaction.  So  the  common  law  has  developed  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  of  fraud  that  will  accommodate  the  cases  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  liability  makes  sense  because  every  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person,  as  Your  Honor  said,  would  assume  something  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true.

and  6  of  the  Restatement  ­­ rather,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7  and  8, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  one  example  of  facts  basic  to  the  transaction  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five  examples  of  facts  not  basic  to  the  transaction.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  very,  very,  very  narrow  duty  of  disclosure. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  fine.  But  now  let's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

go  a  step  further.  We  have  our  contract.  The  facts  are 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  that  any  reasonable  person  would  assume  there  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicit  statement  that  the  services  will  be  provided  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  doctor.  You  say  that  could  be  a  breach  of  contract. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  it  turns  out  that  this  company  that  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  contract  has  sold  the  shares  over  the  SEC.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SEC  says,  you  know,  it's  so  obvious  that  that  implicit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement  in  the  contract  meant  that  they  had  a  doctor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  was  a  doctor  ­­ that's  so  obvious  ­­ that  we  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  selling  shares  in  this  company,  where  indeed  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  was  absolutely  critical,  millions  of  dollars 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  at  stake,  without  a  doctor,  violating  of  implicit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement  that  there  was  a  doctor,  we  think  that's  fraud 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Rule  10(b)(5). 

 

 

            

that  up. 

 

            

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  I'm  glad  Your  Honor  brought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right. 

  

 

 

MR.  ENGLERT:  The  SEC  has  a  habit  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

construing  fraud  under  10(b)(5),  and  this  Court  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habit  of  reining  the  SEC  in.  And  the  Chiarella  case  is

quite  key  here.  And  Chiarella  is  not  cited  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents'  brief.  It's  not  cited  in  the  government's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  In  all  the  dark  green  amicus  briefs,  it's  cited 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once,  and  the  citation  is  to  the  dissent.  Chiarella 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  fraud  in  a  statute  is  very  broad,  but  it's  broad 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  to  cover  the  common  law  and  no  more.  If  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  go  broader  than  the  common  law  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  fine.  But  what  is  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  talking  the  common  law.  All  I  know  about  contracts 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

came  from  Blackjack  Dawson,  my  contracts  teacher  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ who  was  a  great  teacher, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

and  he  taught  the  common  law.  So  I  don't  know  anything 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else.  I  ­­ well,  I  won't  go  quite  that  far,  but 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonetheless.  Nonetheless,  I  think  under  common  law,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

could  say  that  that  was  a  material  breach  of  contract, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  I  just  talked  to.  And  indeed,  there  happened  to  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  whole  set  of  regulations  on  the  shelf,  et  cetera, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  spell  it  all  out  to  which  there  was  an  implicit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference  in  the  contract  if  it's  ­­ you  understand  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  saying.  It's  common  law  that  I'm  saying. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Well,  the  thousands  of  pages 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  regulations  and  the  implicit  reference  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  are  not  what  the  common  law  means  by  fraud. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  are,  sadly,  what  the  lower  courts  have  meant  by

fraud  under  the  False  Claims  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Englert,  I  guess  I  don't 

   

   

  

 

 

understand  that.  I  mean,  let  me  take  Justice  Breyer's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  and  make  it  even  simpler. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let's  say  that  there's  a  contract  and  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  explicit  term,  and  it  says  I  commit  to  providing  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctor's  care.  Yes?  And  then  it  turns  out  that  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical  care  that  was  provided  was  not  by  a  doctor.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  by  a  nurse  or  it  was  by  somebody  with  not  even  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  of  qualifications.  And  ­­ and  then  the  person  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enters  into  the  contract  makes  a  statement,  demands 

   

 

 

 

 

 

payment,  and  says  the  care  was  provided. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  some  care  was  provided;  it  is  true. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  medical  care,  a  doctor's  care  was  not  provided. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now,  by  withholding  that  fact  and  by  just  saying  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care  was  provided,  have  I  not  committed  fraud  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law? 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  No,  Your  Honor.  Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

Kagan,  that  is  not  fraud.  And  that  situation  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  dealt  with  by  Restatement  Section  551(2)(b)  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  famous  Junius  decision  written  by  Justice  Cardozo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  New  York  Court  of  Appeals. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  ­­ what  about 

  

 

 

 

 

Restatements  ­­ oh,  I  think  it's  529,  which  ­­ which

believes  that  it's  misleading  because  of  his  failure  to

Justice  Kennedy.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  There  is  a  failure  to  make 

   

  

 

 

 

 

an  additional  or  qualifying  matter  in  order  to  make  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement  not  false.  That's  exactly  the  Justice's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical. 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Justice  Kennedy,  if  I 

  

 

 

 

 

understood  Justice  Kagan's  hypothetical  question 

 

 

 

 

correctly,  it  is  not  fraud  within  the  meaning  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

551(2)(b).  But  let's  suppose  that  I'm  wrong  about  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay?  Let's  suppose  that  that  is  fraud.  That's  still  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  far  cry  from  the  facts  in  this  case  in  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  of  appeals  had  to  invoke  a  regulation  that  cross 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referenced  another  regulation  that  nobody  had  cited  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  the  failure  to  announce  a  violation  of  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  when  submitting  a  claim  is  fraud. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  see  that.  That's  to  me 

    

  

 

 

 

 

what's  at  the  heart  of  this.  How  do  you  distinguish

those  regulations,  breach  of  which  are  fraudulent  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  breach  them,  and  implicit  promise  not  to,  from  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  not?  There  are  millions  of  regulations.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  all  the  amici  are  worried  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  now,  this  is  my  basic  question,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  question.  The  obvious  kind  of  distinction  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  seem  possible  is  a  contract­based  distinction 

   

 

 

 

 

between  matters  that  are  material  where  the  whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  disappears  and  matters  that  are  sometimes  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  called  nonmaterial,  I'll  get  the  ­­ I'll  forget 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  exact  word,  partial,  where  even  though  the  condition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  violated,  you  don't  destroy  the  contract  but  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  get  damages  for  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  a  distinction  that  every  court 

   

 

 

 

 

that  deals  with  contracts  is  used  to  applying  bread  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

butter.  All  right?  Normal  daily  basis.  Why  not  use 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  same  distinction  right  here? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Because  this  is  not  a  contract 

   

  

 

 

 

 

case.  The  government  has  only  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  no.  What  you'd  say,  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

course  it  applies  where  the  condition  that  was  lied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  was  material.  And  there  can  be  implicit  lies.  Of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  there  has  to  be  an  implicit  lie.  But  it  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  an  implicit  lie  that  I  did  not  comply  ­­ you  might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicitly  imply  that  you  fulfilled  provision

No.  43876(b)  which  says  paper  should  be  three  inches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long,  okay?  Okay.  Or  there  could  be  an  implicit  lie 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  person  in  your  hospital  was  a  doctor.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  you'd  say  is  not  material.  The  second  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material. 

            

Now,  that  I'm  asking  because  I  wonder  if  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  like  that,  drawn  from  contract  law  would,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not,  satisfy  most  of  the  concerns  that  are  ­­ are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  in  the  amicus  briefs  supporting  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Justice  Breyer,  it  would  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy  most  of  those  concerns  for  several  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  and  foremost,  the  False  Claims  Act  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  own  definition  of  materiality,  which  is  greatly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

watered  down  from  the  common  law.  Something  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capable  of  influencing  a  decisionmaker  is  material  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  False  Claims  Act.  So  materiality  doesn't  solve  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem. 

            

Now  let  me  say  also  that  materiality  is,  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  arguably,  a  different  element.  When  I  say  "at 

   

   

  

 

 

 

least  arguably,"  the  statute  actually  doesn't  say  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1)(A)  that  it  has  to  be  material,  but  courts  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly  read  materiality  in.  But  even  if  materiality 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  read  in,  it's  a  different  element  on  top  of  a  false 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  fraudulent  claim. 

 

 

            

And  I  really  want  to  bring  this  Court  back

with  respect  to  the  four  words  "false  or  fraudulent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim"  because  for  it  to  be  fraudulent,  there  must  be, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  Your  Honor  said,  an  implicit  lie.  And  the  common 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  cases  like  Junius,  Restatements  like  551(2)(b), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal  with  the  implicit  lie. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  I'm  totally 

  

  

 

 

 

confused.  I  always  thought  that  when  you  asked  for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment,  you're  making  a  promise:  I  did  what  I  agreed 

    

   

   

 

 

 

to  do.  Pay  me,  please. 

  

 

 

 

            

That's,  to  me,  what's  sort  of  understood. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  I  hired  you  to  provide  me  with  doctor  services,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask  me  for  money,  I'm  assuming  you  provided  me  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctor  services.  And  you  know  you  didn't.  Why  isn't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  fraud? 

   

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Because  it's  a  contract 

   

  

 

 

breach.  Breaking  a  promise  is  a  contract  breach.  Some 

   

   

  

  

 

 

contract  breaches  are  fraud,  most  are  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  providing  a  gun  that 

   

  

 

 

 

doesn't  shoot  to  the  Army  is  simply  a  contract  breach? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  I  don't  know,  Justice 

    

 

 

 

Sotomayor.  It  depends  on  the  facts  of  the  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  ­­ what  more  facts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

do  you  need?  Government  contracted  for  guns.  All  of  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sudden  you  deliver  guns  that  don't  shoot.  That  ­­ those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  facts  that  led  to  this  Act.

MR.  ENGLERT:  The  additional  facts  I  need 

   

  

 

 

 

are  what  was  stated  in  the  claim,  what  was  stated  in

anybody,  except  yourself,  would  ever  think  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  a  fraud  to  provide  guns  that  don't  shoot  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  the  ­­ the  government  contracted  for?

MR.  ENGLERT:  Yes.

MR.  ENGLERT:  Yes,  depending  on  additional 

  

 

 

 

 

facts,  Justice  Sotomayor,  as  stated  in  Section  551  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Restatement.  If  I'm  wrong  about  these  hypothetical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples,  I'm  wrong,  but  I'm  happy  to  rest  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  551  of  the  Restatement  as  to  what  "fraud"  means. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Chiarella  says  as  a  holding  of  this  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  word  "fraudulent"  requires  that  there  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty.  The  Restatement,  551(2),  is  all  about  when  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  and  there  isn't  a  duty.

MR.  ENGLERT:  No,  no.  If  I  may. 

   

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It's  my  misunderstanding. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  ENGLERT:  The  False  Claims  Act  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

amended  a  few  years  ago,  about  20  ­­ about  30  years 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ago  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Right.  Right. 

  

  

 

MR.  ENGLERT:  ­­ to  redefine  materiality.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

may  be  wrong  on  the  timing,  but  it's  been  amended  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redefine  materiality  as  a  very,  very  low  standard.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  point  is  not  use  it  or  don't  use  it.  The  point  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  before  you  get  to  materiality,  you  have  to  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false  or  fraudulent  claim. 

 

 

 

            

Materiality  is  not  part  of  the  definition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false  or  fraudulent.  It  is  an  additional  requirement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  the  false  or  fraudulent. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  what  I  have  a  hard 

   

   

  

 

 

time  understanding.  It  ­­ it  seems  to  me  we  just  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  about  fraud  unless  we  have  materiality  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense.  And  it  could  be  a  very  strict  standard  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Otherwise,  it  seems  to  me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

fraud  doesn't  make  much  sense. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Justice  Kennedy,  I  agree  with 

   

  

 

 

 

you.  For  something  to  be  fraud,  it  must  be  fraud  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined  by  the  common  law,  and  it  must  be  material. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  this  Court's  holding  in  the  Neder  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  yes,  I  agree  with  you  that  to  think  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud,  one  must  have  the  kind  of  statement  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  and  materiality  and  scienter. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  what  I  understood  you  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

be  saying,  Mr.  Englert,  was  that  all  of  these  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples,  examples  that  really  led  to  the  False  Claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act,  are  not  fraud.  So  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Oh,  Justice  Kagan,  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  I'm  saying. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  let  me  just  give  you  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

few  of  them. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Justice  Sotomayor  said  the 

  

 

 

 

 

government  contracts  to  buy  guns;  the  guns  don't  shoot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  government  contracts  to  buy  boots  ­­ this  was  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  context  of  the  Civil  War  ­­ the  boots  fell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apart  after  12  hours.  The  government  contracts  to  buy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

food;  the  food  was  rancid. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  each  of  those  contractors  would  come  in

and  would  demand  payment. 

 

 

 

            

And  the  entire  idea  behind  this  statute  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  that  demand  of  payment  is  a  representation.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation  is  that  I've  given  you  guns  that  shoot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  boots  that  wear  and  food  that  can  be  eaten.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  ­­ when  that  is  not  true,  that  is  a  fraudulent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  And  you're  suggesting  that  all  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypotheticals  ­­ that  somehow  that's  not  a  fraudulent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  And  I  guess  that  leaves  me  sort  of  wondering 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  do  you  think  would  be  a  fraudulent  claim? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Two  things,  Justice  Kagan,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

response.  One,  those  all  may  be  fraudulent  claims.  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  denying  that  any  of  those  can  be  fraudulent  claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  again,  Section  551(2)(b)  and  (e)  of  the  Restatement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cover  those. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  if  those  are 

  

 

 

 

 

fraudulent  claims  ­­

 

 

            

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  But  if  I  may  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ I  ­­ I  would  think  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

this  is  the  exact  same,  is  that  the  contract  was  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctor's  medical  care,  and  a  doctor's  medical  care  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  provided.  A  nondoctor's  care  was  provided. 

    

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  May  I  explain  my  key 

   

  

 

 

 

disagreement  with  that  analysis?  In  your  question, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan,  you  embedded  the  proposition  that  there

are  implicit  representations  in  the  claims.  That  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  how  the  False  Claims  Act  was  read  from  1863  to  1994. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Ab­Tech  case,  decided  by  the  Court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Claims  in  1994,  was  the  very  first  case  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

131  years  under  the  statute  to  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implied­certification  theory. 

 

            

This  ­­ this  concept  that's  easy  to  read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  ­­ graft  back  onto  the  Civil  War  statute,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  an  implied  certification  is  not  how  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  speaking  at  the  time  of  the  Civil  War.  It  is  a  new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concept.  It's  something  that  has  been  causing  the  False 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claims  Act  to  expand  dramatically  in  the  last  22  years, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it  is  not  ­­ there's  nothing  at  all  ­­ nobody  relies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  1863  legislative.  They  rely  on  the  1986 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequent  legislative. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  I  understand  what  you're 

   

  

 

 

 

saying,  you're  saying  that  in  representing  that  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied  the  terms  of  the  contract,  you  are  ­­ or  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  ­­ let  me  say  that  ­­ I'll  start  it  over. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  demanding  payment  for  having  satisfied 

 

 

 

 

 

the  contract,  you  are  not  representing  that  you  are  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  have  satisfied  the  contract;  that's  your  point? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  demanding  payment  for  satisfaction  of  the  contract, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  are  not  making  a  recommendation  that  you  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied  the  contract?

MR.  ENGLERT:  Not  that  broadly.  Not  ­­ not

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I'm  not  into  every  jot  and

MR.  ENGLERT:  That  is  what  the  Restatement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

refers  to  as  essentiality,  which  is  a  much,  much,  much 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

higher  standard  than  materiality.  And  this  is  where  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  comes  in.  When  essentiality,  which  does  go  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  heart  of  an  ­­ of  an  implicit  representation,

problems  reflected  in  the  light  green  amicus  briefs  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case. 

 

            

Now,  the  Government's  and  Respondent's  main 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  as  I  see  it,  is  really  not  even  a  textual 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  It  is  that  men  must  turn  square  corners  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  deal  with  the  government.  That's  a  perfectly  fine 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

principle  in  certain  settings  but  not  when  a  punitive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  is  at  issue.

principles  are  instead  the  principle  of  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoidance  and  fair  notice  and  the  rule  of  lenity.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  of  those  principles  cut  very  strongly  against  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implied  certification  theory.  27  years  ago,  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered  a  case  of  excessive  punishment  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

False  Claims  Act  called  United  States  v.  Halper.  It  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later  overruled  in  just  eight  years,  but  it  remains 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructive. 

            

The  judicial  instinct  to  avoid  excessive 

 

 

 

 

 

punishments  was  so  strong  that  the  Court  let  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellee  out  of  FCA  civil  liability  by  invoking  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Double  Jeopardy  Clause. 

 

 

            

When  the  Court  overruled  Halper,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested  in  passing  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  might  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better  suited  than  the  Fifth  to  address  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excessiveness  concerns.  But  the  recognition  by  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court  that  punishment  under  the  False  Act  ­­ False

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Mr.  Frederick. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  DAVID  C.  FREDERICK 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice,  and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  a  claimant  asserts  a  right  to 

   

   

 

 

government  funds  without  disclosing  that  it  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowingly  violated  the  government's  material  payment

regardless  of  whether  it  contains  ­­

MR.  FREDERICK:  ­­ express  false  statements. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ this  confuses  me  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

no  end.  I  don't  know  why  the  lower  court  relied  on  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  423,  this  ­­ the  director's  qualifications  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsibilities  when  there's  a  direct  regulation  that 

   

 

 

 

 

says  that  the  health  service  will  only  pay  for  services 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rendered  by  a  staff  member  who's  qualified. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Why  did  they  go  off  on  this  indirect  method

MR.  FREDERICK:  I  think  the  original  sin 

    

 

 

 

 

here,  if  I  can  express  it  that  way,  Justice  Sotomayor, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  by  the  district  court  which  was  so  focused  on  what

were  conditions  of  participation.  It  used  a  formulation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  conditions  of  participation  versus  conditions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment.  And  once  it  constructed  that  idealogical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

dichotomy,  it  was  so  focused  on  what  the  conditions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participation  were  that  it  lost  sight  of  the  fact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  regulations  all  work  together  and  in  a  way  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  there's  a  regulation 

   

  

 

 

right  on  point. 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  I  understand,  Justice 

    

 

 

Sotomayor.  And  had  I  been  fortunate  enough  to  litigate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  in  the  district  court,  we  might  have  cited  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision. 

            

But  I  would  point  out  that  the  key  point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  ­­ and  I  don't  think  the  other  side  disputes  this, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  when  you're  providing  mental  healthcare  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teenagers  and  other  children,  it  should  be  supervised, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  should  be  given  by  people  who  have  the  proper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license. 

              

I  don't  think  that  it  takes  any  great  leap 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  essentiality  or  materiality  or  intrinsicness  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  words  the  Petitioner  wants  to  come  up  with, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  pretty  basic. 

 

 

            

And  the  violation  that  occurred  here  was  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  all  over  the  mass  health  regulations.  You  can

First  Circuit  relied  on;  if  you  look  at  the  express

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  is  your  ­­ is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  position  that  every  material  breach  of  a  contract 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  rise  to  a  False  Claims  Act  ­­ a  claim  under  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

False  Claims  Act  as  false  and  fraudulent? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  No.  Our  position  is  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

there  are  two  other  requirements  in  the  Act.  One  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  be  done  knowingly.  And  under  the  statute,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  "knowing"  has  three  features,  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledge,  deliberate  indifference  or  reckless 

 

 

 

 

disregard. 

            

So  there  is  a  knowledge  requirement  that  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  done,  and  I  would  point  out,  Justice  Breyer,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  solves  virtually  every  problem  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  amici  because  they  are  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations  in  which  they  are  not  focusing  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledge  requirement  of  the  fraudster  who  is  seeking  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  government  funds. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­ so  if  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  you've  got  another  one,  and  I  want  to  keep  that  in

(8),  (10),  or  whatever,  you  ­­ the  claimant  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  show  knowledge  of  that  regulation? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Knowledge  that  ­­ that  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  breaching  it,  it  was  going  to  be  material  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government.  That's  the  second  part  of  what  I  think  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

important. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So,  I  guess,  I  mean 

   

   

  

 

 

that  ­­

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  So  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That  causes  concern, 

  

 

 

 

 

of  course,  because  there  are  thousands  of  pages  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  under  Medicaid  or  Medicare  programs.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  your  ­­ your  position  would  precipitate  litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  whether  or  not  the  person  who  said,  here's  our

government  or  the  relator  is  claiming  made  the

MR.  FREDERICK:  The  court  test,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice,  is  whether  the  State  could  reject  the  claim  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reimbursement,  whether  it  had  a  basis  in  rejecting  it

government  that  there  was  something  material  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  I  thought 

   

  

 

 

 

your  point  was  the  first  thing  is  that  the  claimant  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  know  about  it. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It  has  to  know  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  particular  requirement  in  the  regulation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  correct.  And  it  has 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to  know  that  it  was  important  to  the  government.  It  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  material  condition  for  the  government,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  could  reject  payment  on  this  basis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  it  has  to  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  only  about  the  particular  provision  but  that  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material  and  the  government  wouldn't  pay  without  it.

essentially  is  not  discussed  in  the  opening  presentation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  my  friend. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  here,  looking  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

looking  at  what  you  just  said,  you  said  the  three

MR.  FREDERICK:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And,  third,  he  has  to  omit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling  the  government  about  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Now,  I  look  at  the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

two  things  he  talked  about  in  the  Restatement,  and  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  matters  known  to  him  that  he  knows  to  be  necessary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  prevent  his  partial  or  ambiguous  statement  from  being

said  ­­ and  then  (e)  is  facts  basic  to  the  transaction

difference  is  that  I  think  there's  an  easier  Restatement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  that  is  more  directly  on  point.  And  if  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  just  quote  from  our  brief  at  page  28  to  29.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote  the  Restatement,  Section  529:  "A  representation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

stating  the  truth  so  far  as  it  goes  but  which  the  maker

qualifying  matter  is  a  fraudulent  representation." 

   

 

 

 

            

Here  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  it's  got  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  ­­ he  has  to  know  about  the  specific  provision  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation. 

            

correct. 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  correct.  That's 

  

  

 

 

But  here,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I  think  that  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  odd  to  suppose  that  in  what  are  28  provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Mass  Health  regulations  in  what  is  a  massive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program  involving,  you  know,  billions  of  dollars,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  business  model  is  predicated  on  serving  indigent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  so  that  they  can  get  access  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Medicaid­reimbursed  funds,  that  they  would  read  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations.  And  a  number  of  them  say  it  is  critical  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  supervision  when  you're  providing  mental  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care.

it's  an  easy  case  to  prove,  in  other  words,  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  necessarily  known  that.  But  what  they  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  know  is  of  that  regulation,  whatever  one  of  the  28  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  and  they  have  to  know  that  the  government  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regard  that  as  material. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  correct.  But  ­­ but 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  key  point  here,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  is  I  don't  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  should  be  a  difficult  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  other  side  spends  a  lot  of  time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  worthless  services,  and  they  seek  in  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  at  pages  37  and  38  to  say  that  the  standard  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  when  these  goods  are  so  worthless  or  the  services 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  so  worthless,  that  it  would  be  rather  obvious.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  would  point  out  that  if  the  worthless  services  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recoverable  under  the  False  Claims  Act,  then  it  is  okay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  an  implied  certification  theory.  They  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  conceded  that  if  the  goods  are  completely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worthless,  it  would  be  okay  for  the  government  to  bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  False  Claims  Act  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  would  submit  that  if  the  goods  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

partially  worthless,  if  ­­ those  have  also  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recoverable  because  there's  no  clear  way  to  draw  a  line 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  those  that  are  partially  worthless  and  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  completely  worthless. 

 

 

 

            

Let  me  give  you  a  simple  example.

Here,  under  what  I  understand  Petitioner's 

   

 

 

 

theory  to  be,  if  Petitioner  had  gotten  some  college 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interns  who  were  studying  psychology,  and  it  decided  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow  those  interns  to  practice  in  their  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilities,  and  those  college  interns  gave  what  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called  therapy  to  teenagers,  under  their  theory,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  to  tell  the  government  that  these  are  college 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interns  who  don't  have  college  degrees,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certifications,  or  licenses  required  by  the  State,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  A­OK  to  charge  the  government  full  freight.  Not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  for  the  service,  but  under  .408,  they're  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charging  with  the  representation  that  they  have  embedded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  supervision  cost. 

   

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  suspect  most  cases 

    

 

 

 

 

are  a  little  more  complicated  than  that,  and  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  difficulty  comes  in  when  you  have  hundreds, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands  of  pages  of  regulations.  And  typically  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  not  the  government.  They  didn't  in  this  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  didn't  pick  up  the  ­­ the  false  claim;  it  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relator.  And  the  relator  comes  in  and  says,  well,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  ­­ you  violated  the  provision,  not  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

college  intern  is  a  doctor,  but  that  ­­ whatever  it  is. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  know,  you  have  to  use  this  particular  syringes  or

And  I  guess  that's  where  the  problem  comes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in,  in  that  it's  a  little  more  complicated  than  that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  just  don't  know  if  I  can  take  your  abstract 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  and  transfer  it  to  the  reality  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  contract. 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  let  me  ­­ let  me  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  core  of  what  I  think  the  concern  is  in  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement,  and  in  the  position  by  the  amici  on  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side,  and  it's  that  we  don't  have  enough  notice.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  what's  really  important  to  the  government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  their  basic  problem.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

            

Now,  they  don't  solve  that  problem  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  of  the  two  theories  that  they  present  in  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  If  notice  is  the  problem,  the  government  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solve  that  by  having  the  check­off  box  ­­ I  think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer,  you  were  the  one  who  mentioned  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  says,  I  certify  I've  complied  with  all  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations.  Well,  that  doesn't  give  them  any  notice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  it  doesn't  give  them  any  notice  if, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attached  to  the  contract  claim  form,  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Acquisition  Regulations  or  the  Department  of  Defense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  or  the  HHS  regulations  are  copied.  We  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  be  killing  forests  in  order  to  generate  that.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  give  them  any  more  notice  either,

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  it  will, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  changes  the  reality.  They're  going  to  look

MR.  FREDERICK:  These  are  not  bid­ask 

  

 

 

 

 

situations,  by  and  large,  Mr.  Chief  Justice.  These  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  healthcare  area  under  entitlement  programs  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  government  is  setting  the  rate  and  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  is  saying,  I'm  providing  service  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance  with  the  Federal  statutes  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations,  and,  therefore,  I  have  a  legal  entitlement 

   

   

 

 

 

to  receive  reimbursement. 

 

 

            

So  in  that  scenario,  the  problem  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  really  want  is  for  the  government  to  pick  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose  among  the  things  that  are  most  important,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once  you  do  that,  you're  creating  a  roadmap  for  fraud. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  all  you're  doing  ­­ every  time  you  omit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  might  be  material  in  any  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance,  but  it's  not  specified  in  the  list  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely  most  critical  things,  you're  just  inviting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  to  say  we're  not  complying  with  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  what  has  it  done?  What 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  the  government  done  when  they  certify  things?  Do

they  say  things  like,  I  hereby  certify  that  I  complied 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  all  material  regulations?  What  do  they  say? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  there's  some 

  

 

 

 

provisions  that  have  certification  requirements.  But  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  point  out  that  even  if  you  were  to  do  that,  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  going  to  solve  most  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  I  agree  with  you. 

   

  

 

 

 

MR.  FREDERICK:  ­­ because  of  grant 

  

 

 

 

 

programs.  There  are  Federal  dollars  that  are  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third  parties  in  which  people  are  engaging  in  contracts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  third  parties  and  they  are  being  paid  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government.  And  in  those  kinds  of  situations, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  your  kind  of  basic  certification  isn't  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work. 

            

So  the  problem  here,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamentally,  is  one  where  the  two  elements  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality  and  knowledge  are  going  to  solve  the  vast 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bulk  of  the  problems.  Because  if  the  claimant  is  acting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negligently  or  at  a  lower  standard,  simply  just  missed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  that's  not  going  to  be  a  case  that  will  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actionable  under  the  False  Claims  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  furthermore,  if  the  claimant  is  asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  something  that  the  government  doesn't  deem  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material,  in  which  the  test  would  be  can  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

withhold  payment,  then  that  isn't  going  to  be  actionable

under  the  False  Claims  Act  either. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  notably,  the  other  side  has  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus  briefs,  but  they  don't  really  point  to  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  cases.  And  if  you  look  at  Professor  Angstrom's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus  brief,  he  is  the  leading  scholar  on  what  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  with  the  False  Claims  Act  empirically.  He  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

studied  all  6,000  filings  since  1986,  and  he's  charted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  ­­ what's  happened  to  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  his  conclusion  is  that  not  only  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  been  no  spike  as  a  result  of  the  implied 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification  theory  having  been  adopted,  but  that,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  the  problems  that  are  identified  don't  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  to  pass  because  the  vast  bulk  of  the  cases  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  intervened  in  by  the  government,  in  fact,  are  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  a  motion  to  dismiss. 

   

 

 

            

And  so  I  would  submit  to  you  that  if  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  at  the  actual  data  for  the  False  Claims  Act,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  what  you  would  conclude  on  the  basis  of  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  is  hyperbole.  There  is  a  lot  of  fear,  but  it  comes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down  to  two  points:  One  is  they  would  like  to  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice  so  that,  presumably,  they  don't  have  to  comply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  things  that  the  government  doesn't  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  reticulate  in  its  rules.  And  they  want  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  able  to  know,  if  they  want  to  get  around  that,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  key  things  that  they  have  to  get  around.

I  would  submit  to  you  that  in  the  Civil  War, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  Justice  Kagan's  hypotheticals  pointed  out,  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  problem  of  implied  certification  because  contractors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  selling  boots  that  were  made  out  of  cardboard,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leather,  and  guns  that  didn't  shoot,  and  mules  that  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  live  and  whole  mules.  And  that  is  exactly  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  problem  that  we're  talking  about  now  over  150 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  later,  with  respect  to  mental  health  services  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  being  provided  by  licensed  and  supervised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

professionals.  Thank  you. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Stewart. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MALCOLM  L.  STEWART 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  statute  refers  to  false  or  fraudulent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims,  and  I  think  there  are  two  different  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

complementary  analytic  routes  that  the  Court  could  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  conclude  that,  if  the  facts  alleged  in  Respondent's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  are  true,  false  or  fraudulent  claims  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submitted. 

            

One  way  to  look  at  this  is  to  focus  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  in  Medicaid,  as  in  other  government

entitlement  programs,  a  person  who  submits  a  claim  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

not  simply  asking  for  money;  he  is  representing  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  a  legal  entitlement  to  be  paid.  And  you  can  say,  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  person  asserts  that  he  is  legally  entitled  to  be  paid, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  he  knows  that  he  has  no  such  legal  entitlement,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  is  false. 

 

 

            

And  then  you  would  ask,  under  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  would  a  person  know  that  he  had  no  legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement  to  be  paid?  And  the  answer  would  be,  if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  knows  that  he  has  failed  to  comply  with  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material  term  of  the  contract  or  a  material  regulatory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  by  definition,  the  government  will  have  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  to  pay,  and  the  claim  of  legal  entitlement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  false. 

 

 

            

And  I  think,  Justice  Breyer,  you  were 

   

 

 

 

 

exactly  right  in  pointing  to  the  law  of  contracts  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draws  a  distinction  between  material  and  nonmaterial 

   

 

 

 

 

terms.  And  the  purpose  of  that  distinction  is  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify  the  situation  in  which  a  breach  by  one  party 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  excuse  the  counterparty's  failure  to  perform.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  a  ­­ if  the  government  is  obligated  to  pay  money  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  contractor  makes  certain  corresponding  performances, 

 

 

 

 

 

if  a  nonmaterial  term  is  breached,  the  government's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  to  pay  remains  intact. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  a  person  who  knew  himself  to  be  in

breach  of  a  nonmaterial  term  and  requested  payment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

anyway  wouldn't  be  making  a  false  claim.  He  would  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claiming  a  legal  entitlement  to  be  paid;  he  would  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  be  paid  because  the  breach  wouldn't  excuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  payment  obligation.  But  if  the  term 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  being  breached  was  material,  the  claim  of  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement  would  be  false. 

 

 

 

            

The  other  analytic  route  that  you  could  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  get  to  the  same  result  in  this  case  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follows  up  on  Justice  Kagan's  hypothetical  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  in  which  there  is  a  contract  for  services  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  performed  by  a  doctor,  and  the  ­­ the  person  who  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arranged  for  services  to  be  provided  by  someone  else 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  in  and  says  services  have  been  performed;  pay  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  it  seems  like  clear  fraud  under  529  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

551  under  the  Restatement.  You  have  made  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation,  services  have  been  performed. 

 

 

 

 

Explaining  that  they  were  performed  by  a  nondoctor  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  circumstances  is  essential  to  make  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation  nonmisleading. 

 

            

And  what  we  have  here,  at  least  if  the  facts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  as  alleged,  is  basically  the  same  thing.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  recites  that  in  requesting  payment,  Universal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Health  Services  submitted  various  invoices,  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  billing  codes,  five­digit  numbers  that  were

determined  by  ­­ identified  by  MassHealth  as  the  codes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  use  for  particular  types  of  services.  One  of  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corresponded  to  individual  therapy,  one  to  group 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therapy,  one  to  family  therapy. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

Now  obviously,  the  claims  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

false  if  no  services  had  been  provided  at  all.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume  everyone  would  agree  that  if  MassHealth  ­­ I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry  ­­ if  Universal  Health  Services  had  billed  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services  provided  in  a  group  setting  but  had  used  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

code  that  MassHealth  had  identified  for  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therapy,  that  would  have  been  a  false  claim  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

MassHealth  is  entitled  to  treat  the  use  of  that  code  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  representation  that  the  services  were  ­­ were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performed  individually. 

 

            

And,  really,  it's  no  ­­ it's  not  a  large 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

leap  to  say  when  you  use  the  code  for  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therapy,  you  are  representing  by  ­­ that  the  services 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  performed,  the  treatment  was  performed  by  a  person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  was  legally  authorized  to  provide  mental  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therapy  under  Massachusetts  law. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  unlike  the  contract  hypothetical  that 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan  identified,  in  determining  what  implicit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representations  are  being  made,  we  wouldn't  look  to  the

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  do  you  tell  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Stewart,  because  at  least  under  Mr.  Frederick's  view 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  have  knowledge  that  the  government  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay.  I  assume  the  government  wouldn't  pay  even  for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonmaterial  provisions. 

 

              

I  mean,  if  you're  supposed  to  pay  ­­ you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  for  $100,000  you're  going  to  provide  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services,  and  you  don't  provide  small  service?  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  pay,  but  you  wouldn't  pay  for  that.  I  mean,  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  understand  that,  how  some  things  are  material  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  it  go  pay  at  all,  or  ­­ or  carve  out  a  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision?

there  going  to  be  not  performance  of  a  contract  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  going  to  pay  for  that  anyway? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Well,  I  think  if  we  got  a  bill 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

for  particular  services  and  the  services  had  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  performed  as  they  were  expected  to  be,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  policy  objectives  were  adequately  advanced

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay.  So  the 

  

  

 

 

 

contract  is  to  provide  all  these  health  services,  and  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way,  you've  got  to  buy,  you  know,  staplers  made  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States,  not  ­­ not  abroad.  And  they  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything,  but  they  don't  buy  staplers  made  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States. 

 

              

I  would  say  the  government,  if  they're,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  rigorous  contracting  officers,  would  say  okay,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get,  you  know,  99,000  whatever,  but  we're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalize  you  because  you  didn't  use  staplers  ­­ we  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  there  for  a  reason,  you  didn't  do  it,  so  we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  withhold  $100,  right? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  We  would  certainly  agree  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  government  contracting  it's  sometimes  the  case  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  trying  to  serve  ancillary  policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectives  such  as  buy  America,  et  cetera. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  if  under  the  terms  of  the  agreement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ­­ the  law  of  contracts,  the  government  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legally  entitled  to  withhold  payment  or  a  portion  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment  in  that  circumstance,  then  that  would  be  a  false 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ a  false  claim  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  STEWART:  It  ­­

don't  understand  the  difference  between  material  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immaterial. 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Well,  if  it  ­­ if  it  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  ­­ I  mean,  it  may  be  that  you  ­­ that  your  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expansive  conception  of  material  terms  is  correct,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  would  be  some  circumstances  that  I  hadn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

envisioned  in  which  the  government  could  lawfully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

withhold  payment,  even  though  the  violation  seemed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairly  tangential  to  the  claim.  If  that's  the  case,  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  means  is  that  the  ­­

all  it  means  is? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  All  it  means  is  that  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  more  expansive  False  Claims  Act  liability,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  because  we  would  be  punishing  people  who  didn't

he  should  be  made  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  wholly  or  in  part, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

now  ­­ now,  I  just  copied  out  of  the  Horn  book  the  basic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  a  material  breach  and  a  partial  or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

nonmaterial  breach  of  contract.  A  material  breach  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

contract  is  a  contract  that  ­­ a  breach  that  allows  one 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  to  repudiate  the  contract.  A  nonmaterial  breach 

    

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  breach  that  gives  rise  to  damages  but  cannot  serve 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  basis  for  repudiation. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  until  this  last  interchange,  I  thought 

   

 

 

 

 

that  was  the  distinction  you  were  drawing,  that  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

piece  of  paper  says  nothing,  but  pay  me,  and  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  a  reg,  if  the  violation  of  that  reg  is  such 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  material,  meaning,  it  would  be  a  basis  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repudiation,  then  it  is  an  implied  ­­ then  it  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implied  statement.  It  was  complied  with,  and  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud. 

            

But  if  it's  just  staples,  you  may  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay  damage  for  staples,  but  that  certainly  doesn't  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  the  contrary  there  would  make  the  contractor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible  for  having  complied  with  every  one  of  40,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations,  the  size  of  the  room,  size  of  the  table. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Well,  I  mean,  first,  there  is

in  which  one  contracting  party  could  refuse  to

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  STEWART:  ­­ its  own  obligations  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  contract,  including  payment. 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  the  second  thing  is  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

scienter  requirement  really  is  crucial  here.  It  applies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  to  knowledge  of  the  breach,  and  knowledge  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  material  to  the  government. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  only  other  thing  I  wanted  to  ­­ to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarify  in  response  to  ­­ to  your  question  is,  we  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  the  test  is  whether  the  person  knew  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  could  lawfully  withhold  payment,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Withhold  payment, 

  

 

 

 

but  not  repudiate  the  contract. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Withhold  payment  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

particular  claim,  because  there  would  certainly  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plenty  of  situations  in  which,  if  somebody  billed  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services  that  were  not  reimbursable  under  the  terms  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  particular  program,  there  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  In  other  words,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  don't  ­­ if  they  put  the  wrong  billing  code  down,

our  Medicare  provider  in  the  State  of  Massachusetts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  what  I  understand  materiality  in  the  contract 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

concept  to  be. 

 

 

            

But  what  you're  saying  is  it's  a  false  claim

pay  for  it.  You  shouldn't  pay  them  for  it,  but  I  don't

MR.  STEWART:  Then  I  would  say  material  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  sense  of  allowing  the  government  to  decline  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply  with  its  corresponding  obligation  to  pay  for  that

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  but  that  doesn't

negligent. 

            

            

MR.  STEWART:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  if  it's  a  mistake, 

   

  

 

 

 

you  could  withhold  payment,  but  you  can't  sue  under  the

mental  state  that  the  FCA  contemplates  between

term  "knowingly"  to  include  recklessness  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Stewart  ­­ I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Go  ahead. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Could  you  just  ­­ what  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

immaterial  terms  for  the  government?  I  mean,  give  me 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  examples.  What  would  count  as  not  material? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  I  mean,  I  don't  know  if  there 

    

   

 

 

 

 

are  any  terms  that  are  wholly  immaterial,  because  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were,  presumably  they  wouldn't  be  in  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  or  the  ­­ the  regulations.  But  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  terms  that  would  be  immaterial  to  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims. 

            

So,  for  example,  if  the  government  had  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  that  said  at  all  times,  a  hospital  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receiving  Medicaid  reimbursement  has  to  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  equipment  in  its  operating  room.  It  might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

well  be  the  case  that  a  violation  of  that  requirement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  disentitle  the  claimant  to  payment  for  ­­ for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surgical  services  performed,  but  would  not  disentitle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  claimant  to  payment  for  services  that  had  nothing  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  with  use  of  the  operating  room. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  to  follow  up  on  what  I  was  saying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before,  I  think  what  we  have  here  is  really  a  fairly

close  variant  on  the  hypothetical  that  ­­ that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

floated,  the  case  in  which  they  represent  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performed  individual  therapy.  They  don't  say  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  who  performed  it  was  not  legally  authorized  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

render  billable  services  under  the  MassHealth  program. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  would  seem  to  be  a  classic  case  of  implied 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentation,  fraudulent  omission,  et  cetera. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  When  you  started  and  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  there  are  two  ways  in  which  this  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued,  do  you  have  a  preference  as  to  which  one  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  two  ways  makes  most  sense,  or  are  there  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  they  diverge,  and  we  should  be  aware  of  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  I  think  this  ­­ probably  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

one  that  would  be  most  helpful  to  the  government  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  one:  That  if  you  assert  a  claim  of  legal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement  to  be  paid  and  you  know  that  you  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legally  entitled  to  be  paid  or  are  reckless  as  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  the  claim  is  ­­ the  claim  is  false  and  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowingly  false.  That  ­­ that  would  be  the  one  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  helpful  to  the  government  just  because  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  ­­ there's  such  variations  in  the  nature  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documentation  that  is  provided  by  claimants  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various  government  programs.  That  ­­ that  general  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  of  the  greatest  health  ­­ help.

sense,  it's  an  easier  way  to  decide  this  case.  If  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  was  not  ­­ I  mean,  I'm  sorry  ­­ if  the  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  ready  yet  to  decide  whether  the  broader 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposition  was  correct,  it  could  still  say,  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  there  was  not  simply  a  claim  for  a  particular 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

dollar  amount.  There  was  at  least  a  little  bit  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

detail  as  to  what  were  the  nature  of  the  services  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performed.  And  giving  that  detail  without  giving  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

offsetting  fact,  if  it  is  a  fact,  that  the  services  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performed  by  noncredentialed,  unsupervised  people,  would 

 

 

 

 

 

render  the  ­­ the  statement  that  was  made  misleading. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  last  two  things,  if  I  ­­ if  I  could  just

newness  of  implied  certification.  The  term  "implied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certification"  is  new.  I  don't  believe  it  was  used 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

until  the  last  25  years  or  so.  But  the  concept  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  can  be  held  liable  for  fraud  even  though  he  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  explicitly  false  but  labors  to  create  a  false 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

impression,  that's  been  around  for  ages. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  thing  is,  Mr.  Englert  said  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  current  FCA  adopts  a  watered­down  version  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality  requirement.  I  think  if  you  compare  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

current  statutory  definition  to  this  Court's  formulation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  traditional  materiality  standard  in  Neder,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gaudin,  in  Kungys,  that  the  current  statutory  definition

is  drawn  essentially  verbatim  from  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

description  of  what  material  ­­ materiality  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditionally  been  at  common  law. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And,  Mr.  Stewart, 

  

 

 

 

 

both  United  States  and  Massachusetts  did  not  intervene 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  STEWART:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  is  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  STEWART:  We  don't  ­­ I  don't  know  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer,  and  we  don't  typically  give  public  explanations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  why  we  don't  intervene.  Sometimes  it's  because  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollar  amount  is  small.  Sometimes  it's  because  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  that  the  relator  is  capable  of  handling  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  himself,  or  the  relator's  counsel.  Sometimes  we  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decline  to  intervene,  because  we're  skeptical  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits  of  a  case.  But  even  in  those  situations,  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  that  we  agree  with  the  relator's  theory  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  don't  know  whether  the  facts  could  be  proved.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  in  all  variations. 

 

 

 

              

I  ­­ our  amicus  brief  is  obviously  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  best  evidence  of  what  we  believe  the  correct  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  to  be.  The  only  other  thing  I  would  say  is  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  decisions  about  whether  to  intervene  in  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  would  be  skewed  if  we  believed  that  courts  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draw  from  our  failure  to  intervene  an  adverse  inference

as  to  our  views  on  the  legal  theory.  If  we  felt  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  made  to  seem  skeptical  of  the  implied

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ROY  T.  ENGLERT,  JR. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  The  False  Claims  Act  uses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

words  drawn  from  the  common  law  of  torts,  not  words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawn  from  the  common  law  of  contracts.  This  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Henry  Steiner  and  Duncan  Kennedy,  not  Charles  Fried. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  test,  as  stated  by  my  friends  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  side,  is  the  core  test  is  whether  the  State  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reject  the  claim  for  reimbursement.  That  is  a  contract 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

standard;  that  is  not  a  tort  standard.  And  if  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  accepts  that  version  of  the  implied­certification 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory,  it  will  be  much  broader  than  anything  the  lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  have  ever  done,  and  a  parade  of  horribles  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light  green  amicus  briefs  would  cite  many  horrible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  Mr.  Frederick  says  they  cite  none.  They  cite 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  real­world  horrible  cases.  That  would  be  the  tip 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  iceberg  if  this  Court  accepts  their  theory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  has  been  suggested  that  everyone  knows

that  it's  common  sense  and  that  it's  obvious  that  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  provide  counseling  services  to  teenagers  must  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

licensed.  Well,  apparently,  the  Commonwealth  of 

  

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  doesn't  find  it  obvious.  Section 

  

 

 

 

 

429.424(E)(1),  quoted  on  page  8  of  our  opening  brief, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

states  the  standards  in  which  "counselors  and  unlicensed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

staff  may  provide  counseling  services." 

 

 

 

 

            

If  it's  so  obvious,  why  did  the  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  have  to  rely  on  a  regulation  that  applies  only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  satellite  facilities?  When  the  First  Circuit  found  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  that  no  one  had  cited  in  all  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation,  it  didn't  cite  one  that  applies  to  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facility.  It  cited  one  that  applies  only  to  satellite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilities.  And  yet,  we're  told  it's  so  obvious  that  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients  should  have  known  that,  and  that  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality  and  scienter  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Volume  II  of  the  Joint  Appendix  contains 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seven  complaints  to  State  agencies,  four  reports  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  agencies,  two  consent  decrees,  and  four  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents.  They  cite  many,  many,  many,  many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

regulations.  This  morass  of  regulations,  bluntly,  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

worse  than  the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  It's  full  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross­references;  it's  full  of  contradictions,  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First  Circuit  itself  acknowledged  in  footnote  15.

contradiction  was  to  refer  to  the  nonpromulgating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency;  so  it's  Chevron  on  steroids.  These  things  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  obvious.  These  regulations  are  not  obvious. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  Mr.  Frederick  and  Mr.  Stewart,  and  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  Mr.  Frederick,  may  seem  to  have  scored  a  blow

Well,  if  you  assume  fraud,  if  you  put  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rabbit  in  the  hat,  you  can  take  the  rabbit  out  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hat.  People  should  pick  and  choose  which  regulations 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  comply  with.  Why?  Because  there's  so  many  and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing.  And  who  holds  the  keys  to  telling  them  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  to  comply  with?  The  regulating  agency  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  contracting  agency. 

 

 

            

If  the  contracting  agency  or  the  regulating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  says,  please  focus  on  this  regulation  because  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  matters,  guess  what?  People  will  focus  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  because  they  know  it  really  matters.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relators  come  in  after  the  fact,  not  the  Commonwealth  of

calling  someone  a  fraudster,  that's  not  the  system  in

JUSTICE  BREYER:  How  does  it  differ,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  just  said,  from  this  thing  in  the  Restatement  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  say  it  would  be  fraud,  facts  basic  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction  or  matters  known,  that  he  knows  to  prevent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  statement  from  being  misleading?  The  statement  is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicitly,  I  did  the  work.  And  this  kind  of  problem, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  it  or  is  it  not,  basic  to  the  transaction  that  the

you  and  other  lawyers  argue  very  well  on  opposite  sides, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  you  just  did. 

 

 

 

            

But  the  standard  you  advocate  is,  according 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Restatement,  misleading  statement  about  a  fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

basic  to  the  transaction,  misleading,  implicitly,  I  did 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it.  Truth?  I  didn't.  You  see,  I'm  saying  your

But  if  that  doesn't  do  it  for  you,  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  dog  that  didn't  bark  in  the  room.  Look  for

MR.  ENGLERT:  Well,  Your  Honor,  it's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  I  think  it's  a  very 

   

   

  

 

 

basic  provision  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  Your  Honor,  with  respect  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ when  you  say,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

performed  this  service,  that  you  performed  a  service  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance  with  the  contract. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ENGLERT:  And  in  seven  complaints  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  agencies,  in  the  ­­ in  the  operative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  in  this  case,  amended  many  times,  why  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  regulation  the  First  Circuit  relied  on  even  cited? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why  is  the  regulation  Mr.  Frederick  says  he  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  if  he  had  been  litigating  this  case  in  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  even  cited? 

 

 

            

It  proves  my  point,  Your  Honor,  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  morass.  And  for  one  to  think,  after  the  fact,  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic  and  central  and  this  is  fraud,  is  a  plaintiff's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer's  game. 

 

            

Thank  you.
