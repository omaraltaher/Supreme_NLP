CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST: 

We'll hear  argument


first  this  morning  in  Number  00-952, 

the  Wisconsin


Department of Health and Human Services v. Irene Blumer.


Ms. Flanagan.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN M. FLANAGAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. FLANAGAN: 

Mr.  Chief Justice,  and may  it


please the Court:


In 

1988, 

Congress 

enacted 

the 

spousal


impoverishment protections of the Federal Medicaid Act, 42


U.S. Code  section 1396r-5,  to  accomplish two  competing


purposes. 

First,  Congress  sought  to  protect  spouses


living at home  from impoverishment when the  other spouse


is institutionalized  and requires long-term  nursing home


care.  Secondly,  Congress sought  to ensure that  married


couples seeking  medicaid bear a fair share of the cost of


such care.


This  case  concerns  whether  States  have  the


discretion to achieve those competing goals by taking into


account  at the  time medicaid  eligibility is  determined


available  income 

which  the  nursing  home 

spouse  is


permitted to use after eligibility  to support the at-home


spouse.

 When  the 

nursing  home  spouse 

applies  for


medicaid, section 1396r-5 permits  the community spouse to


retain  certain  income  and  resources  to meet  his  own


monthly  maintenance  needs. 

The  statute 

permits  an


increase in  the standard resource  allowance, however, if


the  at-home spouse can  show at  a fair hearing  that the


allowance will be inadequate to provide him with income at


the  State-protected level  once the  nursing home  spouse


qualifies for medicaid.


When making this determination, Wisconsin,  like


more than 30 other States,  first considers whether income


available  to  the at-home  spouse  from the  nursing home


spouse will be sufficient to ensure the protected level of


income once medicaid  eligibility occurs.  This  method of


determining  whether  to  increase or  to  substitute  the


standard  resource allowance  is  called the  income-first


rule.


QUESTION:  And what do the other States do?


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

The  remaining  States  use  a


methodology  called  resource first,  in  which they  look


first  to the  additional  resources  above  the  standard


resource  allowance. 

These  cases  only arise  where the


couple has resources above the standard allowance.


In this case --


QUESTION: 

It would be  very helpful to  me if,

right at this point, you  pointed the statutory -- pointed


out the statutory  provision that authorizes the  State to


transfer income at this stage.


MS. FLANAGAN:  The statutory provision, I think,


specifically is found in 42  U.S. Code 1396a(a)(17), which


deals 

with  State  standards  for  eligibility  and  the


Secretary's  authority to  set  standards for  determining


availability.


QUESTION:  Do  you have a handy reference in the


brief somewhere to the, where we can see that?


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

It's  in  the Attorney --

the


Solicitor  General's appendix  at --

the first  thing  in


their appendix is the codified statute, 30 -- 1396r-5, the


one we  are discussing  primarily, and --

no, I'm  sorry,


1396a is in -- the first thing in the Solicitor  General's


appendix.


QUESTION:  Page 1a?


MS. FLANAGAN:  Yes, and (a)(17) --


QUESTION:  That's 8a.


QUESTION:  8a?


QUESTION:  It looks like 7 --


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

Yes, Your  Honor,  it is. 

I'm


sorry.  It is correct.


QUESTION: 

Then where  in  number (17)  is the


language that you're answering Justice Stevens with?

 MS. FLANAGAN:  Okay,  a(a)(17) provides that the


Secretary shall include reasonable standards, and then you


skip the  one parenthetical,  for determining  eligibility


for and the  extent of medical assistance under  the State


plan, and then under (b),  provide for taking into account


only such income and resources as are -- as determined  in


accordance  with  standards  prescribed by  the  Secretary


available to the applicant or recipient, et cetera.


QUESTION: 

Well, and let  me ask you a question


on this point, if I may.  There is a section,  5(b)(1), r-


5(b)(1)  of section 1396  that says  that pre-eligibility,


none of the income of the community spouse shall be deemed


available to the institutionalized spouse, right?


MS. FLANAGAN:  That's right.


QUESTION: 

And  you're talking  now about  post


eligibility?


MS. 

FLANAGAN: 

We're 

talking 

about 

a


determination made at the point  of eligibility, but which


concerns income available post eligibility.


QUESTION:  Well, it says pre-eligibility none of


the  income  of  the  community  spouse  shall  be  deemed


available to the institutionalized spouse.


MS. FLANAGAN:  That's right.  That's right.


QUESTION: 

And  that  provision wouldn't  make


sense if income  of the  community spouse itself  included

income of the institutionalized spouse.


MS. FLANAGAN:  Well, I think, Your Honor, the --


QUESTION: 

Would  it? 

It  wouldn't  make any


sense?


MS. FLANAGAN: 

I  think you  have to  take into


account  that you're talking about income being calculated


at different points in the temporal spectrum for different


purposes.


QUESTION: 

Well,  you're --

you  seem  to  be


arguing  that  the phrase,  community  spouse's  income in


(c) --

in 

(e)(2)(c) 

includes 

income 

from 

the


institutionalized spouse --


MS. FLANAGAN:  I think --


QUESTION: 

--  

and  yet  it can't  under  that


section I read, I think. 

I don't understand how you  get


there.


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

No,  that  particular  section


(b)(1) refers only to prohibiting  income of the community


spouse from being deemed available to the nursing home --


QUESTION: 

Right, but Justice  O'Connor's point


is undoubtedly correct that income of the community spouse


there  means income of the community spouse alone, not any


attributed  income  from  the  institutionalized 

spouse,


right?  Isn't that right?  It  has to mean only the income


of the community spouse.

 MS. FLANAGAN:  I think you have to look at --


QUESTION:  In that section


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

--  

what's available  at  that


point.


QUESTION:  I understand. 

Do you have any other


section in  the act  in which  the phrase,  income of  the


community  spouse,  means  not  just  the  income  of  the


community  spouse  alone, but  also  income that  has been


attributed from the institutionalized spouse?


MS. FLANAGAN:  Under the definition of community


spouse, income  maintenance allowance, I  believe -- which


is under subsection (d)2(B) --


QUESTION:  (d)2 what?


MS. FLANAGAN:  (d)2(B), refers --


QUESTION: 

Can  you tell us  where in  the SG's


appendix that is?


QUESTION:  It's on 59a of your cert petition.


QUESTION:  18a?


QUESTION:  59a.


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

At  any  rate, that  particular


section refers  to monthly  income otherwise available  to


the community spouse, and the -- our position is that this


evidences a recognition of the  fact, as medicaid has long


recognized,  that  spouses  are  required to  support  one


another, and that this is a background rule.

 QUESTION:  Ms.  Flanagan, it might help  if -- I


think  one of  the main  features of this  legislation was


that  income  from the  community spouse  was never  to be


attributed  to  the  institutionalized  spouse,  but  vice


versa, there is no such prohibition.


MS. FLANAGAN:  That's right, and that's --


QUESTION:  None  of this makes sense  unless you


appreciate that that  was an  absolute prohibition. 

Now,


tell us where that is  in this statute, that says,  income


from the community spouse is  not to be attributed to  the


institutionalized spouse.


MS. FLANAGAN:  It's in subsection (b)(1), 1396r-


5(b)(1), and that was referred to --


QUESTION:  That was the section I read to you --


MS. FLANAGAN:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- in my question.


MS. FLANAGAN:  Yes.


QUESTION: 

Could  I  have 

an  answer  to  my


question? 

The section you just  referred me to  is still


not another  section other than the  one at issue  here in


which the simple  phrase, income of the  community spouse,


is used in a sense  that means the community spouse's  own


income plus any income attributed  to the community spouse


from the institutionalized spouse.

 You  say that that's  the way  it's used  in the


provision at  issue here.  My  question is, where  else in


the entire statute is it used in that fashion?


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

I  don't  believe 

it's  used


anywhere else. 

That's  why the  difficulty in  this case


arose, is to try to figure out what that means.


QUESTION:  Well, no, I  think that rather solves


the difficulty, frankly.


MS. FLANAGAN:  I --


QUESTION:  I would normally think that income of


the community spouse means income of the community spouse,


and you say  it means  no, the  community spouse's  income


plus  attributed income. I don't know anywhere else in the


statute that it's used in  that fashion, just in this  one


section  where you  say we should  interpret it  that way.


There are other  sections where it clearly  means only the


community spouse's income.


MS. FLANAGAN: 

With respect,  Your Honor,  the


medicaid statute  has long considered  available income as


part of  the income of the person to which it's referring,


and we --


QUESTION:  I  mean, where  it does that,  that's


all I'm asking  for.  If it's long done that, just give me


another section where income of the community spouse means


what you say it means here.  The phrase is used a lot, I'm

sure.


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

That particular  phrase is  not


used  frequently  in this  statute. 

That's  part  of the


problem.  It's only used --


QUESTION:  And isn't it  true that the situation


you're talking about we're deeming in the other direction,


where  they  deem  the  community 

spouse  income  to  be


attributable  to the  institutionalized  spouse, not  vice


versa?


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

Well,  Your 

Honor,  Justice


Stevens, the  background rule  which I  referred to  which


this Court clearly  articulated in  Gray Panthers case  is


that  spouses are expected to support one another.  That's


a two-way street.


QUESTION:  That was  for purposes of determining


how much of the community spouse's income should be deemed


to belong to the institutionalized spouse.


MS. FLANAGAN: 

That's right. 

I'm just  saying


that spousal support obligations are a two-way street, and


the Court clearly recognized that.


QUESTION: 

In this  case, we  have the  unusual


circumstance where  Congress sought to  provide additional


protection to the  community spouse  to reverse the  prior


deeming rule which  permitted States  to take income  from


the  community spouse and  require it  to be used  for the

cost of care.


In this  case,  in  the  spousal  impoverishment


provisions and  this provision  specifically, Congress  is


trying to protect the community spouse by making available


to  the 

at-home  spouse  income 

that  is  specifically


contemplated to be  made available as soon  as eligibility


occurs.


QUESTION: 

But it is clear, is it not, that the


resource-first  rule  gives  greater 

protection  to  the


community spouse than the income-first rule?


MS. FLANAGAN: 

The  result is  that it  permits


the -- in general it frequently permits the at-home spouse


to  retain a greater share of the couple's joint resources


than would be  the case  under the State-defined  standard


resource  allowance,  and  in 

that  sense,  yes,  that's


definitely correct.


QUESTION:  Ms. Flanagan, am  I right in thinking


that the,  neither the act we're talking about nor the SSI


actually define community spouse's income?


MS. FLANAGAN:  No, it doesn't.  That's the exact


problem  in this case. 

There  is no definition,  and our


position is  that community  spouse's income  means income


possessed by the community spouse,  income that the spouse


has a right to, and income that is available to the spouse


at the particular point when it's being considered.

 QUESTION: 

Was 

the  income-first 

rule  in


Wisconsin  adopted  by  the  legislature,  or by  a  State


agency?


MS. FLANAGAN: 

It  was initially  adopted as  a


matter of  policy by  the State  agency immediately  after


passage of  the statute. 

Then in  1993 the  legislature


amended  the  statute  to  have  an  express  income-first


requirement.


QUESTION:  So  then your State court, I take it,


under  prevailing  Wisconsin rules,  could not  ignore the


legislature's  determination  unless  it  found  that  the


Federal statute was unambiguous.


MS. FLANAGAN: 

That -- well, that is  what they


did,  yes,  Your  Honor. 

They interpreted  the  Federal


statute as  being unambiguous. 

They  concluded that  the


State law conflicted  with the plain terms  of the Federal


statute and therefore could not be enforced.


QUESTION: 

Ms.  Flanagan, as  I understand  it,


there's a  provision -- and  these have  been referred  to


this 

morning,  but  there's  a  provision  that  forbids


attribution 

from 

the 

community 

spouse 

to 

the


institutionalized  spouse,  period,  no  qualifications on


that.


MS. FLANAGAN:  During institutionalization.


QUESTION:  That's right, yes.

 There's  also a  provision which  recognizes the


possibility 

of 

transferring 

income 

from 

the


institutionalized  spouse  to the  community  spouse after


eligibility has been determined, but  does not require any


such transfer.  It simply in effect says how you do it, is


that basically correct?


MS. FLANAGAN:  It doesn't explicitly require the


transfer.  There are, however,  powerful incentives in the


statute to basically require them to do it.


QUESTION:  But it doesn't, that latter provision


doesn't  make 

any 

reference  to 

the  period 

before


eligibility,  and  I guess  my question  is, why  don't we


infer  some  kind  of  a  negative inference --

when  the


provision refers totally to  the post eligibility  period,


why don't we  find some negative  implication that it  was


not expected in the pre-eligibility period?


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

Well,  the  fact is  that  the


calculation that the  hearing officers ask to be made here


concerns the post eligibility period.  The question is, is


the at-home  spouse going to have sufficient income in the


post eligibility  period, or  does the resource  allowance


need to be jacked up  in order to provide that  additional


income, so in that context, the hearing officer is looking


at the  same period  of  time when  the standard  resource


allowance goes into  effect, the same period  of time when

QUESTION:  So basically the  answer is, the fair


hearing  has  got  to  take  place before  eligibility  is


determined,  and  that's  in  effect 

the  answer  to  my


question.


MS.  FLANAGAN:  That's right. If the calculation


is looking ahead, if there are no --


QUESTION:  Ms. -- I have one further question.


MS. FLANAGAN:  Okay.


QUESTION: 

And if  you can't give  me an answer


right  away, maybe you can when  you come back.  It's sort


of the flip side of  the question I asked earlier. 

Do --


can  you  give us  at  least some  other  portions of  the


statute where  income of  the institutionalized spouse  is


clearly used  to mean  the institutionalized  spouse's own


income 

plus --

plus 

income 

attributed 

to 

the


institutionalized spouse from the community spouse?


MS.  FLANAGAN:  Well,  that really doesn't arise


because  of subsection  (b)(1), which  expressly precludes


that.


QUESTION:  Okay.


QUESTION:  Thank you.


MS. FLANAGAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms.  Flanagan.  We'll hear


from you, Mr. Lamken.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


QUESTION: 

Mr. 

Lamken,  you've 

heard  the


questions, and it is difficult, looking at the text of the


statute,  to  figure out  what  supports the  petitioner's


view, although,  as I understand it, that is also the view


of the Federal Government here.  That income-first rule is


okay.


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  It's our --

Now, are there  proposed regulations


of HHS that  would allow either resource-first  or income-


first rules?


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  There's currently


a pending rulemaking before HHS, and the Secretary in  the


notice of  proposed rulemaking has determined  that States


should  be permitted to decide whether  to use the income-


first methodology or the resource-first --


QUESTION:  How far along is that  process?  When


is that going to be adopted?


MR.  LAMKEN: 

The  comment  period  closed  on


November 6. 

There's been a little bit of a delay because


there's  concern  that  many 

comments  might  have  been


quarantined in the  Brentwood facility. 

However, we  are


hoping the Secretary can proceed and complete that process

with all due speed.


QUESTION: 

Can  I  ask  what 

authority  the


Secretary has  to say that the statute is ambiguous, so it


can mean either one? 

We don't even let Federal  agencies


do that under Chevron. 

I mean, we didn't say  in Chevron


that a Federal agency can  either say that a bubble  means


this, or say that a  bubble means the other, willy  nilly.


We  said, since it  can mean  one or  the other,  we'll go


along with whichever one the Federal agency says it means,


but here  we  have a  Federal agency  that  says, we  have


ambiguous language, so hey, do whatever you like.  I mean,


it may  be ambiguous, but surely  it was intended  to mean


one thing  or the other. 

How can the Secretary  come off


just telling the  States, it's ambiguous, you  know, do it


either way, we don't care?


MR. LAMKEN:  Justice Scalia,  I think the answer


comes  in two parts. 

The first  is, one doesn't  have to


think that the  statute means two different things at once


in  order  to  accept  the  Secretary's view. 

Community


spouse's  income can  have  a meaning,  but  there may  be


different methodologies,  all of which are reasonable, for


determining and calculating what is the community spouse's


income.


In addition, this  Court has --

and the  States


have liberties  in order to  decide to choose  among those

reasonable methodologies, because under section 17 on page


8a  of our,  of  the appendix  to our  brief  they are  to


establish  reasonable  methodologies  consistent  with the


Secretary's regulations.


In addition --


QUESTION: 

You  could  say  that  about  every


ambiguity, 

I  mean, 

that  there 

are 

two  different


methodologies. 

You could have  said the same  thing with


Chevron. 

Now, could  the  Secretary in  Chevron have --


there 

are  two 

different  methodologies 

of  deciding


what's --

what  is  it, point  of  emission,  or -- point


source, yes, point source of emission.


MR. LAMKEN:  In fact, Justice Scalia, this Court


has upheld precisely that type of regulation issued by the


Secretary. 

In  a case called  Batterton v.  Francis, and


again in a case  called Lukar v. Reed, in which  you wrote


the opinion  for  the  Court,  when the  statute  did  not


clearly 

preclude 

one  methodology 

or 

another,  the


Secretary,  because  the  Secretary  has quasi-legislative


authority  to  set  standards  in  this  area,  may  adopt


standards that permit variations from State to State.


In Batterton v. Francis, it  was under AFDC, and


the question  is, what was  unemployment?  Did  it include


striking workers,  or did it not, and  the Secretary said,


States, you  may determine  that based  on your  own State

law.  In Lukar v. Reed, the question was whether or  not a


tort  judgment would  be considered  income or  resources.


The Secretary threw guidance  to all the States  that they


had the  option  of choosing  it  as income  or  resources


because both are reasonable.


This  Court  in Lukar  v.  Reed again  held that


decision, so in  this particular  area, where States  have


the principal  responsibility  of establishing  standards,


the Secretary may establish the boundaries, the reasonable


boundaries 

within 

which 

those 

standards 

may 

be


established, but  unless the, and so long as the standards


established  by  the  State are  not  contradicted  by the


statute, 

are  not 

contradicted 

by  the 

Secretary's


regulations, and are reasonable --


QUESTION:  But  Mr. Lamken, isn't this  a little


different, because  in this  statute, if  I understand  it


correctly, there  is express  statutory authorization  for


the resource-first method, whereas the income-first method


is drawn by inference from what you consider ambiguities?


MR.  LAMKEN: 

No, Your  Honor.  I  believe that


neither methodology is particularly compelled or expressly


authorized  by the statute. 

The statute  simply does not


speak to the issue of  whether when a spouse, a  community


spouse  is going to  have a  shortfall in income  you make


that up  first by paying additional money to the person in

the  nursing home so  that she  may support the  spouse at


home, which  is the  income-first methodology,  or whether


first you raise the resource allowance  so that she may --


so  that the  person at  home  has additional  income from


resources.


I think  I should  probably go  back and  answer


Justice O'Connor's and Justice Scalia's question about the


meaning of  community spouse's  income in  section (b)(1),


because  there has  been  a  suggestion about  necessarily


includes only the  income paid  directly to the  community


spouse. 

It is in our  view a subtle legal tradition that


the community spouse's income, or  one spouse's income may


include  income from another  spouse that is  deemed to be


income of the  community spouse  in contemplation of  law,


and so in  (b)(1) community spouse's income  could include


income 

from  the 

institutionalized  spouse 

that  the


institutionalized  spouse  can  make  available. 

That's


consistent  with the presumption  of spousal  support, and


it's  consistent with,  for example,  existing regulations


such as those in --


QUESTION:  Would you go over  that a little more


slowly for me?


MR. LAMKEN:  I'm -- I apologize.


QUESTION:  How do you read (b)(1) --


MR. LAMKEN:  (b)(1) says --

to cover reverse deeming  as well


as deeming?


MR. LAMKEN: 

Right.  All it says is that income


of  the community spouse  shall be -- shall  not be deemed


available to the institutionalized spouse.


QUESTION:  Correct.


MR. LAMKEN:  The inference to be drawn from that


is that there is no  prohibition in deeming income of  the


institutionalized spouse --


QUESTION:  But  even if there's no  prohibition,


where is your authorization for doing this?  That's what I


don't find in the statute.


MR. LAMKEN:  Your Honor, it was -- it's a --


QUESTION:  If  you start from a  background rule


with the name  on the check as  a background rule  for the


whole SSI  program, how can  you change that  rule without


authorization?


MR. LAMKEN:  That's the mistake, Justice --


QUESTION:  Pardon me?


MR.  LAMKEN: 

That's  the 

mistake,  Justice


Stevens. 

You don't  start with  the presumption  of the


name-on-the-check rule. 

You  start from  the presumption


that the  income of one spouse may be deemed the income of


another spouse because  the general  rule is that  spouses


may be expected to support --

 QUESTION: 

Where in  the  statute does  it say


that?


MR. LAMKEN: 

The statute  doesn't but  Congress


said it  when it  enacted the  Medicaid Act  in the  first


instance,  and  that was  the  established rule  under the


Secretary's policies  at the  time that  this statute  was


enacted.  If you look  at the Secretary's regulations that


existed when Congress enacted this, it said the income --


QUESTION: 

That 

was  deeming,  not 

reverse


deeming.


deeming.


MR. LAMKEN:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION: 

That 

was  deeming,  not 

reverse


MR. LAMKEN: 

No, Your Honor. 

In fact, deeming


did occur --

reverse deeming  did occur,  or could  occur


under the  prior policies, particularly in  section 209(b)


States. 

Now, in most situations --

well, first for post


eligibility determinations, States did set aside a certain


amount of  money of the  institutionalized spouse's income


for the  support of the community spouse, and they treated


that money as  unavailable to  the spouse  in the  nursing


home so that it could be available to the  spouse at home.


That  is  this  situation which  you  have  called reverse


deeming.


Second, 

even 

at 

the 

eligibility 

stage,

particularly  in  section  209(b) 

States,  it  would  be


permissible to  deem the  income of  the institutionalized


spouse to be income of the community spouse.


Now,  it might not  often come up,  but it would


come up when, for example,  both were applicants, in which


case that would be permissible,  so the settled background


principle that existed at the  time Congress acted is that


spouses  support 

each  other 

mutually,  and 

Congress


eliminated one of  those presumptions  on a going  forward


basis  in  (b)(1)  and said,  no,  the  community spouse's


income shall not be deemed available  to institutionalized


spouses, but left  in place the background  principle that


an institutionalized spouse,  if they have the  funds, can


support the spouse --


QUESTION: 

You 

can  leave  that 

background


principle in  place, and we can  all concede that  it's in


place, without thereby coming to the belief that  when you


say income of  the community spouse,  you mean, income  of


the community spouse plus whatever is deemed  attributable


to the community spouse.


I mean,  I don't  contest the  principle, but 


I 

don't -- that's just not a reasonable way to use language.


I agree it can be  deemed, but you should say --

it would


have been very easy to say, income of the community spouse


including any attributed income.

 MR.  LAMKEN: 

Your  Honor,  it  would  be  the


Secretary's --

or the  regulations that  existed at  this


time, when they discussed what we count as your income, as


your applicant  for SSI, for example, it said, we count as


your income your income plus  income from other people, so


that it treated it as the individual's income, and that is


consistent  with 

the  background  principle 

that  each


spouse's income  is income to  the other spouse,  and when


States may establish reasonable standards --


QUESTION:  I'm  sorry, what did it  mean, income


from other people?


MR. LAMKEN:  The --


QUESTION:  Money given you by your children on a


regular basis, and things of that sort?


MR. LAMKEN: 

Well, actually attributed  income,


Justice Scalia, actual income that's passed over you don't


need a deeming rule, because that's actually --


QUESTION:  Right.  Right.  Right, you don't mean


that.


MR.  LAMKEN: 

But  for responsible  individuals


there were categories,  such as spouses, such  as parents,


such  as -- there is another category I can't remember the


name of,  but where  somebody had  the responsibility  for


supporting you, their income was deemed to be your  income


for determining your eligibility.

 QUESTION: 

But I  take it  the only  thing that


you've got express in the record anywhere to indicate that


really is  what Congress had in  mind is the  statement in


the  legislative history that is quoted in the briefs that


refers to other income attributed, is that right? 

That's


the only thing in black and white.


MR. LAMKEN:  That is the only thing in black and


white, other  than the  fact that  the settled  background


principles  the  Secretary 

operated  under  before 

the


enactment  would  treat  the  income 

of  one  spouse  as


available to  the other.  It  was not merely  deeming from


the to  community spouse to  the institutionalized spouse,


but deeming in the other direction occurred.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Lamken.


Mr. Hagopian, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MITCHELL HAGOPIAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


QUESTION: 

Counsel, would  you mind  telling us


why it matters which rule is followed by a State, resource


first or income first, not just in an individual case, but


overall?  Who saves  what in terms of money if  you do one


thing or the other?


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Yes, Justice O'Connor.  Under the


resource-first rule the applicant, the community spouse of


the applicant,  of  the institutionalized  spouse, is  the

person who gets the money,  and they get the money  in the


form of  an expanded  community spouse  resource allowance


that then generates income that  brings the monthly -- the


community spouse's  actual income up to or as close to the


monthly need amount that's set by the State.


Under income  first, the  income is  fictionally


imputed from the institutionalized spouse to the community


spouse,  but  it  doesn't  actually  go to  the  community


spouse. 

That 

would  not 

ever  happen  until 

after


eligibility had actually been determined.


So  in the  aggregate,  the resource-first  rule


allows  community  spouses  who  would  not  adequately be


protected  by 

the  formula  community 

spouse  resource


allowance, because that does not generate income up to the


monthly need amount and because they have no other income,


or not enough  income to bring them  up to that level,  it


allows them to actually have  resources that will generate


that 

income 

and 

protect 

them 

even 

after 

the


institutionalized spouse passes away.


QUESTION: 

Doesn't it  also  make possible  the


payments, the actual payments start earlier? 

I mean, the


reason 

this 

was 

of 

such 

concern  is 

that 

the


institutionalized spouse would not be eligible monthly for


checks,  so that  the immediate effect  was she  could pay


down more rapidly what was her excess resources before she

qualified. 

Isn't that the primary effect?  It's that the


payments under medicaid start earlier?


MR.  HAGOPIAN: 

Yes. 

If I  understand  your


question  correctly,  Justice  Ginsburg,  the income-first


rule requires  that those assets be  spent down. 

Is that


the answer to your question?


QUESTION: 

Yes,  so that --

Justice  O'Connor


asked you what the effect of --


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And I think  the immediate effect of,


she starts  to collect medicaid sooner and doesn't use the


spousal resources.


MR. 

HAGOPIAN: 

Oh,  now  I  understand  your


question.  No, that's not  true.  Under income first,  the


institutionalized spouse  does not become eligible. 

Only


under  resource first  does  the institutionalized  spouse


become eligible, and  then that  allows the payments  post


eligibility to actually occur to the community spouse.


QUESTION:  Maybe  I am not making  myself clear.


I thought the principle of that is to the couple, of using


your  resource rather  than the  income  first -- resource


first, is that the institutionalized  spouse, it pays down


quicker,  and is  therefore  eligible  for medicaid  money


sooner. 

That's what your position achieves,  is that not


so?

 MR. HAGOPIAN:  Yes, that's correct.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But doesn't that assume your case and


not  the more typical  case, the more  typical case, given


statistical projections, is  that the husband will  be the


institutionalized person, and  so in  the typical case  it


will not work to the advantage of the couple?


MR. HAGOPIAN: 

Well,  I would  agree with  you,


Justice Kennedy,  that the  typical case  is statistically


that is the husband that goes into the nursing home first,


and we  don't have that  case here today, but  I believe I


disagree with you as to  the effect that this has. 

First


of  all the sex of the spouses doesn't necessarily matter,


as is indicated  by this case. 

It's possible for  a male


spouse to be  the community spouse  and have exactly  what


happened here happen.


QUESTION:  Mr. --

I'm sorry.  Are  you finished


with that?  I didn't want to cut off your answer.


MR. HAGOPIAN: 

I  don't think  I answered  your


question, Justice Kennedy.


But  the  institutionalized  spouse,  if  it  is


the -- are you asking me whether, if the institutionalized


spouse has a higher income,  that what happened here won't


happen?  Is that the question, or --


QUESTION: 

Yes. 

I  assume in  many cases  the

husband is the first to be hospitalized, and he is the one


with the greater income.


MR. HAGOPIAN:  That's correct,  so in many cases


the income  first rule will have  a worse effect  when the


husband is the one that goes in first.  Because his income


will  be higher, there  will be  more income that  will be


attributed to the community spouse in this pre-eligibility


determination,  and  that  will prevent  her  from  having


income of  her own  that would  raise her  to the  minimum


monthly needs allowance. 

If  resource-first was used  in


that case, she would be  able to retain assets that  would


generate actual income to her that  would meet the monthly


need allowance.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hagopian --


QUESTION: 

Well, if  States cannot  follow this


income-first  rule,  maybe  they  would  just  respond  by


reducing the  minimum monthly maintenance  needs allowance


and adjust it that way.


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Yes.


QUESTION: 

Or  adjust  downward  the  resources


protectable for the community spouse.


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Yes.  Yes, Justice O'Connor, that


could  happen. 

That  is  where  the flexibility  in  the


spousal impoverishment provisions exists for the States.


QUESTION: 

How  many States  are  using  income

first?


MR.  HAGOPIAN: 

We 

don't 

exactly 

know.


According, I believe, to the petition, the State estimated


that it's in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 States.


QUESTION:  Of  course, I suppose a  really hard-


nosed State could  do both, right,  could use the  income-


first rule plus  adjust downward the other --

I mean, the


two don't go with each other.


MR. HAGOPIAN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  You either adjust downward or use the


income first.


I have  this question. 

You  maintain that  the


statute is not ambiguous, if they --


MR. HAGOPIAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION: 

-- do  it this  way. 

What is  your


burden if it  is ambiguous? 

If it  is ambiguous, do  you


lose, do you acknowledge that you lose?


MR.  HAGOPIAN: 

Oh,  absolutely  not,  Justice


Scalia.


QUESTION: 

Do you think the ambiguity has to be


resolved, or can  the Secretary  just leave the  ambiguity


floating out there?


MR.  HAGOPIAN: 

Well,  that's essentially  what


they've decided to do in the proposed rule --


QUESTION:  Right.

 MR. HAGOPIAN: 

-- is to  leave it floating. 

I


don't think that's the proper method to do it.


QUESTION:  By proper, you mean lawful?


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Lawful, that's correct.


QUESTION:  They are not permitted to do that?


MR. HAGOPIAN:  That's right.  I agree, actually,


with  the  way you  framed  it in  your  questions to  the


petitioner,  and that  is  that it  just  is illogical  to


assume that  Congress, when  they enacted  this particular


protection, which we believe is a fail-safe protection for


those few couples who would not adequately be protected by


the formula  resource allowance,  that to  have these  two


wildly  divergent interpretations  spring  from the  exact


same language seems totally unreasonable.


QUESTION:  Well, what did it do with a case like


Batterton v. Francis, then?


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Well, Your  Honor, I believe that


in a case like Batterton  v. Francis, we have a  different


set of rules  here.  First of  all, I believe that  was an


AFDC case.


QUESTION:  Well,  but you  know, it's still  the


general same ball park.


MR.  HAGOPIAN: 

Well, 

we  believe  that  the


enactment in the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of the


no-more-restrictive  rule under  SSI  resolved that  whole

issue  for us, and  that is  that with 1396a(r),  which is


found at the appendix to  our brief -- it's the only  page


in the appendix -- that the  question is actually resolved


by the application of the SSI methodologies.


QUESTION: 

Well,  you  say  the  question 

is


resolved.  Do you mean by that that the Secretary does not


have any  discretion to  decide that  a State  is free  to


follow either (a) or (b)?


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And how does that follow?


MR. HAGOPIAN: 

Well, there's  a  couple  of --


first of all, the authority that  the Secretary has relied


on  to issue its  proposed rule and  apparently from which


its 

authority 

to 

develop 

the 

rule  at 

all 

is


1396a(a)(17)(B).


Now, it  is our position initially  that that --


that 1396a(a)(17) was actually superseded  by operation of


1396r-5(a)(1).


QUESTION: 

This is  very difficult  to take  in


aurally.


MR. HAGOPIAN:  I believe that.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  But go ahead anyway.


(Laughter.)


MR. HAGOPIAN: 

It's almost as difficult  to say

it.


But  the spousal impoverishment  provisions, one


of  the  main  things  that  they did  was  supersede  the


authority that the State and the United States have relied


upon  to issue the  rule and  to engage in  this so-called


reverse deeming,  so -- and  at  the same  time that  they


superseded that rule, they also enacted 1396a(r).


Now, this rule --

what this rule did,  and this


rule was actually -- I want to back up.  Another provision


of the spousal impoverishment enactment was 1396r-5(1)(C),


and this provision retained the  SSI methodologies, or any


existing 

methodologies 

that 

were 

not  specifically


overridden by the spousal impoverishment enactments.


Now, the one  thing that  was left untouched  by


these spousal  impoverishment provisions was the  way that


income was determined for eligibility purposes.  Now, that


brings us to 1396a(r), and that provision is the provision


of the Medicaid  Act mandates  that the SSI  methodologies


apply to income  and resource  determinations for all  the


eligibility groups that were relevant  in these cases, and


that  statute does allow  States and  HCFA, or CMS  or the


Secretary  to  issue  rules that  deviate  from  those SSI


methodologies, but those  rules, if they're going  to do a


rule that deviates from that methodology, the rule has  to


have  the  effect  of  making  more  people  eligible  for

medicaid, not  fewer people,  and this  rule, the  income-


first rule, fails that test.


What  it  does  is --

because 

under  the  SSI


program,  if the SSI  methodologies were strictly applied,


the income  of the two spouses  is separated and  is never


commingled,  and  so  because  under  SSI this  would  not


happen, a  rule which allows it  to happen in  medicaid is


considered to be no more restrictive and not -- I'm sorry,


more restrictive than  the SSI  methodologies, and is  not


permitted by that statute.


QUESTION: 

May I ask you  a question?  I know a


case  is  easier  if you  don't  look  at the  legislative


history, and so it's probably easier for my colleague than


for me.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  But  would you explain to  me how you


interpret the parenthetical  phrase that's quoted on  page


18 of the  Government's brief, and  the -- it says  taking


into  account 

any  other  income 

attributable  to  the


community  spouse. 

I  find  that  kind  of  a  puzzling


parenthetical.  How do you read that?


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Well, I've two responses to that,


Justice Stevens.  First, within the spousal impoverishment


enactment, the term, attribute, or attributable is used in


two different fashions.  When  it's used in -- to describe


34

25

resources, it has the effect  of commingling the resources


and pooling them. 

When it's used in conjunction with the


term, income, it has  the effect of separating  the income


between the two spouses.


So  it's 

my  initial 

position  that 

income


attributable  to the other -- other income attributable to


the community spouse  merely confirms the way  it was done


SSI statutes,  and that is consistent  with the way  it is


done, where  income is talked about at all, in the spousal


impoverishment provisions, and I think there is actually a


reason for that  to be in there, and that is that it would


be  possible  in  some cases  for  a  community spouse  to


attempt to get  an expanded  resource allowance by  coming


into the hearing and saying, I have income, and it's in my


name right now.


Typical  would be,  maybe it's  from employment,


and at this date when I'm trying to establish eligibility,


or my  institutionalized  spouse is  trying  to  establish


eligibility, I have that income,  but I don't believe  you


should count that income to  me because it's going to  end


next month when my job ends.


So I think that is what they were talking about,


trying to  foreclose that type  of argument at  a hearing,


and 

so  I 

believe  that  the 

real  effect 

of  that


parenthetical phrase is to confirm the  separate treatment

of  the income. 

The reason  it isn't in  the statute and


it's in the legislative history is because the SSI mandate


under  1396(a)(R)  accomplished  that  purpose  precisely.


Every  other part of  that legislative history essentially


becomes 1396r-5(e)(2)(C).  That phrase is missing.


QUESTION: 

In  that  particular provision,  to


retain an adequate amount of resources, all that any other


income attributable to  the community spouse need  mean is


income  attributable  to  him 

from  sources  other  than


interest on  his  resources. 

I mean,  that phrase  could


include his actual wages, couldn't it?


MR. HAGOPIAN: 

The institutionalized  spouse's


wages, or the --


QUESTION:  The community spouse's wages.


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Oh, yes, absolutely.  It would --


I think it does.


QUESTION:  I mean --

QUESTION: 

--   

resource  allowance 

is  the


resources  that  provide income,  which  means, you  know,


stocks or  whatever, and all that phrase there may mean is


something,  any  other  income attributable  to  him  from


something other than his stocks.


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Right.


QUESTION:  Such as his wages, right?

 MR. HAGOPIAN:  Exactly.


QUESTION: 

You --

your argument  in the  event


that we  find ambiguity I guess  boils down simply  to the


fact that  for a variety of reasons it would frustrate the


congressional  policy  behind the  act  itself if  we held


against  you, and yet  in a  way, haven't you  provided an


answer to  that, a counter to that argument in your answer


to the question a few moments ago?


You said, and I think  have to say, that if  the


States  lose on the  particular issue before  us here, the


States  as a practical matter can  get to the same kind of


rough dollar  and sense  results simply  by adjusting  the


amount of resources,  that is the baseline amount  for the


community spouse to retain and  the amount of income which


is  thought to  be necessary for  the community  spouse to


live decently,  so it  almost seems  as though  it doesn't


very  much  matter,  necessarily,  to 

the  enactment  of


whatever  policy  Congress  had,  whether the  flexibility


comes in income versus resource first, or whether it comes


in setting the allowances  for income and assets. 

What's


your answer to that?


MR.  HAGOPIAN:  Well, I think that the answer to


that is that the resource-first allowance,  resource-first


rule was  placed in a provision  that is what we  call the


fail  safe  provision. 

This  was  a provision  that  was

supposed to  be  applicable to  all the  States and  allow


those few couples -- and I want to stress that this is not


going to affect a lot of people.


A few couples would not be  adequately protected


by those formula allowances, and  so -- because the policy


of the statute was to defeat spousal impoverishment.  That


was certainly one  of the primary purposes  behind it, and


the vast majority of cases  the formula resource allowance


was going to adequately serve that interest, but in --


QUESTION:  So you're saying  this is kind of  an


exceptional case kind of mechanism,  regardless of how you


set income and resources.


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  And as an exceptional case mechanism,


it's only going to work if it works the way you say,  on a


resource-first basis?


MR. HAGOPIAN: 

That's right, and to  stress the


exceptional case component of it, you have to remember how


you get  one  of these  hearings. 

This  is not  an  easy


matter. This is  not something that s accomplished  by the


local agency for every single  applicant who walks through


the door. You have to have - know that you re in  excess -


have  resources  in  excess 

of  this  formula  resource


allowance. You have  to go to  your local welfare  office.


You  have  to 

apply  for  benefits  knowing 

that  your

application is  going to be denied. 

You get  denied, and


then  you have to  request a  hearing, go to  the hearing,


prove  up  the 

need  with  all  sorts 

of  mathematical


calculations for this.


This is  not something that  people -- the faint


of heart are  going to be  doing on purpose,  so it is  an


exceptional procedure.


QUESTION: 

Have  you read  the  notice  of the


proposed rulemaking?


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Yes, I have, Justice Ginsburg.


QUESTION:  And I suppose your argument is to the


effect that  that's just not  a permissible interpretation


of the statute?


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Yes, that's  certainly one of our


arguments against  it.  We also believe,  though, that the


statutory  authority  that  the  Secretary  is  using  for


promulgating  it, 

which  is  1396a(a)(17)(B) 

has  been


superseded  in spousal impoverishment,  so the rule itself


is probably promulgated pursuant to invalid authority.


QUESTION:  Do we owe any deference to the agency


here in its interpretation?


MR.  HAGOPIAN: 

Well, because  our position  is


that the position they are taking is totally unreasonable,


no, you don't owe any deference to the agency.


QUESTION:  Does the income-first rule  mean that

at  the end  of the  day less  Federal  money is  spent on


medicaid care?


MR.  HAGOPIAN: 

Not  necessarily. 

In 

the


immediate -- the effect of denying an application based on


income first  would at  that moment  prevent someone  from


being eligible for medicaid, but -- and so therefore would


save Federal dollars, no question about that, but you have


to remember that the resources that the couple is required


to  spend  in 

order  to  become  eligible, 

there's  no


requirement that those  resources be spent on  the nursing


home, and so it's  possible that those resources could  be


spent for some  other purpose, and  then the person  could


immediately become eligible for medicaid, you know, within


a short time after the initial application was denied.


And  the important  thing  about  that point  is


that, if  that happens, if  those resources are  gone, and


the  income that's generated from them  is gone, then when


you get to the post eligibility determination, the less of


the institutionalized spouse's income is  going to be able


to  be used to  defray the  cost to the  medicaid program,


because more of it is going to have to be used to increase


the allowance to the institu --

or, the community spouse,


so  in  the short  run  it  may  be --

save  the  Federal


Government.  In the long run, it does not.

questions I asked Mr. Lamken,  whether the background rule


is  the name-on-the-check  rule,  or as  he  puts it,  the


better view  is the background rule is one of deeming, and


so that we should start from the premise that it's okay to


treat one spouse's income as part of the other spouse.


MR. HAGOPIAN: 

Well, I beg  to differ with  Mr.


Lamken's presentation  of the  background rule. 

I  don't


believe  that  there  is  any  precedent for  the  reverse


deeming  that he's talking about  in any of the background


rules.  The deeming that  was permitted was strictly  from


the nonapplicant spouse  to the  applicant spouse, and  it


was for the purpose of denying that person eligibility.


The one  rule he  talked about  where there  was


some  reverse  deeming 

was,  was  also --

was 

a  post


eligibility  rule. 

Under the  old  rules  pre-MCCA, the


nursing home spouse could allocate a small amount of money


to the community spouse, usually just enough to bring that


community spouse above the local welfare threshold so that


they wouldn't have to support that person  on welfare, but


that  was a  post  eligibility  deeming,  it  was  not  an


eligibility, and in the  SSI program, which is  what -- we


believe  where the  methodologies occur  that dictate  how


income is to be determined,  there is no deeming from  the


applicant spouse back to the nonapplicant spouse.


QUESTION:  Well,  even under this program,  as I

understand  it,  in  the  post  eligibility  determination


income  can  be  transferred  from  the  institutionalized


spouse to the community spouse.


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I  might ask one question. 

Examples


help  a lot for me in these  cases.  I couldn't understand


them without them, and the amicus briefs were  filled with


them,  which  was helpful,  but  the example  I'm carrying


around in  my head  is that we  have, say,  a woman  in an


institution who has about $200,000  or $300,000 in assets,


and maybe  a small pension of  $8,000 or $10,000,  and her


husband's at home, and he  has a pension coming in,  maybe


of $10,000 to $12,000, and so he's lacking about $6,000 or


$7,000 or  $8,000 or $9,000 or $10,000 to bring himself up


to the $24,000 level.


Now, if you're  right, what  we'll do is,  we'll


take the  $300,000 the  wife has,  and we  give it to  the


husband. 

It  generates about,  I  don't  know, $10,000,


$12,000,  and  eventually 

that  $300,000  goes 

to  the


children, and if you're  right, she doesn't have  to spend


it down,  and if you're  wrong, by the way,  if that money


goes to  the husband, later on, when her pension comes in,


and there's  about 8 or $10,000 coming in, that money goes


right to the institution to pay for the health care. 

She

doesn't get to keep it.  So that's one way.


Now,  the  other way  is  that she  keeps -- she


spends down  the  $300,000. 

She has  to  spend down  the


$300,000, maybe that money goes  to the institution, maybe


it goes to  fix the roof, but  then when the income  comes


in, it goes right to the husband.


So I  don't know, you know, I mean, it's sort of


what -- the Government seems to think that it's better off


financially  by making  her spend  the money  down,  but I


guess  that depends on  whether the alternative  is to pay


the $300,000  to the doctors  or pay  it to  get the  roof


fixed, so when I end up thinking that, I haven't a clue.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  And so therefore  I'd say, well, if I


were writing this  statute, I guess I'd leave it up to the


Secretary, and  if the Secretary wants  to leave it  up to


the  States,  that's  his  business,  so  I  look  at  the


language, and the  language there seems  not to solve  the


problem, and -- okay, what's the response?


(Laughter.)


MR. HAGOPIAN:  That was a question?


QUESTION:  I was putting the thing because --


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Yes, I --


QUESTION: 

-- I  want you  to see  that at  the


moment I  think,  well, I  can't figure  it  out, but  I'm

working  with those examples,  and since  I can't,  I say,


leave it  up to  the Secretary,  leave it  up to  a State,


leave it  up  to somebody  else, as  long  as the  statute


allows that.


I wanted to  expose that to you,  because I want


you to have a chance to say no, you're wrong, your example


is wrong, your reasoning's  wrong, everything's wrong,  so


go ahead.


(Laughter.)


MR. HAGOPIAN:  I concur with everything you just


said, Justice Breyer.


(Laughter.)


MR. HAGOPIAN: 

I think  your first example  was


the wrong one,  the one that  oddly enough is bad  for me,


and  that's  because  I  think  you're assuming  that  the


resources that are going to  be protected for the care  of


the  spouse will be transferred on  death to the children.


That's possible, but if the  community spouse outlives the


nursing  home  spouse,  that  resource  pool,  because for


whatever reason  there  isn't  an  independent  stream  of


income available to  that community spouse, it's  going to


be that resource  fund that creates the income  stream for


that community spouse.


If it's protected, and not have to be spent down


to medicaid  eligibility,  that community  spouse is  much

more likely to retain it,  not spend it on things  that he


doesn't need  in order to  preserve that income  stream so


that he  can take  care of  himself, hopefully,  not in  a


nursing home but perhaps in  some sort of noninstitutional


setting that he would prefer over that.


So that's my response to your question.


QUESTION:  You make a  big point of that. 

What


happens if you lose and the institutionalized spouse dies,


and  that is a problem. 

I don't  know why the Government


doesn't, as a matter of policy, make a pretty strong case,


but the -- I guess the  response will be, well, you  know,


everybody knows this.


Everybody, no matter  how well-educated or badly


educated, or -- they all know,  when they get that pension


choice, that  if you either take  it all for  yourself, or


you say,  when I  die I want  my spouse  to get  some, and


so -- they've all made that conscious choice, and  if they


make it to protect the spouse, that's up to them, and they


probably will. 

I mean,  that will  be  the response, 


I 

think, to that argument.


MR. HAGOPIAN:  It  would be.  The  problem, when


you -- my understanding -- I'm not a pension expert by any


means, but when  you exercise an option  that protects the


surviving spouse, you so deflate the value of the  pension


that it's economically a poor decision to make.

 QUESTION: 

I  would  have  thought  that  your


response  would be  the  statutory  language requires  the


result you're urging,  but you  don't make that  argument,


apparently.


MR.  HAGOPIAN: 

No,  no,  we  do 

make  that


argument --


QUESTION:  Oh, you do --


MR. HAGOPIAN:  -- Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR.  HAGOPIAN: 

Yes. 

The  statutory language


definitely does require --


QUESTION:  I  just didn't hear that  in response


to the question. 


(Laughter.)


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Well, it was in the opening  that


I didn't get a chance to make, so --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: 

In your  response to Justice Breyer,


isn't it so, or am I -- counsel, am I --


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Pardon me.


QUESTION:  -- wrong in thinking that under ERISA


there  is  a  requirement  to  provide for  the  surviving


spouse, it isn't the option of the insured individual?


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Well, I'm no expert on ERISA, but


I believe that there is  a notice requirement and a  sign-

off  requirement in ERISA. 

If the  community spouse does


sign  off  for  her rights,  then  it  doesn't necessarily


happen. 

It's not a mandated --

it can't be  overcome by


activity by the surviving spouse.


QUESTION: 

But it's not  the insured's election


in the first place.  Of course, if the surviving -- if the


spouse  wants  to 

cooperate  and  says,  I 

don't  want


anything --


MR. HAGOPIAN:  Right.


QUESTION: 

But  it  isn't 

the  wageearner's


choice --


MR. HAGOPIAN:  No.


QUESTION:  -- to say, I don't want, usually her,


to be any part of it.


MR. HAGOPIAN: 

That's right, but I  think those


decisions are  made at a time  when long-term care  is not


necessarily in the immediate offing,  and maybe -- usually


at  age 65 or thereabouts,  long before nursing home stays


may be inevitable, and so the couple is making an informed


choice about how best to maximize their income stream.


I mean, nobody is ready  for nursing home stays,


and to plan for that, you know, based at the time that you


make your pension  election would be counter  to, I think,


human nature.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hagopian, I  want to come back to

the snippet from  legislative history that is  referred to


on page  18 of  the Government's  brief. 

I guess  if you


believe that legislative history, then it would have to be


done the way the Government says it need only may be done.


I mean, if you believe  the Government's interpretation of


that legislative  history, it  certainly  doesn't say  the


Secretary has the option. 

It either says what you  think


it means,  or it requires the Secretary to use the income-


first method, no?


MR. HAGOPIAN:  I think I frankly agree with you,


Justice Scalia.


Thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Hagopian.


Ms. Flanagan, you have 3 minutes left.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN M. FLANAGAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS.  FLANAGAN:  Thank you, Your  Honor.  I would


like  to talk about the  impact of what the resource-first


rule is.  I think there have been questions on that.


The  impact  of the  resource-first  rule is  to


devote  limited medical  assistance funds  to  couples who


have resources substantially above the Federal maximum set


levels and that, in turn, necessarily means, since we have


limited pots of income, that that deprives States of money


needed to serve --

 QUESTION:  Why is that?  I mean, he just said on


that that -- and it certainly  was in the briefs, that  if


you say  they have to spend down the $300,000, they're not


going  to  give it  to  the  doctors  in the  institution.


They'll  fix  the  roof,  they'll  pay off  the  mortgage,


they'll figure  out one of 50  other things, so  the State


will actually end  up with less money,  because they won't


get that  $300,000 as a  set-off and, moreover,  they lose


the income coming in later as a set-off.


MS.  FLANAGAN: 

Well,  neither  of us  have any


statistics on that.  I'm sure that people do pay off their


long-term  financial obligations,  but  they also  have to


pay for  the nursing home, and  that bill doesn't  go away


every month, so if they're  not eligible, they're going to


have to be  providing for that in  some way, so  while the


statute doesn't force  them to  devote their resources  to


that, there are powerful practical  reasons why people are


going to do that.


Another part  of the impact  that I'm  concerned


about is  touched on by Mr. Hagopian, who says that States


can just lower  their resource  standards and lower  their


income maintenance standards. 

Well,  what that says  is,


States, you should  serve fewer people. 

You should serve


fewer elderly  so that  you can  have the  money to  serve


people who happen to have resources in excess, and in many

cases  substantially in  excess of  the standard  resource


limits.


The Cleary case,  which is cited in  the briefs,


is a  good example  of that kind  of potential  situation.


That was  a situation in which the nursing home spouse had


something in the neighborhood of a $1/4 million of  excess


resources, but because  of the income of  the -- set-up of


the spouses it would have taken that -- those resources to


make up that  income, even though that  particular spouse,


as I recall, also would have had money.

REHNQUIST: 

Thank 

you,  Ms.


Flanagan.  The case is submitted.
