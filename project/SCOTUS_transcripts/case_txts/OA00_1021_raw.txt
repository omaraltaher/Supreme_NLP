CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in Number 00-1021, Rush Prudential HMO,


Inc. v. Deborah C. Moran.


Mr. Roberts.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


ERISA preemption cases can be exceedingly


complicated, but our submission this morning is


straightforward.  This Court held in Pilot Life that


ERISA's civil enforcement provisions were the exclusive


remedy for improper processing of a claim for benefits


under an ERISA-regulated plan.  The Illinois independent


external review law at issue in this case affords a


different remedy for a beneficiary dissatisfied with an


HMO's denial of benefits.  The Illinois law is therefore


preempted.


Just last week, in Great West Life, this Court


began its analysis by noting that it was especially


reluctant to tamper with ERISA's enforcement scheme, and


by quoting prior precedent for the proposition that that


enforcement scheme indicated that Congress did not intend

to authorize other remedies that it forgot to incorporate


expressly.  That same language, quoted in Great West Life,


was quoted 15 years ago in Pilot Life.  ERISA's remedies


are exclusive, whether we're talking about additional


Federal remedies or additional State remedies.


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, could you help me with


one part of the facts I'm a little puzzled about?  Your


opponents argue there's a difference between the plan and


the HMO, and that he claims that you -- what you say would


apply to a suit against the plan, but this is a suit


against the HMO, and I have been unable to find the plan


in the papers.  Is the plan in the record?


MR. ROBERTS:  The respondent alleged in the


complaint, joint appendix page 32 and 38, that the


certificate of coverage was the plan, and that is in the


record.  It is Exhibit A to the complaint.


QUESTION:  The certificate of coverage -- who


are the parties to the certificate of coverage?


MR. ROBERTS:  The certificate of coverage is an


agreement between the HMO and the employer that extends to


particular employees the benefits that are set forth


there.


QUESTION:  And in your view, you say -- are they


just hooked by their allegation, or do you think it's


clear that that is the correct -- that is the plan?

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think they're first bound by


their allegation, but second of all, even if other


documents also contribute terms to the plan, certainly the


certificate of coverage indicates elements of the plan. 


There may be other documents that set forth other terms of


the plan.


QUESTION:  You see, they say that's an insurance


policy that is purchased by the plan, in effect. 


That's -- and that therefore there's a distinction between


the plan and the insurance policy, and I know you


disagree.  You say the HMO is not an insurance policy, but


is there -- explain to me why that's totally wrong.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, it's totally wrong because


the question is not how the State law operates to grant a


new remedy to a beneficiary.  We think it's irrelevant


whether it operates on the insurance policy or whether it


operates on the plan.  The point is, however it operates,


it provides beneficiaries, under an ERISA-regulated plan,


with a new remedy, and that remedy is one that's not


granted by Congress in ERISA, and the Court in Pilot Life


said only the remedies that are granted are available.


QUESTION:  Of course, one could also say it's


not really a new remedy, it's a new protection, sort of


like the -- see, the question is whether Pilot Life


controls or the Massachusetts case controls.  It's an

interesting -- whether it's something like a compelled


benefit or a compelled protection of some kind --


MR. ROBERTS:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- that the insurance company


provides.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, and I think the difference


is, between mandated benefits laws like Massachusetts,


those laws provide, as this Court said in UNUM, a rule of


decision that is to be applied by whoever the decision-


maker is in reviewing a denial of benefits.


Here, it's not a new rule of decision, it's a


new decision-maker, and that decision-maker isn't looking


to State law to say, well, they've given you mental health


coverage and so that has to be provided, he's deciding


what -- whether the denial of benefits was proper or not,


and that can only be characterized as a remedy, whether


it's --


QUESTION:  Well -- no, I didn't mean to


interrupt.


Isn't the problem that he's doing two things? 


The decision that he makes is necessarily going to have


its consequence on whether the benefit denial was correct


or not, but he's also making a medical kind of decision,


is, in fact, this reasonable medical practice, and so he's


not merely in the position which a court is in when a

court says, does the evidence show this is reasonable


medical practice.  He's in the decision of, in effect,


making a kind of practice decision which doctors, as


doctors, make, so it's somewhere in between.


MR. ROBERTS:  We don't think that's a correct


characterization.  There is no element of a treatment


component in this decision.  The only thing that is at


issue in this independent external review is coverage, for


a number of reasons.  First of all, the treatment had


already taken place.  There was no question of treatment. 


But coverage is all that Rush HMO has undertaken to


provide.  It does not provide health care.  It doesn't


provide -- it agrees to pay for health care.


QUESTION:  Well, this particular -- I'm assuming


in answer to your -- from your answer to Justice Stevens,


I'm assuming that in this case it is so, but their


argument is, you can have HMO's that have nothing to do


with ERISA plans, and you can have ERISA plans that don't


employ HMO's to provide welfare benefits, and therefore


it's appropriate to think of this as a medical decision or


as a regulation of medical practice in a particular form,


rather than insurance, so once again there's -- the


problem is that the facts do not place this in a clear


category.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I -- with respect, I think

the facts do place this in a very clear category, because


there's no question of treatment at issue.  Even if the


State is purporting to articulate its definition of


medical necessity, that's not the question.  The question


is, is this beneficiary entitled to benefits under this


plan, and the judgment about what is medically necessary


is something that is addressed in the plan.  The plan


provides the broadest possible discretion to the HMO to


interpret the plan terms, including medical necessity.


QUESTION:  Well, but what if the State law in


effect tinkered with how you interpret the plan, and


spelled out that in determining what's medically necessary


the plan will make use of an independent medical


consultant.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the State law can define


medical necessity.  I think that's just like a mandated


benefit, saying you have to --


QUESTION:  And can it not say, and furthermore,


if there's any dispute you will use an independent medical


consultant?


MR. ROBERTS:  That it cannot do consistent with


Pilot Life, because that is a remedy for a denial of


benefits, and Pilot Life indicated --


QUESTION:  Well, not necessarily.  It may be


more a definition in the plan, or a provision of the

insurance plan itself, and then that in turn is


enforceable under section 502.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, that's --


QUESTION:  I mean, that's the argument, and I


can understand that that, you could view it through that


lens, could you not?


MR. ROBERTS:  And I think, as Judge Posner


pointed out in his dissent, if you do that, then all bets


are off.  If you say that this is incorporated by State


law into your plan, and so when you enforce that remedy,


all you're doing is enforcing a term of the plan --


QUESTION:  Well, is that so surprising, in light


of the fact that the ERISA law itself excludes regulations


of insurance?  The law itself took that out of ERISA


coverage, in effect.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, now that was the specific


question addressed in Pilot Life.  That was -- the heavy


lifting in the Pilot Life opinion was reconciling the


exclusivity of the civil remedies and the Saving Clause. 


You can look at it one of two ways.  If you give the


Savings Clause full force, then the remedies aren't going


to be exclusive in a case involving an insurer.  If you


give the exclusivity of ERISA's remedies full force, then


the Savings Clause is relegated to a lower status, and --


QUESTION:  Well, we had a case, U-N-U-M v. Ward,

and held that any statute that effectively creates a


mandatory contract term and regulates only insurance


companies is an insurance law under the Savings Clause.


MR. ROBERTS:  UNUM did not involve a remedy.  It


said, the question under Pilot Life and 502 was, quote,


not implicated, because it wasn't a State remedy that they


were trying to save under the insurance Savings Clause. 


It was a rule of decision.  This is not a rule of


decision.  It's a different decision-maker, and if this


type of State law remedy is allowed, then there's nothing


left --


QUESTION:  But UNUM --


QUESTION:  But Mr. Roberts, can --


QUESTION:  -- wasn't a procedural ruling.  UNUM


was a question of how late could you file, and the State


law said you could file late, and --


MR. ROBERTS:  The law --


QUESTION:  -- why should that be treated


differently?  The State is making something timely, giving


the beneficiary a chance to collect that the plan itself


would not have given.


MR. ROBERTS:  I think that's correct.  I -- the


line is not -- and this is what UNUM taught.  The line is


not between substance and procedure when you're talking


about mandated coverage.  That's not the line we're

advocating.  The line we're advocating is between mandated


coverage, what does term, what does the plan have to


provide, and UNUM said, one thing it has to provide,


whatever the coverage is, coverage for those claims that


are filed in a timely manner, or, if not, that did not


prejudice the insurer.


This is different.  This is not a new term of


coverage.  It's a remedy.  If you don't like what the HMO


has done with your benefits claim, you get to go to a


State law, independent external reviewer, and get it


overturned, and --


QUESTION:  But it's a different kind of remedy


than saying, for example, punitive damages.  It's --


MR. ROBERTS:  It --


QUESTION:  And I thought that's what Pilot Life


was about.


MR. ROBERTS:  The argument is made that this is


okay because all you get are the benefits that you're


entitled to under the plan. We think that the Taylor


decision, decided the same day as Pilot Life, rejects that


argument.  It says that one of the claims in that case was


for the benefits due under the plan, not punitive damages,


not emotional distress, the plan benefits, and the Court


said, that's not only preemptive, that's completely


preemptive.

 ERISA preempts not only different remedies, but


alternative, additional remedies.


QUESTION:  Well, under your theory there could


be no private arbitration agreement by an HMO plan and


people covered by the plan?


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  I think that's certainly an


open question.  The issue there would be --


QUESTION:  I don't see how it's open under your


view.


MR. ROBERTS:  Arbitration -- it's the difference


between a voluntary agreement between parties, which is


what ERISA seeks to enforce, and something that's


compelled by State law.  The analogy that the Solicitor


General draws to the collective bargaining --


QUESTION:  But under your rationale, 502


controls. It's a remedy.  So how could a private agreement


to arbitrate survive under your theory?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, it would survive because it


would be regarded as an internal plan procedure, not --


QUESTION:  But wouldn't it also conflict --


wouldn't it also conflict with the statutory provision?


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  No.  I mean, the -- ERISA


allows internal remedies, appeals within the plan, and


again it's an open question, but we don't dispute that the


arbitration would be allowed.

 The problem with the analogy to the arbitration


cases is that the Solicitor General stops too early.  Yes,


you can have voluntary arbitration, even where remedies


are preempted, but surely a State law that directed that


parties to a collective bargaining agreement must


arbitrate, and here's how they must arbitrate, would be


preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act.


If you pursue the analogy to a situation that's


comparable to this case, the conclusion that there's


preemption seems to follow inexorably, and the idea that


everything is all right because at the end of the day you


have to enforce this in a section 502 action really makes


a hollow shell out of Pilot Life.  You have to sometimes


enforce arbitration in court, but we still think of


arbitration as a different remedy.  We don't say, that's a


judicial remedy because it has to be enforced.


QUESTION:  Yes, but there's another difference


with Pilot Life, and that, the only question is whether it


related to the insurance.  Here, you have -- you admit


it's related, but then you get onto the second ball game


of whether it's a change in the insurance coverage, and


one can look at this, I think -- I just need -- I want you


to comment on this -- as not changing a term of the plan,


but, rather, changing a term of the insurance policy


purchased by the plan.

 MR. ROBERTS:  And we actually go on to the third


game which is, if it conflicts with the substantive term


of ERISA, and this is what Pilot Life held, it is


preempted, and this conflicts with the exclusivity of the


remedies.


We don't believe, when you go through the usual


insurance Savings Clause factors, that this is the


regulation of insurance, but what Pilot Life held, and


this was the important part of the decision, which was


unanimous, is that when you look at the Savings Clause you


have to be informed by an understanding of what Congress


was trying to do with the exclusive remedies, that the


most important -- quote, most important consideration in


deciding whether that remedy in that case is covered by


the Savings Clause was that Congress said that all the


remedies were exclusive.  If you allow them back into this


back door of the Savings Clause, then that exclusivity is


going to be completely undermined.  That's the issue


that's here before the Court.


QUESTION:  That is -- I'd like to expand just a


little, because I'm actually trying to work out what's the


framework within which we think of this, and I had thought


that that part of Pilot Life was really part of the reason


for interpreting the Savings Clause as it was there


interpreted, that normally what you do is ask the first

question, is this preempted in the first place, and it is


if there's field preemption, if there's conflict


preemption, and maybe, with ERISA, if there's something


more, and ordinarily, if there is such a conflict, the


Federal side wins, but the whole point of the Savings


Clause is to say, if there's a conflict in respect to


insurance, the State wins.  Stop right there.


But then maybe Pilot Life adds something else,


which says, but it couldn't just say if there's a conflict


that brought you into preemption in the first place, well,


the Federal Government wins, because that would be to


eviscerate the meaning of the Savings Clause.  Now, that's


the framework in my mind, and I'd appreciate anything you


could help with that.


MR. ROBERTS:  And again, that poses sort of a


conflict between what the Court in Pilot Life said were


the exclusive remedies and the Savings Clause.  That is


what this Court unanimously decided 15 years ago in Pilot


Life when it said, when we look at the Savings Clause, the


most important thing -- most important thing -- is to keep


in mind the remedies are supposed to be exclusive, so that


if this is a remedy, it is a regulation of ERISA, it is


not the regulation of insurance, and the Court reaffirmed


that approach in the John Hancock case where it said, and


I'll just quote one sentence, no decision of this Court

has applied the Savings Clause to supersede the provision


in ERISA itself.


If you apply the Savings Clause to allow this


State law remedy to be applied, that would be superseding


what this Court said section 502 of ERISA meant in Pilot


Life, which was that these remedies are exclusive.  That


question was addressed.  That was -- and I'll say it


again, that was the hard part of the opinion in Pilot


Life, and that was reaffirmed in John Hancock, and --


QUESTION:  I see that.  Then I'd think what


you're saying, I take it, is at least where the conflict


is particularly severe, it's perhaps not -- the State


doesn't necessarily win, and you think this is a


particularly bad one.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I do think it's particularly


bad, but I don't think it has to be.  I think if the State


law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the


Federal objectives, it is preempted.  The Federal


objective requires exclusivity with respect to remedies. 


This obviously stands as an obstacle to that objective and


so is preempted.


Now, they say it's saved because the last stop


in this State law remedy is a quick dash into Federal


court to get a stamp that says, enforce.  The State law


says, if the reviewer says you've got to provide this, the

HMO has to provide it, and they say, well, that's okay,


because we run into Federal court, we make this a 502


action.


Well, that makes Pilot Life ridiculous, because


it says every type of remedy is okay so long as the last


stop is a quick visit to the Federal courthouse.  It also


raises very serious Article III concerns, because Federal


courts are not supposed to be looking at decisions made


by -- made under State law that they have no authority to


review and simply rubber-stamping them, and it gives rise


to the bizarre results that the respondent and the


Solicitor General support in this case that an action to


enforce section 4-10 is completely preempted so that


there's jurisdiction, but then it turns out section 4-10


is not preempted at all.  That's a very curious result,


but they have to maintain --


QUESTION:  What is section 4-10, Mr. Roberts?


MR. ROBERTS:  4-10 is the State law, of the


Illinois HMO act.  I've been referring to it as the


independent external review law.  But they have to


maintain that facade.


QUESTION:  Would you state the absurd positions


again?

QUESTION:  It didn't strike me as that absurd,

but --


MR. ROBERTS:  What is absurd is that they have


to maintain that this can only be enforced under a 502


action, that the State law claim -- keep in mind this


began, of course, as a State law claim in State court. 


502 wasn't mentioned at all.  It was recharacterized as a


502 action, they said because it's completely preempted,


but the underlying remedy that's being enforced isn't


preempted at all.


Now, those are two different questions,


jurisdiction and substance, but it does seem odd that if


you're going in and all you're doing is getting a rubber


stamp from the Federal courthouse saying, enforced, that


that's completely preempted, when the law isn't preempted


at all.


QUESTION:  Well, what they're -- it's not


absurd, in their view, anyway, because they're saying they


have a human being over here called an arbitrator and this


human being tells you what the benefit is, and what your


clients are really objecting to, frankly, is not this


remedy.  They couldn't care less.


What they're worried about is that that human


being called the arbitrator is going to say that this


woman has to have a certain treatment that otherwise in


their view she wouldn't have to have.  I mean, just

imagine the statute that said, instead of what it says,


that you have to provide medical treatment whenever


there's a 25-percent chance of improvement.  No arbitrator


at all in that one, and they'll be even more excited, and


indeed, it doesn't take away the Federal remedy in my


hypothetical, nor does it in this one.  It just turns out


that we know who's going to win.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, that's because there's a


different decision-maker making the decision on your claim


for the denial of benefits, and that's what makes it clear


that what's involved is a different remedy.


It's also a remedy that changes dramatically


what the plan actually provides, and it does that by


taking away from the plan fiduciary the deference that the


fiduciary --


QUESTION:  Is that fiduciary, a definition of


his powers of review and so forth, in the record anywhere?


MR. ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, the --


QUESTION:  The -- you two or three times refer


to the fact that the plan gives the fiduciary this


standard of review.  Is that in the record?


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  The only elements of the plan


that are in the record is the certificate of coverage,


which --


QUESTION:  So for all we know the plan might

actually say, whatever Illinois law requires the decision-


maker to do shall be done.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, that's what the law


provides.


QUESTION:  I mean, maybe the plan says that,


too, for all I know.


MR. ROBERTS:  No, because the elements of the


plan that are in the record, the certificate of coverage,


notes that the HMO has the broadest possible discretion to


interpret the terms of the plan in deciding coverage and,


under this Court's decision in Firestone --


QUESTION:  It says that in the certificate?


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, and -- pages 7 and pages 8. 


It's Exhibit A to the complaint -- and under this Court's


decision in Firestone, that means that that decision is


subject to a deferential review.


The State law changes that, and the State law


gives the decision to the independent external reviewer,


who makes his decision apparently de novo, so that the


precise thing that the plan participants, parties


contracted against, the recognition that this medical


necessity is a question of judgment, some people are going


to view it differently, we want to make clear that it's


our discretion that controls, and that gives us


entitlement to deferential review --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, some close to 40 States


have laws like this?


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And there's legislation introduced,


at least in Congress, to accomplish what?


MR. ROBERTS:  My understanding of many of the


pending bills is that they have an external review


provision but, of course, it's a Federal one, and that is


consistent with ERISA's goal of uniformity in claims


processing and administration.


QUESTION:  Do you know anything about the status


of that pending legislation?


MR. ROBERTS:  No.


QUESTION:  No.


MR. ROBERTS:  Other than at various times


passage is imminent, and then it falls apart, but again


it's a very different thing to say, this is the uniform


Federal remedy, and to have, as Your Honor points out, 40


different remedies, if you're running a company that has a


health care plan with operations in different States, the


health plan can't be uniformly --


QUESTION:  Are most of the State law provisions


similar to the one in Illinois?


MR. ROBERTS:  They all have differences.  For


example, in some States the independent external reviewer

is an administrative board.  In Michigan, it consists of


seven people in certain places.  In some places it's not


just one person, it's more than one person.  Some places


it consists of employee representatives as well as


physicians, but it does change what the parties contracted


for, and --


QUESTION:  Why is that a more disturbing change


than changes in what is the minimum required coverage?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I don't know that it's more


disturbing.  It's different, yes.  The impact on an HMO


can be greater if the State law says, you must provide


mental health coverage, this, this, and this, but then at


least the employer looking at it knows what's at stake,


and he knows that the remedy is going to be the remedy


that is provided under Federal law, which is that they're


going to enforce what I have agreed to provide under this


plan, even if what I've agreed to provide is compelled by


State law.


You know that you're not going to face all sorts


of different remedies and in particular, here, if you


contract for the broadest possible discretion, you know


that when the review is undertaken your fiduciary decision


will be reviewed with appropriate deference.  That is


taken away here.  It's taken away by giving the


independent external reviewer the authority to make a de

novo decision, so that what is set up are two very


different remediary regimes.


The Federal regime, the fiduciary makes a


decision with the broadest possible discretion.  His


obligation is to be faithful to the terms of the plan. 


That is reviewed in Federal court.


QUESTION:  But it's not the fiduciary's


decision, as I understand it.  It's the insurance policy's


decision.


MR. ROBERTS:  Or someone to whom that discretion


has been delegated under ERISA, and there's a provision in


ERISA that allows them to say, this is the entity that is


going to make the final decision.  Under 503, that is a


fiduciary decision, the final denial or grant of benefits. 


That's the Federal remedy.


The State remedy is, the independent external


reviewer makes his or her decision, and that decision is


binding and final.  Those are two very different remedies,


ERISA's remedies are supposed to be exclusive, and the


decision below undermining that exclusivity should be


reversed.


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, before you sit down,


would you just give me a moment of your views on whether


or not it's appropriate to regard the HMO as an insurance


company?

 MR. ROBERTS:  The HMO is properly regarded as an


insurance company when it is engaged in the business of


insurance.  Just because it's an insurance company doesn't


mean that all of its activities, including claims


processing, for example, are necessarily the business of


insurance.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Roberts.


Mr. Albers, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL P. ALBERS


MR. ALBERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Illinois section 4-10 is an insurance law that


does not conflict with ERISA section 502 or this Court's


decision in Pilot Life, and therefore it is enforceable to


protect the interests of Illinois Insureds like Deborah


Moran.


QUESTION:  Does the Illinois law provide for


review in Illinois State courts?


MR. ALBERS:  The Illinois law does not provide


one way or the other.  Section 4-10 does not say that. 


This case was reviewed and was enforced by the Seventh


Circuit as a 502 action.


QUESTION:  But the action was originally brought


in State court, was it not?


MR.ALBERS:  I originally brought the action in

State court to enforce the independent review because the


insurer was refusing to provide any independent review at


all, and the two parts of the statute, the requirement


that there be medical necessity, this review and then the


actual enforcement of the decision, were parsed at the


district court level and in the Seventh Circuit.  Judge


Conlon initially remanded the case after it was removed,


finding that the medical necessity portion of the statute


did not offend Pilot Life or section 502.


Back in State court, Judge Kinnaird in Chancery


found that medical necessity did not offend 502 and


ordered a medical necessity review.  The medical necessity


review determined that the procedure was medically


necessary.  It was then -- I then sought payment of the


benefit, and that was removed to Federal court and Judge


Conlon found that was a 502 action.


QUESTION:  If the Seventh Circuit view is upheld


by this Court, in the future would actions lie in State


court to enforce this, or just under 502?


MR. ALBERS:  I think consistent with the Court's


502 ruling in Pilot Life, it would be a 502 action to seek


benefits.  I think there's a different question with


respect to whether it was just the enforcement of the


statute which requires medical necessity.  I don't think


that then you're seeking the benefit, and I submit that it

was perfectly appropriate to send this case back to State


court for that determination and that ruling, but


ultimately, to get the benefit, I would suggest that that


would have to come under 502, under the Court's reasoning


in Pilot Life.


This case does not conflict with Pilot Life, as


petitioner suggests.  In addressing the conflict issue


which has been raised, which I think is central to the


decision the Court needs to make, I think the Court should


consider the burdens that petitioner must meet to show


that conflict.  ERISA preemption is a defense.


QUESTION:  Could the State provide for


liquidated damages, do you think --


MR. ALBERS:  You mean, damages other than the


benefit itself?


QUESTION:  -- under the reinsurance regulation


exception?


MR. ALBERS:  You mean, other than the benefit


itself, Your Honor?


QUESTION:  Uh-huh.


MR. ALBERS:  I would submit, under your -- the


Court's ruling which you wrote in Pilot Life, that it


would probably be inappropriate to go beyond the specific


damages that are permitted in ERISA, which is recovery of


the benefit, and I think then under the statute you're

permitted to recover interest and attorneys's fees, and


that is all Deborah Moran has ever sought in this case was


the benefit that she was entitled to under the Illinois


statute for what was determined to be a medically


necessary procedure, which also saved her right arm.


QUESTION:  How --


QUESTION:  That's true, but the question is, who


is to decide she has gotten what she was supposed to get,


and the claim here is that that was supposed to be decided


pursuant to one system of review, and the State has


substituted a totally different --


MR. ALBERS:  And under 514(b), the Savings


Clause, the State has the right to do that.  That does not


offend ERISA in any way.  Section 503 --


QUESTION:  Isn't that what Pilot Life was all


about?


MR. ALBERS:  Pilot Life did not talk about who


the decision-maker would be.  Pilot Life talked about the


enforcement of the benefit had to be in Federal court


under 502.  Pilot Life was a State common law cause of


action which was not an insurance law in bad faith and in


contract which sought compensatory and punitive damages


beyond the benefit.  The Court said, you can't do that,


because that offends 502 and, by the way, all --


QUESTION:  I see, so you think all it meant was

the last shot has to be in Federal court.


MR. ALBERS:  I think it --


QUESTION:  I assume the State could provide that


all of these contract claims would be first reviewed in


State court so long as it further provides that the


ultimate judgment of the State court would only be


enforceable by suit in Federal court.  Would that be okay?


MR. ALBERS:  I think that's -- if the State law


provided for a judicial review in State court, I think


that would offend 502.  The State law does not provide for


that.


QUESTION:  Arbitration is not another means of


review?  I mean, I --


MR. ALBERS:  No, I don't think arbitration is --


QUESTION:  You don't think you change the


remedy --


MR. ALBERS:  No.


QUESTION:  -- if you say the remedy is not a


lawsuit but arbitration?  I --


MR. ALBERS:  The remedy --


QUESTION:  I find that a startling proposition. 


Sure, arbitration has to be enforced in court, but I've


always thought that that's a separate remedy.  You ask,


what's your remedy, is it a lawsuit or arbitration?

 MR. ALBERS:  And this gets down to the issue of


what a remedy is, and I looked up remedy in Black's Law


Dictionary, and it has two elements.  It has the process,


some courts have found, and it also has the result of the


process, the enforcement, and I think in Pilot Life the


Court was talking about the enforcement, not the means of


reaching it.


QUESTION:  Okay, consistent with that, in a


shorthand kind of way we refer to this as an arbitration,


or as an arbitration decision.  Is the independent


reviewer acting really as an arbitrator in the classic


sense?  I'm assuming that an arbitrator in the classic


sense listens to evidence in arguments and decides which


of those evidence and arguments is the better according to


some legal standard.


I have assumed, contrast, that what the


independent review here is doing is not only listening to


other people, but making a medical judgment himself, as a


physician.  If the latter is true, then it doesn't seem to


me that it is a classic example of arbitration, but I may


be wrong on that, and I don't want to lead you in the


direction of an analysis that ultimately will not pan out. 


Am I right in distinguishing true arbitration from this,


or should we regard this as true arbitration imposed by


State law?

 MR. ALBERS:  I think this is not -- I think


you're right, and I think this is not true arbitration as


imposed by State law.  I think the Court found in Pegram


that medical necessity decisions contain both elements of


coverage determination and elements of a medical --


QUESTION:  What is --


QUESTION:  May I just ask one -- they did in


that case,  but my concern is, is that true here?  In


other words, what can you tell me about the terms under


which the reviewer acts that says this is, and in part at


least, or ultimately, an independent decision by the


reviewer about medical necessity as opposed to an


adjudication of which side has the better claim, which an


arbitrator might make?


MR. ALBERS:  The statute itself, 4-10, requires


an independent review by a physician in the relevant


specialty.  The statute doesn't provide any further


guidance with respect to how that review is going to be


done.  In this case, it was done de novo.  It was done by


supplying the relevant definition of medical necessity to


a reviewer from the insurance contract certificate, and


providing all the relevant medical records.


QUESTION:  Does it matter under Illinois, under


the Illinois law, whether there's an adequate treatment


that's less expensive?

 MR. ALBERS:  No.  It's de novo review by the


independent reviewer.


QUESTION:  And there's no element in it of


determining whether there's a slightly less effective


remedy, but with fewer risks and less costly?  That's


irrelevant?


MR. ALBERS:  The statute doesn't address that. 


I think that if that was a part of the definition of


medical necessity that was in the insurance contract


document, that would be relevant to the reviewer's


decision.


QUESTION:  It can be in the insurance contract,


those provisions?  It wouldn't conflict with Illinois law?


MR. ALBERS:  Illinois law does not define


medical necessity, and so for our analysis we've assumed


the only place that the reviewer could go would be to the


plan documents and the plan document here is -- there is


no plan document, but the relevant portion of the plan


document is the insurance contract which defined medical


necessity, and that's what the reviewer used, and that's


my understanding of what they intended.


QUESTION:  And how did they define it?  What was


the definition?


MR. ALBERS:  There were a variety of factors to


consider.  What are the available treatments?  Are they

accepted generally in the medical practice?


QUESTION:  But wouldn't the --


MR. ALBERS:  What are the risks?


QUESTION:  I mean, the word necessity sounds


like it means you have to have this, and if you had


something that would be equally effective and less


expensive, then it wouldn't be a medical necessity.  Is


this the general understanding of what necessity is, or --


you seemed to be saying earlier that it was something


different.


MR. ALBERS:  I'm not sure I understand.


QUESTION:  I thought that --


MR. ALBERS:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I'm trying


to --


QUESTION:  You asked whether, suppose -- I think


Justice O'Connor asked you, suppose there was effective


treatment that was less expensive, would this particular


treatment still be a medical necessity, and I thought you


answered yes to that question.


MR. ALBERS:  I think that's up to the judgment


of the independent reviewing physician.  He certainly can


take into account whether there's an equally efficacious


treatment available that's less expensive, and then reach 


his judgment as to which one he or she believes is


medically necessary in that circumstance.

 QUESTION:  Could I come back to your colloquy


with Justice Souter?  The conclusion that you drew is that


this is not really arbitration because it's a doctor. 


What would it take to make it a remedy of arbitration? 


Why isn't it arbitration?  Suppose a lawyer -- suppose the


Illinois law read just the way it reads now, except it


wouldn't be a medical doctor who posses on this but,


rather, a lawyer who would hear medical testimony from


both sides.  Would that, putting a lawyer in the shoes,


convert it to arbitration?


MR. ALBERS:  My understanding of what Justice


Souter asked me was that it had the traditional elements


of what we consider an arbitration, which is, you review


the evidence from both sides, they have an opportunity to


argue, and then you make a decision, and that's what I


meant when I said it's not classic arbitration.  It is


like arbitration, in that you give it to a neutral third


party who then makes their review.


QUESTION:  There are no submissions to the


doctor in this situation?


MR. ALBERS:  The Illinois law does not


provide -- and actually what -- for the specifics of that,


what it does say is that the HMO must set up the


independent review mechanism, and there is no authority in


Illinois on what that must contain or not contain.

 QUESTION:  What does it contain?  I would find


it surprising if both sides didn't press upon the doctor


there their view of the case.  You mean, he just sort of


walks in blind and --


MR. ALBERS:  All I can tell you is what happened


in this case, Your Honor.  In this case, the HMO submitted


a series of questions to the doctor, one of which was --


and it included a lot of the elements that Justice


Ginsburg asked about and Justice Souter asked about with

less expensive treatments, what are the risks, and so on,


and then he was given all of the relevant medical records


and given the definition of medical necessity, and he made


a determination that this particular surgery was medically


necessary.


QUESTION:  And what about your client?  Did you


put any questions to the doctor?


MR. ALBERS:  We did not, because they covered


all the questions we thought were relevant.


QUESTION:  You mean, you don't actually want to


know how the system works in Illinois?  I mean, I'm also


quite surprised that in the Illinois system, which has


been running for sometime, the patient wouldn't have an


opportunity to say to the arbitrator, this is my side of


it, and I would be equally surprised if the doctors who

think the other way don't have an opportunity to tell the

MR. ALBERS:  There's --


QUESTION:  Maybe I'm always surprised in a lot


of things --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  So tell me I should be surprised.


QUESTION:  May I go back to Justice --


QUESTION:  What is the answer, though?  What is


the answer?  Do you not -- are you not familiar with the


system in Illinois?


MR. ALBERS:  Your Honor, I'm probably as


familiar as any lawyer in Illinois.


QUESTION:  Fine, if you're as familiar as


anyone, and it's an ongoing system, and I think the --


MR. ALBERS:  This is the only case.


QUESTION:  This is the only case Illinois has


ever had?


MR. ALBERS:  This is the only legal case that's


ever been brought under the medical necessity statute.


QUESTION:  No, is this the only case in which


the arbitration system has ever worked in Illinois?


MR. ALBERS:  I have no data on that, and the


State doesn't keep data on that. I did ask --


QUESTION:  Do you accept that this is an

arbitration system, then?  Do I understand that in your


response to these questions?  You think it is an


arbitration system?


MR. ALBERS:  I think it is an arbitration, and


then it goes to a neutral third party --


QUESTION:  Well, I would be amazed if people --


I mean, am I right to be amazed that you have a system


where people can't make arguments --


MR. ALBERS:  I --


QUESTION:  -- or can't present their point of


view to the arbitrator?  I've never come across such a


thing, and I take it --


MR. ALBERS:  There's nothing in the law that


precludes either one of the parties from --


QUESTION:  Could I ask you a slightly different


question, which is the thing that -- I'd very much


appreciate, before your time expires, if you could just


address for at least a minute or so what I think is a


difficult aspect of the case.  Why is this insurance?


That is, what I'm thinking is that, after all,


every company that sells a product with a warranty is to


that extent an insurer.  Every credit card that says you


can return defective merchandise is to that extent an


insurer.  Every manufacturer, even without a warranty, who


accepts a product back because it's defective is an

insurer.


Yet Congress couldn't have meant in this Savings


Clause to allow States to win conflicts that broadly, so


why does this fall within the kind of insurer that must


fall within this Savings Clause?


MR. ALBERS:  I think the Court in Pegram -- and


it wasn't the issue before the Court in Pegram, but said


that HMO's act like insurers and transfer risks like


insurers, and the Illinois statute defines an HMO as an


entity that bears risk.


QUESTION:  That's why I gave my example, because


I wanted you to see that virtually every manufacturer of


the United States is a insurer in that sense, and so is


this the kind of thing that Illinois has traditionally


regulated?  Is it the kind of thing that other insurance


commissioners have tended to regulate?  What makes this an


insurer different from General Motors?


MR. ALBERS:  Yes to both those questions.  The


HMO Insurance Act is part of the Illinois Insurance Code,


and I think that insurance law meets all the factors the


Court has set forth in its prior decisions with respect to


what constitutes an insurer.


QUESTION:  What about a law firm that handles


all of the client's legal business, just as an HMO handles


all of the client's medical business, for a flat fee, and

there are firms that do this, especially in the labor


field.  Many unions just hire a firm to handle all of the


union members' legal business for the whole year.  Is that


law firm, like this HMO, an insurer?


MR. ALBERS:  I don't think so.  That's -- it's


not a --


QUESTION:  What's the difference?


MR. ALBERS:  They're not a traditional insurer.


QUESTION:  One is providing legal services, and


they don't know how much it's going to come to for the


year, and the other one is providing medical services and


they don't know how much it's going to come to for the


year.


MR. ALBERS:  Well, laws regulating them would


not be directed to them as acting as insurers.  They're


not traditional insurers.  They don't meet the common


sense definition of what an insurer --


QUESTION:  I don't think an HMO does, either. 


I --


MR. ALBERS:  This law is limited to the


insurance industry.  It's limited to HMO's when they bear


risk.  It does transfer risk by the very operation of the


statute.  The Seventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit agree 


that this is a statute which regulates insurance, and


under this Court's precedents set forth in UNUM, the Court

doesn't ordinarily disturb that determination of State


law, so I would -- I respectfully submit that it is an


insurance company for purposes of what regulates insurance


under 514(b).


QUESTION:  Well, I think the question of what's


insurance under ERISA is a Federal question, not a State.


MR. ALBERS:  Yes, that's -- for purposes of


514(b), but you look at those factors, and one relevant


factor is whether it -- whether the State considers it to


be an insurer or whether it regulates it as an insurer,


and in both situations it does here.


In conclusion, I would suggest, in response to


Justice Souter's question to petitioner, that this case


falls squarely between the Court's two precedents in


Massachusetts, Metropolitan Life in Massachusetts and


UNUM.  It contains a procedural element of medical


necessity, which is the relevant rule decision, just as


the UNUM case determined that the notice prejudice rule


was the relevant rule of decision, and it contains a


substantive element, which is a mandated benefit term. 


Once the medical necessity determination is made, that is


a mandated benefit, and I submit to accept petitioner's


argument this Court would have to reverse its decisions in


UNUM, in Metropolitan, and in FMC.


The effect -- I think Justice O'Connor raises

this issue, what would be the effect of such a ruling on


voluntary agreements, and I agree with the proposition


that if there's a conflict between independent review and


502, then the parties couldn't even agree to provide


independent review, which would change the practice across


the country, because it is being provided by self-insured


plans and by HMO's.


Under 514(b), I submit that this is a State


insurance law which looked to harmonize the effect of that


law and affirmed the States can regulate insurance and can


regulate insurers' medical necessity decisions by leaving


those medical decisions to doctors, who should be making


them.


If there's no other questions --


QUESTION:  May I just ask, on the question of


whether it's an insurance company, does the State


insurance agency regulate the -- you, in fact, would say


the contract between the employer, the sort of unnamed


employer that Ray talks about, and the HMO, is an


insurance policy?


MR. ALBERS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Does the Illinois Insurance


Commission regulate the terms of that policy in any


respect, other than this 510 -- this 4-10(c) provision?


MR. ALBERS:  Yes.  There's an entire statute

which regulates the terms, and there are, for example,

QUESTION:  Is the policy that this HMO issued to


this employer the same form policy it issues to many other


purchasers of HMO services from it?


MR. ALBERS:  I can only assume it is.  I have no


evidence on that, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Albers.


Mr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAEMR.


KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:


The claim is made here that the section 4-10 of


the Illinois HMO act conflicts with section 502(a).  In


considering that claim, it's important to focus on the


language of exactly what 502(a) addresses, and it is set


out on page 2 of the petition.  502(a) is empowered --


QUESTION:  502 of the petition?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Of the petition, yes.  It's


entitled, "Persons Empowered to Bring a Civil Action," and


then it itemizes -- it then continues, a civil action may


be brought by various persons, and then it goes on to

describe the judicial relief that may be granted, awarded


in a suit under section 502(a).  In other words, the


preemptive scope of section 502(a) has to do with causes


of action, civil suits in court, and the judicial relief


that may be awarded in court, and that is precisely the


formulation that the Court used in Pilot Life itself.


At the conclusion of the Court's opinion in


Pilot Life, the Court said in distinguishing Metropolitan


Life, the Court said the Court in Metropolitan Life had no


occasion to consider the question presented in this case,


whether Congress might clearly express through 502(a) an


intention that Federal, the Federal remedy provided by


that provision displaced State causes of action, and


that's what the question was about in UNUM.


Here, section 4 -- excuse me, in Pilot Life.


Here, section 4-10 of the Illinois HMO statute


does not provide a State cause of action in court, and it


does not provide any remedy or relief beyond what's


available under the plan itself.


QUESTION:  Well, you could look at it that way,


or you could look at it that it provides, the State law


provides a cause of action before this arbitrator.


MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't think that's the way


it --

arbitrator that you haven't gotten what is medically


necessary, and the arbitrator shall resolve that cause of


action just as, under ERISA, the court would have resolved


what the contract said. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't think that's the ordinary


understanding of what a cause of action is.  A cause of


action is ordinarily regarded as something that you would


enforce directly in court.


QUESTION:  So the only remedies that you can't


displace ERISA with are judicial remedies.  You can


provide for any other kind of relief?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- my point is, that's


what section 502(a) addresses, and the analysis in Pilot


Life was, what does 502(a) displace, and it's -- another


important feature of Pilot Life is, the Court went through


the various remedies that section 502(a) provides, and


tellingly discussed this Court's decision in Russell in


which the Court held that punitive damages were not


available in a suit against a fiduciary based on claims


processing, and the Court said it was not going to allow a


State cause of action to displace Congress' judgment about


damage remedies to allow and not to allow, or have --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Kneedler, supposing the


State provided for a very elaborate arbitration procedure,


you know, with right to counsel, specified the way the

hearing should be conducted and so forth, but didn't say


what would happen.  It just said the view of the


arbitrator would be final.  That would not be preempted,


in your view, by 502 because it doesn't contemplate


judicial enforcement?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, and if it also did not


provide for relief beyond that was available in the plan


itself.


QUESTION:  Well, supposing that after that you


could just simply bring an action under 502?


MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that would not be


preempted.  In fact, most States -- in this case, Illinois


has not tightly regulated the form in which the


independent review will occur, and that's consistent with


the fact that these are highly judgmental medical


judgments that medical professionals are looking at.


QUESTION:  That may be, but I want to go back to


the Chief Justice's question for a minute.  Just assume


the absurd example in which the State provided that there


are going to be sort of 10 steps of arbitration and review


between the initial denial by the plan fiduciary and the


right to sue, so that someone would be tied up for months


or years before the person could get into court.


In each instance, I'm assuming that it would not


be a provision by the State of a cause of action in the

sense that you have been using it, and yet wouldn't you


concede in that case that the State scheme was keeping


people out of Federal court for enforcement so long that


it would, in fact, be in conflict and would be preempted.


MR. KNEEDLER:  I think the analysis there would


be one of exhaustion of remedies under the plan, including


those required --


QUESTION:  And if the exhaustion was exhausting,


wouldn't you say that the --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, it could be excused, and the


Department of Labor's regulations, and they --


QUESTION:  No, but there would be a preemption


in that case.


MR. KNEEDLER:  There would be a preemption, but


the Department of Labor has addressed that under its


claims processing regulations.  Section 503 provides for a


fair administrative processing of claims, and a


separate --


QUESTION:  Okay, but doesn't that mean, then,


that your answers to the several questions on this should


be, it ultimately is a question of degree, this


requirement of one step in a review process doesn't reach


the point, in effect, of excluding the Federal remedy?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  It does not stand as an


obstacle.

 Another point that the Court stressed in Pilot


Life was that the Congress struck a balance between the


prompt and fair processing of claims and suits in court. 


Well, but arbitration and independent review, measures


adopted by State insurance laws of this sort, are


precisely designed to facilitate the prompt and fair and


expeditious processing of claims without having to go to


court, so it --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, doesn't it give you a


very different remedy -- I mean, to say that it isn't just


a matter of delay, that isn't the problem here.  The


problem here is that under the plan, the plan manager's


determination was to be given deference by the Federal


court in deciding whether the plan had been complied with,


whereas under the scheme set up by the State, his


determination is not to be given deference.  It's this


third party who's been brought in who will have the last


word, and unless that's arbitrary, the court will enforce


what he says.  How can that possibly be regarded as the


same remedy that ERISA provided?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Nothing in section 502 -- and


this Court made this clear in Firestone -- specifies the


standard of review.  The Court therefore looked to


background principles of law there, in trust law.  The


Court here might look to background principles of

arbitration law, and also to the terms of the plan.


State law, as Justice O'Connor pointed out,


might well be able to say that that sort of provision for


deference to the plan administrator's interpretation of


the plan should not be given.  That would be a classic


regulation of State insurance law.


I want to mention one other point about the


characterization of Pilot Life, and that is this Court's


decision in UNUM.  The Court there said, whatever the


merits of UNUM's view of section 502(a)'s preemptive


force, the issue is not implicated here.  The Court then


went on to say why, because Ward sued under 502(a)(1)(B)


itself to recover benefits it was not a displacement of


the Federal remedy, it was an invocation of the Federal


remedy to recover benefits, and the Court said in that


cause of action, the notice prejudice rule of California


insurance law supplied the rule of decision.


So, too, here, in the cause of action under


section 502(a)(1)(B) the State Illinois HMO law supplies


the rule of decision, a procedure for an independent


reviewer to give a quick, prompt review of the claim, and


that independent reviewer's decision is -- then supplies


the rule of decision that the HMO must comply with, and


that is then subject to review in Federal court.


The claimant's right to go to court is not

frustrated.  He can seek review of the arbitrator's


decision, or, as we point out in our brief, he can bypass


this procedure altogether and can go directly to court,


and so 502(a)(1)(B) confers rights on claimants, not on


plans.  Nothing in the HMO act stands as an obstacle to


the claimant's ability to go directly to court.


Another important point about UNUM is, the Court


made clear that the processing of claims under an


insurance policy, it is an integral part of that insurance


policy, but at the same time States may regulate the


process by which claims are adjudicated, and that is


precisely what the State has done in this case.  It has


provided a familiar mechanism.  40 States now have


provided for this external sort of review, and it is


common in insurance and medical practice to provide by


second opinions by physicians, so what has been provided


here is a very familiar sort of approach.


One other point about section 502, it's


patterned after section 301 of the LMRA, an arbitration


preceding judicial review is a very familiar aspect of


judicial review under section 301.  Section 301 itself


does not provide for any particular standard of review. 


You can have de novo breach of contract suits, as in the


Bowen v. Postal Service case we mentioned in our brief, or


highly deferential standards of review where the

particular issue has been committed to an arbitrable


process.


502 has the same flexibility.  It can have a


direct de novo cause of action, as the Court contemplated


in Firestone, or, where the parties' underlying agreement


or contract provides for a separate resolution process,


there is deference to that process under section 502.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.


Mr. Roberts, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


My friend Mr. Kneedler again drew the analogy to


the Labor Management Relations Act, and we are on common


ground.  That's a good analogy.  He again stopped one step


short.  A State law that compelled the parties to a


collective bargaining agreement to resolve their disputes


in a particular manner, even arbitration, would surely be


preempted under the Labor Management Relations Act and, to


the extent this remedy is similar to arbitration, that


same conclusion applies.


We heard that there's no interference with 502


because beneficiaries have the option.  They can use the


Federal remedy, or they can use the State remedy.  The


existence of an alternative remedy is, in fact, an

interference with section 502, and that test is that


option with the beneficiary is peculiarly inappropriate


when you're talking about preemption.


Preemption often is the result of a quid pro


quo.  We're going to give, say, employees a Federal


remedy, but for the employers we're going to make it


exclusive.  To say that additional remedies are okay so


long as the employee can still resort to the Federal


remedy seems to ignore the typical dynamic of preemption.


And as far as the arbitration analogy goes, the


fact that the plans may or may not be able to voluntarily


adopt such a remedy doesn't mean the State can compel it. 


Nothing prevented the plan in Egelhoff from voluntarily


opting the beneficiary designation rule at issue there. 


that didn't keep this Court from ruling that it was


preempted.  Nothing preempted the plan in Greater


Washington Board of Trade from saying, we're going to


provide the same level of benefit to people on Worker's


Comp as to others, and yet a rule mandating that was


preempted.


We're dealing here with a compelled alternative


State law remedy that changes completely the standard of
