CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-516, Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher v.


Lee Bollinger.


Mr. Kolbo.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK O. KOLBO


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KOLBO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court: 


Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher were denied


admission to the University of Michigan's flagship


undergraduate institution, the College of Literature and


the Science and the Arts under an admissions-- under 

admissions policies that facially and flagrantly


discriminated on the basis of race.


The history of their case and of the


University's defense of its discriminatory admissions


policies is a powerful argument about the perils of


entrusting to the discretionary judgments of educators the


protection of the Constitution's guarantee of equality to


all individuals.


For nearly 5 years, the University vigorously


defended in the district court and the court of appeals

the admissions systems that were in place when petitioners


Gratz and Hamacher applied. These systems featured


separate admissions guidelines for different races,


protected or reserved seats in the class for select


minorities, that is blacks, Hispanics and Native


Americans, racially-segregated wait lists, and a policy of


never automatically rejecting students from their


preferred -- from the preferred minority groups while


doing so for others.


QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Kolbo, as a preliminary


matter, would you address the question of whether the


named plaintiff Patrick Hamacher has standing in this


case.  He was denied admission, I think, in 1997?


MR. KOLBO:  Correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION: 


And he claimed that he intended to 

apply to transfer to the University of Michigan, from


wherever he was going to school, and yet the transfer


admissions policy, I guess isn't before us.


MR. KOLBO:  The transfer admissions policy


itself is not before you -- the Court, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  No


MR. KOLBO:  -- but the policy is essentially the


same with respect to the consideration of race and the


Court did -- we did certify a class in this case, with


respect to Mr. Hamacher, and I believe it was December of

1998.  We moved for class certification and the district


court granted that certification.  And as a result of


that, of course, anything with respect -- anything that's


happened with respect to Mr. Hamacher subsequent to that


time it seems to us is not irrelevant to the consideration


of standing.


QUESTION:  Are you sure that the transfer policy


is the same as the admissions policy for new freshmen?


MR. KOLBO:  Well, it's not exactly the --


QUESTION:  We didn't find any such finding. 


There was some little material in the record that gave me


a different thought about it.


MR. KOLBO:  The transfer policy considers race,


Your Honor.


QUESTION: 


I know it considered race, but not in 

precisely the same way as this --


MR. KOLBO:  Not in precisely the same way, and


the Court -- there -- there is nothing -- it may be,


perhaps included in parts of the appendix materials, but


the district court did not address the issue of the


transfer policy in it -- in Mr. Hamacher's potential for


transferring under the policy.


QUESTION:  Well, there's nothing, I take it 


--

if Mr. Hamacher prevails on the transfer -- there is


nothing in his prevailing that would hurt any other class

member.


MR. KOLBO:  Nothing at all, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  It's not a -- okay.


MR. KOLBO:  No.  If Mr. Hamacher prevails, then


the rights of many thousands of others will have been


vindicated and they will be able to compete under a non-


discriminatory system.


QUESTION:  Of course that would be true even if


he doesn't have standing.


(Laughter.) 


MR. KOLBO:  That's true.  Well, Your Honor they


would not be able to compete under a non-discriminatory


system unless this particular system is struck down.


QUESTION:  I understand if it's struck down, but


that -- that begs the question of whether the named 

plaintiff has standing to represent a class of people who


want to get into the freshman class.  He wants to get in


as a transferring student.  I mean, it -- maybe there's


standing, but the mere fact that if he wins everybody will


benefit certainly doesn't speak to the question whether he


has standing.


MR. KOLBO:  No, Your Honor, but we -- we do


believe that because the -- the transfer policy and the


original admissions policy are fundamentally the same in


the respect that they both consider race in the admissions

process in a way that is discriminatory and we believe


that's --


QUESTION:  And therefore if you're right that


any consideration of a race is enough to condemn the


program, then he would have standing, but if it -- if it


requires analysis of the particular components of the


policy, then we ought to know whether the transfer policy


is the same as the original policy.


MR. KOLBO:  That would be true, Your Honor, if


the case were decided strictly on the issue of narrow


tailoring, but my understanding is that the University


considers race for a purpose to achieve a diversity that


we believe is not compelling, and if that is struck down


as a rationale, then the law would be same with respect to


the transfer policy as with respect to the original 

admissions policy, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Oh, he has standing to challenge. 


That's -- that seems clear, but the -- depending on the


rationale that the court adopts if it finds -- if it finds


the program unacceptable, he may not be entitled to


relief.


MR. KOLBO:  He would be -- it seems to me,


perhaps, Your Honor, entitled for relief for damages. 


He's -- he's not at this point seeking to be admitted to


the University.  He's graduated with the passage of time,

it's been five-plus years since this suit was filed, 


Mr. Hamacher has attended and graduated elsewhere.  It


seems to me he would be entitled to damages.


QUESTION:  And the Court agreed with him as far


as the program that was in place when he applied.  The


Court, I thought, held that program unconstitutional.


MR. KOLBO:  It did, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And -- but upheld the program that


came into being after his application, and he hasn't


reapplied under the new -- but he -- but there was a class


certified, so I suppose you could substitute another


plaintiff, someone who is applying under the current


system.


MR. KOLBO:  Well -- well, our position, Your


Honor, is that because the class was certified with 

respect to Mr. Hamacher, that that's sufficient; that if


the -- if the system is found unconstitutional, he is an


adequate class representative.  Sure.  Certainly.


One of the critical things that is demonstrated


in this case is how easy it is for one system to be


disguised as another.  What has happened in this case is


that for five years again, the University defended the


system with its facially separate admission guidelines,


with its reserved seats, and then in -- two years into


this case, in fact, was still using some of these

particular forms in its admissions policy.  It is an


indication, I think, of how difficult it is to conclude


that what we have here is a system that, for example,


comports with what Justice Powell indicated he was -- he


approved of in the -- in the Bakke case.


What we have here is a system that was -- is not


narrowly tailored to achieve any governmental interest,


any compelling governmental interest.


I would like, if I may, to return to the issue


of diversity and the diversity issue as a -- as a


compelling state interest.  The fundamental problem with


the diversity rationale is that it depends upon the


standardless discretion of educators.


It is a discretion that would be exercised in a


number of different respects. 


And we need to be clear 

about this.  The University and its amicus have all made


it clear that in their judgment they ought to be entitled


to use race as much as necessary in their educational


discretion.


If that is the rule that we end up accepting,


then universities are free in their discretion to choose


which races are discriminated against, which are favored. 


We can have one institution that discriminates against one


group of individuals, and another against another.  We can


have with the -- with shifting fashions and -- and

preferences and time, the preferences for the races can


shift.  An example of that is found in comparing the facts


of this case to the Bakke case, wherein Bakke, Asian


Americans were included in the preference, and under the


University of Michigan's systems, they are excluded.


The -- the exercise of discretion will extend to


who's identified in a particular race.


It will be for educators to decide whether


someone of a mixed race is someone that is entitled to a


preference.


You can have anomalous situation of the


University's guidelines for example where someone who is


both half-white and half-black --


QUESTION:  How -- how does the University of


Michigan decide those things? 


Do they -- is it just a 

self-reporting type of system on the application?


MR. KOLBO:  That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,


it's a matter essentially of self-identification.  So if


someone of mixed race who is white and black identifies


himself as white, then as far as the University is


concerned, they don't bring the diversity that they're


looking for.  If that person identifies himself as black,


then merely from that identification, they have fallen


within the diversity that the University seeks.


QUESTION:  And -- and the reason that these --

 QUESTION:  One thing I don't quite understand


what difference does it make to your client whether


they're three or four races or five or six races as long


as she's not one of them?


MR. KOLBO:  Well, it seems to me, Your Honor,


it -- the problem --


QUESTION:  She's equally being discriminated


against as a Caucasian, no matter how many other races are


preferred. 


MR. KOLBO:  That's true, Your Honor.  I -- I


raised the point because it -- it indicates how


standardless this interest is.  It is not defined with


respect to any constitutional principle like, for example,


an interest based on remedying discrimination.  It is


entirely discretionary with the University.


QUESTION:  So is it entirely discretionary when


you read a set of exam books, you know, it's highly


subjective, which is a little better than its --


Often I'd make a mistake as a professor, so --


so the fact that there aren't written-down standards is --


is -- I'm -- I'm not sure of the Constitutional relevance


of that when what you're trying to do is something lawyers


don't normally do, which is to select among people


individually considered which one is better for this


particular slot.  Businesspeople do that, lawyers don't

except when they're hiring.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  But -- but I don't -- if you said to


a businessperson, this doesn't have standards, such a


thing, I think they might laugh and say my job and


experience is to select who's better for this slot, so --


so I'm not sure of the constitutional relevance of what


you say, which seems to me to me to grow out of the nature


of the problem.


MR. KOLBO:  Well, again, Justice Breyer, the


constitutional relevance derives from the fact that we're


talking about a constitutional right here, the use of


race, which is not the same thing as --


QUESTION:  Yes, yes, but I mean, as Justice


Stevens just said, the constitutional problem consists of 

the injury to your client and that injury is the same


irrespective of the precise nature of the standards on the


other side.  And -- and what I'm sort of struggling for


here is I see your point, if you say you cannot use race


at all, period.  No matter what.  That's a -- that's a


clear position, which I think is one of your positions. 


But once you depart from that, now I'm -- I'm interested


in the detail.  At that point I'm not quite sure the


relevance of what you're saying.


MR. KOLBO:  Well, Your Honor, what I'm

suggesting is the Court itself has made clear that for an


interest to be compelling, one of the considerations that


the Court must look at is whether there are standards --


independent, ascertainable standards apart from the


discretion exercised by, say, an employer to determine


whether the interest is one that's compelling and one that


the Court can oversee.  That interest, that standard --


that standard exists, for example, when we have an


interest in remedying identified discrimination.  The


Court has made it clear that what with can be done in that


case is you can measure the extent to which there has been


past discrimination, that's not a matter of discretion for


the employer to decide, and once you've measured the


extent of that discrimination, you can tailor your remedy


to that interest.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kolbo, because you mentioned the


employer and the employer's judgment, I gathered from your


brief that this case is not simply about public


universities.  Employment -- because you bring up 1981 and


you bring up Title VI -- under Title VI, this case is as


much about Harvard as it is about Michigan, isn't that


true?


MR. KOLBO:  The same standard would apply, 


Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.


QUESTION:  And it -- and in the private sector,


13

25

employment in the private sector, there's 1981.  So there,


too.  So this case is much larger than private --


public -- public universities.  It's all colleges and


universities, and it's the entire realm of employment if


you're right.


MR. KOLBO:  Well, Your Honor, I want to be clear


about what it is that we're arguing for here today.  We


are not suggesting an absolute rule forbidding any use of


race under any circumstances.  What we are arguing is that


the interest asserted here by the University, this


amorphous, ill-defined, unlimited interest in diversity is


not a compelling interest.  Nothing we argue today and


nothing we seek to do today would undo the Court's


precedents that have recognized if some --


QUESTION:  As far as --


QUESTION:  But I think you are arguing that


anything except remedies for past discrimination is


impermissible.


MR. KOLBO:  Your Honor, that is not a conclusion


that we need to follow from this Court's decision.


QUESTION:  No, I -- I think that's your


position, is it not?  That the only permissible use of


race is as a remedy for past discrimination?


MR. KOLBO:  I would not go that far, Justice


Stevens, there may be other reasons.  I think they would

have to be extraordinary and rare, perhaps, rising to the


level of life or limb.  We do know that the Court has


recognized past identified discrimination.


QUESTION:  What about Weber, to take a specific


case?  Employment setting, the employer says I don't want


to confess to having been a past discriminator, but I'm


willing to engage in this voluntary affirmative action.  I


take it that that would be impermissible if we adopt your


view?


MR. KOLBO:  Weber, as I understand it, is a


Title VII case, Your Honor and it's not implicated by this


decision.


QUESTION:  But there's 1981, then -- then the


person who was attacking it on grounds that it's racially


discriminatory just says my lawsuit is under 1981, which 

it could be as well as Title VII and then what is the


result?


MR. KOLBO:  Well, it seems to me, Your Honor,


that -- if the Court could resolve the issue consistent


with Title VII, which has remedial --


QUESTION:  If the suit is brought under 1981,


the Court can decide what the plaintiff's complaint should


be?


MR. KOLBO:  No, no, if this Court decides this


case under section 1981, the only interest asserted here

at least is an interest in diversity that we are asking to


strike down.  It may be that there are some other


interests, including a remedial one, that would be


justified under some other statute.  But the issue is not


presented.


QUESTION:  But there was no -- this is a


voluntary affirmative action, no admission of prior


discrimination.  I gather if someone brought a 1981 suit,


to stop that, your theory is that that person would


prevail?


MR. KOLBO:  The use of race to exceed non-


remedial objectives, I think would have problems, Your


Honor.


QUESTION:  Congress wanted race to be considered


by private institutions such as Harvard and what-not, if 

there's a problem with 1981, or any of the other Federal


statutes, they can simply amend it.  What the -- the only


thing that the Constitution applies to is State action.


MR. KOLBO:  Yes, that's correct, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  And all the rest is simply Congress'


decision to impose a similar restriction upon private


actors, which decision it can change if it wishes.


MR. KOLBO:  That's my understanding, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Or suppose you say you used the word


extraordinary as compelling justification, and the other

side says, yes, extraordinary, we're 280 million people,


we have large racial diversity within the country, the


world is even more diverse, and we think from the point of


view of business, the Armed Forces, law, et cetera, that


this is an extraordinary need to have diversity among


elites throughout the country.  That without it, the


country will be much worse off. That's what we're being


told.


In fact, the country might not function well at


all.  And we have to train those people.  We have to.  All


right, now, how can you say, or can you say, that isn't


extraordinary?  That isn't a question of life or limb for


the country?  It isn't really that necessary, when so many


people are telling us the contrary?


MR. KOLBO: 


Your Honor, because there are 

important constitutional rights at stake.  And those


rights are the right to equal protection.  And a mere


social benefit that is having more minorities in


particular occupations or the schools simply doesn't rise


to the level of compelling interest.


It simply is not -- it doesn't remedy a


constitutional value, like --


QUESTION:  So if the University president or the


dean told you just what Justice Breyer said, you would


tell them there's -- and that we have underrepresentation

of minorities, you would tell them there's nothing you can


do about it?


MR. KOLBO:  I would say, Your Honor, that racial


preferences are not the answer.  If there are problems


again in not getting a sufficient number of -- if


minorities are not competing at the same level as other


racial groups then we should take steps to solve that


problem.  But racial preferences, because they injure the


rights of innocent people, because it's a prohibition


contained in our Constitution, simply aren't permissible


to remedy that problem.  If I may reserve the remainder of


my time, Mr. Chief Justice. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Kolbo.


General Olson, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


GENERAL OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The University of Michigan admissions program


has created a separate path and a separate door for


preferred minorities.  For those groups, if they meet


basic qualifications, their path is always clear and their


door is always open.


Non-preferred racial groups face rigorous

competition to get through the other door.


The University admits that race is such an


overarching factor in its admissions process that


eventually every qualified underrepresented minority


applicant will be admitted.  The 20 point bonus, which is


one full grade point, nearly twice the benefit of a


perfect SAT score, and six times better than an


outstanding essay, the -- that bonus is actually


unnecessary with the way the plan actually works, because


every qualified candidate who gets the bonus gets into the


University.  It might just as well be an admissions


ticket.


The University acknowledges that its pre-1999


admissions program used separate grids, separate


qualifications, separate standards and protected seats. 

They acknowledge that this system was -- which was held


unconstitutional and was not challenged, yet they


stipulated that the only changes that they made from that


system affected only the mechanics, not the substance of


how race and ethnicity were considered in the admissions


process.


QUESTION:  First the changes were sufficient to


convince the district judge that it was on the other side


of the constitutional line?


GENERAL OLSON:  Notwithstanding the fact that

the -- the University -- we -- we respectfully disagree


with that conclusion, because the -- the University itself


admitted that it only changed the mechanics.  It intended


to produce the same --


QUESTION:  Yes, but isn't -- isn't -- I mean,


mechanics is another word for tailoring.  And they're


saying we have tailored it differently.  Our objectives


are the same.  We may be reaching those objectives in


roughly the -- the same proportions, but the argument is


an argument about tailoring and we've changed the


tailoring. 


GENERAL OLSON:  We submit Justice Souter, that


the changes which they referred to as mechanics were


cosmetics, that ultimately, the system was intended to,


and they acknowledge, to produce the same outcome as the 

prior system.


QUESTION:  Yes.  The stipulation is that it did


not change the substance of how race and ethnicity were


considered.


GENERAL OLSON:  Correct, Justice Kennedy.  And


what the Court only needs to look at the operation of the


system.  That 20 point bonus means that if you pass the


minimum qualification standards at the University of


Michigan, you were admitted.


Everyone else just like in the Davis program,

had to compete -- people that were not in the preferred


races, who were not on the preferred class had to compete


with one another.


QUESTION:  It was the same 20 points given --


socioeconomic status also had 20 points?


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.


QUESTION:  And atlethics, too, I think?


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, and you couldn't get both. 


But if you had -- whether -- whatever your background,


whether you were an athlete or not, you got the 20 points


solely because of your race.  There were other systems,


that the Constitution doesn't implicate.


QUESTION:  I thought you got only one 20?


GENERAL OLSON:  That's correct.


QUESTION: 


So if you were an athlete you 

wouldn't get race?


GENERAL OLSON:  That's correct.  But if you --


irrespective of those other factors, if you didn't get the


-- the 20 point bonus for being an athlete or -- for


socioeconomic conditions, the only thing that was required


was to be a member of the preferred race.  Like the other


program that we're hearing today, the same State, the


state Board of Regents, this plan violates every standard


that this Court has set for the examination of racial


preferences.

 It is a thinly disguised quota because there's


only one path, a segment -- Justice O'Connor put it this


way in Croson -- a segment of the class reserved


exclusively for certain minority groups.  It isn't tied to


a particular number.  It's a segment of the class reserved


on the basis of race.


It is -- it is based upon the stigmatizing


notion that if you are a certain race, you think a certain


way or if you're a certain race, you have certain


experience that's are common.


QUESTION:  What do you say to the argument that


number one, it's not stigmatizing, because the box study


certainly didn't show that it was, and number two, the


objective is not to show that there is a correlation


between race and one point of view. 


The objective is to 

show students what the correlation or no correlation is


between races and points of view. And it seems to me that


the Michigan plan is equally consistent with the latter


interpretation as with the former.


GENERAL OLSON:  What we're saying is that if you


assume that because you are white or you are red or you


are brown or you are black, you must have certain


experiences and you must have certain viewpoints.


QUESTION:  The argument is that you need to have


enough of them to demonstrate that the point of view does

not always fit just one person.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, but Justice Stevens --


QUESTION:  And that was a finding I think?


GENERAL OLSON:  -- that's a self-contradictory


rationale that they've come up with.  They've said first


of all you have these characteristics because you're black


but we must admit enough of you into the class to prove to


the other students that -- that black isn't the reason


you're --


QUESTION:  No that is not -- the argument is


basically that, look, people who have grown up in America


and are black, regardless of race, no, not regardless of


race, regardless of socioeconomic background have


probably, though not certainly, shared the experience of


being subject to certain stereotypical reactions from 

people throughout their lives.


Now, that may have led them to react one way, or


another way or not react at all.


And indeed many of the students in our class


will have stereotypical reactions.  And it's good for them


as well as for everyone else to rid themselves of those


reactions.  And we want people in this school of all kinds


who are black, because that will be helpful education.


Now, that's their argument, I think, in that


respect, not the argument that all black people are poor,

not the argument that all black people have been


discriminated against, not the argument that all black


people share a point of view. 


As I read it, that's their argument.  And so


you're reply to that argument is what?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, their argument, A, takes


several forms, at one point it's that, at one point, it's


the need to get more people elite -- of different


backgrounds, it's a -- but what this Court has said that


racial preferences, racial stereotyping, which it is, is


stigmatizing, it's divisive, it's damaging to the fabric


of society, it's damaging to the goal ultimately to


eliminate the problems that racial discrimination and


racial differences have created.


QUESTION: 


General Olson -- we're part of a 

world, and this problem is a global problem.  Other


countries operating under the same equality norm have


confronted it.  Our neighbor to the north, Canada, has,


the European Union, South Africa, and they have all


approved this kind of, they call it positive


discrimination.  Do we -- they have rejected what you


recited as the ills that follow from this.  Should we shut


that from our view at all or should we consider what


judges in other places have said on this subject?


GENERAL OLSON:  I submit, Justice Ginsburg that

none of those countries has our history, none of those


countries has the Fourteenth Amendment, none of those


histories has the history of the statements by this Court


which has examined the question over and over again that


the ultimate damage that is done by racial preferences is


such that if there ever is a situation in which such


factors must be used that they must be -- race neutral


means must be used to accomplish those objective, narrow


tailoring must be applied, and this -- this -- these


programs fail all of those tests.


QUESTION:  General Olson, do you know whether


any of those countries that Justice Ginsburg referred to


that have gone down the road of racial preferences, racial


entitlements, have ever gotten rid of racial preferences


or racial entitlements?


GENERAL OLSON:  There --


QUESTION:  Has it been the road to ultimately a


color blind society or has it been the road to a society


that has percentage entitlements for the various races?


GENERAL OLSON:  Sadly, I believe that that is


correct, Justice Scalia, and let me conclude by saying


that the Michigan Law School and the University of


Michigan ultimately must make a choice.  It may maintain


its elitist, as it refers to it, selection process without


regard to race, or it may achieve the racial diversity it

seeks with race neutral compromises in its admission


standards.


But the one thing that it may not do is


compromise its admission standards or change its admission


requirements for one race and not another.


That is forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause


of the Constitution.


QUESTION:  Is it also forbidden for the United


States military academy?


GENERAL OLSON:  It may well be Justice Stevens. 


We're not defending the specifics of those programs, but


we have not examined them individually.  We -- we believe


that the ultimate solution to the problem that race has


created -- that difference in race has created in this


country has got to be according to what this Court has 

said, the most neutral race -- neutral means possible.


QUESTION:  Thank you General Olson.


Mr. Payton, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN PAYTON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. PAYTON:  Mr. Chief Justice and, may it


please the Court: 


I think I want to spend just a few minutes


briefly setting the record straight on why it is the


educational judgment of the University of Michigan that

the educational benefits that come from a racially and


ethnically diverse student body are crucial for all of our


students and why those benefits do not depend in any way


on the assumption that, for example, all African Americans


think alike.


LS&A, our premiere undergraduate institution, is


an undergraduate college, most of its entering students


come in as 18-year-olds, about two-thirds come from


Michigan, and about half from Detroit or the greater


Detroit area.  Michigan, I think as everyone knows is a


very segregated State.


QUESTION:  Half of the ones who come from


Michigan come from Detroit?


MR. PAYTON:  Yes.  Half of our students come


from -- yes.


Michigan is a very segregated State. Detroit is


overwhelmingly black.  Its suburbs and the rest of the


state are overwhelmingly white.  While Michigan is extreme


in this regard, it's not that extreme from the rest of the


country.  The University's entering students come from


these settings and have rarely had experiences across 


racial or ethnic lines.  That's true for our white


students.  It's true for our minority students.


They've not lived together.  They've not played


together.  They've certainly not gone to school together.

 The result is often that these students come to


college not knowing about individuals of different races


and ethnicities.  And often not even being aware of the


full extent of their lack of knowledge.  This gap allows


stereotypes to come into existence.


Ann Arbor is a residential campus, just about


every single entering student lives on campus in a dorm. 


On campus, these 18-year olds interact with students very


different from themselves in all sorts of ways, not just


race, not just ethnicity, but in all sorts of ways. 


Students, I think as we know, learn a tremendous amount


from each other.


Their education is much more than the classroom. 


It's in the dorm, it's in the dining halls, it's in the


coffee houses. 


It's in the daytime, it's in the 

nighttime.  It's all the time.


Here's how critical mass works in these


circumstances.  If there are too few African-American 


students, to take that same example, there's a risk that


those students will feel that they have to represent their


group, their race.  This comes from isolation and it's


well understood by educators. It results in these token


students not feeling completely comfortable expressing


their individuality.


On the other hand, if there are meaningful

numbers of African-American students, this sense of


isolation dissipates.


QUESTION:  Mr. Payton, what is a meaningful


number?


MR. PAYTON:  It's what we've been referring to


as critical mass.


QUESTION:  Okay, what is critical mass?


MR. PAYTON:  Critical mass is when you have


enough of those students so they feel comfortable acting


as individuals.


QUESTION:  How do you know that?


MR. PAYTON:  I think you know it, because as


educators, the educators see it in the students that come


before them, they see it on the campus.


QUESTION: 


Do they -- professors at the 

University of Michigan spend a lot of time with the


students? 


MR. PAYTON:  Yes, they do.  This is a incredibly


vibrant and complex campus that has diversity in every


conceivable way.  And I think --


QUESTION:  Do they spend a lot of time with them


other than lecturing to them?


MR. PAYTON:  They do.  In the record, we


actually have an expert report that's not contradicted in


any way by Professor Raudenbush and by Professor Gurin,

25

just on the issue of how do you know when you have enough


students in different contexts and circumstances so that


there will be these meaningful numbers.


QUESTION:  What do they say?


MR. PAYTON:  They said that given the numbers


that have been coming through in the last several years,


we are just getting to that critical mass.  And the way


they analyzed it was to look at the circumstances in which


students interact.  A entering seminar, a dorm context, a


student activities context, student newspaper context, to


see what would happen if you distribute the students


across these small encounter opportunities.


QUESTION:  Does Michigan have, as some schools I


know have, schools that have affirmative action program,


does it have a minority dormitory? 


MR. PAYTON:  No.  The answer is no.  We have


dormitories like I said.  Just about every single entering


student stays in a dormitory.  We do not have any


dormitories where your entrance into it is governed by


your race.  But we have tremendous representation in our


dormitories because everybody has to stay there, okay?


So the answer is --


QUESTION:  I mean, apart from being excluded, if


-- it is in fact the residential pattern quite mixed and


there are no dormitories that are, you know, just as


30

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

sometimes there is -- there is the jocks dormitory, there


is really no African American dormitory?


MR. PAYTON:  The answer is there is no African


American dormitory, put it -- the full answer is more


complex.  After students are there for their first year,


they can choose to move off campus. They can choose to


stay on campus.  Many stay on campus, many move off


campus.  Ann Arbor is a college town and off campus is


actually in the larger campus community and what they do


off campus is obviously up to the students themselves, but


I think that's -- you know, that's the real world.  If you


have the meaningful numbers of minority students, what


then happens is that students will see a range of ideas, a


range of viewpoints from and among those students and they


will then see things that they may not have expected, 

similarities and differences, and those in turn will have


the result of undermining stereotypes, you know, and this


happens for the minority students, and the white students.


This happens for all the students.  You know,


the benefits from this affect every single student that


comes through.  And they're dependent on their being


meaningful numbers, or critical mass, of minority


students, or the benefits don't come about.


That's the interest that the University is


asserting.  That's why they think that this is so crucial.

Education, understanding, produces citizens and leaders in


our complex society.


QUESTION:  But where we are is, there's an


assumption, you may not agree with it, but it's one


beginning assumption in this area, that there may not be a


quota, every -- all of the eloquent things you said could


be easily met by a quota.  That -- let's just assume for


argument, we cannot do.


I have to say that in -- in looking at your


program, it looks to me like this is just a -- a disguised


quota.  You have a -- a minority student  who works very,


very hard, very proud of his athletics, he gets the same


number of points as a minority person who doesn't have any


athletics -- that to me looks like an overt quota.


MR. PAYTON: 


Here's how our system works and I 

believe it's not a quota at all and I can believe -- I can


simply explain this.  The way it works, an application


comes in, it is reviewed on the basis -- every single


application is read in its entirety by a counselor, every


single application.  It is in fact judged on the basis of


the selection index, which has the 20 points for race and


20 points for athletics, but it also has all sorts of


other things that it values, in state, underrepresented


state, underrepresented county within Michigan,


socioeconomic status, what your school is like, what the

curriculum that you took at your school is like.


QUESTION:  But none of that matters.


MR. PAYTON:  Your grades --


QUESTION:  None of that matters if you're


minimally qualified and you're one of the minority races


that gets the 20 points, you're in, correct? The rest is


really irrelevant?


MR. PAYTON:  The way it works is that every


application comes through and it's read in its entirety,


it is evaluated taking all of these factors into account,


and then based upon the number that comes off the


selection index which can go up to 150, the students are


all competing against each other.  There is a score that


is evaluated throughout the year, because there's an


overenrollment problem that always has to be managed and 

if the score is higher, you are in, and that doesn't


matter about anything other than what the score is.  In


addition, the counselor can on the basis of three factors


see that an application is reviewed by the admissions


review committee.


QUESTION:  Mr. Payton, in your brief, you say


the volume of applications and the presentation of


applicant information may get impractical for LSA to use


the same admissions system as the much smaller University


of Michigan Law School.

21

22

23

24

25

 Now, you're saying that every single application


for admission to LSA is read individually?


MR. PAYTON:  Yes.  Sometimes twice. Because


every application is read when it comes in, and those that


a counselor flags that -- because they find that there's


three factors you have to have flag an application --


academically able to do the work, above a certain


selection index score and also contributes at least one of


various factors that we want to see in our student body,


including underrepresented minority status, but also very


high class rank and a whole range of other things.


QUESTION:  When you say underrepresented


minorities, what comparison are you making to say that


it's underrepresented?


MR. PAYTON: 


I think we're taking that term as 

the Federal Government has used it, and the reason Asians


aren't included, just to pick up one of the --


QUESTION:  How does the Federal Government use


it?


MR. PAYTON:  I think there are three minority


groups, you know.  Let me just go back and answer what we


want. 


QUESTION:  Well, I think perhaps I could get a


more direct answer.  How do you decide whether, say,


African Americans or Hispanics are quote underrepresented,

close quote?


MR. PAYTON:  I think this is actually a very


important point.  They are underrepresented in our


applicant pool.


QUESTION:  Compared to what? 


MR. PAYTON:  Compared to -- we have very small


pools of African Americans, for example, that are


qualified to the extent that we require students to be


qualified to do the work at the University of Michigan and


what that means is that if we didn't take race into


account, we would not be able to get the numbers of those


students, the critical mass, necessary for the educational


benefits that we want.


QUESTION:  But --


MR. PAYTON: 


That's underrepresented. 

QUESTION:  When you say underrepresented, it


sounds like something almost mathematical, that you're


saying, we only have a certain percentage of -- and we


should have this percentage, well, what is this


percentage?


MR. PAYTON:  It's actually not a percentage at


all and it really is driven by the educational benefits


that we want from our diverse student body.


If we had in our applicant pool sufficient


numbers of minority students, African Americans, for

example --


QUESTION:  What is a sufficient number?


MR. PAYTON:  So that when we made our selection


--

number?


QUESTION:  I asked you, what is a sufficient


MR. PAYTON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  An answer -- would you answer it?


MR. PAYTON:  A sufficient number so that when we


made our selections, we were achieving the critical mass


of students that we need for the benefits I described. 


That is not a fixed precise number at all, as you've


heard.  It is -- that's simply not the nature of the


critical mass.  But when you're trying to figure out


whether or not in your applicant pool, you have sufficient 

numbers, so that the normal operation of our process would


yield a critical mass, that's underrepresented.  We are


underrepresented with respect to Hispanics, with respect


to African Americans and with respect to Native Americans.


QUESTION:  Because your standards are so high,


you say that there are very few of those who can meet your


standards.  So why don't you lower your standards,


actually, I mean if this is indeed a significant


compelling State interest, why don't you lower your


standards?

 MR. PAYTON:  We do have sufficient numbers in


our applicant pool to achieve the critical mass that we're


achieving.  We're not taking -- you're right we're not --


QUESTION:  By taking race into account, you can


you can do it.  But --


MR. PAYTON:  But we're not taking students that


aren't qualified, you are correct about that, Justice


Scalia.


QUESTION:  But just lower your qualification


standards, if -- if this value of -- of having everybody


in a mix with people of other races is so significant to


you, just lower your qualifications.


MR. PAYTON:  It is that significant to us.  But


I think that --


QUESTION: 


You don't have to be the great 

college you are, you can be a lessor college if that value


is important enough to you.


MR. PAYTON:  I think that decision which would


say that we have to choose, would be a Hobbesian choice


here.  Our premiere institutions of higher education, I'd


say, are part of our crown jewels.  We have great


educational institutions in this country.  The University


of Michigan is one of them.  I think we are the envy of


the world.  If we had to say, gee, our educators tell us


that it is crucial that for the full education they want

for those students, all of those students we needed for a


student body, that the decision is, oh, gee, we want to


you decide to either have a poor education for the


essentially white students and/or you can say, change what


you are as an institution.  I think we get to decide what


our mission is.  I think the Constitution gives us some


leeway in deciding what our mission is and how we define


ourselves.


QUESTION:  And anything that contradicts that


mission is automatically a compelling State interest?


MR. PAYTON:  No.  I think what we're saying is


we can achieve both of those things, because, in fact,


achieving the educational benefits that come from a


diverse student body can be achieved, given our mission,


if we can go about selecting students in a way to achieve 

the critical mass of minority students that we need.  We


want both of those things.  We think that --


QUESTION:  Go ahead.  Are you finished?


MR. PAYTON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I wanted to go back to Justice


Kennedy's question.  The point system here, does it meet


the opinion of Justice Powell in Bakke when that was


called for individualized consideration? 


Now, the concern that it does not, is that you


under this system would seem to have the possibility that

two students -- one is a minority, African American, one


is not, majority, and they seem academically approximately


the same and now we give the black student 20 points and


the white student, let's say, is from the poorest family


around and is also a great athlete, and he just can't


overcome that 20 points -- the best he can do is tie.


And so that's the argument that this is not


individualized consideration.  And I want to be sure I


know what your response is to that argument.


MR. PAYTON:  I have two responses.  The first is


to say that it is individualized if that white student


actually was socioeconomically disadvantaged, that could


be taken into account.


QUESTION:  But remember he has that and gets 20


points for it?


MR. PAYTON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And he also is a great athlete and


I've constructed this example to make it difficult for


you, and -- but I mean you see he can only get 20 points,


no matter how poor he is.  And no matter how great an


athlete he is as well, and the -- let's say the black


student who has neither ties him? 


MR. PAYTON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But on individualized consideration,


the black student might lose, if there were the

individualized consideration.


MR. PAYTON:  Well, he might --


QUESTION:  And that's -- and that's what you're


giving him.  Now what is the answer I'm -- I'm trying to


find your answer?


MR. PAYTON:  The answer is we value both of


those aspects of diversity.  We want both of those


represented in our student body, all right, if they tie,


they will being judged exactly the same as far as how the


selection index works.


QUESTION:  What you're saying is that race is


individualized consideration?


MR. PAYTON:  I'm saying that each student --


QUESTION:  Otherwise you're saying that only in


the hypothetical given that only the white student 

receives individualized consideration?


MR. PAYTON:  No, no.  They both --


QUESTION:  Some are more equal than others?


MR. PAYTON:  They both receive individualized


consideration.  They're both reviewed in their totality. 


They both may be sent to the admissions review committee


where they get a second reading.  In Bakke --


QUESTION:  If in those circumstances, because we


have the white student who is both a good athlete and also


very poor, and the other student, the minority is not,

could that be sent to the -- the individual -- could that


be sent to the review committee and the review committee


would say, well, we have a special circumstance here, and


even though the points tie, nonetheless when we look at it


carefully, we see that the white student has these extra


pluses, despite the points, we let in the white student?


MR. PAYTON:  The admissions review committee --


about 70 percent of the applications that it reviews in


any given year are white student applications that are


sent to it.  Okay.  It can reach its judgment irrespective


of whatever happened in the selection index score.


QUESTION:  So they can ignore the points?


MR. PAYTON:  They can -- actually once it goes


to them they simply look at the application and make a


judgment.


QUESTION:  So I want a clear answer to this. 


That review committee can look at the applications


individually and ignore the points? 


MR. PAYTON:  It does.


QUESTION:  Yes.  The answer is yes?


MR. PAYTON:  The answer is yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. PAYTON:  And it does.  In Bakke, where


Justice Powell says that he could look at one example of


an admissions policy and he discusses briefly the Harvard

plan and then he has a long quote from it, there is the


footnote 50 that Ms. Mahoney mentioned.  In both footnote


50 and footnote 51 there is a citation to this study by


Carnegie and he introduces that by saying in the footnote


there are in this study examples of the actions by other


leading institutions, trying to get diverse student


bodies. That study indicates that there are plenty of


other models where in fact some effort to come up with a


system to handle these different factors was successful.


QUESTION:  Mr. Payton, it's easy to say they can


ignore the points.  Easy to say.  Do you know of any case


where a minority applicant, one of the minorities favored


in your program, who was minimally qualified, got the


20-point favor and was rejected?


MR. PAYTON: 


I don't know, Justice Scalia. 

QUESTION:  Well, it's important, I mean, to say


theoretically, it's fine, yes, theoretically, you can


reject it.  But as I understand what -- what the other


side is saying, it is automatic, if you are minimally


qualified, and you get those 20 points, you are in, that's


what they claim?


MR. PAYTON:  Actually --


QUESTION:  Now, do you assert that that is


false?


MR. PAYTON:  That is not correctly describing

what happens.  The way the policy works and the way it is


implemented is how I described the policy.  In fact, the


results of the policy are that most of the qualified


minority applications do end up getting admitted.  That's


not the design.  The design is here's how you do it,


here's how the decisions are made, either on the selection


index score, some are sent to the admissions review


committee.  Most of those that are sent to the admissions


review committee are in fact not minority applications,


but the design is not gee, admit all qualified minorities,


the design is to take these different factors into account


in order to achieve the student body that we think is


crucial here.


QUESTION:  So there are some qualified 


minorities who get the 20 points and who are rejected? 

MR. PAYTON:  I believe that is the case, all the


record says in this is that virtually all of the minority


students, as a result of the policy ended up being


admitted.  I think there are certainly some, I can't give


you one, I can't give you one, but there are certainly


some where if you work it out, you can see that won't


happen.


QUESTION:  But the design is to admit a higher


percentage of the qualified minority applicants that you


get, given the numbers that there are today, because if

you don't do that you won't get your mix?


MR. PAYTON:  The design is to make sure we get


to the critical mass of the meaningful numbers and given


the small pool size we have, the way it operates is as you


just described, but that's the way it operates, the design


is to make sure we get the critical mass of students that


are, in fact, necessary for the educational benefits that


we are asserting here.


QUESTION:  Has anyone at Michigan ever defined


critical mass as being anything more specific than


something beyond token numbers? 


MR. PAYTON:  I think that the reason I


referenced the two expert reports by Professor Raudenbush


and Professor Gurin is to try to see this -- those two


reports try to put this in sort of an everyday example, 

you know, students don't interact with the student body as


a whole, they interact in small settings and it's to see


if you see what our minority student population is how


that would distribute into these small settings.  And on


the basis of how that distribution works, Professor Gurin


looked at it to see whether or not that looked like that


would be generating the interactions that she would expect


for these educational benefits.


QUESTION:  But in the criteria used by the


admissions committee, did anyone put a percentage figure

or a specific number --


MR. PAYTON:  No.


QUESTION:  -- beyond the concept you've got to


get more than just token representation?


MR. PAYTON:  No.  The answer is no.  And --


QUESTION:  Mr. Payton, do you know the origin of


critical mass that is being spoken of here as though it


were something that were invented?  I know it goes back at


least with respect to the enrollment of women in law


school, the schools talked about we want to get a critical


mass, so women will feel welcome because when they were


one at a time curiosities they did have to do as you said


defend -- they were representatives of their sex and if


they failed, all women failed.  Once they had a critical


mass, it was no longer necessary, the woman was free to be 

who she was.


But that term I certainly was familiar with that


term used in that setting.  It's -- it comes from


sociology, doesn't it?


MR. PAYTON:  It does, and I think you've


described it exactly as it has come about with respect to


diversity and critical mass.  In the Harvard plan, in


Justice Powell's discussion of the Harvard plan, he


clearly acknowledges and -- because the plan acknowledges


that you must have meaningful numbers and it means more

than token numbers and there's clearly an acknowledgement


that if you have too few numbers you get the dynamics of


isolation that you just discussed.


QUESTION:  In the law school context, there was


testimony, I think from one of the admissions officers


that said 5 percent is too few, 10 percent might suffice.


And he's talking in respect to what is a 


critical mass.  Now, do people coalesce around numbers


like that or is that just out of -- what do I do with that


piece of testimony?


MR. PAYTON:  I think that in all of this, you


know, there's a false precision here that everybody wants,


which is tell me exactly what this is, and I don't think


it exactly works like that. You know, we have a lot of


experience as, you know, an educational institution about 

what has happened on our campus and what has worked.  The


class that we've had, the entering classes that we've had


over the last 4 years or so, have ranged from 12 percent


to 17 percent, okay?  Twelve percent to 17 percent.  I'm


not saying it's a percent and I'm not saying it's that


fixed range, but 12 percent to 17 percent is sort of how


it is ranged and that has generated the representation in


the small groups that is what is working to achieve some


of these educational benefits that we're talking about.


But it's not quite that precise as far as how

all of this works.


QUESTION:  Mr. Payton, let me ask Justice


O'Connor's question, when does all of this come to an end?


MR. PAYTON:  I think that we all certainly 


expect it to come to an end.  I think we're all quite


surprised if we looked back at Bakke, in 1978, I think all


of us would be quite surprised from that vantage point to


realize that today in Michigan students live in such


segregated circumstances growing up, it's really quite


unbelievable.  We could not have foreseen that.  I think


people thought that we were coming together in a way and


that hasn't occurred.  That's created some educational


challenges and opportunities.


The test score gap, I think is narrowing -- we


put that in our brief. 


I think we're all quite optimistic 

about how this is going to progress.  There is progress. 


I think the pool is increasing.  But I can't give you how


long is it going to last.  I think we're all quite


confident that it's only going to last for X number of


finite years, I just can't answer with any precision that


question either.


QUESTION:  Suppose the Court were to say that


the 20-point system and the law school system looked just


too much like a quota and that quotas are impermissible? 


As of that point, is it our burden to tell you what other

systems to use or is it your burden to come up with some


other system, say, more individualized assessment in order


to attain some of the goals you wish to attain?


MR. PAYTON:  I guess I'm not sure what the more


individualized assessment would be here.  I'm not saying


that obviously there are things that could be done


differently.  We've done things differently.  The two


schools do things quite differently.  But I think we're


both trying to achieve the critical mass, that I think


there's no dispute at all from anyone that the critical


mass is essential to get the educational benefits that


we're talking about. 


If this goal is a compelling interest, then


critical mass is essential to its attainment, given the


small pool size that we're talking about. 


Can it be 

crafted in another way?  Obviously, from the amicus


briefs, there are a lot of schools that do it in different


ways.  We're doing it in a very individualized way that in


fact does allow students to compete.  Every student is


evaluated on the same criteria.  You know, head to head. 


We do take race into account in the way that you've heard


described.  But I'm not sure that lacks the individuality


that you would be striving for.


This is, you know, an enormously important case.

to say that the Nation's future depends upon leaders


trained through wide exposure to the ideas and mores of


students as diverse as this nation of many peoples, I


think that statement was absolutely correct then.  I think


it is, you know, it has never been truer than it is today. 


This is of enormous importance and correct, not just to


the University of Michigan, but I'd say to all of higher


education and I think to our country as a whole to be able


to do things that bring us together, that bring us


understanding, that result in tolerance and, I'd say, make


us the -- more -- closer to the day that we all look


forward to when, in fact, we are beyond some of these


problems that we've been discussing rather intensely here


today.


QUESTION: 


Mr. Payton, do you think that your 

admissions standards overall at least provide some


headwind to the efforts that you're taking about?


MR. PAYTON:  Yes, I do.  I think they do in all


sorts of ways.  They are certainly producing black


students, white students, Hispanic students, Native


American students who go out into our communities and


change their communities.


QUESTION:  You may have misunderstood me.  I


mean the -- Ms. Mahoney said earlier that the problem of


law school admissions, in response to Justice O'Connor,

that it was for the elite schools, it was more a problem


at the elite schools, when she was talking about Boalt


Hall, for example, you meant -- you suggested or alluded


to in your argument today that, you know, you don't want


to choose between being an elite school and the whole


diversity issue.


It -- would it be easier to accomplish the


latter if the former were adjusted, that is the overall


admissions standard? 


MR. PAYTON:  I think that --


QUESTION:  Now, I know you don't want to make


the choice, but will you at least acknowledge that there


is a tension?


MR. PAYTON:  I think that, you know, some of our


other schools, the non-selective schools, actually some 

can end up with completely undiverse populations as well;


that the fact that a school does not have selectivity


doesn't mean that the community college, in fact, is


diverse.


So I don't think it necessarily follows at all


that if you lower your standards and distribute this all


across the country, we will get these educational


benefits, you know, throughout our educational system.

 MR. PAYRON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- and the argument was made that the


historically -- the HBCs, the historically black colleges


provided a different benefit to minorities.  Would the


same arguments with respect to diversity apply to those


institutions?


MR. PAYTON:  Yes.  You mean do they benefit if


they had a racially and ethnically diverse student body? 


I believe most every single one of them do have diverse


student bodies.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Payton.


Mr. Kolbo, you have two minutes remaining -- you


have three minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KIRK O. KOLBO


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. KOLBO:  With respect to the point system,


Counsel has made it sound as if it's sort of a fortuity


that the University of Michigan has an admissions system


that ends up admitting -- admitting virtually all minority


students.  In fact, I want to talk a little bit about the


record here.  We put in the record the guidelines from the


original system that was in place in 1995 and 1997.  At


the joint appendix, at page 80, it's made very clear that


the guidelines were set in 1995, when Jennifer Gratz


applied to admit all qualified minority students.  It's

25

also undisputed in this record that the way the University


got to the 20 points was to statistically design it based


on the old model.  So what they've done is they've taken


the old guidelines that were set to admit all qualified


minority students, statistically figured out how many


points they needed to give -- to give to students under


the new system to replicate the old system, and that's how


we ended up with 20 points. 


So it -- it strikes me as disingenuous to


suggest that it's simply an accident.


These policies have a purpose.  They grant a


preference for a purpose.  And the new system does what


the old system did -- did, which is to create a two-track


system.  It's not enough if you're Jennifer Gratz or


Patrick Hamacher to be merely qualified to get admitted to 

the University.  To be admissible is not simply enough


because of their skin color.  If however you're a member


of one of the minority students and you meet those minimum


qualifications, that's sufficient.  If that's not a


two-track system, I can't imagine what one -- what one


would actually look like.


With respect to test scores, a question was


made -- a question was asked about how long are these


systems going to last.  There's actually evidence, and


this was not put in the -- in the record by the

University, with respect to test scores and disparities,


but there's -- there's also opposing opinion which has


indicated that as long as we have these preferences, they


create perverse incentives.  We've cited the work of John


McWhorter, for example, in our reply brief indicating that


test scores to the extent that they're not narrowing, or


to the extent that the gaps are increasing may, in fact,


be to the fact -- due to the fact of these -- of these


preferences.  With respect to the Hobbesian choice that


Mr. Payton has talked about, they have resolved a


different Hobbesian choice.  The University has decided


that they are willing to lower their academic standards to


get their critical mass.


They've resolved that -- that Hobbesian choice


that way. 


But they've resolved the other Hobbesian 

choice, how to get those objectives and stay selective,


they've resolved that Hobbesian choice on the backs of the


constitutional rights of individuals like Jennifer Gratz


and Patrick Hamacher.  They are the ones that are paying


for the Hobbesian choice that the University has resolved


with -- by the use of a two-track admission system.


With respect to the concept of critical mass,


all I have to say, if one can't ascertain from the way


it's defined, meaningful means sufficient, sufficient


means critical, critical means sufficient, that meets the


53 

definition, it seems to me, of an interest that's too


amorphous, too ill-defined, too indefinite, just like the


role model theory, just like a remedy for societal


discrimination, too indefinite to support the use of a


compelling -- to suit -- to use -- to be a basis for


racial preferences. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you Mr. Kolbo. 


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
