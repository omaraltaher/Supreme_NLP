CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 02-311, Kevin Wiggins versus Sewall Smith.


Mr. Verrilli.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Under the clearly established law of Strickland


v. Washington, a lawyer's decision about how to defend a


client facing a death sentence must be supported either by


a thorough investigation or by a reasonable professional


judgment supporting limitation on investigation.


In this case, the Maryland Court of Appeals and 

the Fourth Circuit applied that rule in an objectively


unreasonable manner.  Kevin Wiggins' lawyers did not


fulfill what this Court described in Williams against


Taylor as their obligation under Strickland to investigate


thoroughly their client's background, and no reasonable


professional judgment in fact supports or could support


their failure to do so.


QUESTION:  Do you think the Williams case is a


white horse for you, that is, I mean, that it's exactly


identical to this case?

 MR. VERRILLI:  I do not think it's exactly


identical to this case, Your Honor, but we think it


clearly informs this case both by explaining what an --


what an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland


amounts to and in emphasizing the critical importance of


investigating a -- a -- your client's background as -- as


a prerequisite to making informed, reasonable choices


about how best to defend your client.


QUESTION:  But -- but wasn't Williams decided


after the Maryland Supreme Court's opinion here?


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, it was Justice Scalia,


but --


QUESTION:  So, therefore, it can't be used for


purposes of deciding whether what Maryland did was an


unreasonable application of then-existing Federal law. 

MR. VERRILLI:  I disagree with that, Justice


Scalia, for the following reason.  Williams, like this


case, was an AEDPA case and all Williams could do was


decide whether Strickland had been unreasonably applied. 


Williams was -- because Williams was an AEDPA case, was a


2254(d)(1) case, Williams could break no new ground by


definition, and therefore, the -- the fact that Williams


concluded what it did about Strickland's requirement,


means that that is what Strickland requires.  And that --


and -- and so we don't think it -- we're going beyond

AEDPA in the least.


QUESTION:  Yet, you go back to Strickland and


you can't find the principle that you're now enunciating.


MR. VERRILLI:  Oh, no, no.  I disagree with


that, Mr. Chief Justice.  We think it's right on page 690


and 691 of -- of Strickland, and here's the principle that


we think -- Strickland specifically says, as we read it,


that a lawyer's judgment about how to defend a client has


either got to be based on complete investigation or, if


it's based on less than complete investigation, it's


reasonable only to the extent that reasonable professional


judgment supports the limitation on investigation.  That's


the rule.


QUESTION:  Last year in Bell -- Bell versus


Cohen -- Cone, we stressed that it is a tremendously 

deferential regard that we have to the lawyer's action in


a case like that.


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, but there's a fundamental


difference between this case and Bell v. Cone, Mr. Chief


Justice, and it's this.  Bell v. Cone was not a case about


the failure to investigate.  That was purely a case about


counsel's decisions about what information to present to


the sentencer after having done what was indisputably a


thorough investigation.


And the reason that's critical is because as --

as we read Strickland, the whole point of the deference


given to counsel's choices about what to present is


premised on the adequacy of the investigation that


precedes them.  That is what the source of the deferential


stance towards presentation is.  It's the adequacy of


investigation.


QUESTION:  Is that what this case is about,


Mr. Verrilli, about failure to investigate?


MR. VERRILLI:  This case is about both, but it's


principally about --


QUESTION:  It would seem to me if it were, you


would have to establish pretty clearly that counsel did


not know these many things that you say he did not know. 


And in fact, counsel was never asked the question, did you


know this, did you know that, did you know -- we don't 

know what counsel --


I -- I'm looking at the joint appendix on


page 490.  He knew a lot of these things.  He's -- he's --


he's asked did you know that Wiggins had been removed from


his natural mother as a result of a finding of neglect and


abuse when he was 6 years old?  Yes, he says, I knew that. 


That was in the social service records.  So you knew it. 


Yes.


You also knew that there were reports of sexual


abuse at one of the foster homes.  Yes, he knew that.

 You also knew he had his hands burned as a child


as a result of his mother's abuse of him.  Yes, he knew


that.


You also knew about homosexual overtures made


towards him by his Job Corps supervisor.  Yes.


And you also knew he was -- he was borderline


mentally retarded.  Yes.


Now, that -- that examination could have --


could have gone further, but you didn't know, did you,


this, this, this, this, and this.  There's no examination


like that.  We know that he knew many things about this


person's background, but we don't know that he didn't know


the rest of it.


MR. VERRILLI:  I disagree with that, Justice


Scalia.


know it?


QUESTION:  Well, how do we know that he didn't


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, here's how.  There -- there


are two absolutely compelling reasons, but before I get to


them, I think it's important to look at the very next


thing that the lawyer says in that colloquy.  And the very


next thing the lawyer says is, well, yes, at least I knew


what was reported in other people's reports.  And that is


what led the Maryland Court of Appeals to the conclusion


it reached, which was that the social service records and

the pre-sentence records, other people's reports,


contained that information, and we have shown by clear and


convincing evidence that they do not.


But there are two additional points that are


critical here, and the first one is this.  The trier of


fact, the actual judge who heard that testimony --


QUESTION:  I -- I have to correct you.  That --


he -- he didn't say that all of this that he knew he only


knew because it was in other people's reports.  The


question was -- he had just said -- and you also knew that


he was borderline mentally retarded.  Yes.


He -- then another question is begun.  You knew


all -- he interrupts the question and he says, at least I


knew that as it was reported in other people's reports,


yes. 


The that was the fact that he was borderline 

mentally retarded.


MR. VERRILLI:  Justice Scalia, that is not how


the --


QUESTION:  That's how it reads.


MR. VERRILLI:  -- Maryland Court of Appeals read


it.  It is not how the Fourth Circuit read it.


QUESTION:  The court of appeals and the Fourth


Circuit must have read it wrong because that's the way it


reads.


MR. VERRILLI:  But -- but, Justice Scalia, what

matters here for AEDPA purposes under (d)(2) is whether


the court of appeals based its determination on an


unreasonable factual finding, and there are two -- there


are two critical indicia here that it did.  The first


one -- the first one is this.  Well, there are three.


First, the records don't contain the


information.


Second, the trier of fact, the judge who heard


this testimony, concluded -- and this is at page 605 and


606 of the joint appendix -- that Mr. Schlaich, the lawyer


who gave that testimony, did not know what was in the


social -- what was in the social history subsequently


prepared.


QUESTION:  This was in the trial itself or in a


State habeas proceeding?


MR. VERRILLI:  In the State habeas proceeding,


Your Honor.  His -- at the conclusion of his testimony and


during closing argument by the -- by the government in


that State habeas proceeding, the -- the trier of fact who


heard the testimony, could assess demeanor, could assess


credibility, heard all the other evidence, saw all the


other evidence, concluded that he didn't know and found it


was error.


And then -- and the next point that we think


conclusively demonstrates that -- that the lawyers did not

know is this.  Remember that -- that at the close of the


sentencing proceeding, not the post-conviction proceeding,


Mr. Chief Justice, but the actual sentencing proceeding,


counsel for Wiggins made a proffer of what mitigating


evidence they would have submitted to the sentencing jury


had their motion to bifurcate been granted.  That proffer


doesn't mention any of the mitigating evidence that --


that we have shown in the social history -- doesn't


mention the terrible abuse of the first 6 years of his


life.  It doesn't mention the horrible burning incident. 


It doesn't mention the sexual abuse.  It doesn't mention


the homelessness.  There's no conceivable reason why


counsel would have withheld all of that information from


its proffer at the conclusion of the sentencing phase of


the proceeding if counsel knew that and could --

QUESTION:  So that counsel referred to other


people's reports and other reports.  Can we draw any


inference from the record that there were some reports


other than the -- I take it it's the social -- social


services report?


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I think there was --


QUESTION:  And the pre-sentence and social --


MR. VERRILLI:  Pre-sentence.


QUESTION:  -- and social services?  Were there


any other documents that --

 MR. VERRILLI:  The -- there is a document which


the State has lodged which indicates that there were


transcripts of interviews with family members.  Those


aren't in the record, but I think the same exact analysis,


the same exact inference has to be drawn.  If those had


included the kind of terrible descriptions of -- of abuse,


it would have shown up in the psychologist's report


because, after all, what that document shows is the


psychologist got those interviews and it would have shown


up in the proffer because that is the most --


QUESTION:  And -- and the psychologist's is the


social -- social services report.


MR. VERRILLI:  No.  That's separate --


QUESTION:  That's a separate report.


MR. VERRILLI: 


That's a separate --

QUESTION:  That's exactly my -- look, there is a


document here called lodging and it says, Baltimore City


Department of Social Services Department File.  Now, in


looking through it briefly, I cannot find in it all the


references that you say are not in it.


MR. VERRILLI:  They are --


QUESTION:  I don't think they're there.


MR. VERRILLI:  They are not there.


QUESTION:  But this says, other people's


reports, and I'm perhaps going to hear in about 20 minutes

from now that there could be other reports to which he was


referring which are not in this document and which might


be those other -- those other interviews with other


people, et cetera.  In other words, I don't want you to


sit down -- it's -- it's one thing if I'm supposed to look


at this document and say did this lawyer investigate the


background, and the answer I think would be no.  But it's


quite another thing if he knew all kinds of other things


from other sources, namely about the burned hands, all the


things you've listed.  So I want to be sure.


Now, you're referring me one other thing, the


proffer.  But in respect to the proffer, since I've read


the briefs, I suspect I will hear the following.  Of


course, he didn't want to proffer this.  His strategic


decision was to make the jury think that this man might 

not have done it, and the more lunatic we make him sound,


the more the jury is going to think the opposite.


MR. VERRILLI:  Justice Breyer, let me -- let


me --


QUESTION:  Or I suspect I'll hear that because


I've read it.


MR. VERRILLI:  Let me address --


QUESTION:  So I would like you --


MR. VERRILLI:  Let me address that directly


because I think this goes the essence of why the Maryland

Court of Appeals judgment was an unreasonable application


of -- of the Strickland rule, and it's this.


The proffer occurred in the following context. 


Counsel for Wiggins made a motion to bifurcate the


sentencing proceeding so that they could first retry the


factual case of eligibility, and then if they lost, they


could then put on the full-blown mitigation case.


QUESTION:  That would have involved the


principal issue had they -- as a separate --


MR. VERRILLI:  Right.  Bifurcation would have


first involved the principalship, and then had


principalship been established to the jury's satisfaction,


they would have moved to the issue of mitigation.  And


the -- and the trial judge denied that motion.  Now, he


denied that motion -- this is critical -- on the first day 

of the sentencing hearing.  So up to the first day of the


sentencing hearing, Kevin Wiggins' lawyer's strategy was


obviously to prepare both a principalship case and a


mitigation case because they made a motion that was


designed to allow them to do precisely that.  So there is


no conceivable justification for them to have failed to do


everything a reasonable lawyer would have done to develop


a mitigation case.


And they -- and what the proffer shows -- I'm


afraid the proffer cannot, Justice Breyer, be explained on

the basis that Your Honor described for this reason.  The


point of the proffer -- the point of the proffer was to


show the judge and to create a record on appeal of what


they would have shown had the bifurcation been granted and


they could have tried their mitigation case.  This proffer


was their mitigation case.


QUESTION:  What about the first part which was


Justice Kennedy's part, I think so far all of our parts --


questions, which is when you read just the part that


Justice Scalia read to you -- and he says it's on the


basis of other people's reports -- will the other side


concede or how do we know it's -- what he's referring to


is this document rather than some other set of documents?


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I think what's critical in


that regard is what the Maryland Court of Appeals found 

because what AEDPA requires deference to is factual


findings made by a State court.  And what the -- and the


factual finding that the Maryland Court of Appeals


found -- made is on page 121 of the appendix to the


petition in the -- in the second paragraph there.  It --


it says, counsel was indeed aware of Wiggins' unfortunate


background.  They had available to them not only the


pre-sentence investigation, but detailed social service


records documenting sexual abuse and physical abuse.


That is the sum and substance, the total, of

what the Maryland Court of Appeals said in terms of the


facts here.  It's the sole factual finding.  That factual


finding --


QUESTION:  Did it say, and nothing else?  Did it


say, and nothing else?


MR. VERRILLI:  It said --


QUESTION:  You're -- you're making it as though


it was a factual finding that this is all that he knew. 


Now, they knew that he knew that, but they didn't make a


factual finding that he didn't know anything else.


MR. VERRILLI:  They -- the factual -- the only


factual finding they made -- the only -- the only -- the


only thing that supports and explicates the general


statement at the outset of that paragraph that they were


aware of his unfortunate childhood is the specific factual 

finding that the social service records documented sexual


abuse and documented physical abuse.  We've shown by clear


and convincing evidence that that finding is wrong.


And then under (d)(2) in AEDPA the question is


whether the Maryland Court of Appeals' judgment was -- was


based on an -- an unreasonable factual determination.  And


we've shown that the only thing that they found --


QUESTION:  Mr. Verrilli, I'd like to come back


to the habeas -- the State habeas decision that you --


that you cited us to, which is on the joint appendix

page 604.  Now, as I understand it, if you're making a


claim of failure to investigate, the burden is on you to


show that counsel did not know things that he would have


learned on investigation.  The burden is on you.


As I read this court's decision, what the court


is simply saying is, I don't ever remember a death penalty


case where there was not a social history done.  And so it


was simply unthinkable not to have a social history.


Then when you go across the page, so, therefore,


based upon the evidence that I have seen, I'm concluding


it was error for them not to investigate it because I


don't have any information before me to believe that they


did not have this information available to them.


You see the context?  And I understand what


you're saying, but the context of this case is that I have 

no reason to believe that they did have all of this


information.  That's not -- that's not enough to satisfy


your burden.  That court would have had to find I believe


that they did not have this information, not I just have


no reason to believe that they had it.


MR. VERRILLI:  But --


QUESTION:  The court should have had to find


they did not have this information.  It doesn't find that. 


It just says I have no reason to believe that they had it.


MR. VERRILLI:  Justice Scalia, I disagree.  I do

simply because you're always supposed to do a social


history.

evidence that I have seen, I'm concluding it was error for

them not to investigate it.  If they knew the information,


he never would have reached that conclusion.


QUESTION:  No.  He reached the conclusion


because --


MR. VERRILLI:  And that's completely supported


by the proffer.


QUESTION:  He reached the conclusion because


he --


QUESTION:  No two voices at the same time. 


Justice Scalia is asking you a question.


MR. VERRILLI:  Excuse me.


QUESTION:  He reached the conclusion because he


said, I have no reason to believe that they had the


information.  He never made the finding that they didn't


have it.


MR. VERRILLI:  I think that's implicit, Justice


Scalia, in his conclusion that it was error not to


investigate, and I think it's completely confirmed by the


proffer which didn't include any of this information and


for which there would have been absolutely no explanation


for its exclusion.  Absolutely none whatsoever.  So I


think with respect to the -- to the factual finding that


the Maryland Court of Appeals made, that the social


services records documented abuse and provided the source


of his knowledge, that's clearly erroneous.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Verrilli, you said absolutely no


reason why it wouldn't come in if they had it.  Why


couldn't counsel for the defense think if we introduce


this, it's going to be subject to cross examination?  And


if we look at that social history, we find out that the


whole thing is -- the defendant himself was the source of


the information about the horrible sexual abuse he had


been exposed to as a child.  The jury might find that a


person who had been so abused would be full of hate and


therefore very likely would have had the mental state to


carry out this brutal murder that -- in other words, that


this kind of information could be a two-edged sword.  The


jury could infer from it he's not fully responsible for


his acts or, on the other hand, that this person was


violent, full of hate, and indeed committed this brutal 

murder.


MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I think, Your Honor, I'm


going to answer Your Honor's question directly, but I -- I


need a minute to do it.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. VERRILLI:  The question under Strickland, it


seems to us, is that once you've concluded that there was


a failure to investigate adequately, the question is


whether there is a reasonable probability that the outcome


would have been different as a result of that failure.

And in this case, it seems to me, that means that what


we -- and Strickland also stresses that that is an


objective test.  That is not based on the idiosyncracies


of the individual decision makers.  It's an objective


analysis.


And so the question here is whether had this


information been investigated, if it was in the hands of


competent counsel, is there a reasonable probability that


competent counsel would have used it and introduced it,


and then is there a reasonable probability that it would


have affected the sentencing jury's outcome.


And the second half of that analysis, it seems


to us, is answered a fortiori by Williams against Taylor.


The first half of that analysis seems to us


clearly to support relief here because, as I take Your 

Honor's question, it's a question of, well, there might be


a justification for not submitting this evidence to the


jury.  Yes, there might.  We think in a case like this


one, it would be an unreasonable choice not to do so


because this evidence has so little of what this Court has


described in other cases like Burger and Darden as a sharp


double edge, and it is so powerfully mitigating that we


don't think it would have that effect.


But we -- we respectfully suggest that's not the


relevant question.  Once you've established deficient

performance with respect to investigation, then we shift


to the prejudice inquiry, and it's an objective analysis. 


And so long as there is a reasonable probability that


competent counsel would have used this information in


combination with the case that they made, then -- and


there's a reasonable probability that the outcome would


have been affected, which I think Williams v. Taylor


establishes for us, then we have shown what we need to


show to be entitled to relief.


QUESTION:  Do you --


QUESTION:  What are the --


QUESTION:  What do you think the test is that


Williams against Taylor lays down as to determining a -- a


probability of a different outcome?


MR. VERRILLI: 


Well, I think, if I may just draw 

from Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion with respect to


that.  If there's an obvious failure on the part of the


State court to consider the totality of the record, that's


an unreasonable application with respect to prejudice. 


And with -- in Williams, of course, as Your Honor's


dissenting opinion pointed out, there was a much more


severe case of aggravating information than here. 


Williams had a terrible, long record of violence.  Wiggins


has none.  And the mitigating evidence here is even


stronger than the mitigating evidence that existed in the


21

Williams case.


And so we think it follows directly from


Williams that -- that if you look at whether there's a


reasonable probability that the outcome would have been


different here on the basis of submitting this evidence,


that we think that's a very clear and easy case under the


standards that Williams sets.


QUESTION:  Are -- are you making any argument


that the ruling on the bifurcation motion might also have


been different if there had been a proffer of this?  Or


did the judge rule on the bifurcation motion without


knowing what the mitigation evidence might be?


MR. VERRILLI:  The -- factually, Justice


Kennedy, it's the latter.  The -- he ruled on the


bifurcation motion at the outset of the -- of the trial. 

QUESTION:  Is -- is that a common motion in


Maryland capital cases, to try to bifurcate the sentencing


proceeding?


MR. VERRILLI:  At the time it was, and the


reason it was, Mr. Chief Justice, is because sometime


shortly before this case was tried in Baltimore County,


another Baltimore County judge had allowed such a motion.


And we think that fact reinforces the utterly


unreasonable character of the failure to investigate here. 


These lawyers had a -- had -- had to think there was a

reasonable prospect they were going to be able to put on a


mitigation case, but we know that all they had to put on


that mitigation case was the psychologist's testing.  And


after all, that -- all that psychologist did was test.


QUESTION:  But they would -- they would be


fighting over the principalship too, would they not?


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, but that -- the point of


bifurcation was to do principalship first, and if they


prevailed on principalship, they wouldn't go to the second


phase.  And only if they didn't prevail on principalship


would they go to the second phase where they wouldn't have


any of the tactical cross currents they were worried about


because principalship was already established and they


could go whole hog and make the fullest mitigation case


possible.


And the fact that they were -- that they were


endeavoring to follow that strategy until the first day of


the sentencing hearing, October 11th, 1989, shows that


they didn't -- that all they had as of October 11, 1989,


was the psychologist's report -- shows that they did not


investigate at the level that Strickland requires.


QUESTION:  Mr. --


QUESTION:  What about the psychological reports,


Mr. Verrilli?  Those were available to defense counsel?


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, Justice O'Connor.

 QUESTION:  And indeed, obtained by defense


counsel.


MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  And what did they reveal in this area


of mitigation?


MR. VERRILLI:  They were -- the -- the -- there


are two things that are important about the psychologist's


report:  one, what it does contain; the other, what it


doesn't contain.


The psychologist was commissioned in this case


to do testing of Mr. Wiggins, intelligence testing and


then psychological profiling, MMPI-type testing.  The


evidence is undisputed about that.  That's what the


psychologist did.


The thing that's significant about what was 

discovered was the fact that Mr. Wiggins was of borderline


intelligence, which seems to us quite relevant and


entirely consistent -- it would have been entirely


consistent, even absent bifurcation, to use that evidence,


in addition to an effort to disprove principalship,


because the borderline intelligence would easily and


strongly have supported the conclusion that Mr. Wiggins


was an accomplice and not a principal.


But the thing it doesn't show is any of the


history of abuse, and that's because the psychologist

wasn't commissioned to do that.  They didn't do what they


needed to do here, which was to do the social history. 


The evidence is clear that it was routine practice in


these public defenders' office to do the social history. 


They admitted that.  The evidence is clear -- and the --


and the public defenders admitted it -- that funds were


available for that purpose.  They just didn't do it.  They


just dropped the ball on this.  They didn't do what all


the lawyers in their office did routinely, and they didn't


do what the State post-conviction trial judge said he had


never seen not done, which is prepare this social history


and --


QUESTION:  Mr. Verrilli, is -- is there any


evidence, one way or the other, as to whether defense


counsel simply sat down with the defendant and said, tell 

us about your background and what has happened to you in


your life?  Is there any evidence one way or the other


about that?


MR. VERRILLI:  There is not.  There is not, but


it wouldn't be a surprise, Justice Souter, that even if an


interview like that occurred, that the defendant would not


have revealed it, that -- it's very difficult to get this


kind of history of horrible personal abuse out of a


defendant.  It very often requires a professional to do


it.  That is why -- that's the very reason why the social

workers are brought in to do the kinds of social histories

If there are no further questions, I'd like to

QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Verrilli.


Mr. Bair.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. BAIR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


I'd like to first start with a correction in the


factual record in this case.  Counsel for petitioner


has -- has referred the Court to JA605 and 606.  And


indeed, that was a comment made by the post-conviction


court during the State post-conviction proceedings. 

However, that was an oral comment from the bench in April


of 1994.


The post-conviction court's written opinion did


not issue until 1997.  And in the post-conviction written


opinion -- it was a 257-page written opinion.  And that


written opinion basically countermanded and superseded and


disavowed the statements that are on page JA605 and 606. 


If you look to page 137a of the appendix to the petition


for writ of certiorari, that is where you have the


excerpts from --

 QUESTION:  What page?  What --


MR. BAIR:  137a, Your Honor.  That is where


you have the excerpt from the State habeas, State


post-conviction court's written opinion.  And if you look


at footnote 261 on that page --


QUESTION:  These are footnotes in the State


court's opinion or footnotes in the -- in the appendix?


MR. BAIR:  This is in -- these are footnotes in


the State post-conviction court's opinion.  It was, as I


said, a very lengthy opinion and had several hundred


footnotes as well as 257 pages.


By the time the post-conviction court rendered


its final decision, its written decision, it had the


transcripts from the post-conviction proceeding.  And --


and as you may recall, the post-conviction proceeding 

lasted 5 months.  Testimony was taken over 7 days in a


5-month post-conviction hearing.


That footnote 261 is the transcript that Justice


Scalia was referring to which is on JA490 and 491.  So


this is the testimony that the post-conviction court used


to make its fact finding.  And in its fact finding it said


Schlaich had more information than appeared in the PSI


report.


I would go back to what was said earlier.  There


were several sources of the information for trial counsel.

In fact, I would -- I would tally them up to be six


different sources.  You had, obviously, the DSS reports,


the lodged material that Justice Breyer referred to,


220 pages of social background, educational background,


medical background, because petitioner was in foster care


from when he was about 6 years old to when he --


QUESTION:  Let me just get one thing straight on


the -- the long footnote that you quote.  They end up


saying, you knew all this and you did not get a social


history.  Do you think it was -- a competent counsel would


have gotten a social history or not knowing what he said


he knew?


MR. BAIR:  I think he got a -- he -- he got a


social history in a different way, Your Honor.  He didn't


hire a forensic social worker. 


Instead, he obtained 

lengthy DSS reports, hired a psychologist, hired a


criminologist, talked to family members, talked to the


client.  He didn't do it in the way that -- that counsel


now says it should have been done.


QUESTION:  Is -- is the way that counsel says it


should have been done the way that lawyers typically do it


in -- in Maryland?


MR. BAIR:  I think they do it in different ways,


Your Honor.  I think -- I think sometimes they use


forensic social workers.  Sometimes they use

psychologists.


QUESTION:  But they're wrong to tell us that


they normally use social workers.  Is that right?


MR. BAIR:  I think --


QUESTION:  That was -- his representation was


that this case is unique because every other member of the


defense bar routinely gets the social history.  Are you --


is that right or wrong?


MR. BAIR:  I think it's wrong.  I think it's


wrong, Your Honor.  I think that lawyers in Maryland use


psychiatrists, they use psychologists, they use social


workers, they use combinations thereof.


QUESTION:  But he didn't use any of these.


MR. BAIR:  Pardon me?


QUESTION: 


He didn't use any of those. 

MR. BAIR:  He -- he used a psychologist and he


used a criminologist.  And he obtained very lengthy DSS


records.


QUESTION:  If -- the DSS records that he


obtained -- are they all in the lodging or there are some


other ones?


MR. BAIR:  Yes.  They're all -- they're all in


the lodging.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, if -- if -- it's


5 months -- it took 5 months.  They went into this in

great care.  You've given us the lodging.  I've looked


through the lodging, my law clerk more thoroughly.  I


can't find a word about the sexual abuse.  I can't find a


word about the frightful things that he -- one I did find


where it said for -- when he was taken from his mother


at age 6, it's true that the mother hadn't fed him for


2 days.  All right.  That's there, but none of this other


stuff is there.


And -- and, indeed, if he looked at any of it --


anywhere for this other stuff, where would he have looked? 


Why wasn't that in the record which took 5 months, if in


fact he looked?  Why was there no more reference to it


than an ambiguous statement where he seems to refer to the


lodging?


MR. BAIR: 


Your Honor, a couple of -- a couple 

of points to be made.


First of all, I -- I agree, and I think we state


in our brief, there is no specific reference to sexual


abuse in those -- in -- in the lodging.


QUESTION:  And that's actually -- to me that's


the most serious thing there is, I mean, in terms of


shaping an individual who could later turn out the way


that some have turned out.  And -- and there is -- it was


horrible in this case, and -- and there's absolutely no


reference whatsoever that I can find that suggests that

this lawyer even knew about it.


MR. BAIR:  Well, there is, Your Honor.  That --


that goes back to JA490 and 491.


QUESTION:  He said he knew about it.


MR. BAIR:  But the lawyer explicitly testified


that he knew of it.


QUESTION:  And what was -- that's why I want to


know since -- since that statement, the two pages out of


5 months, when I read them -- people can characterize them


differently, but it seemed to me ambiguous, and the


written reports could have easily referred to what I call


the lodging.  But if they didn't refer to the lodging,


what did they refer to?


MR. BAIR:  The written reports and -- and I


think the reports of others could be either written 

reports or oral reports.  I think --


QUESTION:  What he said was -- what did he say? 


He said, in other people's reports.  Yes, they could have


been.  So I would like to know.  There's been 5 months of


trial, as you said.  There have been endless proceedings. 


In your opinion, what did they refer to if, in fact, they


did not refer to the lodging?  Because if they did refer


to the lodging, the lawyer in those two pages out of the


5 months simply made a mistake, repeating what he knew


later and thinking that he had learned it earlier from the

lodging.


MR. BAIR:  Your Honor, again, two -- two points


to be made.  One is if there is any ambiguity or any lack


of a record here, I think under Strickland that inures to


the detriment of petitioner.  He had the burden at this


hearing to rebut the -- the strong presumption of


competence, the strong presumption of reasonable conduct.


But let me go back to what the reports were. 


You had reports from the client.  And I think, although,


as -- as was asked earlier by Justice Souter, there's


nothing in the record to say whether he spoke to his


client.  I think we can infer that he spoke to his client. 


He represented him for close to a year.  Counsel for


petitioner at post-conviction never pursued those lines of


questioning. 


So I think we can assume that this lawyer 

talked to his client.


QUESTION:  The -- the post-conviction proceeding


extended over a period of 5 months.  How many trial days


were there?


MR. BAIR:  There were 7 days, Your Honor, where


testimony was taken in those 5 months --


QUESTION:  So it had recessed and then


resumed --


MR. BAIR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- several times.

 MR. BAIR:  Yes, several times.  It was --


QUESTION:  Mr. Bair, you -- you seem to accept


that -- that all that he knew was as it was reported in


other people's reports.  But I just don't read the text


that way.  He said, at least I knew that as it was


reported in other people's reports.  And the that in that


transcript is that he was borderline mentally retarded.


MR. BAIR:  I agree.


QUESTION:  That is the only thing that he said


he got from other people's reports.


MR. BAIR:  I agree.  I think --


QUESTION:  We don't know where he got all of the


other information that he said he had.


MR. BAIR:  No, but I think logically, going back


to the reports of sexual abuse, there's only one person 

that could have come from because even the Selvog report,


which is what post-conviction counsel prepared -- Selvog


testified at the post-conviction hearing that his sole


source for the information about Wiggins' sexual abuse was


from Wiggins himself.


Now, Wiggins obviously spoke to his attorney. 


He spoke to the psychologist who interviewed him.  He


spoke to the criminologist that trial counsel hired. 


Clearly, I think an inference can be drawn that Wiggins


reported that sexual abuse either directly to his attorney

or to the criminologist or to the psychologist.


QUESTION:  And in your view on page 137a of the


transcript, all of those matters are comprehended in this


question and this answer toward maybe -- 10 lines from the


top.  You also knew that there were reports of sexual


abuse at one of his foster homes?  Yes.


MR. BAIR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  So the term -- the word reports there


means that he relied on things other than that are in the


lodging.


MR. BAIR:  Yes, I think so, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  To your knowledge -- and this is


quite important to me.  I'm just trying to find out what


the -- if they were not referring to the lodging which


contains the reports, if they were not referring to that 

document, they must have been referring to or they were


referring to Wiggins' own statements.


MR. BAIR:  Either Wiggins' own statements or the


reports of the other experts in the case.


QUESTION:  Other experts in the case.


MR. BAIR:  Right.  There was --


QUESTION:  He would have gotten them from?


MR. BAIR:  From Wiggins.


QUESTION:  After the trial was over.


MR. BAIR:  No, no, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  Before, before.


MR. BAIR:  This was all going on --


QUESTION:  That's the criminologist and the --


MR. BAIR:  Yes, yes.  And those reports were


prepared before trial or between trial and sentencing.


There was a 2-and-a-half month postponement between the


time of this trial and the time of the sentencing.


QUESTION:  All right.  So the words, other


people's reports, could have meant Wiggins told me or an


expert whom I hired who talked to Wiggins told me.


MR. BAIR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Yes, okay.


MR. BAIR:  Or I guess the only -- the only


other --


QUESTION: 


That -- that he was mentally 

retarded.  It only goes to whether he was mentally


retarded.


MR. BAIR:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I'm puzzled about another thing.


MR. BAIR:  The only other --


QUESTION:  Do those reports refer to sexual


MR. BAIR:  Pardon me, Your Honor?


QUESTION:  Do those reports refer to sexual


abuse?


abuse?

 MR. BAIR:  The only report that refers to sexual


abuse -- now, the only written report that refers to


sexual abuse is the Selvog report.


QUESTION:  The what?


MR. BAIR:  The -- the Selvog report was the one


done by the social worker during post-conviction by -- by


post-conviction counsel.


The psychologist's report was an oral report. 


So we don't really know exactly what he knew because


there -- that was never reduced to writing.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm still puzzled.  Were there


any written reports available to the lawyer that referred


to sexual abuse that we know about?


MR. BAIR:  No.


QUESTION: 


So then when he said you know that 

there were reports of sexual abuse at one of his foster


homes, he was wrong.


MR. BAIR:  No.  I think he -- he was referring


to -- he could have been referring to reports of Wiggins


himself.


QUESTION:  Oh, oh.  I see what you're saying --


QUESTION:  Oral reports.


MR. BAIR:  Oral reports.


QUESTION:  That -- that word reports does not


mean written reports.

 MR. BAIR:  I don't think it has to refer to


written reports, Your Honor.


The only -- just to follow up with Justice


Breyer, the only other report was the pre-sentence


investigation.  That was the other written report that was


available to counsel.


QUESTION:  But that didn't have --


MR. BAIR:  No, no, no.


QUESTION:  I mean, what's worrying me obviously


is we're -- we're turning an awful lot here on this word,


other reports, which came in a fairly long hearing and


which would normally be taken as referring to written


reports, though it doesn't say that.  And I'm -- that


makes me concerned.  I'm not sure where to go with it.


MR. BAIR: 


Well, I think two points, Your Honor. 

One, counsel did testify and it was undisputed -- it was


never in any way negated through cross examination or any


other vehicle -- that he knew of sexual abuse.  In fact,


he specifically answered the question, the more specific


sexual abuse question, I knew about the Job Corps


overture.  So those answers are unequivocal and they stand


in the record unchallenged.


QUESTION:  Yes, but that's troubling because the


Job Corps overture is -- is quite mild compared to the


repeated days, months-on-end physical abuse suffered at

the hands of the stepfather.


MR. BAIR:  I agree.


QUESTION:  And it seems to me that this -- well,


I'll ask you.  Does this permit us to make the inference


that if he had known this, he would have brought it out?


MR. BAIR:  I think --


QUESTION:  Because it's just very difficult to


see why he would not have.


MR. BAIR:  Well, I think he made a -- a


reasonable tactical decision.


QUESTION:  That goes to the tactical point.


MR. BAIR:  I think he made a reasonable tactical


decision.  He had a powerful case.  Under Maryland law,


the jury had to find unanimously and beyond a reasonable


doubt that Wiggins was the principal, that is, the actual 

killer in this case.


They also had to find unanimously and beyond a


reasonable doubt that the murder and the robbery occurred


at the same time, and there was evidence in this case. 


This was a very unusual situation in that it wasn't even


clear whether the robbery occurred simultaneously with the


murder.  There was a -- there was a -- a huge dispute at


trial and at sentencing over when Ms. Lacs was killed


because her body was discovered on a Saturday.  Wiggins


was in possession of her car --

 QUESTION:  Mr. Bair, may I ask?  Did counsel


during the -- the sentencing hearing come up with a theory


as to what happened other than that his client was the


killer?


MR. BAIR:  Yes, absolutely.  He challenged


and -- and very strenuously both during opening and -- and


closing -- pointed out the evidence in the case that


showed there were five fingerprints in Ms. Lacs' apartment


that were not tied to anyone.  There was a hat, some sort


of a baseball hat, that was in the apartment.


QUESTION:  No, I understand -- but did he -- did


he suggest who they might have belonged to?  Did he come


up with a theory as to who --


MR. BAIR:  No.  I don't -- I don't think there


was any particular person who was another suspect. 

QUESTION:  He didn't suggest that the man who


lived downstairs might have been involved.


MR. BAIR:  No.  And that -- that was never


challenged as part of any ineffective assistance of


counsel in these proceedings, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bair, what -- what do you respond


to opposing counsel's argument that it doesn't matter


because you didn't know until the eve of trial that you


wouldn't have had a bifurcated proceeding, so you should


have been doing this research in contemplation of a

bifurcated proceeding?


MR. BAIR:  Well, Your Honor, first of all, of


course, our position is they were doing it.  They had,


as -- as I said, lots of information.  They were doing it. 


They were -- they were keeping that option open.


But another answer, Your Honor, is the evidence


would not have been put on.  The more evidence that --


that actually came out in -- in, you know, the


proceedings, the details that we've now learned of through


the Selvog report, they are so double-edged.  They are so


potentially harmful particularly in the context of this


case.  Between the Selvog report and the lodged materials,


the DSS records, the -- the jury would have heard not just


that Kevin Wiggins was -- had been in foster care and had


a clean record, which is all they did hear.  In addition,


if those records had come in, they would have heard that


he hated his biological mother, that he was in fights with


other foster children, that he had once stolen some


gasoline and tried to set fire to -- to a building, that


he had a disturbed personality --


QUESTION:  That all goes to explain why they


wouldn't have put it in, but why didn't they put any of


this in the proffer at the -- to the judge at the --


MR. BAIR:  There -- there was no need to, Your


Honor.  There's no need under Maryland law to give a

detailed proffer.  They -- they did not want to tip off


the other side as to any potential things that might be


negative to their client.


And again, to the degree that we don't know


about the details, it -- it inures to the detriment of


Wiggins.  It was his burden to bring out all of this


evidence and he didn't do it.


QUESTION:  Does -- does the strength of the


mitigating evidence have anything to do with whether a


bifurcated proceeding is allowed?


MR. BAIR:  No.


QUESTION:  Would they have been more likely to


get the bifurcated proceeding if they had come up with a


lot of information about his childhood and so forth?


MR. BAIR:  I don't believe so, Your Honor.  Of


course --


QUESTION:  What does it turn on then?


MR. BAIR:  I think it was -- it was the trial


court's discretion.  I think it was just a -- this was


back in 1989.  There wasn't a lot of definitive law on it


at the time.  Since then, the Maryland Court of Appeals


has said absolutely not.


QUESTION:  Was there a transcript of that


hearing?  He just said, I want a bifurcated hearing and


sat down, or did he say, I want a bifurcated hearing

because there's going to be very substantial mitigating


evidence and I want the jury to consider that separately? 


What did he -- do we have a transcript of what he said


here?


MR. BAIR:  I think we do have a transcript, Your


Honor, and my recollection is that there was a short


discussion of it, not -- not a detailed discussion of it.


QUESTION:  No, but if he had been in a position


to make a strong proffer, why wouldn't he have made it? 


His case for a bifurcated hearing would have been stronger


if he had had a strong proffer.  Wouldn't it have been?


MR. BAIR:  It would have been stronger, Your


Honor, but I think in all likelihood if you look -- if you


look at the Maryland sentencing law, it contemplates it,


as I said, the court of appeals in Maryland has since held 

definitively.  In fact, in the direct appeal in this case,


in the Wiggins case itself on direct appeal, they have


held that the Maryland sentencing procedure in capital


cases requires that the jury go through certain steps, and


those steps all have to be done at a unitary hearing. 


Obviously, there's a bifurcated guilt/innocence and


sentencing.


QUESTION:  Well --


QUESTION:  Well, obviously, the -- the defense


counsel didn't know until the motion was made and ruled

upon for a bifurcated hearing whether the judge would


grant it, and there's no reason presumably that defense


counsel should not have investigated the mitigating


circumstances pending that ruling.


MR. BAIR:  I agree.


QUESTION:  And yet, we don't have a clear


understanding of what he knew.  And in fact, did not


defense counsel tell the jury for sentencing that they


would be hearing evidence about the defendant's


background --


MR. BAIR:  They -- they did --


QUESTION:  -- at sentencing?  And then nothing


was put on.


MR. BAIR:  No, not -- not really, Your Honor.


QUESTION: 


I mean, what -- what is the jury to 

make of that?  It's so odd.


MR. BAIR:  I don't -- I don't think so, Justice


O'Connor.  I think -- I think what counsel did is if you


look at the essence of the -- the approach at sentencing,


clearly it was we're contesting principalship.  There was


one comment about you're going to hear what a tough life


he had.


Now, that was done I think for a couple reasons. 


One is the counsel knew that petitioner could allocute and


probably would allocute personally to -- to the -- the

jury.


They also knew that there was going to be a


criminologist who was going to testify because the jury


knew there was only two choices for this man, either life


or death.  That was -- and life without parole.  But they


knew it was either life or life without parole or death. 


And they were also putting on evidence by a criminologist


that would show that Wiggins would adjust well to a life


sentence.  So I think they -- they also knew that -- that


the pre-sentence report --

MR. BAIR:  Thank you, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Mr. Himmelfarb, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The position of the United States is that the


Sixth Amendment imposed no obligation to present evidence


of petitioner's background at sentencing.  It imposed no


obligation to conduct a more extensive investigation of


his background before sentencing.  Those conclusions


follow from a straightforward application of Strickland


versus Washington which judges attorney performance by a

single standard, whether it was reasonable under all the


circumstances of the case.


The decision to choose a principalship defense


and to reject a mitigation defense falls comfortably


within the wide range --


QUESTION:  What's the bifurcated -- I've never


heard of a bifurcated sentencing hearing.  How does that


work?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  My understanding, Justice


Breyer, is that the basis for the motion was that the


principalship defense could be undermined by presenting


the mitigating evidence, so they wanted to do it


separately.


QUESTION:  Right.  So what do you do?  You


present the principalship defense and then the jury votes 

death or life, and then if they vote death, they go on and


present the next one, and if the next jury or the same


jury, having heard the other one, votes life, then it's


life?  I mean, I don't see how it works.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  My understanding is that under


the theory advanced by petitioner's counsel in support of


the bifurcation motion, principalship alone would be


determined at the first phase of the sentencing.  If the


jury found principalship, there would be a second phase at


which counsel could --

 QUESTION:  Okay.  Under those circumstances,


they're saying that, obviously, in that motion he would


have given everything he knew about the background since


he thought it might work that way, and if he didn't,


that's evidence, in fact, amazingly convincing evidence,


that he didn't know.  He didn't know about the sexual


history.


And the main argument they're making has nothing


to do with the strategic choice.  It has to do with his


failure to investigate.


So what's your -- what's your response?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  If you look at the actual


proffer that was made in support of the bifurcation


motion, which is at pages 44 and 45 of the joint appendix,


what counsel said was, I can proffer to the court that in 

a non-bifurcated proceeding, the defense is in a position


of coming forward with evidence regarding psychological


history on Mr. Wiggins.


QUESTION:  This is 40 -- page 44 of the appendix


to the petition?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  No, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's


the joint appendix.


QUESTION:  Oh, the joint appendix?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Page 44 at the bottom.


I'm in a position to come forward with evidence

regarding psychological history on Mr. Wiggins, including


aspects of his life history, including a diagnosis of a


personality disorder, including diagnosis of some


retardation.  So --


QUESTION:  So he says nothing whatsoever about


the most frightful sexual abuse, about having the mother


who did all the things that this one particularly did, not


feeding them, burning their hands on the stove, et cetera. 


I won't list it.  But I just don't see anything in the


thing you've just read that suggests that he knew a single


thing about that.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, it's true it was a


general proffer rather than a highly particularized


proffer.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


And so their point is, 

obviously, if he had known about it, he would have said


something, and the fact that he didn't say something, when


coupled with the ambiguities on the pages, you know, 404


or 405 or 401-402 -- you get what we're talking about, the


footnote -- coupled with that shows that the correct


reading of that is he didn't know about it.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  I think there's an important


point to keep in mind here.  The constitutional right


petitioner has raised in this case is not the duty to


know, it's the duty to investigate.  The claim is that the


47

investigation was constitutionally inadequate.


And the other important thing to keep in mind is


that there is significant evidence in the record that a


significant investigation was done, an investigation which


we think is constitutionally adequate.


QUESTION:  Mr. Himmelfarb, in that connection,


there's something I'd like you to set me straight on.


There was a statement at some point that each of the


defense counsel thought the other was going to bear the


laboring awe in working up the mitigation case.  Now, it


seems to me that each one thought the other was doing it


and the other wasn't doing it.  That would be ineffective


representation if each one thought the other was


investigating and it turned out neither investigated.


MR. HIMMELFARB: 


I agree that would be 

problematic, but I don't think the record bears that


suggestion out, again, going to the joint appendix.


QUESTION:  Well, where -- where do I get that


notion from that each one thought the other was


principally responsible for working up the mitigation


case?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Petitioner makes that argument


in his brief, and there are record cites to support it.


But we don't think the record cites do, in fact, support


the notion that each counsel thought the other was

responsible for investigating the mitigation case.


There were two lawyers, Schlaich and Nethercott. 


At page 485 of the joint appendix, Schlaich testified that


after he left the Baltimore County Public Defenders Office


and went to another office, from that point forward his


co-counsel, Ms. Nethercott, did most of the mitigation


preparation with his guidance.


Then Ms. Nethercott testified at the


post-conviction hearing as well, and her testimony was


that she had no responsibility for retaining experts,


that that was Schlaich's responsibility.


So I think that's a far cry from testimony by


either that only the other one had responsibility for


preparing the mitigation case.  Each one was testifying


about his or her particular responsibilities. 

QUESTION:  Yes, but where -- the page you refer


to, he says, when asked what he did in -- in mitigation,


he said, well, basically what we did in mitigation was


attempt to retry the factual case and try to convince the


jury on the principalship issue.  That doesn't sound like


the kind of mitigation we're talking about.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, that's right, Justice


Stevens.  It remains the case, though, that a substantial


amount of investigation was done.  That testimony --


QUESTION:  But this part of the transcript

certainly doesn't support that proposition.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well --


QUESTION:  That's the part you called our


attention --


MR. HIMMELFARB:  -- in fairness to Mr. Schlaich,


I think he was interpreting the question to mean what was


your defense at sentencing, not so much what was your


mitigation --


QUESTION:  That's right.  So this part does not


support the -- the proposition that he did any mitigating


research himself or with the other person.  He's talking


about the principalship issue.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  I was just responding to


Justice Ginsburg's question about whether it was true that


each one testified that the other was responsible for the 

investigation.  My only point is that I don't think the


record bears out that suggestion in petitioner's brief.


QUESTION:  But it also doesn't show that there


was substantial investigation, which is what you went on


to say, and I don't think it's supported.


MR. HIMMELFARB:  I do, Justice Kennedy.  The


investigation that was done in this case by trial counsel


was not materially different from the investigation that


was done by post-conviction counsel.  It was trial


counsel, after all, who obtained the social services

records that documented a history of neglect.  Trial


counsel directed public defender investigators to go out


and interview petitioner's family members, which they did. 


Trial counsel hired a psychologist to conduct clinical


interviews of petitioner which were done.


Really the only difference between what trial


counsel did and what post-conviction counsel did was that


post-conviction counsel hired a social worker, a so-called


mitigation specialist, who supervised the investigation


and pulled the information together in a report.


But we're talking here about whether there is a


constitutional deficiency in the investigation, and any


difference in the two investigations, which is really the


fact that the social worker was there in the one but not


the other, we think can't have constitutional 

significance.


I do want to say a little bit about the duty to


present claim because most of the focus in the argument


has been on the question of the duty to investigate.


We think that the principal defense was


reasonable both because a finding of no principalship


would have been an absolute bar to imposition of the death


penalty and because the principalship case that the State


put on here was so weak.


We also think it was reasonable not to present a

mitigation defense either in addition to the principalship


defense or instead of it.  It was reasonable not to


present it in addition to the principal defense because it


had a -- a very serious possibility of undermining it.  It


was reasonable not to present it instead of the


principalship defense because mitigating evidence is just


that.  It's evidence that would be weighed against


aggravating circumstances.  It might or might not lead to


a sentence of death.


A finding of no principalship is a categorical


bar to imposition of the death penalty.  If a single juror


harbored a reasonable doubt about whether petitioner had


carried out the killing himself, it would be obligated to


return a verdict of life.


QUESTION: 


But presumably the -- the 

determination of the facts about the murder was made in


the trial when he was determined guilty or innocent, and


they found him guilty.  And so to try to redetermine that


at sentencing and not to offer any evidence in mitigation,


do you think we can say that's reasonable?


MR. HIMMELFARB:  Absolutely.  There were two


different issues, one issue at the guilt phase, one issue


at the sentencing, as far as the -- as far as petitioner's


role is concerned.  He was charged with first degree


murder.  As the jury was instructed, a conviction of first

degree murder does not necessarily encompass a finding of


principalship, a finding that petitioner himself had


carried out the killing.  So it was perfectly


understandable that petitioner's counsel would think that


contesting principalship at sentencing would be a


reasonable strategy.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb.


Mr. Verrilli, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. VERRILLI:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


I'd like to clarify the -- the facts surrounding


the proffer because it's very important to understand how


this unfolded.


Counsel for Wiggins made a motion.  That motion


was argued on October 11th, 1989 and denied at that time,


the first day of the sentencing hearing.  But the proffer


was not made at that time.  What -- what counsel for my


friend, the United States, described was what Mr. Schlaich


he would proffer if he had to proffer.  He made the actual


proffer at the end of the sentencing proceeding, and it


can be found at pages, I think, 349 to 51 of the -- 348 to


51 of the joint appendix.  And there's a lengthy proffer


there of what he would have shown had he been able to put


on his mitigation case in the -- in the method he wanted

to.  So --


QUESTION:  He does that -- he does that to


argue --


judge --


MR. VERRILLI:  He's making a record for --


QUESTION:  -- after the fact that that the


MR. VERRILLI:  He's making a record for appeal,


Justice Kennedy.  Here's the -- here's what we would have


suffered because we wouldn't have been -- we weren't able


to put on all of this mitigating evidence, and here it is.


And so the sum total of his mitigation case is


right there on the pages.  He's described what it is and


it contains nothing about the horrible abuse that this boy


suffered.  Nothing.


Now, with respect to the question of whose 

responsibility it was, I think it is correct to focus on


the -- the colloquy on page 485 of the -- of the joint


appendix, but the question asked Mr. Schlaich there, as


Justice Stevens' question suggested, was, well, he first


says, well, it was Ms. Nethercott's job to develop


mitigation.  And then the question put to him is what


guidance did you give her, obviously, about how to develop


the mitigation case.  And he says, well, what we decided


to do was retry the factual case.  That's the -- that's


what he says he gave as guidance with respect to

developing the mitigation case.  So it's -- it's


completely clear that this was neglect.  They just dropped


the ball.


Now, with respect to what they actually did at


the sentencing proceeding, picking up on Justice


O'Connor's questions, I think this is critical as well.


Remember, Strickland says no hindsight, but


that's an argument that works against the government in


this case because what these lawyers actually did was, in


opening statement, invite the jury specifically to


consider not only the facts of the crime but, quote, who


this person is, said they would hear he had a difficult


life.  And then they didn't deliver on that promise.


But not only that, Dr. Johnson, the -- the


criminologist, got up and testified, well, yes, violent 

people do tend to adjust well in prison.  Well, that's not


focusing on principalship.  That, once again, is inviting


the jury beyond principalship into the mitigation inquiry


and giving them some reason to -- to mitigate, but of


course, omitting all of the extraordinarily powerful


reasons to mitigate that the social history shows.


And then third, there was as a matter of law in


Maryland a pre-sentence report that had to go to the jury. 


And there was nothing that Wiggins' lawyers could do to


stop that.  And that pre-sentence report gave a highly


55 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

misleading and negative portrayal of Wiggins' background. 


And the -- what -- effect of what these lawyers did was to


leave that unrebutted, further damaging Wiggins'


prospects, further ensuring that he was going to get a


death sentence.


Now, if I could conclude by just reminding this


Court that very recently in the Miller-El case, this Court


said even in the context of Federal habeas, the


deferential review of Federal habeas, there's a difference


between deference and abdication.  And what my friends on


the other side are asking for here is the latter.  They


are asking for abdication.  They are asking this Court to


uphold a judgment even though the only factual finding the


Maryland Court of Appeals made was wrong by clear and


convincing evidence, and even though that proffer 

demonstrates that Wiggins' lawyers did not do the work


necessary and did not know the powerful mitigation case


that could have been made to save this man's life.


Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Verrilli.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
