 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-6261, Robertson v. United 

 (11:16 a.m.)

States, ex rel. Watson.

 Ms. Frankfurt.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACLYN S. FRANKFURT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 This case presents the question whether, 

under our Constitution, the power to prosecute criminal 

contempt in a Federal court rests solely with the 

sovereign.  The United States now agrees that the fact 

that a criminal offense may only be prosecuted by the 

sovereign is a foundational premise of our Constitution. 

Because Mr. Robertson was prosecuted for criminal 

contempt in a private right of action, his prosecution 

was unconstitutional, a nullity in our view, and his 

convictions must be vacated.

 Ms. Watson defends the lower court's ruling 

that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  He didn't make 

that argument, though.  I mean, his -- as I recall, his 

only complaint was that he had been promised that -­

that he wouldn't be -- he wouldn't be prosecuted.  And 

that was his only complaint below, wasn't it?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  His complaint below was that 

he had a plea agreement with the United States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  And that the only lawful or 

constitutional way he could have been prosecuted was in 

an action brought by the United States; that the local 

statute didn't authorize a private right of action, and 

that the Constitution could not -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He made the constitutional 

claim below?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  He said below that -- that a 

private right of action was neither lawful under the 

local statutes nor constitutional, and the parties 

responded that it was; and the lower court held it is 

authorized by local statute; it's constitutional; in 

fact, this was a private right of action prosecuted by 

Ms. Watson on her own behalf and therefore your plea 

agreement fails.

 We have never argued, if it was actually her 

prosecuting, that -- that she was bound by the plea 

agreement.  We argued it can't be her prosecuting, it 

can't be under the Constitution, it can't be under the 

local statute.  And if it's the United States, then we

are entitled to the benefit of the plea agreement we had 

with the United States.

 The -- Ms. Watson defends the lower court 

ruling that a private right of criminal action is 

constitutional, but really has mounted -- excuse me -­

mounted very little attack on our constitutional 

argument that the Constitution contemplates that crimes 

are public wrongs brought on behalf of sovereigns.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  We have 

plenty of plea agreements jurisprudence that say if the 

Southern District of New York prosecutes someone and 

they sign a plea agreement and say, we're not going to 

prosecute you for further crimes, we read that to mean 

that the Southern District of New York won't prosecute 

you for further crimes.  We don't read it that no other 

government agency is bound, who has jurisdiction over 

that criminal activity, that they are equally bound.

 So why isn't this case the same? 

Assuming -- that you're making a broad statement, that 

this has to be brought in the name of the government. 

Assuming that's correct, does that mean that -- why does 

that mean that both the U.S. Attorney's Office and the 

Attorney General's Office, which appear to be two 

different entities enforcing two different sets of law, 

why would both be bound?

MS. FRANKFURT:  Well, it's important to 

clarify, because there is -- there is a lack of -- it is 

not parallel to the Federal system.  So even assuming -­

and I believe there is a circuit -- that the Second 

Circuit says when the Southern District signs it's the 

Southern District only, and the Third, Fourth, Eighth, 

and Ninth view it differently when something reads as 

broadly as this, which is the government.  In the 

District of Columbia -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  It's not just 

the Southern District; it's also what, the State?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  No.  No, I believe in the 

Second Circuit they might read something signed by the 

Southern District as not binding in the Eastern 

District.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I got you.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  But in the District of 

Columbia, only the United States Attorney prosecutes 

criminal offenses of the type that occurred here.  There 

is a bit of a red herring here from this plea form. 

This is a plea form that is used in Superior Court both 

in traffic offenses, which are the type of offenses that 

the District of Columbia prosecutes, and in criminal 

offenses.

 And the cross-outs are just to conform the

plea form, so that if you cross out "D.C." it reads 

"United States v. John Robertson," which is how -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That did puzzle me.  I was 

wondering if there's -- if there's coordinate 

jurisdiction.  Can the -- can the District prosecute for 

crimes that the Attorney General can prosecute for?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  There is -- there is not 

coordinate jurisdiction.  There is some -- some 

provisions for consent if there are multiple offenses 

and one goes to one, one goes to the other.

 But all the offenses we're talking about 

here are United States offenses.  It was the United 

States's position below that only the United States 

prosecutes contempt.  It was actually the Attorney 

General's conviction in the lower court that it could 

not, representing the District of Columbia, prosecute 

contempt.

 So that if we are construing the party to be 

the United States as the Solicitor General now asks -­

you know, Young and Providence Journal really apply, 

which is then the prosecuting entity is the United 

States, whether represented by a private prosecutor or 

by a United States attorney.  That's a very different 

situation than different offices or -- because the 

District of Columbia could not be prosecuting this case

representing the -- the Attorney General couldn't be 

prosecuting this case representing the District of 

Columbia government.  That's not in the picture as an 

option.

 The -- the case -- if it's 

prosecuted by a sovereign, it's prosecuted by the United 

States, and the only argument that the Solicitor General 

is now making is that that wouldn't bind if private 

prosecutor representing the United States, as happened 

in Young.  We have a local case that says when a private 

prosecutor in a criminal contempt case signs the plea 

agreement on behalf of the United States, it's a binding 

plea agreement and binds the -- the United States.

 So the cross-out on the plea form, I 

believe, are a bit of a red herring.  The cross-out on 

the caption just makes it read United States v. John 

Robertson in a felony, which is the only way felonies 

can be prosecuted.  The cross-out on the signature line 

just makes it read the United States Attorney, who is 

the only one who can sign such a form in a felony case. 

And it doesn't define a particular prosecuting entity 

between Federal and State, or between two different 

Federal jurisdictions that have concurrent jurisdiction 

over, let's say, mail fraud or something like that.

District or do other States -- I mean, the problem that 

they are trying to get a handle on is domestic violence. 

And the prosecutors are busy prosecuting drug crimes and 

the rest.  So the District's solution is, we will allow 

the abused person to initiate this criminal contempt. 

Are there other States that have the same procedure?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  I -- the -- the same 

procedure is a question of how that is defined.  If the 

question is whether there are other States that have a 

wholly private right of action where the person is 

construed as bringing it on her own behalf, not on 

behalf of a sovereign, in a criminal case, we have seen 

nothing -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I mean, however you 

describe it in practical terms, are there other places 

that say, abused person, you can initiate this and you 

can have your lawyer present it, whether it's on behalf 

of the State or -- but just the practical of how you go 

through the motions; are there other States that allow 

the victim?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Yes, there are other -­

there are other States that allow the complainant to 

either bring it to the attention of the court in the 

form of a request for an order to show cause and to 

actually prosecute as a private prosecutor, the way,

let's say, in Young, they would have characterized a 

private prosecutor -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In criminal cases, because 

I -- I -- correct me if I am wrong, but my -- my 

recollection is that orders to show cause for contempt 

in the civil -- on the civil side occur frequently, and 

that allows a jail sentence in California I think of 5 

days -- and this is civil, because it's coercive.  Now, 

you are talking about something different, I take it?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  I am.  I am talking about 

criminal contempt.  For instance, in the District of 

Columbia before this case came down there -- we had an 

opinion, based on a local legislature's determination, 

that said a beneficiary of a civil protection order may 

initiate a criminal contempt proceeding and may act as 

private prosecutor the way in -- in Young this Court 

said as a matter of supervisory authorities they didn't 

want interested parties.

 There are jurisdictions, I believe, that 

allow for interested parties to take that role.  But the 

role is the role of the lawyer on behalf of the 

sovereign -- sovereign, whichever sovereign it is, who 

is the ultimate party -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, of course -­

MS. FRANKFURT -- and who can nolle the case.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the States don't have 

the same compulsion that the Federal Government has, 

which arises from the separation of powers.  And -­

which -- which means that it is the executive that has 

the right to prosecute, and States are not bound by such 

a thing.  And they can perhaps allow private individuals 

to prosecute, whereas the only exception we have made 

from the -- from the chief executive's authority to 

prosecute is Young, which is a very narrow exception, 

dealing with the Court's ability to protect itself from 

contempt of its orders.

 And here the court had nothing to do with 

the appointment of this private party, right?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  That's absolutely true.  In 

our view to the extent there are any sort of exceptions 

from procedural rights or the normal process in contempt 

proceedings, they are narrowly tailored and governed by 

the doctrine of necessity.  And that -- and so while 

Respondent's counsel indicates, well, there are a lot of 

differences in contempt and just add one to this list, 

they make no attempt to ground that in the document of 

necessity, which is really the only thing that -- that 

justifies any sort of procedural difference in the 

contempt context.

District has been following this procedure for quite 

some time?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Yes.  Well, I guess it 

depends on what the question what "this procedure" is. 

The District -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, where a private 

party initiates, the beneficiary of an order of this 

kind, initiates a contempt proceeding against a person 

who violates it, and seeks a punishment for it, not just 

discontinuance.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Yes.  The -- the District 

had a case where it said it believed itself not bound by 

the supervisory authority of Young and it would allow 

interested parties to prosecute contempt in the domestic 

violence context only, not outside the domestic violence 

context.  And it has had cases prosecuted in that 

fashion since that time, which I believe was 1984.  But 

it has -- it was not until this case that the issue 

arose because of the plea agreement to suggest that that 

person was prosecuting in her own name -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  It doesn't say to me that 

the plea agreement goes to the question of whether there 

is sort of an inherent violation of the Constitution by 

adopting this procedure at all.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I have trouble figuring 

out whether the plea agreement has any relevance to the 

kind of basic argument you are making.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Well, we actually see two 

arguments, and maybe that's -- that we are making, which 

may be part of the confusion.

 If this proceeding really was, as the lower 

court interpreted, the lower court -- the lower court 

interpreted the local statute and what occurred and 

said:  This really was a private right of action brought 

by Ms. Watson on her own behalf; no government party 

initiated it, controlled it; and we believe that is 

constitutional.  That's what the lower court said.  If 

that's what occurred, then we believe this Court could 

well say that is unconstitutional.

 We -- we defer to the lower court's view of 

what occurred pursuant to the local statute.  This was a 

private right of action, the lower court told us so, and 

we don't think that the Constitution can tolerate such a 

thing.  And, therefore, like in Gompers where criminal 

penalty was imposed, Gompers v. Buck's Stove, a criminal 

penalty was imposed in an action between private 

parties, that judgment must be set aside.  She never had 

power to invoke the authority of the court in the first 

place.  That's one way to view it.  The Solicitor

court was wrong -­

MS. FRANKFURT:  The lower court was wrong.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- on that premise.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We have another option, 

once we say they were wrong on that premise, to send it 

back and let them look at the second question, which is 

whether or not a private party can bring an action in 

the name of the sovereign.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Well, I think that the 

second way to view it, as -- as I was going to say, is 

what the Solicitor General of the United States now 

agrees -- they thought below that it was Constitution, 

but they now agree that the Constitution cannot tolerate 

private criminal rights of action.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And if -- if that's true, 

they have been following an unconstitutional practice 

for about 25 years; is that right?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  I believe -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  And nobody thought about 

it in all this time?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  And certainly since, you

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Because it is done many, 

many times, as I understand it, over the years.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  It was done many times, 

received -- when the original -- when the interested 

prosecutor decision was made, it was made on the same 

foundational premise as Young, which was let's look and 

see if we are concerned about conflict of interest.

 By the nature of asking, the court asking 

questions of conflict of interest, the court was 

thinking of the woman as representing the government.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This wouldn't be allowed 

under Young.  I mean, if Young made anything clear is 

you couldn't appoint as a prosecutor an interested 

party.  And here is the most the interested party of 

all.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  That's true.  It certainly 

would not be -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So don't -- don't -- don't 

say that Young would have allowed it.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  No, no, no, no.  It 

certainly wouldn't be allowed under Young.  But to 

finish my -- my answer to Justice Sotomayor and Justice 

Stevens as to the second route:  If this Court -- what 

the Solicitor General I believe is asking this Court to 

do is to say it's not constitutional to have such an

action brought on behalf of a private party, therefore, 

construe it as an action brought on behalf of the 

sovereign.

 This Court -- if this Court goes that route, 

as opposed to deferring to the way the lower court 

described it, rather says this must have been on behalf 

of the sovereign, the sovereign was the United States, 

then the question is whether the plea agreement barred 

it.

 The lower court said the plea agreement 

didn't bar it because it was Ms. Watson's; obviously it 

didn't bar it.  Ms. Watson is not the United States. 

But if in fact it was on behalf of the United States, 

then the question is does the plea agreement bar it.  We 

think that the -­

to be saying that?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  I do believe that they -­

that they concede that the -- the relevant sovereign is 

the United States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, we can ask the 

government.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Yes.  And -­

(Laughter.)

 MS. FRANKFURT:  But -- but I believe that's 

what their brief said.  They certainly said that below 

and I believe that's what they are saying here because 

they are saying it's prosecution on behalf of the United 

States.  They have given section 518 permission in this 

case because they believe that the United States is 

interested.

 And so the District of Columbia's role, 

oddly enough, all the way through this proceeding and 

then they withdrew at the merits stage in this Court, 

was they believed themselves representing the 

Petitioner.  They had never perceived themselves to be a 

public prosecutor.  And they in fact said in the lower 

court that they had no authority to prosecute contempt 

in the District of Columbia.  We agree with that.

that said that Federal separation of powers principles 

are binding on territorial governments, for instance?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  You know, I -- I think that 

the question is -- I don't think -- I disagree with the 

government, with Respondents that this Court has said it 

hasn't.  I think in -- I think Springer appears to apply 

separation of powers principles.  I think that 

Metropolitan Airport Authority used Springer in a

territory, no.  No, it is Article I power that is being 

exercised.  Our focus hasn't been entirely separation of 

powers, because in our view, you know, separation of 

powers is about the division of powers within 

government.  Here the problem was that the problem was 

that the -- there is no authority under the Constitution 

to give the power to prosecute time, which has 

historically, way back, been an attribute of sovereignty

and to take it entirely away from the sovereign at all.

 Which is what -- what the lower court 

finding was and what Ms. Watson now defends.  But we see 

a long, long history in the common law, in the English 

common law, in our common law, and in our constitutional 

jurisprudence of criminal actions being public wrongs 

prosecuted acting on behalf of the sovereign and 

criminal contempt falling right within that even more 

so, because this is indication of public authority, and 

to the extent there are any deviations from due process 

or separation of powers principles, they are justified 

only by the doctrine of necessity.

 If the Court has no further questions, I 

will reserve my -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Could I -- I have this 

question.  This -- again, I'm trying to see the case in 

the broad -- in the broader sense.

 Supposing there is a civil lawsuit that's 

settled and part of the settlement is a consent decree 

that would enjoin certain conduct, and the defendant 

then violates the decree and engages in the prohibited 

conduct.  Are you saying that the only person who could 

prosecute for contempt would be the sovereign?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  For criminal contempt?

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.

MS. FRANKFURT:  Yes.  Now whether -- whether 

in some situations a private prosecutor could be 

appointed -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So, no, the question would 

be whether the lawyer for the -- the party who entered 

into the settlement could bring a contempt proceeding 

against the adversary who had violated the settlement.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  On their own behalf?  I 

don't -- I don't believe so.  Not a criminal contempt 

proceeding.

 We are drawing a fairly rigid distinction 

between who the lawyer is and who the lawyer represents. 

In our view, the party in a criminal action has to be 

the sovereign, the United States.

 Now in the contempt context there is a 

limited exception for appointment of private prosecutors 

when the executive is declining to prosecute and the 

judiciary needs to vindicate its authority, and if it's 

referred to the public prosecutor in the Young situation 

and the public prosecutor has declined but the judiciary 

still needs to vindicate its authority, it can appoint a 

private attorney to represent the sovereign.

 But at root it's the sovereign that is 

prosecuting, no matter who the lawyer is who is standing 

in the courtroom.  And the problem in this case was the

holding of the lower court that said -- that Ms. 

Watson -- it was her case.  The prosecutor said it was 

her case; the lawyer said I can't control her; she gets 

to make all the decisions.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  What do you think the best 

authority from this Court for your basic proposition is? 

What is your strongest case?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  I think the strongest case 

is Gompers v. Buck's Stove.  That says fundamentally -­

and I'm not quoting verbatim -- but it says 

fundamentally erroneous as if a tort action of A -- for 

battery of A versus B, a sentence of 12 months is 

imposed.  Well, that's exactly what we have here, is we 

have a sentence of 12 months imposed for an action that 

our lower court said was solely between private parties.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  You think Gompers is the 

best case?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Yes, I do.

and can you advise us -- I know it's not in your case -­

Court should go with the Third and Fourth Circuits who 

have -- expressed -- quite eloquently about the United 

States not being a bunch of separate fiefdoms, but that 

when the United States speaks, they speak for the 

government at large.  That is different than a case -­

of some of the cases that were cited, where it says the 

United States will make a recommendation to the 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, and then the 

criminal defendant comes back and says well, the INS is 

down, too.

 And people looks at the agreement and say 

well, no one would have read that to mean that the 

United States included INS, because they were talking 

about a recommendation to INS.

 But when the government has written in, my 

view is that -- that the Third Circuit and the Fourth 

Circuit speak eloquently to that.  But I don't see that 

that issue is presented here, given the context on which 

it arises in D.C. where this is conduct that should only 

be prosecuted in D.C. court by the United States.  It 

was going to be the United States Attorney or a private 

prosecutor representing the United States.  We have 

local law that says private prosecutors do sign plea 

agreements by the United States and I would think the 

converse would be true.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Long.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. LONG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I think it's very important to be clear 

about what is properly before the Court.  This started 

out as a case about a plea agreement, and the 

Petitioner's claim is that his plea agreement with the 

U.S. Attorney barred his criminal contempt proceeding. 

He has not made the claim that a private interested 

party may not bring a criminal contempt proceeding.  He 

has said -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but the 

argument is that because a private interested party 

can't bring it, the party is bringing it on behalf of 

the United States and his plea agreement therefore is 

with the United States.

 MR. LONG:  Well, I mean if I could, 

Mr. Chief Justice, there are I think several questions 

in the case, and some are actually no longer in dispute 

so that will help to simplify a very complicated matter 

23

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

a little bit.

 One is according to the question presented, 

whether the criminal contempt proceeding for violating a 

civil protective order must be brought in the name of 

the United States, so actually have United States in the 

caption.  And I think now all the parties agree, there 

is no constitutional requirement that the caption of the 

case actually say "United States."  So to the extent 

that answers the question about what does the plea 

agreement cover, we don't have a dispute about that. 

There's no constitutional reason why the court of 

appeals has to be reversed.

 So the other part of the question, as it's 

framed in the question is does it have to be brought 

pursuant to the power of the United States.  That's not 

language that is in the court of appeals opinion -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm not sure I 

understand your point.  Yes, the caption doesn't have to 

be styled in a particular name -­

MR. LONG:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the prosecuting 

person -­

MR. LONG:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the person whose name 

is listed is acting for someone.

MR. LONG:  Yes.  Is the real party in 

interest the United States?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.

 MR. LONG:  And I agree, that's mostly what 

we have to talk about this morning, but I'm trying to 

bracket it with issues that are really not properly in 

dispute here.

 One is, the caption is not a constitutional 

issue.  Another is, as Petitioner has said over and over 

again, the actual ability of a private, interested 

party, the question that was left open in Young, under 

the Constitution, under the Due Process Clause or under 

separation of powers, is that constitutional for 

Ms. Watson to even do this, as the representative of the 

United States or on her own behalf?

 They have said over and over again, they are 

not raising that question.  In their reply brief to the 

court of appeals, they say they in no way challenge 

that.  In their post-argument brief to the court of 

appeals, they say the assertion that they are 

challenging it is just wrong.  In their supplemental 

brief to this Court at the cert stage, they say they -­

they decline to raise that question.  And even in their 

reply brief here, they say they have not raised the 

issue left unresolved in Young.

So that is a very important issue.  And I 

think that issue is really -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you define what you 

see as that issue?  What's the issue that you think -­

MR. LONG:  That's the issue of whether a 

private interested party, either on their own behalf or 

as the representative of the sovereign, can bring a 

criminal contempt action.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you mean?  Not on 

their own -- not on their own behalf.  I mean, that -­

that's a quite different issue.  That's the issue that 

was decided below, whether -­

MR. LONG:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- whether a private 

interested party can be authorized to bring the suit on 

behalf of the sovereign.

 MR. LONG:  Yes.  What I'm trying to do is 

narrow down to -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand, but you -­

you covered two things.  You said whether a private 

individual can bring it on his own.

 MR. LONG:  Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or whether a private 

individual can be appointed to bring it on behalf of the 

sovereign.

 MR. LONG:  No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.

 MR. LONG:  I think -- I think the -- all 

they have conceded is that for purposes of this case, we 

are going to assume that -- well, I may have given you 

the wrong answer to you -- we are -- they have said over

party can bring a criminal contempt proceeding.  And so 

we think, given the importance of -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As representative of 

the sovereign?

 MR. LONG:  Well, I -- I think that question 

is fairly before the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And nobody doubts --

I didn't think it was at issue that the United States, 

rather than operating through the Assistant U.S. 

Attorney, can appoint you to handle the prosecution.

MR. LONG:  The point is, they are not

not disputing that a private, interested individual, 

like Ms. Watson, the individual in this case, can bring 

this proceeding.  Now -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On whose behalf?  That's 

the issue that I'm trying to -­

MR. LONG:  And the issue that I think is 

before the Court is, would that be as a representative 

of the United States or would that be as a private 

person?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.  Are you saying 

that it's out of the case that if we say it's on behalf 

of the United States, they are not challenging that they 

can do that?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's so -- so if we 

say they can act on behalf of the United States, you -­

MR. LONG:  Yes.  And I will say, there is an 

oddity to this, because in many ways, the bigger 

question is the question that the Court left open in 

Young, since that's not been properly raised, not 

properly decided, by the court below, not properly 

briefed, it is a little odd to be answering this other 

question of:  Well, assuming that the private party can 

do this, would it be in the interest of the United 

States?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So in other words, if, in 

fact -- you agree or don't agree, I don't know -- but 

the government says and they say, the government of the 

United States has here -- and it can, under the 

Constitution, delegate to a private person the authority 

to prosecute.

 MR. LONG:  Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There is a big argument 

against that.

 MR. LONG:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The argument is:  This 

would be the one person you can't delegate it to because 

they are very biased.

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that argument, you say, 

is not in this case.

 MR. LONG:  Exactly.  Exactly.  So -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So now we have what 

is in the case, which is the question of whether, 

leaving that argument out of it, did they hear or -­

MR. LONG:  So let me now address the point 

that:  Is it a constitutional requirement?  No matter 

what the legislature says, that any criminal contempt 

proceeding must be brought in the interest of the 

sovereign, not in the interest of a private party.  That 

may seem like a fairly obvious proposition, but I want 

to submit it's actually much harder than the Court 

actually should agree.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what you mean 

by "in the interest of"?  On behalf of?  Is that what 

you mean?  Are you saying -- you acknowledge here that 

it is on behalf of the United States but you say it 

doesn't have to be in the interest of the United States, 

is that it?

 MR. LONG:  Well, the language that the court 

of appeals used is in the interest of the United States. 

Who is the real party in interest?

brought on behalf of the United States by your client?

 MR. LONG:  No.  I want to make an argument 

that actually, the D.C. legislature and the D.C. courts 

are constitutionally permitted to determine that in this 

specific situation, the interests of the individual 

actually predominate over the interests of the 

government and there is not a constitutional problem.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is that even relevant? 

Why do you even get to that?  Isn't the question what 

the parties understood the plea agreement to mean?

 MR. LONG:  Well, I agree with you completely 

Justice Alito.  The ultimate question is exactly what 

you say.  And we think under any reasonable construction 

of the plea agreement, it does not bar this proceeding. 

As Justice Stevens said, these have gone on for.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It's highly relevant, I 

think, because I think you would you like to make the 

argument, which I would like to hear, is that:  Forget 

the United States.  The Constitution permits this woman 

to bring the case as a private citizen.

 MR. LONG:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, if you are right about 

that, the plea agreement drops out.

plea agreement with her.  Because that is the argument 

you want to make at some point.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. LONG:  I will make the argument, 

although if I am wrong, I still think the plea agreement 

doesn't bar this prosecution.  Here's -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  But, well -- well, with 

respect, even if the Constitution permits this, if the 

parties understood the plea agreement to mean that this 

was going to be barred, then why isn't that the end of 

the matter?

 MR. LONG:  Well, it's what a reasonable 

person would have understood Justice Alito, when the 

plea agreement says, crosses out District of Columbia, 

crosses out corporation counsel, and we are now all 

agreed that Ms. Watson, in her own name, can bring this 

proceeding under a statute that authorizes it and has 

for 20 years -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  And I suppose the argument 

could be that the -- that the government has no 

authority under D.C. law to enter into such an 

agreement, as well require these two -­

statutory issue was raised or decided by the court 

below.  Typically, this Court treats the D.C. court of 

appeals as -- as final, as a practical matter, on issues 

of D.C. law.  So, I think that is going off in a 

completely different direction.

 But on the issue -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Gee, I have really lost 

you.  What is going off in a different direction? 

Really?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. LONG:  The issue is, it's a matter of 

D.C. statute.  There was some problem with this 

prosecution.  I mean, that's really something else.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, okay.  You're -­

you're asserting that this agreement with the United 

States Attorney cannot cover this case because your 

client was not acting on behalf of the United States, 

but rather in her private capacity.

 MR. LONG:  Yes, and let me make that 

argument.

right?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's perfectly okay, 

 MR. LONG:  If -- if that is a constitutional 

requirement.  It is in Blackstone, we admit that, for 

crimes in general, but we are talking about contempt.

be in the Constitution someplace.  Petitioners say it's 

because the Constitution uses words like "crimes."

 Well, you know, the Court has been very 

cautious about implying common law rules, 

constitutionalizing common law rules, because of words 

in the Constitution -­

can find it in the Constitution is that we have built a 

body of law about the obligation of people bringing 

prosecutions that wouldn't fit within your situation.

say we have the -- we'll call it a private person as 

prosecuting.

 MR. LONG:  Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does that person have a -­

a right to look at all the government files to see if 

there is any exonerating evidence?

 MR. LONG:  Well -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, how does it work? 

That's what we want to know.

 MR. LONG:  This is a determinate sentence, 

so under this Court's cases, without regard to whether 

the government's interests are -- take precedence over 

the private interests, it's criminal.  So you get all 

the rights that the Due Process Clause gives you in a -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But how does it work?

prosecution have the right to go in and -- and look at

MR. LONG:  In this case the court said that 

the Brady rights did apply.  I mean, this is another 

reason why I would urge the Court not to try to decide a 

number of very important questions about a very 

important system that has not really been properly 

presented in D.C.

are all going to be variations of that theme and we 

could think of 100 arguments.  Boasting.  Then is this 

special?

 MR. LONG:  Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, before I can answer 

that question, I would like to know whether the 

government could appoint the private person.  After all 

there is a check -- there is a check against the total 

Furies, it's the government doing it.  Now you say no, 

the government can't do it, so -- but they can do it on 

their own.  Maybe -- I don't know.

 MR. LONG:  Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  How do I get my -- how do I 

begin to answer these questions bound together in my 

mind in some partial way?

 MR. LONG:  Well, part -- part of the answer 

is, of course, that the court exercises control. 

Another part of the answer is that the D.C. legislature, 

which is exercising delegated legislative authority from 

Congress, has determined that this is in the public 

interest.

 And you know, the third part of it is that 

we are not granting these private individuals excessive 

authority.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But you want to do that.

You see, so there is no control.  You are saying we want 

the private individuals to have the authority to bring 

criminal contempt; they are on their own; they decide 

it.  The government has nothing to say about this.  It's 

a totally private matter.

 MR. LONG:  No, but -- but you know, D.C. 

tried for over a decade to do this with public 

prosecutors, and there just were not enough resources. 

So what we are allowing here, if I could take it a 

stop -­

 You are looking for a section of the 

Constitution; I suggest Article II, Section 1, the 

executive power shall be vested in the President.

 MR. LONG:  Well, but -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And just as the executive 

power includes the power to expend funds appropriated by 

Congress, so also the executive power except in the -­

in the instance of necessity acknowledged by Young, 

which I think was wrongly decided anyway -- except in 

that one narrow instance, the -- the power to prosecute 

belongs to the executive.

 MR. LONG:  But -- but Justice Scalia, we are 

dealing with the District of Columbia.  The Constitution 

does not assign any powers over the District to the 

executive or to the judicial branch.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now the State 

of California, trying to save money, say we have a very 

good idea.  We are going to pass one law, abolish all 

the prosecutors' offices and say wherever there is a 

victim of crime, that victim will bring the prosecution.

is debated in the briefs and I think it was less common 

in the colonies in the United States than it was in 

Britain, but certainly wouldn't have been regarded as -­

as unconstitutional.

 But this is -- now we are back to the 

question that I say really the Court should not decide 

because it was never properly -- whether this can be 

done by a private individual at all, even as the 

representative of the government.  So I don't think you 

should get into that.

 But if you do -­

we can avoid it.

presents the argument that a private party can't bring a 

criminal prosecution on their -- in their own -- perhaps 

their own name, they can, but on their own, in their own 

interest.  It always has to be a government interest. 

That's what the argument is.

 MR. LONG:  Yes, we -- we are arguing two 

things.  They can bring it in their own name, that's not 

unconstitutional; and they can certainly -- they could 

certainly bring it as the representative of the 

government, that is also constitutional.  And -- and so 

there are two ways -­

 MR. LONG:  Yes, absolutely.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you are saying it 

can.

 MR. LONG:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Answer why.

 MR. LONG:  Because the D.C. Council said 

they could do it.  So we have a legislature that has 

said that the interest of a private party here takes 

precedence, and that is not an unconstitutional 

determination by the legislature.  In this Court's 

criminal contempt cases, the Court has said we don't 

look to whose interest is paramount or what this -- the 

legislature or what the Court says whose interest is

paramount.

 We recognize that both kinds of contempt, 

civil and criminal, further the sovereign's interest in 

vindicating the court's orders and further the private 

interest in seeing that that order which applies 

particularly to that party is followed.

 So you don't look to that at all.  You just 

look to the nature of the punishment.  And if it's a 

determinate sentence versus a coercive sentence, then 

it's criminal.  So that answers all the questions about 

Brady and what sort of due process -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  You might -- you might -­

you might say this.  To answer your question that is 

here, there are a couple of ways of doing this.  One way 

you would say is, well, don't worry about this so much. 

If the answer is no, you can still bring your private 

prosecution but you have got to get government 

permission, because you are doing it in the way of the 

government.

 But if the answer to the question is if you 

can't do either, they you might say, then why wouldn't 

you say why well, aren't we back to the Eumenides, and 

the answer is going to be this is say contempt. 

Contempt is special.

ways would work.  So what would you think, since the 

government has changed its position, of sending this 

back so some of these things can be worked out?  At 

least we would have some opinions that would help us.

 MR. LONG:  Well, you know, I think that 

would be an unfortunate result in the sense that, you 

know, the plea agreement in our view doesn't prevent 

this prosecution on any reasonable interpretation.  You 

know, we also think for the reasons I have been trying 

to spell out that there is no real basis for the Court 

to hold that it is unconstitutional, only in the 

criminal contempt setting, for the D.C. legislature to 

find that the private interest here justifies allowing 

the private party to bring this action but it's still 

criminal.

 Because it's a determinate sentence, you get 

all the due process just as you would as -- if the 

government brought it.  You get all the due process 

rights which in fact the defendant did get here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, unless you 

think it's a violation of due process for an interested

MR. LONG:  Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- whether or not to 

proceed.  And the court certainly can appoint a 

prosecutor, and does in many states.

 MR. LONG:  Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.  And 

that's really what we're asking.  I mean, if you think 

about these situations, many thousands of cases, most of 

these individuals have no lawyers.  They are pro se.  A 

civil order is entered, about domestic violence, child 

custody, child support.  It's violated, or the 

individual thinks it's violated.

 What do they do?  They come to the court on 

their own, so now they are pro se, so now maybe we're in 

the Furies and Young and Province.  But this is -- to 

make the system work, we at least, I submit, have to 

allow those individuals to come to the court and file a 

motion, even though they are interested in, say, 

somebody's violating the order, Judge, you should do 

something about it -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- that's -- why 

isn't it a different matter?

 MR. LONG:  I mean, that's what -- that's 

what happened in this case.  It so happens this woman 

was represented by the D.C. Attorney General, who is a 

public prosecutor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, so now you are into 

the question of what counts as a prosecution.

 MR. LONG:  Yes, yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And there again, I am at 

sea.  I don't know what the authority is.

 MR. LONG:  Well, if I could -- if I can just 

do it step by step.  I mean, in this case and in tens of 

thousands of other cases, the first step is just 

allowing that motion to be filed.  And if you don't 

allow that, you say that's unconstitutional, the entire 

system will -- will blow up.

 So if you at least get to that, then we say, 

well -- the judge looks at it and says, well, civil's 

not appropriate here because the violation is over; if I 

am going to punish this, it's going to have to be a 

determinant sentence, that's criminal.  At that point, 

under this Court's cases, due process requires all sorts 

of things to protect the defendant.

that's the question.  That's the question that I don't 

know that we have enough information in the record 

about.  Is this really -- is this prosecution like a 

state?  That's the Solicitor General's position, which 

is, it's on behalf of the local government, not on the 

behalf of the Federal government as a sovereign.  I 

think that's what this case speaks to.

 MR. LONG:  If you look at them -- if you 

look at this Court's decision in Palmore.  I mean, we 

are dealing with an Article I court of the District of 

Columbia, not an Article III court, to the extent that 

the sovereign's interest is at stake here.  Let's keep 

the interest of that Article I court.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there somewhere I can 

look to see what happens?  All I can find in the long 

law is that a violation of the order is a contempt. 

Fine; no problem.  And then the only word about the 

Petitioner, it says the Petitioner is entitled to relief 

under this chapter, which contains about 50 different 

things.  And it doesn't say what kind of relief.  It 

doesn't say how you get relief.  It doesn't say if you 

are just asking -- all those things you raised.  So how 

do I find out actually what is in the system.

 MR. LONG:  You mean the relief for contempt?

says the earlier part of this statute which goes on for 

six pages in an earlier part of this statue, which goes 

on for six pages, seven pages.  It says, a Petitioner 

has a right to seek relief under this subchapter.

 Now, that contains civil contempt.  It 

contains how you get protective orders.  It contains a 

lot of things that are absolutely noncontroversial.  So 

I am trying to figure out:  What is the system?

 MR. LONG:  Well, I think -- I think the 

honest answer is, Justice Breyer, you can find some of 

these things by looking around, but since we've been 

talking about issues that were not properly litigated 

and not decided and we do not have a well-developed 

record, some of these things are just not going to be 

available.

 And again, we think -- you know, this case 

started out about a plea agreement.  It's really a small 

case.  We are now talking about these great big issues. 

We think the plea agreement doesn't bar this under any 

reasonable construction, and so the right result is 

either to dismiss the cases as improvidentally granted 

or to affirm.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 General Kagan.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 There are two questions, properly raised, in 

this case.  Petitioner is right about one.  Respondent 

is right about the other and the disposition.  There are 

a couple of questions that are extremely interesting --

I can see why the Court is interested in them -- but 

were not properly raised in this case, and this Court 

should not decide them.

 What Petitioner is right about is that in 

this criminal contempt action, Ms. Watson, the 

Respondent, was and must have been exercising sovereign 

power, that she was acting as a state actor for purposes 

of the Constitution.

 What Respondent is right about -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Whose state power was 

she acting on behalf of?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  The way we understand this, 

Justice Sotomayor, is that Respondent was exercising 

sovereign power on behalf of the Article I court, the 

D.C. court, which of course is partly a local court, but 

is exercising power whose initial source, original 

source, is Congress.

So she is exercising sovereign power in 

order to vindicate the Court's order, the order of -- of 

restraint.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Courts don't have the power 

to incarcerate people.  I mean, if you are prosecuting 

for a criminal offense, you are exercising more than the 

power of the Court.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I -- I don't believe that is 

the case, Justice Scalia.  Imagine Respondent 

essentially doing the same function that an appointed 

person would do in Young.  There, of course, the court 

appointed the person to prosecute contempt.  Here 

Respondent is essentially doing the same thing, is 

acting in order to prosecute a contempt on the court and 

to vindicate the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But nobody asserted in 

Young that the prosecutor appointed by the court was 

only exercising the power of the court.  Surely it was 

the power of the government that the -- that the 

prosecutor was exercising.  Now, the court was given the 

power to appoint that prosecutor, but I would think it's 

extraordinary to say that there's nothing but the 

court's power in play.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, the court is surely 

part of the government, and in the end this is power of

the United States.  The court is created through power 

of the United States.  It's an Article I court.  And so 

Respondent is no doubt exercising sovereign power and 

exercising it on behalf of the United States ultimately.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then why doesn't an 

agreement by the United States not to prosecute carry 

the day?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, so this goes to the 

second question, in which I think Respondent is right. 

And the reason is that when a single U.S. Attorney's 

Office says that the government will decide to drop a 

certain set of charges, that U.S. Attorney's Office we 

believe is -- is speaking for itself, unless there is 

some indication that it is speaking more widely in such 

a way that will bind other parts of the government.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's -- that's 

absolutely startling.  The different U.S. Attorneys all 

work for your boss, right?  They work for the Attorney 

General.  How can one part of the Attorney General agree 

to something that doesn't bind the other part of the 

Attorney General?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  The United States Government 

is a complicated place and the fact that -­

 GENERAL KAGAN:  -- and the fact that the 

Southern District of New York agrees to do one thing 

does not bind, for example, the INS, does not 

bind the -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe or maybe not, 

but surely it binds the New Jersey U.S. Attorney.  If 

you -- just think about it.  The -- the U.S. Attorney 

from the Southern District says:  Look, you agree to go 

to jail for 10 years and I will drop these 3 charges. 

Done.  Then the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey can come in 

and prosecute under those three charges?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Assuming that the U.S. 

Attorney in the second office has jurisdiction and 

assuming that the plea agreement does not say anything 

to suggest that it should be read more broadly, I think 

the answer is yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how do you 

get -- I mean, you are a defendant.  You have to go to 

all more than 50, all the U.S. Attorney's Offices and 

say, will you agree to this and get everybody to sign 

off?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

even if you are right I think that we prevail.  There 

are two views in the court system.  One is the Second

and Seventh Circuit and they take the position that I've 

taken, which is that the default position is that the 

contracting party binds only the contracting party and 

that the plea agreement needs to say something in order 

to apply more broadly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It can't do that. 

If the U.S. attorney in New Jersey has the authority to 

prosecute this, the U.S. Attorney in New York can't say, 

oh, and by the way I bind all the other U.S. Attorneys.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, the U.S. Attorney in 

New York could -- presumably that U.S. Attorney will 

know who else might have jurisdiction over the 

underlying conduct and would go and get an agreement 

from those other U.S. attorneys.  But unless the U.S. 

Attorney does that, under one approach the agreement 

bars only the contracting entity.  But even if you're 

right -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But do I understand your 

position that in this particular case the U.S. Attorney 

could have entered into a settlement agreement that 

would have bound the Respondent?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  We actually don't think that 

that's right, Justice Stevens.  We think that in fact 

the U.S. Attorney did not bind the Respondent, but we 

don't think it could have bound the Respondent, and it

JUSTICE STEVENS:  You draw a distinction 

between the D.C. Circuit -- the D.C. and the United 

States?

court system is an actor that is wielding United States 

authority.  But it's a very different -­

take it, that the attorney for the District of Columbia

argument.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Usually we have 

questions the other way.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I apologize.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know that courts 

have ever asserted that they themselves have the power 

to prosecute.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I do think that that's 

the situation that we find in Young, where a court 

appoints a person to prosecute a contempt on behalf of 

the court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not on behalf of the court. 

On behalf of the government, and that's why Young said 

you should offer it first to the United States Attorney, 

and only if he won't bring it, then you can appoint 

somebody else to bring it.  But the -- the prosecutor is 

not the court.  My God.  What a terrible situation.  The 

prosecutor's the court, the judge is the court?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, I do think Young is 

different, Justice Scalia, because Young was a 

separation of powers case.  This case is not because it 

arises in D.C.  In Young, absolutely the judge has to go 

to the U.S. Attorney's Office first.  But that's not the 

case here, because normal separation of powers 

principles are not in application in D.C.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't it the case that only 

the U.S. Attorney can prosecute for this crime?  Could 

the D.C. attorney general or whatever the name of it, 

what, counsel, prosecute for this felony?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Scalia, I don't 

believe that is entirely clear.  I think that the court 

could ask the D.C. Attorney General to prosecute the 

crime in the same way that the court in Young asked the 

U.S. Attorney's Office.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because it's all up to the 

court; the court's the big prosecutor, right?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Well, just as -- I know you 

dissented in Young, Justice Scalia.  But just as the 

court in Young goes to the U.S. Attorney first and when 

the court is told no the court can appoint its own 

independent prosecutor, essentially that's what is 

happening here.  The court is appointing -­

because they're all exercising power -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but that was the 

same authority.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, and they all are 

exercising power from the United States.  Dixon involved 

this very statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you don't think this is 

a Bartkiss-like case, like Bartkiss v. Illinois?

 GENERAL KAGAN:  I -- I am not familiar with 

that case, Justice Kennedy, but I do think that the 

double jeopardy clause -- ­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That a State prosecution 

doesn't bar a later Federal prosecution.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Yes, that's exactly right, 

because ultimately all of these power are exercising 

power that comes from the same source, which is the 

United States Government.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is your argument the broad 

argument that the Chief Justice was talking about, that 

we have a man who drives in a car from Baltimore to rob 

a bank in Washington and the U.S. Attorney in Washington 

gives him a piece of paper which says, I will not 

prosecute you for this now or in the future, and 

suddenly the U.S. Attorney in Baltimore prosecutes it.

Justice.  To the extent that there is skepticism -­

not thought about that question.  I am completely clear 

as to your -- the question that you asked to Mr. Long, 

which is does she have Brady obligations.  She does have 

Brady obligations.  She was held to Brady obligations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  She's a State actor. 

She's acting on behalf either of the United States or 

the District of Columbia.  Therefore, she can be sued 

directly and be personally liable.

 GENERAL KAGAN:  She -- it is absolutely 

right that she is a State actor for constitutional 

purposes.  And she was treated as such throughout this 

litigation.

 To go back to Justice Breyer's point -- may

 GENERAL KAGAN:  Justice Breyer's question, 

the Chief Justice's question:  Even circuits that apply 

a default rule whereby the government is the entire 

government and there needs to be limiting things in the 

agreement, I think if you look at this agreement you 

will find those limiting things, both in the cross-outs 

in the caption and in the particular promises that the 

United States Government has made, which applies really 

only to the United States Attorney's Office.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JACLYN S. FRANKFURT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. FRANKFURT:  Thank you.

 I just want to say in response both to -- to 

Mr. Long's comments, that a lack record as to what 

actually occurred or the general comment, about whether 

or not Ms. Watson was treated as a State actor -- I 

actually think there is a -- a decent record in this 

case that what occurred was not a motion to request the 

court to issue a show cause, but in fact, a -- a motion 

that requested -- that triggered a ministerial act, 

which was an act -- which was used as a charging 

document, which the judge believed she had no 

discretion, and the Assistant Attorney General, who was 

representing the Petitioner, believed she had no 

discretion to control, and Ms. Watson was treated as 

bringing the action on her own behalf.

 That's what the lower court held as a 

factual matter, and I think it is quite supported by the 

record.

understand that Mr. Robertson's plea agreement bound 

Ms. Watson and precluded her contempt proceeding against 

Mr. Robertson.  If we accept that, is there any other 

issue in this case?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  If you -- yes.  The issue is 

whether she could constitutionally bring the case on her 

own.

because our argument from -- from the very beginning was 

she can't constitutionally be representing herself in

she represents the United States, and if she represents

because our plea agreement was with the government.

of a private person to prosecute on her own behalf?  Any 

agreement -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Even if he didn't get that

proceeding would still be barred for some other reason? 

Did you make that argument?

 MS. FRANKFURT:  I am not sure that I can 

answer that we did, because I am not sure that I -- I 

understand the question.  I -- I know that we did make 

the argument that it could only have lawfully been 

brought on behalf of the sovereign, and that the 

sovereign was the United States.  And so our view was if 

this Court views it the way the lower court did, which 

was as an action between private parties, then it's 

unconstitutional under Gompers.

wrote the word, you know, "whoever stands in the well of 

the courtroom, it doesn't matter who that person is; 

that person represents the sovereign."  That's the only 

constitutional way.  If it's viewed that way, it's 

barred by the plea agreement.  If it's not viewed that 

way, as the lower court construed the local statute to 

permit, then Gompers v. Buck's Stove does -- there is no 

authority there to impose a criminal penalty.  We would 

ask the Court to reverse.
