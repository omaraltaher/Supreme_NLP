CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this morning in Case 16-149, Coventry Health Care 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Missouri v. Nevils. 

 

 

            

Mr. Estrada. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ESTRADA:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The issue in this case is whether FEHBA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempts State laws that forbid subrogation by insurance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carriers.  The Missouri Supreme Court upheld the State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule, but we believe that is wrong for at least three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons. 

            

Number one, antisubrogation laws relate to 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits and coverage, as this Court concluded in FMC v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Holliday, and at the very least, they relate to payments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to benefits. 

 

 

 

            

Number two, if there's any ambiguity on this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, OPM's notice-and-comment regulation answers a 

 

 

 

 

 

question in favor of preemption. 

 

 

 

 

            

And number three, although the majority of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Supreme Court of Missouri thought otherwise, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe there's no constitutional infirmity in

Section 8902(m)(1) under the Supremacy Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

If I could turn to my first point, it seems 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to us that the antisubrogation rule in this case is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted for basically the same reasons this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered in FMC in concluding that the same rule was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted under ERISA.  That is to say that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively requires plan administrators to calculate 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits on the basis of different liability conditions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that vary from State to State; that very importantly, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermines the statute's goal of uniformity; and third, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it could encourage plan sponsors, in this case, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal government, to reduce the scope of coverage. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In addition to those reasons, this statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives you an additional reason to find that it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted, and that is that it also preempts those rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that relate to payments with respect to benefits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It is quite clear to us that the subrogation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and reimbursement claims that are at issue in these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules quite plainly refer to and relate to payments with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to benefits; and therefore, the Supreme Court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Missouri was wrong in overlooking that part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute and also wrong in overlooking your decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FMC v. Holliday. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any -- any room 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all for State regulation of carriers who have these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

contracts with OPM? 

 

 

5 

            

MR. ESTRADA:  Well, to be sure, the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, if you focus on the last clause -- now, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute appears in page 2 of the blue brief -- if you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focus on the last clause, the statute only reaches those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State laws that, quote, "relate to health insurance or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans."  And there are any number of subjects that may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be reached by these laws, or by other laws, and also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjects that are not related to benefits, coverage or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments with respect to benefits. 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress dealt separately in Section -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 8909(f) with the subject of taxation in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of these plans and generally provided that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carriers may be subject to generally-applicable laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are applicable to all businesses under profits and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- and the like, but that States, you know, may not tax, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, the benefits and the payments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so Congress has, in fact, crafted a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited preemption provision that singles out those laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are most likely to apply to the insurance plans at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, and then only say that the scope of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption will be defined by particular terms of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract.  And so in our view, in some ways, the reach 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this law is somewhat more limited than the -- that of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ERISA statute because, although your "relate"

language is identical and they should have identical

scope with respect to benefits coverage and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments with respect to benefits, it does not reach all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws of the State.  It targets, to begin with, only the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health insurance -- those laws that relate to health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance or plans. 

 

 

            

Now, if I could get to the second point, we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize that --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Before you do, I mean, we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

appeared to find this a difficult question in McVeigh. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

We said there were two plausible readings.  We said it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a hard statute.  We didn't want to decide as between 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the two.  You know, what do you make of that case? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ESTRADA:  I actually was going to be the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

headline on my second point, Justice Kagan.  So thank 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you. 

            

You know, we recognize that McVeigh 

 

 

 

 

 

considered the same statute and concluded that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute did not give rise to a cause of action in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal subject matter jurisdiction.  And we believe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that that question was indeed difficult, because unlike 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA, where Congress expressly provided a cause of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

action in Section 502 of that statute, Congress had not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done so here.  And the Court was basically being asked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to imply common law cause of action out of the terms of

what otherwise appears to be a defensive preemption 

   

 

 

 

 

 

prohibition, which is relatively rare. 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

The background rule in the Federal system is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Federal preemption is a defense only, as we learned 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Motley case.  And the difficulty that the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had was in transforming what it otherwise would be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense into a cause of action and implying Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

              

I think that context is extremely important 

 

 

 

 

 

to understand the Court's caveat as to the text of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, because the question then was will the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would bear a construction that was expansive indeed with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to an entirely different subject matter. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With -- with respect to the question of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the Court considered the statute as being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

susceptible on the merits of the defense to plausible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative constructions, I think if you look at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant passage, what the Court said was that different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructions were being urged upon the Court; on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one hand, one by the United States, and on the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hand, another one by the Cruz plaintiffs out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seventh Circuit. 

 

            

The Court described both of them generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as plausible and wrote to saying that it didn't have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pick either of them.  We do not believe that that sort

of description of the litigants' position really rises 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

to the finding that the statute is ambiguous as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold for even a Chevron analysis, because the Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not considering any canon of construction, was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering context, was not considering purpose.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was simply describing the position of litigants in front 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this Court and concluding that it was unnecessary to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pick one or the other. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Counsel, in this case you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have an express-preemption provision.  You have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal entity that makes the contract.  So that may be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all you need to say in order to prevail.  But there --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are there some limiting principles that we -- should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just be in the back of our mind when we think about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption?  The case in Boyle was, I think, a close 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

case.  Completely different from this because there was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no express preemption. 

 

 

            

So it's not really your obligation to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct -- to address a parade of horribles that isn't in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, but are there some general limiting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles that we should keep in mind when determining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not preemption, A, existed; B, is permitted? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ESTRADA:  Well, of course.  You know, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you have, really, three headings of preemption under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court's doctrine.  You have conflict where you take

the text of the statute and decide whether the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

rule actually conflicts as a -- as the label says.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that's the common form that comes in front of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court, and I think that's just a question of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary statutory interpretation applying all the 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant canons and considering as well the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of Congress. 

 

 

            

The harder cases are ones like Hillman v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maretta where you're not dealing with actual language of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute, but you're considering whether the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law is an obstacle to what Congress wanting -- wanted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get at.  And this case does not involve that problem 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except as an a fortiori type argument as to how this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be out even under that rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the issue in this case seems to me to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you have here, where Congress had exercised an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate level of Federal power under Section --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Article 1 Section 8, and then has gone further by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself declaring what it views as the consequences with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Federal/State balance.  And in this context, it seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to us that it is especially inappropriate to consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the conceivable limits would be of a doctrine that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arises practically in every case. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, maybe one 

  

 

 

 

 

doctrine has to do with the delegation issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

Suppose Congress passed a law that said, 

   

 

 

 

 

10 

well, any professional responsibility -- any 

 

 

 

 

 

professional responsibility rule adopted by the ABA will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempt contrary State law. 

 

 

 

            

            

Is that okay under preemption doctrine? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ESTRADA:  Well, it seems to me likely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not, but let me take apart what I think are the key 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspects of the consequence of the -- of that answer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First, Congress has to identify a part of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Article 1, Section 8 that gives it a head of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional authority to do what you just described. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Second, to my --

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you just -- are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you just saying this is beyond -- regulating the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ESTRADA:  Well --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- profession is 

  

 

 

 

 

beyond Congress's power? 

 

 

            

MR. ESTRADA:  -- as described, is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

self-evidently connected to any one of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Well, assume 

  

  

 

 

 

it is within Congress's power to legislate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ESTRADA:  When -- then there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question of identifying what it is that Congress is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to do.  It is, in fact, true that Congress has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted what otherwise would be State -- State rules for

the government of certain issues.  You know, you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

things like you have -- like the assimilated crime 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, for example.  And, you know, the question is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how closely it is tied to the relevant heading of power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then whether Congress has provided enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governmental supervision for the activity so that it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to a delegated exercise of power under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate standards by an ultimately responsible 

 

 

 

 

 

authority. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess, is it --

    

 

 

 

 

 

you know, in some of those areas, you're talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State governments.  Is -- is it permissible for Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to delegate the authority to decide what laws are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted to a private entity? 

   

 

 

            

MR. ESTRADA:  I think it depends on how it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

does it.  I would be reluctant to say that considering 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever crisis or problem Congress may be considering, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there's a particular avenue of dealing with them 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is completely foreclosed.  But to the extent that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are limits to the ability of Congress to do such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things, it seems to me that a precondition for Congress' 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability to do that would be to do something like has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened, for example, in the securities markets where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have what are called self-regulatory organizations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where trade groups, in effect, have rules that apply to

parts of the industry, but they're strictly supervised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

and approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there is recourse for their violation to go in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court. 

 

            

Now, those rules in some cases are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered preemptive, and so I don't want to foreclose, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, the proposition that as a category using an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

industry group or a private group, so long as it is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to appropriate government supervision, could not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a possible tool that Congress could use. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well --

  

 

 

 

MR. ESTRADA:  But in that event -- if I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could just finish -- but in that event, you would also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the additional layer of involvement having to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the limit that this Court itself has placed on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- on the delegation by Congress -- Congress of any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  You do have something called the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Nondelegation Doctrine. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what about two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

private parties, whether, you know -- whatever they are, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a railroad and a shipper, in other words, and Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, whatever you agree to will preempt contrary State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws. 

            

            

MR. ESTRADA:  I believe --

    

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know you're going 

    

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

to suggest --

 

 

13 

            

            

case --

 

            

            

            

MR. ESTRADA:  No. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- it's not this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ESTRADA:  No, no.  I understand --

    

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- but assume it is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ESTRADA:  I understand that, Mr. Chief 

    

 

 

 

 

Justice.  I find it hard to believe that Congress could 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawfully give a blank check to private individuals 

   

 

 

 

 

 

without any subject -- without any government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervision and/or without appropriate standards as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what it is that they may do or not do.  But I want to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish the hypothetical that you posit from what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at issue in this case. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, before you 

  

 

 

 

 

get -- get to that, I mean, it would seem to me that you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could deal with the concerns you have and still address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the problem.  In other words, it's not a blank check. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

You know, it -- any rate between, you know, $10 per mile 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and $30 per mile, but you, the parties, you know, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to give the -- the free enterprise system a little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more scope than having the government set it.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever rate you set between $10 and $30 a ton or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mile will preempt contrary State regulation.

this is a question to some extent of conceptualizing.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

think I am agreeing with the basic premise of your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, Mr. Chief Justice, but there are, of course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits to the ability of Congress to delegate to private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The question, I think, 

   

  

 

 

which is perhaps truly speculative, but it is rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interesting, if we go back to the sick chicken, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Schechter --

 

            

            

question --

 

            

            

MR. ESTRADA:  Well, I was going to go there. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- there first is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ESTRADA:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- of whether Congress has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this Article 8 power to legislate at all in the area. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

yes. 

            

MR. ESTRADA:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You assume the answer's 

  

 

 

 

 

The second is a nondelegation question. 

   

 

 

 

There, the delegation had run riot.  But suppose they'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used the words "unfair competition" instead of "fair 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competition" and, therefore, they had satisfied the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nondelegation Doctrine. 

 

            

Given the satisfaction of the -- of the

doctrine or nondelegation, is there additional 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

requirement?  Does the preemption matter, assuming there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were parts of that that preempted as there must have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been, is that a separate doctrine that imposes yet a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further restriction, or once the first two are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied, have you automatically satisfied the third? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ESTRADA:  I find it hard to say that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's an independent limit on the basis of preemption, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because, as I understand the power of Congress, Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

could pass a statute that displaces all law in a subject 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter and renders it a law-free area, for example.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so I don't know that I would ever say that in dealing 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a crisis like the Great Depression, for example, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress could not turn to the type of remedies that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tried in the Schechter case and that those would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely foreclosed to Congress.  But --

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  But the 

  

  

 

 

 

idea -- the concern is -- raised by your friend on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side is, yes, Congress can do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ESTRADA:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But we're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

about the preemption of State law.  And the question is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not they've authorized someone not subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the political constraints that Congress is subject to to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undertake that pretty significant step of telling State

law -- State legislators that they can't legislate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. ESTRADA:  But if I could just pivot to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what -- why the -- the argument doesn't really fit what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the problem is that we have in this case, even though it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is preemption, is that it arises ostensibly because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute literally says that the terms of its statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would supersede and preempt.  It is quite evident from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute that what Congress actually intended to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the words will bear is that the terms of the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall be effective notwithstanding the contrary, et 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cetera, et cetera. 

 

 

            

And that although I understand that the 

   

 

 

 

 

whole delegation going down, you know, the -- the road 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of delegation is very interesting, I will point out that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nowhere has a delegation challenge as such been raised 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case in any of the lower courts, and that it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only in this Court that this was reconceptualized as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

              

I think the proper way to conceptualize what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has done in this statute, as it has in many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other statutes, is that it has displaced State law to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create room for the operation unimpeded of certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract terms that it believed should be encouraged for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the public interest.  The Federal Arbitration Act is one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example of that, even though it is a purely private

statute.  You know, the -- the statute that we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

mentioning earlier, ERISA, is another. 

 

 

 

 

              

I will simply say that if Congress can do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that to make room for the operation of purely private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts, a context that involves Federal benefits for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal workforce under Federal contracts 

 

 

 

 

 

administered by a Federal agency is something that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress can clearly deal with, because under Clearfield 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Trust and its progeny, these contracts would be governed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by Federal common law in any event, and that law would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be preemptive, at least in certain circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it is certainly appropriate for Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to identify itself the outlines and limits of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption than to leave it to ad hoc adjudication of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common law claims by the Federal courts in this country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  And I would

about how they work, why they're important --

statute --

 

            

            

ambiguous? 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think the 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. TRIPP:  -- and --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. TRIPP:  I guess --

    

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Whether we get to 

  

 

 

 

 

Chevron deference at all. 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  I guess our basic take is that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the answer to that doesn't really matter because we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picked one of the two interpretations and it's really up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Respondent to show that our interpretation is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even reasonable.  And we think that there's just no way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they can do that.  Our interpretation, we think, is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just a better interpretation, if you were choosing among 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the two. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why is the agency 

  

 

 

 

 

 

better than a court suited to define its own 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction? 

            

MR. TRIPP:  Right.  And so that's what I was 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

wanting to get at and explain how these regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work.  And I -- so I think the key point that I want to 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphasize here is that in the preemption provision, the

administering under a different provision of the 

   

 

 

 

 

statute.  8902(d) says that each contract shall include 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

such benefits and limitations and other definitions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits as it considers necessary or desirable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So those two things go hand in hand.  In the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations, they work the same way.  In Section B(1) of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the regulations, it says that subrogation imposes a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

condition of and a limitation on benefits and benefit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments and that makes good sense.  It's a clawback 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

provision. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- you've 

  

 

 

 

 

already -- you just slid into the Chevron question; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  I -- I understood Justice Sotomayor to want to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

know if you -- well, at least as I would want to know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do you need Chevron to get around the ambiguity? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because once you say that, it's -- you get into somewhat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious questions about whether Chevron applies, 

 

 

 

 

 

basically, to the decisions of private entities to -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, I think the concern is it's bad enough that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're preempting State law, but now they get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference.  They can preempt State law so long as their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms are plausible.

MR. TRIPP:  Right.  So -- so I think we 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

20 

would win this case even without Chevron deference, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the regulations.  I think we just have the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

better of the two readings of the statute.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application of the presumption against preemption here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think, is really just fundamentally misguided.  Not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only do we have an express-preemption provision, we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about Federal benefits for Federal employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Federal contracts entered into under a Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  And the way this would work on the ground is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if Missouri can prohibit subrogation, then what happens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that Federal workers in Illinois who are enrolled in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same plan and paying the same premiums are footing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bill for benefit payments they can't even keep, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not part of a State's traditional authority to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose those kinds of externalities on out-of-State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal workers. 

 

            

So what I was getting at, and the answer to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor's question, is that we would clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get deference here on -- on 8902(d) in determining what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are -- what are the definitions and are there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations on benefits available under a plan?  And I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think under Chevron, it doesn't make much sense for us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to get less deference in determining what is the nature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and extent of benefits and benefit payments, if it's

really just another way of saying the same thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, on -- on why it's important -- I think I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

covered this a little before -- but to be very concrete 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about this, in the D.C. metro region, Virginia prohibits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subrogation, but Maryland and the District of Columbia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do not.  Under Respondent's position, similarly-situated 

  

 

 

 

 

Federal workers working for the same agency, enrolled in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same plan, and paying the same premiums would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different benefits and -- and the different extent of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit payments, depending on whether they lived in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bethesda or McLean.  We think that's just clearly wrong. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And then on -- on -- on --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, you understand 

  

 

 

 

 

the problem, and I understand the argument that it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

semantic, but sometimes semantics matter.  If you wanted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to take care of that problem, you just have to pass a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law saying that the -- the State laws are preempted --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. TRIPP:  Yeah.  And then -- then --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you don't.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

says that the contract is what preempts the State laws. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  Sure.  And I -- and I think what 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

my -- my brother said was exactly right.  If you just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turn to the statute, I'd like to illustrate why I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it really proves as no constitutional problem at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's on page 2 of the blue brief or page 3 of the gray 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

brief. 

            

It says that the terms of these Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

contracts shall supersede and preempt State or local law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relating to health insurance or plans.  What that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly means is that the terms of the contract shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply notwithstanding State or local law.  It's a non 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

obstante provision like the Supremacy Clause itself, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think when you read it that way, it makes it crystal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear that the -- that the statute is doing all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempting here.  It's creating a protective umbrella to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

enable OPM --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If -- if you edit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute, it's perfectly clear.  It doesn't say -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, it says preempt. 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRIPP:  And -- and I think what I was 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

getting at is, I think it's a perfectly natural reading 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

of shall supersede and preempt to interpret that to mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall apply notwithstanding, because the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supremacy Clause itself has similar language about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding.  We think that's obviously what 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress was getting at here.  Every other Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits -- general -- general Federal benefits statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has this same language, so it's health insurance, life, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dental, vision, long-term care; we don't think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's any problem in -- in -- in picking this

If there are no further questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Wessler. 

 

          

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W.H. WESSLER 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A decade ago in McVeigh, this Court stressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that FEHBA's express-preemption clause requires cautious 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation.  That instruction remains true today. 

  

 

 

 

 

Section 8902(m)(1) was, in Congress's own words, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposely limited and not designed to disturb the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important role that States play in regulating those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private insurers who participate in the FEHBA program. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indeed, that is why, when Congress first enacted the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision, it specifically warned that the clause would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not preempt insurers from traditional State laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governing insurance. 

 

            

Reading FEHBA's express-preemption clause 

 

 

 

narrowly here so that subrogation contract terms do not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempt otherwise applicable State law honors Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent and accords respect for the States as independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereigns in their historic role in governing matters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of insurance and tort law.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does the -- does the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute 8902(m)(1), does it preempt anything? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, we think that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute is unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so, as written, it has -- it should have no effect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think if you carve that out for -- for one second, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think what Your Honor is asking is are there a subset of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws that Congress was attempting to displace by virtue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these contract terms, and I think the answer to that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is yes and you can get that from the legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history. 

            

There were -- I think, just to back up for a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second, when Congress first passed FEHBA in 1959, it did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not attempt to enact a uniform area of Federal law.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- you know this because what Congress said when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first passed the law was, there's a problem with Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workers.  They don't have the same competitive Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits packages that those in the private sector do; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we want to create a competitive way to allow that to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entice them to work for the government.  But they also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a problem, because the government wasn't 

   

 

 

 

 

administering any sort of serious health program.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so what they chose to do was to tap into the private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market. 

            

They -- they explicitly said, we don't have

the expertise to administer this program.  We'd like to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

act as a market participant and buy these plans from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private insurers who are doing business in the States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so from its inception, the FEHBA program was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dual-regulatory scheme.  Congress intended States and 

  

 

 

 

 

their insurance laws to govern those participant --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those private insurers who are participating in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program. 

            

Now, in the '70s what happened was that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number of the carriers and the agency administering the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program, which was then at the time called CSC, found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there were a number of States that had begun to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pass benefit laws; State laws that required, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance, a carrier to cover acupuncture services or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

chiropractor services.  And the carriers went to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress and they said, these laws pose a problem.  We 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

need you to address this in some fashion.  And that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Congress did with 8902(m)(1), but it was very clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the legislative history at the time it passed this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute in 1978, that it was purposely limited and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to displace the State background insurance laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would apply to all of the carriers participating in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this program. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Before we get to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

legislative history, could you say something about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

terms of this provision?  Would you argue that the terms 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a sub -- of a subrogation -- of a contract that has a 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

subrogation provision do not relate to coverage?  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do not relate to benefits, that they do not relate to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment of benefits?  Could you explain how you would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach that conclusion? 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  That's right, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

That -- that, we think, is the best reading for three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  First, the -- it makes sense to distinguish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subrogation from benefits, because subrogation claims 

 

 

 

 

 

involve the proceeds of a distinct and separate tort 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause of action that happens distinct in time and is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highly contingent.  It doesn't involve any -- it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect at all any payment for a benefit or a coverage 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a Federal worker might receive --

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  It doesn't -- it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

affect the benefits that the participant receives? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. WESSLER:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If -- if it -- if there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subrogation claim, the benefit receives a certain 

   

 

 

 

 

amount.  If there is a potential, it's -- if there's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement of subrogation, the participant receives 

 

 

 

 

 

that amount minus X? 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  I don't think that's quite 

    

 

 

 

 

right, Your Honor.  They get the MR -- a Federal worker,

let's say, who needs coverage for an MRI, gets -- gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that MRI covered and gets the coverage for that MRI paid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

for by her insurance plan regardless of any subrogation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. 

  

 

MR. WESSLER:  Because that claim is 

  

 

 

 

 

necessarily contingent, it may never occur.  And -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money that -- that ultimately is involved in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subrogation claim isn't the money that is getting paid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for, for the MRI coverage.  It's money that comes out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a separate -- the proceeds of a separate tort claim from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a personal injury action. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But money is money, and, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, one dollar is as good as the next.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is -- I think what Justice Alito is saying; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll just say it my way -- is one way -- say you're in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

car accident.  One way you get all the hospital and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical costs that you incur, and the other way you get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those costs minus any recovery in a tort suit.  So maybe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a recovery won't happen in a tort suit, but a recovery 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

might happen in a tort suit and then you get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerably less. 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, I think -- I think that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that is certainly possible, although I do think the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

money matters.  These are historically equitable claims

and the pots of money and the differences about from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

where those monies come matters in the way you conceive, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the outset, of what a benefit is and whether that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit will be covered. 

 

 

 

            

But I also think that part of understanding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

how to interpret the text of the statute requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding what Congress intended when it passed it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the first place.  And I think the purpose here is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress was distinctly concerned with these kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of front-end benefit laws that made it difficult for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carriers to know and provide for the coverage that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted and not to be required to cover for Arizona's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acupuncture doctors' benefits and services that weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered under, for instance, a Blue Cross/Blue Shield 

   

 

 

 

 

 

plan. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The point is, is your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

point.  Look, what we're talking about here is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

subrogation.  Has nothing to do with coverage.  It has 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing to do with benefits.  You're covered, you get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money, you get the CAT scan.  You're covered, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get the hospital payment, you get the pain and suffering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or whatever, you -- you're covered. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, there's a different thing that happens 

   

 

 

 

 

in the world.  There's a tort suit.  And our law affects 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proceeds of that tort suit.  The proceeds of that

tort suit are not benefits.  The proceeds of that tort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

suit are not coverage.  The proceeds of that tort suit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are some money that our State and a judge decided should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be paid to a victim of an accident.  Is that the point? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. WESSLER:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if that's the point, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

then what about payments with respect to benefits? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The -- the sub -- those payments are not even with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to benefits? 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Again, I don't think that's 

   

  

 

 

 

the best reading of the statute for largely the reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Justice Breyer gave.  The -- the benefits and the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment of those benefits contemplates a front-end 

   

 

 

 

 

question about whether you are getting your MRI covered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the plan, not whether many years down the road there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is some additional extra pot of money that is then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available to be shared among a number of different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

entities. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But the question isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

whether it's benefits; it's whether it relates to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits, and not even whether it relates to benefits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it relates to payments with respect to benefits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  I -- I -- yes.  I think that's 

    

    

   

 

 

 

-- that's certainly right, but I think relates to, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, is -- is context-dependent in this -- in this --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

for this statute as it is for every other statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

            

And Congress had a laser focus when it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

passed this statute in 1978.  It did not want to disturb 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise applicable State insurance laws.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reason it didn't want to disturb those laws is because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it understood that the private carriers that were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participating in this program should be governed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same laws that would govern anybody in the private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sector when it comes to insurance. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that's why this distinction, I think, is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

a false one between a employer -- an employee in -- in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Missouri and an employee in Kansas getting different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights because their State laws are different.  That is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely the kind of differences that Congress wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to ensure controlled in the FEHB program. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I -- I think also, you know, what this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

points up, Justice Alito, is that there is, I think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this textual ambiguity that certainly can be read, based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on just a -- a pure matter of --

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  There is no ambiguity.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

answer to the point, if I got the point right, is you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, you know, it's sort of like a lottery or something. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's some money floating out there.  And what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract says, different from what the State law says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that money that's floating out there, maybe you won

it in a lottery or it came from Mars as far as this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receiving benefits is concerned by the patient, but this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract says you take that money that came from Mars or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

wherever and you pay it to the insurance company. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

think --

 

            

Why do you pay it to the insurance company? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. WESSLER:  Well, I think -- I mean, I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because what is it that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance company did that entitles them to receive that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money from Mars?  What is it that they did? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, they -- they included in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their contract this requirement --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

just very simply, in three words, what did they do that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled them to money from Mars? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. WESSLER:  Sure.  They paid the benefits. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Exactly.  So there we are. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Now, it relates to benefits because they get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money from this separate thing that happened because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they paid benefits.  So now how do you say that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract does not relate to benefits? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, Your Honor, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

again, the question is -- is largely what did Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend when it passed this statute.  The question --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"relates to" could be read uncritically broadly, or it

could be read narrowly, and -- and the -- the proper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

approach, I think, as this Court has explained in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple different contexts, is to ask what did Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend when it passed this particular express-preemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause.  And here, we know that their goal was not to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create an expansive form of preemption that could extend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to cover laws that would fall within traditional areas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of State insurance regulations. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  How do we know that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  They said in the legislative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

history, it is purposely limited and not intended to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

displace otherwise applicable State insurance law. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  You know, our colleague 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Scalia, is not here any longer, but he would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having a fit at this point, so maybe --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Sure.  I -- I understand, Your 

    

   

  

 

 

Honor.  But again, I think in McVeigh, what -- one of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lessons in McVeigh is that there is this textual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity that arises from precisely this colloquy that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've had.  And the question then becomes what does --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what does the Court do in the face of this textual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity when we don't quite know what Congress may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have intended exactly. 

 

 

            

And in the area of traditional State

regulation, as we are in when it comes to insurance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

there's a -- when we're talking about State laws and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether Congress intended to displace those State laws, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we require a clear statement from Congress before we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

undo a category, wipe away --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Wessler, what is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

how do you differentiate our holding in Hillman? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  I --

    

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is this --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- any more or less 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"relates to" than in Hillman? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, I --

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Almost identical 

  

 

 

language.  And we read it very, very broadly. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, the critical 

  

 

 

 

distinction, Your Honor, in Hillman, is that Hillman was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided on an implied form of preemption.  The Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said -- life insurance statute at issue there, including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an express-preemption clause, but the Court didn't --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't address the effect or meaning of that clause at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all and instead looked to the -- to the statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language and the regulations that the agency promulgated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and found that -- a Virginia State law that would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required something else other than what the -- the

statute required was in conflict. 

 

 

 

 

34 

            

            

Now we think implied preemption --

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why -- why isn't there a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conflict here? 

 

            

            

MR. WESSLER:  We -- we think that there --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's a direct 

   

  

 

conflict between what the benefits paid here demand --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's benefits minus later subrogation -- and what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law says, which is you can't honor that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contractual term. 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  I -- sure.  So one thing to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

say, first -- I'll answer your question, Your Honor, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is not an implied preemption case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Neither the Petitioners nor the government 

 

 

 

 

 

have argued that there is a conflict that has -- that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been created that gives rise to a form of implied 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption.  Their argument is focused solely on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning of scope of this express-preemption clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

Now, there could be, down the road, if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government were to, in fact, enact a substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

regulation, some form of implied conflict that could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give rise to the displacement of State law, but we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not in that world in this case today. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think that's actually a crucial point 

   

   

 

 

 

that -- that what we have here is the challengers are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

asking for what is, in essence, an unprecedented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

expansion of Chevron at the same time while trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

smuggle in insurance laws through express-preemption 

 

 

 

 

 

clause, when they have available to them the possibility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of arguing, as in Hillman, an implied form of preemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would still allow the Court to do the -- the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- to make the decision about whether there's indeed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an irreconcilable conflict. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- but --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so I do.  That -- that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

gives me whip -- whiplash.  All of a sudden you -- you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have implied preemption, and that's the -- the preferred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument to express preemption?  It should be just the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other way around. 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, I think, Your Honor, 

   

  

 

 

 

that is what happened in Hillman v. Maretta.  And there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was an express-preemption clause like there was here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but the Court, you know, instead of considering whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that express-preemption clause displaced Virginia law, 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted a form of implied preemption to decide whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a conflict.  But we don't have here a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive regulation --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it just seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as orderly proceeding for us to ask the first question: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is there express preemption?  And that displaces the

whole necessity for going through the very difficult 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise of implied preemption. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, I --

   

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You seem to indicate it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has some priority.  That was my only comment. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, I don't -- I don't 

   

   

  

 

 

know -- I wouldn't -- I don't think there's necessarily 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

a priority, but I don't think the express-preemption 

   

 

 

 

 

 

clause in this case can bear the weight of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation that the challenger is --

 

 

 

 

 

            

thing.

couple of years ago, we said with respect to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express-preemption clause, we said that the presumption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against preemption just didn't apply in a case like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- like that; that it was only applicable in a case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of implied preemption. 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Right.  I -- well, I don't 

    

   

  

 

 

think this Court has overruled the 70 years of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent establishing that the presumption against 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption applies to express-preemption clauses.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

think --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that was just a careless

statement --

 

            

            

            

MR. WESSLER:  No.  I think that --

    

  

 

 

 

37 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- on our part? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. WESSLER:  I think in that case, the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

point the Court was making was that where the language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of an express-preemption clause is clear, where we know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress intended to displace a -- a particular 

   

   

 

 

 

 

State law, the presumption does not need to apply.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that's perfectly consistent with an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation here, that where the text is ambiguous, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where we do not have a clear statement from Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it intended to displace some particular area of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law, that we would -- we would exercise caution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not cavalierly displace that State law unless and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until Congress makes that intent clear. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd like, if I can, to just turn to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts' question that he posed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the challengers about the very odd nature of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express-preemption clause, because I do think it raises 

   

 

 

 

 

 

some very serious constitutional problems that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if -- if this Court were to adopt the challengers' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, would -- would allow these contract 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms to really do the displacing of State law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I do think that there is -- it would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unprecedented -- Congress has never enacted another form 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

38 

of this type of preemption that would actually authorize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the terms of privately-negotiated contracts to step in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and displace otherwise applicable sovereign decisions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

And there really is no way around this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem in the case, other than to adopt a narrow 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of what the -- what relates to benefits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means, because Congress, when it wrote this statute in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1978, unambiguously intended to delegate the power to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempt to these terms of contracts.  And these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts are not laws under the Supremacy Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Does your -- does your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument depend on the wording of this provision?  Does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it depend on the fact that it says the terms of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract shall supersede State or local law?  Would --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would you have a -- would you make the same argument if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it said this statute hereby supersedes and preempts any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State or local law that conflicts with the terms of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract? 

            

MR. WESSLER:  I think that is -- I think 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that is a -- a far better approach that would -- would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely not raise these problems, because it points back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a -- a statute that actually does the preempting. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, boy, if you're willing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to concede that, I don't see what there is to your

argument because that's, in essence, what this is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what this is saying. 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  But the difference, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

Honor, is that here the terms are -- the terms of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts are determining the scope of preemption.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the terms themselves are not known by Congress at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time it passes the law.  What Your Honor suggested looks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a lot more like what ERISA looks like where Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said the subchapters of ERISA preempt any State law that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might interfere with plans.  But when this Court does a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption analysis under ERISA, it refers back to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- to the actual substantive provisions in ERISA to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine preemption. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But Congress doesn't know 

  

 

 

 

 

the term -- doesn't know what's in all these plans. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They didn't know what would be in all these plans when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they enacted it. 

 

 

            

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, that --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It depends on the -- it --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on -- on the formulation.  If you say the contract 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempts anything that conflicts with State law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's -- that's a problem.  But if it -- this -- it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, this statute hereby preempts anything that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conflicts with the contract, that's -- that's not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem?

MR. WESSLER:  Well, it depends on what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute says.  And in ERISA, when Congress passed ERISA, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it included a series of substantive provisions that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

dictate which State laws are displaced.  For instance, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

it has reporting requirements.  It has disclosure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

requirements.  It has a remedial scheme.  All of those 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

substantive provisions give force to the preemption of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law. 

 

            

Here, there isn't any of that.  All Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has said is we're -- we are authorizing these contract 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms sight unseen that are entered into by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government, not acting as regulator, but acting as -- as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market participant, and the terms of those contracts are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to other -- to displace otherwise applicable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign State law. 

 

 

            

And -- and there truly is no limiting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle if, in fact, that is authorized under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supremacy Clause, because, as the Chief suggested, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be nothing to stop Congress from doing the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing for completely private contracts or the rules of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some informal body. 

 

 

            

When -- when the Supremacy Clause speaks of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a law being capable of displacing the sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions of States, it requires that there be some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accountability checkpoints, some procedural protections

that safeguard States from the kind of arbitrary

decision making that could occur through an informal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process where there's no public participation and no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial oversight. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think I don't quite 

    

   

 

 

understand your -- your answer to Justice Alito's first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  I think he gave you a statute something along 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

the lines of this Federal law preempts and supersedes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any State law that conflicts with these kinds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts.  And you said that would not be subject to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your constitutional concerns; is that right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  I may have misheard -- I may 

    

   

 

 

 

 

have misheard Justice Alito. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because those contracts are 

  

 

 

 

 

just as indefinite as the -- as the contracts in this --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. WESSLER:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- statute written here. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. WESSLER:  That's right.  And -- and the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

key point, the one that I think might infect a -- would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infect that -- that hypothetical is that where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract terms themselves are determining the scope of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption, where they, the terms, are actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring State law to yield, that is where I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the Supremacy Clause comes into play because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those contract terms themselves are not laws.  They have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

not been enacted by Congress.  They come with no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

safeguards, procedural protections --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but that -- that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

again, is true of ERISA, too.  ERISA is a statute that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says this Federal law displaces these State laws because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they conflict with a bunch of contract terms. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  Well, I think the difference 

   

  

 

 

 

is that when this Court does -- when this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considers preemption in ERISA, the Court looks to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive provisions of the statute.  It looks to, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance, the remedial scheme.  It says there is this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedial scheme in ERISA, and that substantive scheme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

displaces a State common law claim.  The same would be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

true for a disclosure requirement. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Doesn't -- doesn't specify 

  

 

 

 

 

everything that's in -- in a State -- in a -- in a plan. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And things that are in a plan that are not required by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA supersede State law; isn't that true? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  That's true.  But what happens 

  

  

 

 

 

 

then is you have Federal common law that comes in to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fill the gap.  What we know from McVeigh here is that we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not in a Federal common law context.  These contract 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms, the ones involving subrogation and reimbursement, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not governed by Federal common law.  They are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctly State law controlled.  They arise after a

personal injury happens in a State and through a tort 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

43 

action in State court.  They are governed by these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinct State law rules, not any Federal common law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so the difference here is that you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what is otherwise a State-focused area of law in which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these terms in Federal contracts that go through no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oversight, no public participation are being used to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deflect those State laws in a way in which Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself does not have any control over. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think the Court ought be very careful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

before wading in to whether, in fact, that is something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is authorized under the Supremacy Clause.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's what motivated this Court in McVeigh to look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at this exact provision and express what is, I think, a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite concerned view over whether there is the Supremacy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause problem. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I think Mr. Estrada referred 

    

 

 

 

 

to this situation.  What if Congress says that in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular area, States cannot regulate it at all?  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

free market has to govern.  So any State law that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purports to regulate in this area is preempted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Now, is there a problem with that? 

   

 

 

 

 

MR. WESSLER:  I think that -- I think if you 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

are in a world where there's field preemption, where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has displaced everything, you -- you might not

run into this problem.  But I don't think that's what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

we're talking about here. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  You might not run into the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  You might run into the problem? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WESSLER:  I think, again, it depends 

    

 

 

 

 

specifically on what the Federal law says and how it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operating.  But the closest example that the challengers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have come to for -- for an analogue to what Congress has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done here is ERISA, which refers specifically to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subchapters of the law as doing the preempting and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Arbitration Act, which itself only establishes a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal rule of nondiscrimination.  It seeks to put 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitration agreements on the same plane as other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts and have State law apply equally to both. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What's going on here is a rule of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

essentially priority in which -- which Congress has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delegated to these contract terms the power to override 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law and exist above what would otherwise apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- in the private sector.  And I think that actually 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cuts strongly against what Congress intended when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first passed FEHBA, which was that this -- this statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the -- and the -- and the insurance policies that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are offered to Federal workers who are also State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens should be subject to the State insurance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regimes that have controlled these carriers from day one

in the private sector. 

 

 

 

45 

            

And when Congress has been asked to address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific problems in this area, it has reacted and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responded repeatedly.  The one thing that this agency 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, OPM, has not done, as much as it's tried to argue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for Chevron deference over an express -- its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of an express-preemption clause, it has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never, in fact, asked Congress to amend this law to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address what it perceives as a problem. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And I would point the Court in this -- in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this respect to the way preemption works under the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Department of Defense insurance regime.  Because for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of the -- again, the challengers pointing to several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copycat versions of this statute and several of their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other insurance regimes, the Department of Defense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance regime looks very different. 

 

 

 

 

            

What Congress did there is that it first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted an express-preemption clause that looked nearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical to what the Court has in front of it here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then five years later, it amended that law and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delegated the power to preempt not to terms of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract, but to regulations promulgated by a Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

agency; there, the Secretary of Defense. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think if we're thinking about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

democratically accountable ways that preemption should

work and the protections that States must have for their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

own law, allowing either Congress to do the preempting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or delegating that power specifically and expressly to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an agency are the only two ways that we can -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are -- that are constitutionally permissible, and here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have neither. 

 

 

            

Congress itself does not control the terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these contracts, and it has not expressly delegated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any authority to the agency to pronounce on preemption. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so the agency's effort to seek Chevron deference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over what is explicitly a conclusion on the scope of an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express-preemption clause just doesn't work.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

well knows how, when it wants to, to delegate that power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the agency, and it has not done so here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If there are no further questions, save the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest of my time.

MR. ESTRADA:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'd like to start with the last point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel made about how Congress did not expressly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delegate the power to preempt.  I would point out this

other side. 

 

            

Under this Court's ruling in De la Cuesta, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which held -- you know, this Court held that an agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may use general rulemaking authority to preempt State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws, and in those circumstances, of course, their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations get deference. 

 

 

            

And one of the contentions that this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically rejected in De la Cuesta was that in order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the agency to use general rulemaking, Congress had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically to specify that the power to preempt was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of the rules.  That is at page 154 of this Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion.  The case is cited in page 54 of the blue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief. 

            

It's very odd, therefore, that, under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conception that Respondent has, the agency could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done this conclusion on its own under its general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulatory power under 8913, and yet Congress cannot do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so by expressly provided that this is the conclusion it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants. 

            

The second point I would like to make is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- one that addresses Justice Breyer's point, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, keep in mind that this is not a fight as to who gets 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money in the first place.  This is a class action 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint brought in State court against my client under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the theory that we were unjustly enriched by keeping the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

benefits that we should have paid them because we got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

them back.  It is inconceivable to me that in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of a case in which the gravamen of the complaint 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is we took his benefits back, the case could not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

related to benefits.  The relevant parts of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint are Joint Appendix 62A and 63A. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The third point has to do with democratic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accountability and whether you would leave this to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies or bureaucrats as opposed to Congress.  But as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you recognize in City of Arlington, the choice that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being proposed is not between Congress or the agency, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but between the Federal courts, which are certainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unelected and generally unaccountable in the democratic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process and people that, at least in theory, are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately accountable to the elected representatives, 

 

 

 

 

 

that is to say, an agency. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And finally, to the extent that you believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this statute has a constitutional doubt in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms in which it was drafted, I can well believe that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have seen many cases in which you feel that you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the body shop for the roller derby across the street. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is not one of them.  This requires no significant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surgery.  It is, at most, a little bit of buffing, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it is certainly easier than concluded that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some -- concluding that something that Congress had

invoked in Nabutinov, Bond and other cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It is certainly easy here to read shall
