CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this afternoon in Case 16-373, the California Public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Employees' Retirement System v. ANZ Securities. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Goldstein. 

 

          

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

We ask you to hold that American Pipe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling applies to both of the time limits set forth in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 13 of the Securities Act, which is reproduced in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a number of places, including the blue brief at the top 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of page 3. 

 

 

            

The other side has a tendency to invoke the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase "statute of repose," which isn't really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self-defining in the phrase, in no event, when there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more going on in the statute than that, so I thought I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would just start with the text, and it begins, "no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action" -- and action is going to be the important noun 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

"No action shall be maintained to enforce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any liability created under Section 11 unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought" -- and that's going to be the operative thing

that has to happen -- "within one year after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after such discovery should have been made by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise of reasonable diligence." 

 

 

 

The three-year period will follow in the next sentence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but we can pause here for just a second because it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teaches a lot. 

   

            

We know that American Pipe tolling applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to this sentence, and therefore, we know a few things, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it's conceded and everyone agrees. 

 

 

 

 

 

The action is brought on --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're -- you're just a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

little fast for me. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sorry.  I apologize.  Yes. 

    

  

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't want to interrupt 

    

 

 

 

 

you.  We know American toll -- American Pipe applies? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  To this sentence, that is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if you do not -- if you file your action within one year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and class certification is denied, say, at year two, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we haven't gotten to three years yet, if class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification is denied two years afterwards, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American Pipe tolling applies, and a class member can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

opt out. 

 

              

I apologize for moving through that so 

 

 

 

 

 

quickly.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand. 

    

 

5 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And so what we know from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, I think, is, as American Pipe tells us, that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class action complaint commences the action on behalf of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each unnamed class member, and in the wording of Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13, it brings the action on behalf of every unnamed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class member. 

 

            

So the class complaint in our case, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was filed within a year, brought the action on our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behalf. 

            

Now, the second sentence says, and it's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one at issue in the case before you, "in no event shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any such action," referring to the one in the previous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence, "be brought to enforce a liability created 

   

 

 

 

 

 

under Section 11 more than three years after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

security was bona fide offered to the public." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so what happens, we believe, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just as the action was brought by the class action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint within one year, it was also brought within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily three years.  It was brought and it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought on our behalf. 

 

 

 

            

And we don't think that there's anything in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this sentence that is concerned with the application of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like American Pipe tolling, which is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of Rule 23.

If it doesn't apply here, we think, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 23 doesn't work, and it's going to generate all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manner of satellite litigation over what is the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of repose and what isn't.  And it will all be entirely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointless. 

            

            

As we understand --

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But the argument that you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

making is the one that you describe, I think -- or am I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct, it's the one you say on page 38 of your brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the easiest way to decide this case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, sir.  This is 

  

  

 

 

 

the straightforward argument --

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Statute of repose argument? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  This is -- well, I -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't mean to confuse --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  The -- the argument relating 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to the statute of repose. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It has nothing to do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the class action was still pending at the time, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the debate over what the scope of the second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question presented is.  This is the argument that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented straightforwardly in IndyMac, and it is simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that under the text of Section 13, the class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action complaint brought the action on our behalf. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the point that I was making is that, as I understand 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the other side's rule, it amounts to amount -- a huge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

amount of just pointless paperwork, because as the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side understands how the statute should operate, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is, when the class action complaint is filed, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what should happen is every class member ought to move 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to intervene in the action or file their own individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint then, to presage the possibility that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetically, some day later, they might opt out and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigate on their behalf.  Not necessarily that they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

will, but that they might. 

 

 

 

 

            

And the entire point of American Pipe, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting Rule 23, is to stop that from happening. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Has it happened in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Second Circuit? 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It has happened in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Second Circuit.  I will -- so there's the Petrobras case 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the best example.  It was anticipated by American 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pipe.  The other side does point to statistics and I've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continued to look into that. 

 

 

 

 

            

The reason that the number of opt-out cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is relatively small in comparison to the body of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securities litigation in the Second Circuit is twofold. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The first is there are very few recent Section 11 cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because Section 11 cases are only filed in declining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

markets.  If the market is increasing and the price of

securities is going up, then there's no point in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bringing Section 11 litigation at all, because it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

divined by -- you're -- you only get damages if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price goes down. 

 

 

            

And the second is, when the Second Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

announced this rule in the IndyMac case, this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately granted review.  And so there is an amicus 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief by securities and civil procedure professors who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain why it is that you haven't seen a ton of this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet, but if you announce a rule that tells lawyers like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, you will only protect your client's interest if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's -- you are -- there's a class action lawsuit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under something that is a statute of repose, or looks 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like it, you will only protect your client's interest if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you file your own lawsuit or you move to intervene.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will do just that.  It was --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is -- is it -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said you only can bring -- bring a suit if the -- if the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price -- price goes down? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You can only --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if everybody 

  

 

 

 

 

else's stock in -- in your sector is going up 50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent, and your stock goes up 5 percent, and you think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's because of a non-disclosure, you can't bring an

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, sir.  The floor of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

9 

the -- the price has to go down in order for you to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to recover Section 11 damages -- section -- damages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Section 11.  And that is, there are a variety of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protections for defendants, but if the price hasn't gone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down, then you're not going to get damages under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, and that's why there's almost -- in recent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, there has been very little --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  As a practical matter or as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a formal matter? 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I believe as a formal 

    

   

 

 

matter.  And that causes people as a practical matter 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

not to litigate.  It's no surprise --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but under your --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is an attack on statutes of repose generally.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, oh, if you have a statute of repose, everybody 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will have to sue within three years.  That's exactly the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point of the statute.  That's the whole reason they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed it. 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sir, it is the case that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of the statute of repose, we quite agree, is so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- all of the possible asserted liability is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed within the period in question.  And so that would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be true under a variety of provisions of the securities

laws, under ERISA, a lot of things. 

   

 

 

 

 

10 

            

What American Pipe holds is that the class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action complaint does do that.  So it's very important, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think, that my friend doesn't say that they were in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any way unaware that we had this claim against them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What they want us to do is to move to intervene in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation, and what American Pipe and Crown, Cork & 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seal, and United Airlines all tell us is that we don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to foist upon the district judges, and retired 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district judges have filed an amicus brief, having to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through, churn through this paperwork of 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely unnecessary --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's clearly an argument 

  

 

 

 

 

in your favor, practically, but I think the other side 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has said that that second sentence is what's called a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of repose, whatever historically was the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In CTS, we made a big distinction, and said in such 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes, you cannot toll them, et cetera. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And here we're not talking about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action -- you may be right that -- that -- that when you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file a class action, if it's certified, that is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action brought within the time, but here there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second action. 

 

            

Your client leaves the first action.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what does he do after three years?  I guess he puts a

piece of paper called a complaint in a court and that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would seem to be bringing an action.  And if the other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side says -- I'm just reminding you of these arguments, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because you seem to think that they haven't made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments, they have made arguments -- well, you think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they haven't made good arguments. 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, look, they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

say this is not -- this is a strict liability statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Underwriters, after all, have committed no sin.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't the bright mental state.  They've done nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong. 

            

And in -- in that separate later action, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there might not just be a repetition, one, two, three, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of what's in the class action, but three new things, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four more sentences, maybe 20. 

 

 

 

 

            

So years later, they could -- now, what do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- please, I -- at some point --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- I would like you to deal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

with those actions --

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Of course.  Right.  So --

  

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- those arguments. 

  

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right, so the question is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is this a separate and distinct action within the

meaning of Section 13.  And what American Pipe teaches 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

is that it is not.  It is -- what American Pipe says --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, remember, in American Pipe, you had the exact same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structure. 

            

You have a time limit of one year, and then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, if it's not brought within four years, it shall be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forever barred.  The parallel is, we think, precise. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And this is not a new action in any sense of the word. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer, if the plaintiff in the subsequent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual lawsuit brings a new allegation about other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

securities, changes the nature of the lawsuit in any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way, but all we have done is opt out and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserted precise --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  He just asks to amend the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint, which has now been filed 10 years later after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he left, opted out a month before, and in that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendment, he says -- this was 1,000 pages, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offering, and on page 463, there are five new sentences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which have false facts, we want to put them in too. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You're not allowed to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that under our rule or theirs.  It has to be precisely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Precisely. 

  

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Just to return to the -- how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they understand the world will operate, and that is,

according to my friend, what will happen is on Day 1, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they understand the statute, a party like CalPERS will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

move to intervene in the class action, will file a piece 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

of paper saying we are seeking either intervention as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of right or permissive intervention.  Then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

nothing will happen.  And, then, 4 years down the road, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if class certification is denied, that case will start 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up again. 

 

            

The only difference between our rule, it has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no practical consequence, except for the fact that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

add additional litigation for district courts to deal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with on the front end.  All the same amendments can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen --

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But, Mr. Goldstein, when I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

see the word "action," I think of lawsuit, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

traditionally, and "claim" as the claims within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit.  And the laws often distinguish between actions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and claims.  The securities laws do, routinely. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Here, why -- why shouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we follow the plain language and the traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding of the term "action"?  Congress could have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

use "claims," which is what you're saying, it's the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims, as Justice Breyer points out, but it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different action.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, I'll -- can I just say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

first, I think we would win even if it was lawsuit, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the lawsuit that matters, what American Pipe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teaches us in terms of putting the other side on notice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the lawsuit, is the class complaint.  But if you were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to disagree with that and if you were to say, look, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're going to say -- if we hold that it's a lawsuit, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're going to lose, so it better not be a lawsuit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The reason here is that what Congress was concerned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about was the assertion of liability.  And if I could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just give you a couple of examples of why I think I have 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be right. 

 

 

            

Imagine that in year 4, a new plaintiff 

   

 

 

 

 

 

moves to intervene in an existing lawsuit.  Okay.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit is on file.  I don't think the other side would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be willing to say, hey, you know, there's no new action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  You're free to do it.  Or, alternatively, imagine 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an orderly -- ordinary bilateral litigation.  I and my 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend sue -- we probably shouldn't do this -- but sue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lehman Brothers under Section 11.  Okay.  We have a dual 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

complainant.  And years into it, the district judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, look, you're actually suing over different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securities.  I want to you break it up into two 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different complaints.  We're going to have two different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

docket numbers.  And so the second complaint is filed.

I don't think we would say it's a new action. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Why not? 

  

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, because it would --

  

 

 

 

 

 

because the ordinary --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I mean, I don't like the 

    

   

 

 

 

policy consequences, but as a matter of plain language, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

why wouldn't we? 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, because it can be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

either one.  Jones v. Bock teaches us that in some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contexts it does mean the individual claim and in some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases it means the actual --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I just don't read Jones 

    

 

 

 

 

that way, though.  I read Jones as saying the action may 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contain exhausted claims and unexhausted claims, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't conflate the two claims. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, the way I read it --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and I understand that Jones v. Bock does use the word in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a couple of different ways. 

 

 

 

 

              

I think the bottom line is what you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, is that we try and be pragmatic about what it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress is attempting to accomplish when it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk -- using a phrase like "action" in a limitations 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

period.  And so what I think you have to do is realize 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you have not only Section 13, but you have what is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in effect, another Congressional enactment in Rule 23. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

What you tried to do in American Pipe is to reconcile 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

two different things that are going on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In the wake of 1933 and 1934 and lots of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other statutes as well, when we modified and got away 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from Equity Rule 38 and Equity Rule 30 -- and 48 and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created this class action system, is we were trying for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the administration of the courts to come up with a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regime in which we would have only representative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation and not these individual suits. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the other thing I would point you to is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're not just dealing with Section 13 in securities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases in particular.  And, Justice Breyer, also remember 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that their rule has nothing to do with strict liability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's true about every statute of repose, which are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all -- if you can figure out what they are, they are all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over the place. 

 

 

            

But we have the Private Securities 

 

 

 

 

 

Litigation Reform Act as well.  And it teaches, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

several important things about class and represented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation in securities cases.  Number one, we want a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single representative plaintiff.  We don't want all of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

these litigants.  Number two, we contemplate that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

absent class members will simply provide a notice if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they believe that they should be a named party.  We will 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have them move to intervene, which is what we're

trying to avoid.  And number three, and this is really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

quite curious; within 90 days of the filing of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint, a new named party can be named -- a named 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

party in the lead litigant without regard to whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's after three years. 

 

 

 

            

The entire body of law involved -- and so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what I'm saying is you have to interpret this word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"action" in the context of all of the law.  It doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make any practical sense to believe that Congress would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want this kind of meaningless paperwork, just these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motions to intervene, in the teeth of these other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regimes that surround it --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Goldstein, as I 

  

 

 

 

 

understand your adversary, and he'll speak for himself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when he gets up, but a motion to intervene doesn't save 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you.  Because according to him, it's only a separately 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

filed complaint that would be a separate action subject 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the three-year period of repose, correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I -- I haven't been able --

    

   

 

 

 

 

I've been unable to determine exactly what they believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is necessary. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's why I said --

   

  

 

 

 

I'm -- I'm just wondering what happens to American Pipe, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in terms of not opting out --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- meaning that the

Court just denies the class certification.  What happens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to all of those cases?  In normal parlance, the one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

named plaintiff continues, but how about if there's 10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or 20? 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  They would continue. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In that one case --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  In that one case. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- or would they be spun 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

off into their own jurisdictions? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If we had -- well, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends on exactly how it came to be.  And there can be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very difficult questions about specific personal 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, depending on where the plaintiff comes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from and those sorts of things. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Putting that to the side imagine, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following hypothetical complaint.  It is a nominal class 

   

  

 

 

 

 

action with 10 named plaintiffs.  If they are in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint, then those 10 people will go on on their own. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I guess my principal belief --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If -- if class 

  

 

 

 

 

certification --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What I'm asking, would 

  

 

 

 

 

it be the same action or would they be spun off into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different cases?  Because often, maybe common questions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are certified --

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and the original 

  

 

 

 

 

courts maintain jurisdiction. 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You can -- this particularly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

will happen in the MDL context, in which a district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge to administer the case in front of her, will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct the filing of the consolidated complaint.  But it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is MDL'ed.  It's only there for pretrial purposes.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to have to be spun off into separate complaints, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at which point, I take it, given the formalism of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side's rule, all of these actions are now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untimely, and nobody has any idea why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What is it that we're trying to do here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What we know --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your -- your idea -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why is that -- is that your theory stems from Rule 23, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct? 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That American Pipe is an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of Rule 23, yes, sir.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And your -- and your rule, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is somewhat different from American Pipe, also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

comes from Rule 23. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I believe --

    

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your principle. 

  

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  We have two 

  

  

 

 

 

alternative theories.  One, is that our action was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

always on file.  And I haven't discussed this. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right. 

  

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  This was the question of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito, but American -- they are both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applications of Rule 23, yes, sir. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My concern is that you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

using Rule 23 to create, in effect, a legal right, or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

override a legal right, and it's very clear that Rules 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Civil Procedure do not do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is correct.  If we were 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

to be violating the Rules Enabling Act, of course, our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation could not stand, and so I should talk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about that for a moment. 

   

 

 

            

American Pipe confronts a quite similar 

   

 

 

 

argument, of course, where the other side argued -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remember, American Pipe has the parallel structure; the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1-year period and the 4-year period saying it shall be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forever barred.

And what this Court said in American Pipe, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

and all of its Rules Enabling Act precedent is that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look, obviously, there are rules of procedures that have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequent consequences.  So you violate the rule, then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have no more right. 

 

 

 

 

            

That's not what the Rules Enabling Act is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about.  It is not talking about a rule about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when or where or how you file your lawsuit, which is why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the limitations period and, equally, a repose period is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned with. 

 

            

If I could just return to kind of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of whether or not it would have made sense for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress to have enacted this, and I -- I take the point 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that maybe Congress -- if Congress enacts bad rules, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress enacts bad rules.  But there is ambiguity in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute, and I'm --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Where -- where is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity in -- in no event? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

what? 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, it's in no event, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  In no event. 

  

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  But, sir, if I could jut 

   

  

 

 

 

 

take you to the text, sir, because it's very rare that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress just writes "in no event."  And so what it says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, in no event something.  Okay?  In no event, shall 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

any such action be brought to enforce liability, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

then the 3-year period. 

 

 

 

            

And so my point is what CTS says and what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other precedents have said about Statute of Repose, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they prohibit the application of equitable tolling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to extend the filing of the action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what does the term 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"such action" mean? 

 

 

            

            

action." 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  We --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  "In no event, shall any such 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you think the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

action -- what is the definition of action --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- in that statute? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  To take your first 

  

  

 

 

 

 

question, which is "such action," we believe such action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is an action that is otherwise subject to the discovery 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule in the previous sentence.  And that makes it make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfect sense. 

 

            

What Congress was doing here is saying --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and this is true throughout, wherever you have these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-tiered statutes of limitation or repose.  It says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I've got this thing in the first sentence that's going

24

25

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

to say there's a discovery rule.  But then I'm going to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

say, look, there's -- you can only have so much of this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At some point, we're going to have to call a stop.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so it says you're going to have an action that's subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the discovery rule, but in no event shall such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action, one that could otherwise be extended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indefinitely. 

            

Remember the first sentence, if you leave it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alone, the discovery rule can go 5, 10, 15, 20 years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So in no event shall such action be brought more than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three years after it's offered to the public.  And what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this sentence does is it cuts off the discovery rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But even if you were to disagree with me about that and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just say, no, the phrase "such action" just refers to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any Section 11 lawsuit, we believe it refers to a claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Section 11.  And what -- the reason I started with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first sentence --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So it's enough that it's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

same claim --

 

 

            

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- as in the class action? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is, it has to be the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirety of the claim.  So to be just clear, you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just intone Section 11.  We are talking about the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securities, the same misrepresentation --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.  Right. 

  

  

 

24 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  -- with respect to them. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

What I have done when I have opted out is I have taken 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

control over an existing --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So if -- if a plaintiff in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

every single judicial district in the country had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought exactly the same claim, those would all be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same action, in your opinion? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.  It's on behalf of that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

person.  Remember, it has to be not just the existence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a legal claim in the abstract, but what American Pipe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does in interpreting this idea, we'd have this new Rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 so that we have collective litigations, it says it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brings the action on behalf of the individual unnamed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class member. 

 

            

So, to be clear, if one party brings it, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, just an individual lawsuit is brought, a claim, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that doesn't bring the -- the action on behalf of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CalPERS, of course.  It has to be we have to be a member 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the class involved --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And you think Congress had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

all of this in mind when it wrote, "In no event shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any such action," but it thought it was also clear it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't need to spell it out.

reason is this:  Class action practice in 1934 was quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  Class action practice was a situation in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

which a representative action would be brought and then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

people would opt in at the very end.  This was an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unresolved question --

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  So what did Congress 

  

  

 

 

 

 

have in mind when it wrote this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  What it had in mind 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

was letting the other side know that the claim had been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserted against it, and that the class action does. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What it wanted was a party like ANZ or Lehman to know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay, here's the scope of your potential liability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And what American Pipe says in terms is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the classic complaint tells the other side everything it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs to know, whether it's litigated on a collective 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis or instead on an individual basis.  And what it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says is we are not going to generate all of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unnecessary motions to intervene, all of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unnecessary individual lawsuits because we're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret Rule 23 and these Federal statutes together. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so if I can just give you an illustration from your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own docket.  Imagine that you were presented with a -- a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme -- a hypothetical Supreme Court Rule 100.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you, as a docket management measure, are trying to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure out how many cert petitions were going to be

26 

a cert petition within one month of the court of appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision, you shall file a motion for leave to file a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cert petition. 

 

            

Now, you're not promising to file a cert 

   

 

 

 

 

 

petition.  You know, you don't -- you don't have to file 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a cert petition.  All you're going to do is let us know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by making us act on this worthless motion.  Nobody would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that that was a sensible thing to do because it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would accomplish nothing other than giving you, just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like this would only give the district courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional work. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Goldstein, could I ask 

   

  

 

 

 

you to speak to this question of your alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theories, because in your briefing, the non-tolling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory, if I can call it that, took pride of place.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you haven't really spoken in those terms today.  So what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

am I to make of that? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Nothing.  I just think the 

    

  

 

 

 

-- we have two very good arguments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other argument that we make and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I've also just tried to avoid the complication of what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in and out of Question 2.  You all will know the answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of what you intended when granting cert more than we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will.

But I think that if you were thinking in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

terms of tolling, then there has to be a gap in time in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which there is a distance between when the first action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ended and the second action began.  That is why you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would need to toll something, to fill in the gap.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you have a case like this one, when all we have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done is take control of our own action, it's very hard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to see why we need tolling at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other thing that's quite important is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that here we do have something concrete in law that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are exercising, and that is our Rule 23 right to opt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out.  You don't have to wonder about this as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional matter or not.  We do have the right to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opt out and take control of our lawsuit, which is what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we did. 

 

            

And so I don't understand how it is unless 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy's argument were to be played out and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were to violate the Rule 23, to everyone's surprise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates the rules enabling act in its core application 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of our opt-out right, in that situation, all that has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened is that we have different lawyers.  We are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to litigate this on our own.  Nothing more is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required in terms of tolling, and that seems a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straight way -- forward way of resolving this case --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's not necessarily a 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

question of violating Rule 23.  It's using Rule 23 to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create a new legal right.  That's the difference. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

28 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, if we were to do that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I quite agree, Justice Kennedy.  I have never resisted 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proposition that if Rule 23 were to be -- violate a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive right of theirs or create a new substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, it could not be interpreted that way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

My point is this:  You have, we think, at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the very least, statutory language that can be read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either way.  And the way you deal with that problem is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reconcile the two of them.  There's no reason to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create a conflict between the opt-out right in Rule 23 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or all of the policies --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But you need tolling.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

don't need it, perhaps, on your second theory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If we take your second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

theory, we have to read the words "be brought" to mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like deemed to have been brought when, but --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that -- but that won't solve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical problem you raised, because there will still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be cases in which class certification is denied after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three years, and all these practical problems will then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist, won't they? 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  They will, because --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And we need tolling in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

order to stop that. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

-- the --

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I don't believe so. 

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why? 

  

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And let me just say that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Why? 

  

  

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because the phrase "tolling" 

  

 

 

 

 

here is misleading.  And if I could answer this question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and reserve the balance of my time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Both United Airlines and the Chardon case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider the question, does tolling mean suspend the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations?  And it says no.  United 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Airlines is a case in which the motion to intervene 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't happen, not after class certification, but after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment at the end of the case.  And the court said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't have to just use up the remainder of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations period. 

 

            

And Chardon is a case in which it was a 1983 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

class action, and the court said, no, no, no, no. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tolling here doesn't mean just suspend the running of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the limitations period.  It just means you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied it and you're not going to be deemed untimely. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The tolling effect in the 1983 context is provided by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law.

Mr. Clement. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

Section 13 of the Securities Act, in its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three-year time limit, plainly provides a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

repose.  This Court said as much in Lampf, and the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-tiered structure and emphatic, in-no-event language, 

 

 

 

 

 

admits of no other conclusion. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about the Clayton Act 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that was at issue in American Pipe?  That doesn't say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"in no event," but it did say -- what was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language -- "forever barred."  Forever barred 

  

 

 

 

 

commence within 4 years. 

   

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  That's right, Justice 

  

 

 

 

Ginsburg, but there's three reasons why the three-year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time limit in Section 13 is a statute of repose.  One is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the no-event language that is emphatic.  Two is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-tiered structure.  And three is the legislative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

history. 

            

Now, if you contrast that with the Clayton 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act at issue in American Pipe, there -- we can quibble

about whether the language was as emphatic, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

importantly, that language itself was -- was suspended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or tolled if there was a government enforcement action. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And what this Court held, at least as I read 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American Pipe, is that we know that was a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations because it was subject to tolling in at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least one circumstance. 

 

 

            

And what this Court said in the Wallberger 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, of course, is, when you have a time limit that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to tolling, that's a hint that it's a statute of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations because the defining feature of a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

repose that makes it different from a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations is that it's not subject to tolling or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estoppel. 

            

And since American Pipe was emphatically a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule of tolling, the Court used the word "tolling rule," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"toll," "tolling" at least a dozen times in the opinion. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That tolling rule simply does not apply to a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repose like Section 13. 

 

 

 

And I think --

   

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does one know?  When 

  

  

 

 

 

 

one uses the language "forever barred," the other uses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"in no event," how do we know whether it's a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repose? 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think you have to

perhaps read beyond those particular words.  And I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

32 

if you read beyond those words in the Clayton Act, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get a textual clue that this is a limitations period, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

because it says that it's subject to tolling if there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a government prosecution. 

 

 

            

If you continue to read in the context of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 13, you would find the two-tiered structure of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute, which this Court in Lampf said could only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be explained with the longer time period being a statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of repose. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But did you --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  And then if you were --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please, just to finish the point. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you were inclined to go further and look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at legislative history, then you would look at American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pipe where this Court said the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

legislative history 

 

was silent.  And here, the legislative history strongly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

supports the notion that the three-year time limit is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of repose, because, as originally drafted, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a ten-year statute of repose.  And Congress 

   

  

 

 

 

 

specifically looked at it, specifically looked at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two time periods, said that the second time period was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there to protect the defendants, and then shortened it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantially in 1934. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The two-tiered structure can 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

33 

be where the second tier just cuts off the discovery 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  So that would perfectly well explain the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-tiered structure just as that, and say, yeah, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually it's one year after discovery, but if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discover it five years later, that's too much.  So it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just cuts off the discovery rule.  And that's the only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing that the two-tiered structure means perhaps. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think that's right, 

    

 

 

 

 

even if you were writing this opinion on a clean slate. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But, of course, you're not writing on a clean slate. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This Court looked at this specific provision, along with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some other provisions in the Exchange Act, in deciding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Lampf case. 

 

 

            

And it said that the three-year period was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of repose, not that it just cut off the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery rule, a statute of repose.  And we know that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because in Lampf itself, this Court considered an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable tolling argument.  And it rejected the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

equitable tolling argument precisely because the 

 

 

 

 

 

three-year limit was a statute of repose. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Now, I suppose my friend on the other side 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

could quibble that there was multiple provisions at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue in Lampf, but if you actually look at them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's Section 13, and then there were two provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the 1934 Exchange Act.  And the -- the -- the

language from the 1933 Act, Section 13 that's at issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

here, is the most emphatic.  The other two have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-tiered structure, but don't say in no event --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I suppose one question is, 

    

 

 

 

 

what exactly do -- have we meant when we say a statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of repose?  And we've certainly meant something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different from a statute of limitations.  But I think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

what we were talking about in Lampf was the cutoff of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the discovery rule.  It -- it sort of didn't matter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether your claim was going to accrue in the normal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way, consistent with the statute of limitations.  At 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

some point, we were going to cut it off. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that's what we meant when we said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of repose, as opposed to some term that cut off 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a variety of claims that just weren't before us and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we weren't thinking about. 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, if I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

could beg to differ.  I think if you go back and read 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the very last section of the Lampf decision, it's where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it specifically rejects an equitable tolling argument on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the basis that this -- the second tier of the statute is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute of repose.  So it wasn't just talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a discovery rule. 

 

 

            

And, frankly, if you go back and think about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the context of Lampf, it was a pretty decent equitable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

35 

tolling argument.  Because up until that point, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

basically every federal court that looked at it thought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the state law provided the statute of limitations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And only very late in the game did this Court come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around and say, no, actually, it's a federal statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations, and it's much shorter than everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expected. 

            

So in the cosmic scheme of equitable tolling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments, it seems like the parties that relied on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable state statute of limitations had a darn good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable tolling argument, but this Court --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is --

  

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  -- would have none of it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is -- American Pipe, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

at least as many interpret it, is not an equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling provision. 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, on at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

least two occasions --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Doesn't -- it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

differ -- we don't ask about good faith, and -- and it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not tailored to the individual case.  It says when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start the class action, that's it.  That's -- that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical thing that must be timely. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

give you two responses to that.

First, on at least two occasions, when this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

Court had a reason to label it one way or another, it --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court labeled the rule of American Pipe as the rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of equitable tolling.  So that's one way of answering 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

But the second thing is, with all due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect, I think that your effort to say that this is --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that American Pipe's not equitable tolling is built on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistaken premise, because -- and it follows directly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the argument my friend on the other side made, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which seems to flow from the premise that in order for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it to be equitable tolling, it has to take into account 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the individual circumstances of the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And as this Court said in Waldburger, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about equitable tolling, two of the classic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations for equitable tolling are categorical rules: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infancy and, essentially, lack of mental competence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those are two equitable rules for when a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations are tolled, and they're equitable rules. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think the equitable rule that this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established in American Pipe, and why it was right on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two occasions to refer to it as a rule of equitable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling is that, if you were a member of a timely 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

commenced class action, you have an equitable basis to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

toll the statute of limitations.

I think it's as simple as that.  They didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look into other circumstances, because they didn't need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to.  They had a sufficient basis for equitable tolling. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, I'd like to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

go through the practical consequences.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let me start with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

simplest one.  Okay?  A class action motion is filed. 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

The court dismisses it saying, wrong venue.  This should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been in California instead of New York.  Under your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory, because a new complaint is filed in California, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that statute of limitations or that statute of repose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

starts to run from the filing of the new complaint, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the old one? 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think so, Justice 

    

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor, for the --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is a rule that 

   

  

 

 

 

says if you're in the wrong venue, there's an automatic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling.  But you're saying that that rule would not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply in that circumstance. 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  No, but as I understand the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

federal procedure -- and, you know, this is based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of background understanding, so I could have it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong.  But as I understand it, in the federal system, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you're in the wrong venue, you can transfer the

one. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But so could the judge. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

38 

MR. CLEMENT:  You don't have to file a new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You could -- you can ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for it, but it's still within the judge's discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether to transfer or dismiss and let you file anew. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Yeah, well, and so I would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think that certainly if there were adverse consequences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for part of the class in that situation --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

transfer --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So answer my question. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  -- you would -- you would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under your theory --

  

 

 

 

 

under your theory, action means new complaint, new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint number? 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  A new complaint 

    

  

 

 

initiated with a, you know --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even though it's asking 

  

 

 

 

 

for the same relief? 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  By the same party? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

this Court --

means motions to intervene won't help --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- if the class is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately denied. 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I don't take that 

    

   

 

 

 

position, Your Honor.  I think a motion to intervene --

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

and I think we know this from American Pipe -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion to intervene makes it an individual action on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that party's behalf if it survives --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what happens when the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

complaint is denied? 

 

 

            

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Those individual --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All of those individual 

  

 

 

 

 

complaints -- most of them are not transferred.  They're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spun off into new complaints in where -- whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction has venue over them. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, again, as long as -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think there is really a simple way to look at this that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think, answers all these questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You ask at the end, is the party seeking to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recover based on an action that was timely filed? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's why this is a simple case, and it's why my friend 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does need a rule of tolling or some kind of super strong 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule of relation --

Why couldn't --

 

 

40 

            

            

MR. CLEMENT:  What's that? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- could the judge 

  

 

 

 

 

have -- or can a judge, who has a class action and tells 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people, if you opt out, just file a motion to intervene? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Under your theory, why can't they do that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Because the motion to 

  

 

 

 

 

intervene, if I'm following -- it -- they can file the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion to intervene.  Then the question is, is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion to intervene timely? 

 

 

 

            

And so in American Pipe, for example, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealt with the statute of limitations, not a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repose, there were those individual motions to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervene.  Now, importantly, the Court in American Pipe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not say, all of those motions to intervene are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

timely because the class action actually filed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action for them.  That's not what American Pipe held. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

American Pipe held, all right, we're going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to examine the timeliness of those individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervention actions, and we are going to deem them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

timely because we're going to apply a tolling rule.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were tolled for the period that there was a class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action that covered this -- that covered the claim, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual claim.  That's why my friend, who desperately 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't want there to be a tolling rule, is absolutely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

misreading American Pipe. 

 

 

41 

            

American Pipe was a tolling case.  It looked 

   

  

 

 

 

 

at the circumstances of the individual cases.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused on the fact that they were filed within five or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eight days of the denial of the class certification. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

None of that would have been relevant --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So even --

  

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  -- if somehow 

  

 

 

 

metaphysically --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if that's what 

  

 

 

 

 

American tolling did, now that we're looking at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language of the statute, and looking at Rule 23, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the substance of the statute is, why is his reading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrational? 

            

            

MR. CLEMENT:  His -- his --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you're not relying on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

American tolling.  He's not, he's relying on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language of the statute and the language of Rule 23. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  And -- and here's why his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument doesn't work on the text of Section 13, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's very straightforward.  If he's -- he is not seeking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to recover based on a timely filed class action.  He is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking to recover millions of dollars from my client, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on an action that they filed in the Northern

after these securities were issued to the public. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

            

That is the action they're seeking to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recover.  That is the action to which you would apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plain text of Section 13.  And, I'm sorry, 2011 is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too late under the plain terms of the statute, and it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a statute of repose.  And the case really is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simple. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you're suggesting 

  

 

 

 

we -- there's only one view of the word "action," and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the case stops there.  And perhaps that's right, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's say it's not right.  Let's just suppose that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"action" is a word that sometimes it's used one way, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes it's used another way, and we should look a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little bit as to the practical consequences of what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're doing. 

 

            

And it seems as though -- and tell me if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think this is wrong -- that the consequences go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like this:  If we go your way in this case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any future suit like this, all large investors, the kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of investors CalPERS -- CalPERS is not going to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this mistake again.  CalPERS is going to file a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protective action for itself, and then it can do what it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants.  Opt out, don't opt out, wait and see, whatever. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well, small investors are not going to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  They're not going to have the faintest idea that

they should be doing that.  So this is a rule that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of guaranteed to create make-work for district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts to be essentially irrelevant for large investors, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and for small investors to lose their claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well -- so, Justice Kagan, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, you know, let me just put a pin in the idea that I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think there's any way to get to the textual result 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that action just --

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I know you think that --

    

 

 

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  No.  And -- and I think there 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

are good textual reasons for that, but let's put a pin 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that.  Maybe I'll get back to it, maybe I won't. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To address sort of the -- the sort of parade of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

horribles.  I mean, there's -- there's a couple of 

    

   

 

 

 

 

points I'd like to make about that.  I mean, one is, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I can imagine that where you might think that if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this were IndyMac and we had no experience with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  But we've had, you know, almost 4 years of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience with this rule in the Second Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, there might be some context where you'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say 3 and a half, 4 years isn't that long, but there are 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots of securities class actions in the -- in -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second Circuit.  And despite what my friend says, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not like every stock in the index has gone up over the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last five years.  You know, some of them have gone down.

At the -- you know, the -- the rising tide hasn't lifted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every stock. 

 

            

And also, this whole issue of IndyMac also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies in 10b-5 actions where you can bring those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regardless of whether the market is rising or falling. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So take the year 2014 in isolation.  There were 63 class 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions settled in the Second Circuit in the year 2014. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There were exactly zero opt-outs.  Zero out of 63 class

JUSTICE BREYER:  What will happen, what 

  

 

 

 

 

you -- what you have to do to get to his -- I agree --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to get to his result, I agree with you this far.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to read those words, "any action be brought."  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what they mean is the action was brought.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought when they filed the class action.  Whether it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied class certification or not, that's when it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought.  And this is the same action.  It is not a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different action.  It is the same action.  It is the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same action because, one, the same words, because, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, we go through a list, and moreover brought within 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a reasonable time. 

 

 

            

Why interpret those words in the way I just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said?  The reason why is because it is the same action. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The other reason why is because you will, even if not so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

far, discover that people do want to protect themselves

and will do so.  Whether they are big or small, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will.  And, therefore, let's imagine a class action 

   

  

 

 

 

 

involving 300,000 potential plaintiffs in the class, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

imagine you're the district judge, and imagine 300,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pieces of paper coming across your desk.  You'll have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

build a new clerk's office. 

   

 

 

              

I mean, you see, that's the way their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument goes, I think.  I think. 

    

   

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I think that's the way it 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

goes.  Now, I'm a simple-minded person.  I would not get 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

past the first step of that argument because I would say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're seeking to recover on an action that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntarily filed in California when the rest of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class action was going on in the Southern District of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New York, and it's just not the same action.  So you'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lose me at step one. 

 

 

 

 

            

But if you got to the policy arguments, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would really -- if I were, you know, trying to like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really twist the statute in a way that I think doesn't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

comport with its basic test, I would need different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

empirical data than we've gotten from the Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit. 

            

            

And to get back to Justice Kagan's point --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And we do have -- we do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have two briefs, one by retired federal judges, one by

law professors, tell us that inevitably you are going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have people filing to intervene. 

 

 

 

 

            

And in -- in that respect, assuming that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're right, so that the people who don't intervene 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the 3-year period are out, does lead counsel have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an obligation to inform everyone in the class, if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't file a separate action of your own or intervene in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this one, you are going to be out? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  So, two things, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg.  I'll answer your final question first, which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is to simply say I don't think lead counsel has that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation.  But let me also, just in -- in specific 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference to the two briefs you've mentioned, it's worth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going back to the IndyMac docket and looking at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus briefs filed there, because those same two amicus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs were filed -- some law professors, some retired 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges.  And they made the same prediction back then. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it turns out it's absolutely not borne out by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience in the Second Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, why is that?  Well, as Justice Kagan 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed out, the reason that lots of small investors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't file their own intervention actions or separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions, is because it's just -- you know, for them it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a class action or nothing.  And -- and so, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have to essentially rely on the class action

device. 

            

The reason that the institutional investors 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

haven't done it is because they're not that worried 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about timeliness in lots of cases, though there are some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases where they are worried about either the quality of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the class counsel or some other counsel has gotten to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them and convinced them that they're going to do better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they file alone -- they file alone --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You mean they're not 

  

 

 

 

 

worried about timeliness because they're relying on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class action? 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly.  And if they stay in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the class action, there's no timeliness problem.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

get to recover. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just to --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. CLEMENT:  And so all -- all our rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does is make somebody who wants to go it alone, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to make that decision within 3 years.  It's --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It puts tremendous pressure 

  

 

 

 

 

on the opt-out right, right?  We're used to thinking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the opt-out right is a very important part of class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions; it's what saves them from a due process 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem, that people actually do get to say, I don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want any part of this. 

 

 

 

 

            

And you're saying they only get to say that

within 3 years, which may be not within 3 years of the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time the suit was brought; it may be 6 months of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

time the suit was brought, or 1 month or something like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And, you know, if -- if you haven't decided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within that month or 6 months that these lawyers are not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing a good job, you've lost your ability forever to do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it for yourself. 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, it -- I -- I guess I --

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

sort of there's a couple of points I'd want to say about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  I mean, even if you don't opt out, you haven't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lost the ability if you think the class counsel aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing a good job.  You have the right to object to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement, and if you really care about individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investors --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  All power to you, but, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, a lot of those settlement hearings are awfully 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

tough. 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, they're tough, I 

  

 

 

 

 

suppose, because everybody is all in the same team.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we create an incentive where the CalPERS of the world 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are actually going in there and actually fighting for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better settlement for the whole class, I mean, that's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world where actually the small, individual investor is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to benefit. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Rule 23 did not want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

that to happen.  Rule 23 wanted to allow people to opt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out rather than to be confined in the suit for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

entire pendency of the suit and then to start fighting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the outcome at the -- at the last moment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, two points, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Kagan.  First of all, whatever Rule 23 wanted, the PSLRA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually wanted large institutional investors to stay in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the class.  They actually have preferences for them as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lead plaintiff, precisely on the theory that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to rise -- that all boats will rise with the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the institutional investor.  So whatever happened 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in Rule 23, I think in light of the PSLRA, this is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually a better result. 

   

 

            

But as to the opt-out right, the opt-out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right gives you a right not to be bound by a judgment 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you had no business in procuring.  It doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantee that you're going to have a viable individual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

action to opt into. 

 

 

 

            

Now, there still may be reasons why an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual investor or an institutional investor wants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to opt out. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's not much of an opt-out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  Go ahead, opt out, but -- but you can't bring 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your own claim. 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  But -- but look at what

happened with the Petitioners in this case.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

they opted out.  I used air quotes because they filed 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their individual action before class certification, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they, like, pre-opted out. 

 

 

 

            

But they opted out, but they still preserved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10b-5 claims, which have a longer statute of repose, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they proposed -- they -- they pursued some other claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Other plaintiffs could pursue State law claims.  So it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just -- if -- if you opt out of a claim that's subject 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a 3-year statute of repose and you haven't brought an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual action before then, then you do not have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

timely action subject to that statute of repose.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the purpose of a statute of repose. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And from the perspective of a defendant, if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you are facing just a class action, you know that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- it -- and the time of repose passes, then you know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're going to be able to get essentially global legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peace if you settle the class action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If, on the other hand, you face that big 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class action and then two or three of the big 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institutional investors opt out and file their own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual actions, then you're going to know that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't get global legal peace in the class action; you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to have to pay sort of a hold-out premium to those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institutional investors.

Now, if those institutional investors file 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

before the statute of repose goes out, then that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tough.  That's life.  But all of the policies of the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of repose are implicated when you're in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation where, after 3 years, you're no longer facing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just a class action where you can get global legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peace, but you're also facing an opt-out right, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially where the opt out is a big institutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

investor, and the whole reason they've opted out is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get a better deal than the class.  And that's why, you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I would like you to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

go back to the question I asked, because one of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes of the Federal rules is that so litigants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should know what they're facing.  And there's all kinds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of notices that have to be sent for class actions, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet you tell me that there's no obligation of lead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, or the court, I assume, when the 3 years -- the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time is running, to tell everyone in the class, now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either you bring an individual action or intervene in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this one, otherwise, you'll never get a penny. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I don't think there is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that obligation, Justice Ginsburg.  I think it's based 

    

 

 

 

 

 

on the theory of the class action, which is that you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only going to have a class action if the class

representative is an adequate representative of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire class and you're only going to approve a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

settlement under Rule 23(e), if it's fair and reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the entire class.  I think that's where the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

protections are built in for the class.  And it bears 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphasis that nothing in the rule that we are proposing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is going to prevent anyone from recovering from a timely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed class action. 

 

 

            

It's only when somebody wants to go out of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the class action and get themselves a better deal, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have to have a timely action to get the better 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal.  If they do, then my clients don't have a statute 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of repose. 

 

            

But if in a case like this, in 2011, even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before class certification decision is being made, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide you know what?  We're going to be better off if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we file our own action in the Northern District of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California. 

            

It's a bit rich for them to say okay, even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though we've decided to file our own action for our own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons because we think we're going to be better off, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we still get the benefit of the timeliness of the class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action that we're essentially pre-opting out of.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and magically, they think they get the benefit of that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without even applying tolling or some kind of

is, but it's worth remembering that even if you somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think you can maybe interpret Section 13 to encompass 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this theory, I mean, there are other cases. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

This case had -- this Court had four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitions in front of it.  None of the other three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitions invoked this issue in the context of Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13.  The other -- two of them were 10b-5  actions, one 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of them was an implied statute of repose provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So you're going to have to take one of those cases to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant the question that I thought you granted this case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide, which is, as a general matter, can American 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pipe tolling override a statute of repose? 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I think the answer to that question, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that my friend really doesn't want to spend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much time talking about, is no.  A statute of repose 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means repose.  Its defining feature is that it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to tolling or estoppel rules 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  But, I mean, 

   

  

  

 

 

there's different levels of repose.  I mean, the --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- you have repose under his theory, in the sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you know what people are suing you about.  You're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

54 

still facing a lawsuit in the other case.  There aren't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be any more surprises.  You know what's on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

table.  That's repose. 

  

 

            

Repose can also mean, in your -- your sense, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that everything is done.  You're not going to owe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody anything.  But we know that's not the reason, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because if you bring your claims within the period, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can extend for 15 -- 15 years, however long these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigations take. 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think that both Waldburger and the text of Section 13 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell you what repose defendant gets.  It gets no new 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions.  That's the repose it gets.  If an action is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed before the time deadline, then, of course, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be subject to liability under that action, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it takes another couple of years for that to run its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course and be resolved.  But you are not subject to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional liability under actions that are filed after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the period of the statute of repose. And that seems like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a very reasonable compromise --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, but they're 

  

 

 

 

 

put -- I'm not -- it seems uncertain whether you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being subjected to new liability.  I mean, the liability 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the same if you have the class action, including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CalPERS, and, as it is, if you then have -- you're

facing the class action without CalPERS, but another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CalPERS suit. 

 

55 

            

I'm not, you know, sure that that increases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your liability. 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'm absolutely sure that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it increases my liability, and so are my clients, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice.  Because they know from experience 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the only thing worse than having a class action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against you is having a class action and some individual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions against you.  Because then you've got to pay to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settle the class action and then you have to pay --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But at least in -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, it -- it requires, perhaps, more management and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny by the district judges that is possible, but, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, theoretically, if a big chunk of the class is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out, you're not going to pay twice for that, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CLEMENT:  No.  But typically, and 

  

  

 

 

 

especially in securities class action, it's not a big 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

chunk that's out.  It's a handful of institutional 

   

  

 

 

 

 

investors who are able to use the fact that they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opted out for additional leverage to get a better 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement than they would get in the class.  Now, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

works against the principles of Rule 23 and the PLSRA, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but there's nothing that my clients can do to stop it if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those individual actions are filed in a timely fashion. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

But when those individual actions, new 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

actions are filed after three years has passed, I would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respectfully suggest that that fully implicates the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policies behind statutes of repose generally and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text of this statute. 

 

 

 

            

And then I do think that gives you a very 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

easy way to essentially decide this case, which is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just ask the question:  Is the action that they are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking to recover millions of dollars on one that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed within 3 years of the public offering of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securities at issue here. 

 

 

 

            

And it was most certainly not.  It was filed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Northern District of California in 2011, more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than 3 years after the securities were issued.  And the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only way they can make that action timely is to point to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something else that was timely filed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, at the time that they opted out because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the class wasn't even certified, that action over in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New York, they weren't even a party to it under Smith v. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bayer and Standard Fire.  So maybe they can get the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit from some super tolling rule or some super 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concept of relation back, but those are two things that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't get to use to impose new liability in the face 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a statute of repose. 

   

 

 

              

I don't think ultimately whether you call it

equitable tolling or not matters much.  This Court in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Waldburger said the defining feature of a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

repose is they're not subject to tolling or estoppel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It didn't use equitable tolling as a modifier.  And, of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, as we've discussed, or as was discussed, if this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule is something other than a rule of equitable tolling 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it's a legal rule, then the Rules Enabling Act 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem is front and center, because we have a defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Federal statutory law to substantive defense under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Waldburger to not have new liability, new actions filed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against us in over 3 years.  If the only thing that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trumps that is a judicial construction of Rule 23, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a Rules Enabling Act problem. 

   

 

 

 

            

At the end of the day, I think the path for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding this case is very clear.  Section 13 is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of repose.  This Court said as much in Lampf. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Statutes of repose are not subject to tolling.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court said as much in Waldburger.  There's simply no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis to deviate from this Court's precedence.

points.  The first is I don't believe that the statute 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be functioning as the Respondent suggests because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their point is look, as the Petitioners see it, after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the class certification is denied or there's an opt-out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period, then they'll have these individual lawsuits spin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  and whoa, we didn't expect that at all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the world that they want is exactly the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same; it just involves more paperwork.  What they want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us to do is to intervene in the class action on day 1 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then do nothing and sit back.  And when we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eventually would otherwise intervene, then spin up our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit.  Nothing will have been gained.  They won't be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on any more notice. 

 

 

 

            

American Pipe explains, and particularly in 

 

 

 

 

 

the context of Section 1, when you're talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bonds that they issued, they knew that we're out there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All that we didn't do was to file our own complainant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get stayed, or our own motion to intervene to just take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up the district judge's time, and then, later, we would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed on the exact same lawsuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So there's no additional surprise at all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under our rule.  All there is, is, perhaps, a trap for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the unwary. 

 

            

Then, if you are trying to understand what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"action" means -- and it can mean different things in

different context, we have to realize that we have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59 

body of law here.  We have not just Section 13, but we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have Rule 23, which contemplates that we have the right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to notice and the opportunity to opt out, not into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacuum of space, but into our timely filed, initiated by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the class action and thus far meritorious action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, second is I do believe the other side 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

profoundly misunderstands the Private Securities 

 

 

 

 

Litigation Reform Act, the entire point of which was to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have a bunch of parties in there litigating on their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own.  It doesn't contemplate that a bunch of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

institutional investors will be out there.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contemplates that there will be one, and he's called the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lead plaintiff. 

 

            

It contemplates that other parties might try 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and become the lead plaintiff by submitting a notice, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not by moving to intervene.  It contemplates that a new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lead plaintiff could be named after the expiration of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three years 

 

            

What happened here is this:  The statute is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

written in bilateral terms.  Later on, 30 years later, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we get Rule 23.  We have to figure out how to make the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two of them work together. 

 

 

 

 

            

What we know is Section 13 wants them to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on notice of the claims against them.  American Pipe

action on our behalf, and then we just took control of
