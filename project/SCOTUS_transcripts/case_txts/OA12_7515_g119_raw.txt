            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

argument next in Case 12-7515, Burrage v. United States.

Ms. Campbell.

          ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANGELA L. CAMPBELL,

                APPOINTED BY THIS COURT,

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

            Marcus Burrage is serving a 20-year

mandatory minimum sentence for selling heroin that,

according to the jury instruction that was given to the

jury at the time of the trial, was not the primary cause

of the death, but, rather, merely played a part in the

16

death.

17

18

19

20

            This lesser standard of contributing

causation was neither articulated by Congress within the

words of the statute, nor was it generally accepted at

the time the statute was passed, as an acceptable

21

version of causation.

22

23

24

            Congress's selection of the word "results"

instead should be interpreted to mean the traditional

notions of causation; those of factual cause or but-for

25

cause and proximate cause.

            Now, the parties don't disagree that

"results in" means causation.  That it's a causation

analysis.  And regardless of whether you look to the

common law or the treatises or the legal commentators,

causation triggers, at the very minimum, a but-for

causation analysis.  In this particular case, but for

the use of the heroin, the victim would not have died.

            Now, the Solicitor General suggests a lesser

causation standard, one that expands the notion of

but-for causation.  But if we instead look to the case

law and this Court's precedent, we are not actually

trying to expand but-for causation in most cases, we are

trying to limit it.  Because but-for causation can be

extrapolated beyond what we are willing to give

15

liability for.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How would you respond to

the hypothetical that the government poses on 24 of its

brief, that it's the three drops of poison, each

defendant puts in one drop, one drop will not do it,

three drops will, and none of them would be chargeable

21

because it takes three drops?

22

23

24

25

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, I would disagree with

the premise that they are not chargeable.  Each

individual person that put the drop of poison in that

cup could be charged with attempted murder if they were

trying to kill a person.  But under standard causation

analysis, you -- you do not have but-for causation.

Each individual drop of poison was not the but-for

causation and so you -- you don't have causation.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you would if --

if you knew that there were two drops in and you added

the third drop after the two drops.  Right?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Then --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I've

lost sight of this.  Is this each drop is enough or --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Three -- three drops.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It takes three.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  In the government's -- in the

government's hypothetical, each person individually puts

in one drop and you need three drops in order to -- to

16

kill the person.

17

18

19

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  Well,

there's but-for causation when you are the third person.

Your drop caused the death, and the death would not have

20

been caused without your drop.

21

            MS. CAMPBELL:  That would be correct, that

22

there would be but-for causation.

23

24

25

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But each one is the third

person.  I mean, each one of them is the third person.

It seems to me each one is a but-for cause.  And I don't

5

know why you don't say there's but-for causation there.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Well --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  As I understand -- as I

understood the evidence in this case, the experts

testified they could not say that he would not have died

but for the cocaine.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  That's --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's quite different from

this case where what is put to you is he -- you could

10

say he would not have died but for the drop that each

11

one of them put in.

12

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Yes, you could say that.

13

And that -- and --

14

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why isn't that but-for

15

causation?

16

            MS. CAMPBELL:  It's a form of but-for

17

causation that I think --

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care if it's a form

of but-for causation.  It's but-for causation.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  It -- it can be.  And I think

that certain -- that specific hypothetical, while it

warrants special consideration by this Court, whether or

not in criminal context, we're going to expand the

criminal liability to that is not this case, Justice

25

Scalia.

11

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I thought the

hypothetical was a bit different.  I thought it only

takes two drops to kill him.  And that's what creates

the problem where you don't have but-for causation

because you don't know whether you are the extraneous

drop or whether you were the drop that actually killed

him.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Correct.  If there is a

hypothetical that changes it just slightly, you would

not have but-for causation in that circumstance, because

each individual drop was not the but-for cause.  And

12

that's more like our hypothetical.

13

14

15

16

17

            And, again, with a poison hypothetical,

because it's an intentional act by the defendant, you

would still have liability, criminal liability for

attempt or assault or something along those lines, but

you would not have each individual person liable for the

18

actual death.

19

20

            JUSTICE ALITO:  But part of your argument is

that but-for causation isn't sufficient, right?  It also

21

has to be foreseeable.

22

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Correct.

23

24

25

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that your argument?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  That is our argument.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, give me an example of a

14

situation where a heroin dealer deals -- sells drugs to

somebody, and foresees that the drugs that are sold will

cause death?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, I think you can look to

the actual case law.  There is, for those types of

hypotheticals, when the heroin dealer is actually using

with the particular purchaser of the heroin and knows

that he is overdosing.  If the heroin dealer is the one

injecting the drugs into the system, certainly those

circumstances are foreseeable.  And the government --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Those are very unusual

circumstances.  In all other circumstances where

somebody is just selling heroin there wouldn't be

foreseeable, so the statute wouldn't -- foreseeability;

15

the statute wouldn't apply?

16

17

18

19

20

            MS. CAMPBELL:  No, I disagree with that.

Foreseeability could be read into those circumstances

where you simply have a heroin dealer that is selling

heroin and you would take that foreseeability question,

the proximate cause question, and you would charge it to

21

the jury.

22

23

24

25

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think "foreseeability" is

the wrong word.  I don't think, you know, in tort law

we -- we use the word "foreseeability" for Palsgraf.

It's a matter of scope of the risk.  It may not be

12

13

foreseeable.  It may be an unusual situation that will

cause it, but it's within the scope of the risk.  And

when you sell drugs, you know that one of the things

that can happen is that the drugs will produce an

overdose.

            I'm not sure -- I wouldn't call it

foreseeability.  I would call it scope of the risk.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Both scope in the risk and

foreseeability are versions of saying proximate cause.

And either standard in this circumstance would be better

than the contributing cause standard that was given to

the jury, because it did not use scope of the risk

language.  It didn't use foreseeability language.  It

14

didn't use reasonably probable --

19

21

22

23

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think this is all

being sort of tied up together.  I always thought

foreseeability and proximate cause were the same.

            I think the issue doesn't do with either

foreseeability, scope of risk, or proximate cause.  It

has to do with what you started with, which is what's

the level of factual causation that we want to set.

What definition are we going to give for the legal

causation standard.  And you're saying that it has to be

24

but-for?

25

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Our position is -- I agree

12

13

with you, Justice Sotomayor, that the main issue is this

but-for causation issue, that if we are correct that

but-for causation should be read into a criminal

statute, as we believe it should under these

circumstances under this statute, that the appropriate

question is whether, but for the heroin, they would have

died.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Let's assume

that we are troubled by the examples that have been

given.  If two people or three people come together and

each puts in a drop of blood, either knowing that only

one drop is necessary or that all three drops are

necessary, we don't want to let that person off because

14

it doesn't seem logical, okay?

15

16

17

            What would save your case in it?  Is there a

different proximate cause standard but not involving

but-for that would still get you what you are looking

18

for?

19

20

21

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Yes, and I don't think you

need to look to causation to get to that answer.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what do we look to

22

if we are not looking to causation?

23

24

25

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, if each individual

person in the poison hypothetical is working together

and knows about the other people, then you have

10

Alderson Reporting Company

1

2

3

9

conspiracy liability.  And they would be liable for the

actions of the other people -- of the other person that

has put the poison in and you can still --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why does it matter if

you know that three people have -- three people hate

someone and they are acting independently, each one

intended to kill the guy and, you know, that the other

two joined in was lovely, but we don't know which drop

did it.  We don't particularly care, do we?

10

            MS. CAMPBELL:  In that particular

11

hypothetical then the --

12

13

14

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is no conspiracy.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  There's no conspiracy.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How can we save this

15

case if there is no conspiracy?

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Then you have attempt

liability, and those people would still all be

criminally liable for attempted murder.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  The Model Penal Code, the

Brown Commission, everybody says this is a famous law

school hypothetical, I thought you would never find it

in reality.  They say certainly there is liability where

two people strike, each strikes a mortal blow

independently, and everyone seems to agree there is

liability there.  And even though no blow -- neither

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

2

3

4

5

6

7

8

9

blow is in fact a but-for condition, because in the

absence of blow A he would be dead anyway from blow B.

            All right.  So we start with that, I

thought.  And now starting with that -- you can say I

don't want to start with that.  I think that all

Professor Wechsler and Professor Hall and all these

people famous in my day were wrong.  Okay.  That's up to

you.  But if you do take that as a basic assumption,

then how do you win?  I think that was the question, and

10

there may be an answer to that.

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Yes, Justice Breyer, there is

an answer to that.  The hypotheticals that are posed by

Professor LaFave, which is the one that you are citing,

actually can be answered by the use of the substantial

factor language.  Now, when you have two independently

sufficient causes which act upon an individual causing

the death, you have a but-for problem because but for

the actor A, B's blow would still kill the person.

            In that limited circumstance, the common law

already addresses that and you use the substantial

factor language, which we did at the time of the trial,

tried to incorporate into our jury instruction, which

was rejected by the trial court.  And so that is limited

to those circumstances where you have two --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is substantial factor?

12

I mean, I don't follow you.  I don't see how it gets you

to where you want to be unless "substantial factor"

means that it would have been a but-for cause.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  That is our position, that

substantial factor is appropriate when it would have

been a but-for cause.  You either need independently

sufficient cause or but-for causes only failing by

another independently sufficient cause.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So when you use that

language of "substantial factor," what you really mean

to point to is independent sufficiency?  Two people

shoot, either one would have killed the person, but you

13

can't say --

14

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

15

16

17

18

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that either is the but-

for cause because of the fortuity of the second act?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Correct.  That is the

traditional reason why you would use the substantial

19

factor instruction.

20

21

22

23

24

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you don't mean that to go

any further than independent sufficiency?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  We do not mean it to go any

further, and I don't believe that the case law or the

treatises take it any further.  There is this other

25

hypothetical --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a strange terminology

for it.  I mean, they really ought to get another

terminology if that's what they mean.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  We agree.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can be a substantial

factor without being independently sufficient.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  You could under the common

use of the word "substantial factor," but at least

"substantial factor" would have been better language

10

than "contributes to" or "plays a part in" that this

11

jury heard.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Marginally.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  It would at least give us the

opportunity to argue that the heroin was not the

substantial factor to a jury in a factual question if

"substantial factor" does not mean independently

sufficient cause.  But it's our position that at the

time of the passing of this particular provision,

"substantial factor" meant to address the circumstance

where you have two independently sufficient causes.

            So regardless of whether you use

"substantial factor" as being independently sufficient

cause or some other sort of formulation of the language

of "substantial factor," you still have this problem

that the jury was not instructed on even substantial

14

Alderson Reporting Company

9

factor.  They were instructed on contributing cause,

that --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You do agree that, that

an overdose -- there is a foreseeable risk that someone

who purchases heroin will overdose, there is a

foreseeable risk of that?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  I concede that in a heroin

case, that is a question for the jury, that you would

charge foreseeability or proximate cause to the jury in

10

those circumstances.

11

12

13

14

15

16

17

18

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess here's what the

government might say back to you.  They might say, you

know, in these drug cases, people often take drugs in

combination and then they overdose, and it's really

impossible for anybody to be able to say what you are

requiring an expert to say.  In other words, it's

impossible to say it was the heroin, not the cocaine, it

was the cocaine and not the heroin, it was both, it was

19

neither.

20

21

22

23

24

25

            It's just -- it's all we can talk about is

likelihoods.  You know, just as this expert did.  They

say the fact that he took the heroin made it much more

likely that he would die.  And that's all we are going

to be able to show in a case like that, this, and

because of that, we -- that's got to be enough.

17

            MS. CAMPBELL:  And I would agree that that's

their argument and that's an argument that should be

presented to Congress to amend the statute to

incorporate language that addresses that.  Congress

knows how to address a contributing cause standard.

They said it in numerous other statutes that a certain

act contributes to a death, that the result is in whole

or in part a result of the defendant's action.  They've

said it.  They know how to say it and they could say it

again in this statute if they wanted to.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's compare what --

the situation that Justice Kagan just described with

this situation.  The heroin dealer sells a user, I don't

know, a three-day supply or four-day supply, whatever it

is.  And tells the -- the user, now, you should only use

this much per day.  But the user goes off and injects

the whole amount and -- and dies as a result of an

18

overdose.

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

            Now, why would Congress want to punish that

person where the overdose -- where the heroin sold is

the but-for cause of death and not the situation where

there's the -- the multidrug cocktail?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, in the absence of

language to the contrary, this statute actually says,

the use of this substance, the substance sold by the

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

defendant results in a death.

            And so when we start by looking at the words

of the statute, they -- they don't say these common

words that you could use to encompass those

circumstances.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand that.

That's a textual argument and maybe the text can be read

both ways.  Assuming it can be read both ways, why would

Congress want to attach these severe consequences in the

overdose case and not in the drug cocktail case?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Because Congress would want

to target a situation where there has been proof beyond

a reasonable doubt that the defendant's actions were the

cause of the death.

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, for -- for any crime,

there are two things.  We punish the intent, the

wickedness, and in both cases, the party is equally

wicked, but we also punish the consequence.  In one

case, the party dies because of that person's act.  And

in the other case, nobody dies just because of that

person's act.  I don't know why you have to run away

22

from that.

23

24

25

            It's -- it's common in the criminal law

that -- that two acts that are equally unlawful, equally

nefarious, one happens to kill somebody, the other one

17

doesn't.  We punish one person, we don't punish the

other.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  That would be true.  And what

I was addressing in Justice -- the justice's

hypothetical was that you can't read congressional

intent into the selection of the words within this

statute.  And if Congress intended to punish multiple

drug cocktails all equally, they would instead have

written the statute to address the cocktail.

10

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it said -- the

11

statute says results, right?

12

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Correct.

13

14

15

16

17

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so we're asking about

results.  Justice Alito's hypothetical, he gives a

three-day supply.  Suppose he gives a year's supply and

he overdoses the next day, what result?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  I believe that would be a

18

jury question.

19

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no, no.  As a matter

20

of law, is that a violation?

21

22

23

24

25

            MS. CAMPBELL:  It would be if he takes the

heroin, and the heroin is the cause of the death, then,

yes, it's a but-for cause.  We would then add that you

should have a proximate cause analysis, which is the

juries are in -- in a unique position to determine

18

10

12

13

14

whether or not foreseeability is appropriate in that

circumstance.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  Suppose we go

back to Justice Alito's example and it's just a two-day

supply and there are statistics that 1 percent of heroin

users overdose.  Is that sufficient to establish

liability under your foreseeability standard?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Not as a matter of law and

not to the degree that the Solicitor General urges that

it's a per se foreseeability.  Foreseeability is still

always going to be instructed to the jury in that

circumstance.  And they can argue that certainly

1 percent is sufficient, and the defense can argue

1 percent chance is not sufficient and can attack the --

15

the numbers.

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the question is what

the legal standard is.  I'm the juror.  I said -- I want

to know does this suffice to impose liability?  And you

say well, if you say it is.  Does it or doesn't it?

That's a -- that's a fair question.  Just -- you can't

say, oh, well, it's up to the jury.  We don't know.  I

want to know what the rule is.  The juries have to

23

follow a rule.

24

25

            MS. CAMPBELL:  The rule is the language of

the proximate cause instruction that you give them.  And

19

Alderson Reporting Company

4

6

7

9

10

11

while there are different formulations of that proximate

cause instruction, you would instruct the jury whether a

reasonable person in the position of the defendant would

be able to foresee that consequence.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I would say, my

goodness, if only 1 percent overdose, that -- that isn't

very foreseeable.  I -- you know, I don't think you have

to submit that to the jury.  I think that's one of the

reasons we -- we banned these drugs, because they are

risky, and anybody should know that if somebody dies

from it, it's within the scope of the risk when you sold

12

the cocaine.

13

14

15

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

            Now, I guess it's different if you're

selling, I don't know, sleeping pills, okay?  Which are

part of a cocktail that -- that causes somebody to die.

That's the situation that worries me.  It seems to me if

the cocaine -- the person selling the cocaine can be

liable for the cocktail death, I guess the person who

sold the sleeping pills could, as well.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, in that circumstance,

in our specific factual circumstance, each individual

person that supplied any of the drugs to the victim in

23

this case would be equally liable.

24

25

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, one was -- the

heroin was illegal -- was not -- the selling of a

20

Alderson Reporting Company

2

3

4

5

6

7

8

10

11

sleeping pill is not illegal.  It's perfectly lawful.

Selling heroin is illegal.  Doesn't that make a

difference?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Selling sleeping pills can be

illegal if they're sold to someone that does not have a

prescription, if they're sold on the street.  The

OxyContin that was used in this case was not procured

legally.  The marijuana in this case was not procured

legally.  The -- there was no evidence whether or not

the other prescription drugs, the multitude of

prescription drugs he had in his house were procured

12

legally.

13

14

15

16

            So assuming that the conduct of the person

distributing the drugs were each individually violating

the other provisions of the statute, it would be equally

liable under the theory that they only had to contribute

17

to the death of the individual.

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

            JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't see how this

foreseeability test would work.  Well, you'd have

testimony what, this particular user looked -- looked

like a healthy person, so there wasn't -- it wasn't

foreseeable that that person was going to overdose.

This other one looked kind of shaky and irresponsible

and who knows what the person might do.  That's what

we -- that's what the jury would have to evaluate?

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

            MS. CAMPBELL:  There are certain facts that

could be read to a jury.  In each individual case, they

would differ.  And you can look at the case law,

especially regarding this --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what sort of facts?

Suppose you -- you have the heroin dealer, is a

responsible heroin dealer.

            (Laughter.)

            JUSTICE ALITO:  And he wants to sell heroin

but doesn't want to cause anybody to die.  What would be

kind of the checklist that the person would go through?

All right, I'm going to sell this.  I take the risk of a

drug conviction, but I don't want this death results

business.  So a person is well dressed.  Person is --

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, I think you could look

directly to the Eighth Circuit's opinion in the

Macintosh case and the factors in that case where that

particular person manufactured methamphetamine and

specifically said, I do not want my methamphetamine to

go to this person.  None of the meth should go to this

person.  But his meth ended up going to that person and

23

that person overdosed and died.

24

25

            In that circumstance, that would be a fact

that we could argue to the jury on the defendant's

behalf using the appropriate proximate cause standard

that that was not foreseeable and not intended --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  But I want my -- I want

the checklist for my responsible heroin dealer on the

street corner.  What does this person go through?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, I -- I don't think

there can be a checklist.  That's why proximate cause

and foreseeability is always charged to a jury.  Why

it's -- it's uniquely a jury question.  Whether there's

an experience with this particular user, whether the

person that is selling the drugs knows the user has

overdosed in the past, whether there's something within

that particular drug that is stronger than normal

14

heroin.

15

16

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have any --

what type of heroin user is more likely to overdose and

suffer death?  A first-time heroin user or an

18

experienced heroin user?

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

            MS. CAMPBELL:  There are no facts in the

record that reflect that.  The evidence within the

record indicates that this particular user was an

experienced heroin user and that people who use heroin

on a -- on a regular basis actually develop tolerance to

heroin, so it would take a higher amount of heroin for

that person to overdose.  That's what's in the record.

            Now, the -- the studies that are cited by

the Solicitor General indicate that there have been some

sort of research -- we don't have access to all of those

documents -- but some sort of research regarding heroin

addicts.  And -- and when you're dealing with heroin

addicts, that number is less than 1 percent using

their -- their research.  Heroin addicts are less than

1 percent likely to die.

            Those types of factors could be used in

formulating a foreseeability analysis.  But, of course,

you can't just rely on the foreseeability analysis, you

should always incorporate this but-for analysis.  And in

a but-for analysis, you would also be dealing with a

situation where you have multiple drugs.  And so it not

only informs our discussion about whether or not the

heroin was the but-for cause of the death, but also

whether, in this particular circumstance, this

particular defendant could foresee that this particular

19

person --

20

21

25

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I just want to get

your position as -- as a matter of law.

            Let's assume 1 percent of heroin users

overdose.  Dealer sells to an addict he's never seen

before.  Doesn't know anything about his age, background

or anything.  Just sells him the drug.  The heroin

addict overdoses.  Liability or not?  Can there be

liability under those facts?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  It would be our position that

there could be liability if properly instructed to a

jury.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it's just up to the

jury to decide whether it was foreseeable or not.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Correct.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you cannot say, as I --

as I think I say, that if you sell cocaine and if it is

without a doubt the but-for cause of somebody's death,

you're liable under this statute.  You don't think

13

that's the case.

14

15

16

17

            MS. CAMPBELL:  We disagree.  And,

Justice Scalia, I would point actually to the -- this

Court's precedent in the civil context where you -- you

read proximate cause and foreseeability into almost

18

exact same language.

19

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but in the

civil --

            In the civil context, you have strict -- you

have strict liability.  This is in a way strict

liability and seems to me quite proper.

it doesn't take proper steps, it is liable even if

1 percent of the users are adversely affected.

            Excuse me, Chief.

            MS. CAMPBELL:  You -- in a strict liability

circumstance would have a statute which writes in strict

liability.  This statute doesn't write in strict

10

liability.

11

16

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I just clarify before

you're finished.  You have used the words

"foreseeability," "but for."  Are you saying, to make it

very simple, that unless the government proves that the

heroin independently would cause death, then no

conviction?  The heroin must independently cause the

17

death.  Is that --

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

            MS. CAMPBELL:  Only in the circumstance

where you have two independently sufficient causes do

you -- do you reach that question.  We don't think you

need to reach that question here.  That's why we didn't

argue that at the motion for judgment of acquittal

stage, because you don't have standard but-for

causation.  And that failure was not as a result of two

25

independently sufficient causes.

            If I may reserve my time.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, are you then saying

except for the heroin ingestion, the death would not

have occurred?

            MS. CAMPBELL:  The -- that's the primary

argument, that except for the heroin that -- the factual

basis of this case is that, if you remove the heroin,

the doctors are saying he still might have died.  And

that is what defeats the but-for causation.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

       The situation here is very much what Congress had

in mind when it sought to hold drug traffickers

responsible for the results of the use of the dangerous

substances in which they deal.  It's perfectly ordinary

to speak of a drug as contributing to an overdose.  And

in the context of the Controlled Substances Act, there

is no room to argue that a heroin user's overdose death

25

comes as a surprise.

27

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So Mr. --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So one little -- one

little grain of heroin that you discover is in the body,

and that person's going away for whatever it is,

20 years?

            MR. HORWICH:  No, I don't think so,

Mr. Chief Justice.  And let me explain, because I think

the concern that arises with your hypothetical, which

doesn't arise on these facts, presents a different issue

than what's in dispute before the Court right now.  The

dispute between the parties is what kinds of -- on the

causation in fact side of the case, the dispute is

between what kinds of causes can qualify at all.  Do

they have to be but-for causes or can a contributing

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

            Now, there is a separate principle which is

reflected in jury instructions and reflected in the

substantial factor concept and so forth that causes that

are causes in fact but are too insignificant or not

important enough or too insubstantial are not properly

the basis for criminal responsibility.

            Now, that's -- that's not the dispute before

23

this Court.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Horwich, I mean,

it seems to me that the dispute before this Court is

this:  You have somebody who's taken five drugs.  One of

them is heroin.  And the -- the experts get on the

stand, and they say:  Did the heroin cause the death?

And the experts say:  Really can't say whether the

heroin caused the death in the sense that if the -- if

he hadn't taken the heroin, he wouldn't have died.

            So they say:  Well, what can you say?  He

said:  Well, what I can say is that if he hadn't -- is

that the heroin made it more likely that he died.

            Well, how much more likely did the heroin

make it?  Well, the heroin made it 50 percent more

likely that death resulted.  Would that be sufficient?

            MR. HORWICH:  I -- I think probably yes,

although let me -- let me explain that we -- why we see

the nature of the expert testimony as actually different

than what you're describing there.  Because --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, take mine.

18

            MR. HORWICH:  Yes.

20

actually --

21

22

23

24

25

            MR. HORWICH:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean

the expert testimony in this case, but in general what

experts are testifying to when they're testifying to

that.  They are not testifying to some uncertainty about

whether the defendant's drugs played any role at all.

This isn't the question of say, yeah, he bought heroin

from two different dealers.  He took one of them, and he

died, but we don't know which dealer it was.

            In that case we totally agree that that sort

of uncertainty means no liability.  What the experts

testified to in these cases is that the primary cause of

death, which is essentially central nervous system

depression that leads to asphyxiating on stomach

contents or saliva or something like that, was a process

to which a number of substances contributed.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, and he might have died

even without the heroin, because all the other

substances might have been perfectly adequate to cause

death.  So I really can't tell you that the heroin

played -- even -- you know, even to use your language, I

can't tell you whether the heroin contributed.  All I

can tell you is a likelihood, a probability that the

18

heroin led to death.

19

20

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, the experts here of

course did testify specifically that the heroin did

21

contribute to the death.  So --

22

23

24

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, again, that question

of words, the experts were very careful to say:  "I

cannot tell you that in the absence of the heroin he

wouldn't have died.  He might have died even without the

heroin, the experts said.  The only thing I can tell you

is that the heroin made it more likely that he died.

            MR. HORWICH:  I guess -- maybe I can respond

to that with a perhaps more conventional hypothetical.

If you imagine that -- if you imagine that you have

three assailants who independently simultaneously set

upon the victim and beat him to death, and the victim

could have survived any one of them.  In that situation,

you might well have testimony from a doctor that says,

Well, I can't tell you -- he probably would have died --

even I can be sure he would have died from the other two

guys.  But I think in that -- in that scenario we would

certainly recognize that the -- that each of the

assailants is responsible for the victim's death.  We

15

wouldn't say oh, well, he --

17

18

21

22

23

24

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a bad sign that you're

using the hypotheticals rather than the facts of your

case, you know?  The facts of your case are that the

expert gets on the stand and says:  I can't tell you

that the heroin was responsible for the death.  I cannot

tell you that in the absence of the heroin he wouldn't

have died.  What I can tell you is that the heroin

was -- what I can do is to give you essentially a

probability that the heroin caused the death.

            And you're saying that's enough, even if the

probability is as small as 50 percent.

            MR. HORWICH:  I don't think -- the experts

here did not testify in probability figures in that way.

What they testified to was that -- was that the heroin

contributed to the set of drugs that were responsible

for the actual primary cause of death.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  They said it contributed to

the set of drugs, but they didn't say that it

contributed to the death.  They had no idea whether it

contributed to the death.  All that they were able to

say is:  There are five drugs; here are some

probabilities; here are some likelihoods.  If you don't

like the probability language:  Here is the likelihood.

Using heroin made it more likely that he would die, but

we can't say that using heroin killed him.

            MR. HORWICH:  That -- and it is that aspect

of the testimony which is why we concede that if you

apply a but-for test, that testimony does not establish

19

a but-for test.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  How about 30 percent?

            MR. HORWICH:  The relevant question is in a

contributing cause analysis, at least in the first

instance, setting aside the substantiality question that

the Chief Justice's hypothetical raised, the basic

question of the contributing cause analysis is whether

the drug in a case like this contributed to the physio

-- the internal physiological effects that culminated in

the death.

            And I would make a distinction here, for

example.  If you -- consider the marijuana in this case.

The testimony here does not even establish the marijuana

as being a contributing cause, because the

toxicologists -- the toxicologist testifies -- this is

at Joint Appendix 193, that the -- "Every drug on this

list, with the exception of the constituents of

marijuana, have central nervous system depressant

effects," and then goes on to explain why it's those

effects that are -- that's what's going on in the body

17

that's leading to the death.

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

            So again -- so we would agree that if you

apply -- that if you insist on a but-for test, then,

correct, these sort of probabilities don't get the

government even to the jury.  That's a directed verdict.

            But I want to -- but I would like to point

out though -- so I guess what I would like to discuss is

why the but-for test is not the right test to be

25

applying here.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Before -- Mr. Horwich,

before we leave this hypothetical --

            MR. HORWICH:  Yes.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  -- may me ask you this.  If

I were a member of a legislative body considering what I

would want to happen in this situation -- it's kind of a

frightening thought.  But if that were, I would want to

know what kind of testimony medical experts can

reasonable be expected to provide in cases like this,

where there is the ingestion of multiple drugs.  If it

is possible in most cases, many cases, all cases, a high

percentage of cases, for them to break this down

probabilistically, there was a 50 -- this made it

50 percent more likely, 90 percent more likely,

10 percent more likely, I might want to go down that

road.  But if it's not reasonable in a lot of these

cases to go further than what the experts did in this

18

case, that would make a difference.

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

            Now, can you tell us what, realistically,

can they do in these cases where there is the ingestion

of multiple drugs and the consequence is death?

            MR. HORWICH:  I -- I can't represent to be

informed enough about sort of the range of cases, but I

think the testimony in this case is actually informative

on that point, because there are a number of

uncertainties to which the -- the -- the experts

testified that show why it is, from -- why it is, from

their point of view, essentially impossible to

disentangle the effect of one drug and another drug when

they're having the same effect on the body.  They're

doing the same thing to the -- the victim's central

nervous system.

            And so, it is -- it's the sort of thing that

it's meaningless to speak of one drug versus the other

as being "the cause," because they're all in the body,

they're all doing the same thing in the same way that --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So Congress -- Congress

supposedly knew that and -- and could have written a

statute so that you're -- you're liable if you are a

contributing cause of -- of the death.  It didn't do so.

It said -- it says it has to result in the death.

And -- and I take that to mean at least, at least

18

but-for causality.

19

20

21

22

23

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, we -- we --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why should "result

in" not -- not mean but-for causality?

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, we -- we would take

Congress to have been incorporating the rules settled on

24

generally in the criminal context --

25

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?

16

            MR. HORWICH:  -- for this sort of problem.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why does "result in"

refer -- refer to what -- what we do in the common law?

I mean, I apply common law rules when -- when Congress

adopts a common law crime, yes.  It -- it brings along

the -- the soil that goes with that crime, right?  But

this is not a common law crime, and -- and Congress used

the English language "results in," and I would take that

to mean causes.

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, we do take it to mean

causes.  But courts applying the concept of cause -- so

that's why we think that Congress would be intending to

borrow courts' approaches to causation in common law

cases.  And I think there's a key insight in those

cases.  Now, we cite a number of them going back 100,

120 years in our -- in our brief at pages 19 and 20, 21,

17

25 and 26.

18

19

20

21

22

23

            And the key insight in those cases, which I

think Justice Sotomayor touched on, which is that if

your test for causation, say a but-for test, is

producing a result in a case that nothing and nobody was

the cause of the victim's death, you need to rethink

your test for causation.  It's not producing sound

24

results.

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I accept that.

15

            MR. HORWICH:  And so, Justice Breyer, that's

what's going on in -- in the treatises that then say,

well, in these other cases, we're going to -- we're

going to say, well, these independently sufficient

tests, that applies as well.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, here -- here I

accept that -- first of all, there's no problem with

intent for me for the reason Justice Scalia pointed out,

that anyone who sells heroin to someone is reckless, at

least, in respect to the possibility of a death

resulting.  So I think that's enough to bring them

within the intent problem.  Also, there was a death

here; fine.  But still you have to show cause.

            And this is this unusual situation, which

the Brown Commission expresses itself upon and which the

16

model Penal Code didn't.

24

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And the model Penal Code

did express itself on what they call, in the Brown

Commission, concurrent causes, all right?  It has to be

a but-for or a concurrent cause.  But a concurrent cause

is the situation where there are two people striking a

mortal blow.  Therefore, either is sufficient.  And if,

in fact, the second wasn't sufficient, then the first is

25

a necessary condition.

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

            MR. HORWICH:  Yes.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right?  So here we have

the separate problem which has been pointed out that not

only -- we don't know if the others were sufficient, nor

do we know if this was a necessary condition.  And Brown

and 5 States tell you what to do in such situation to

fall within the definition of cause.  And the model

Penal Code where you have Professor Wechsler debating

Professor Hall with Dean Griswald throwing in the odd

comment decided not to tell us its view.  Okay?

            So that's where I stand.  And you can

correct that if you want, but I'm beginning to think

that probably, at least it should be important in such a

situation, and that the word "substantial" better

connotes the idea of it being an important factor than

the word "contributing," which means picks up all kinds

of quite unimportant factors.  That's where my thinking

is, and anything -- I just say that in case you want to

respond to that.

20

21

22

23

24

25

            MR. HORWICH:  I do.  I have, I think, two

very important things to say in response to that.  One

of them is, as -- as I was sort of suggesting with the

Chief Justice, if the dispute is over whether it should

be a substantial contributing cause, then I think we're

happy to argue that the jury instruction gets in that

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

direction, and at a minimum, there's harmless error

here.  So --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It depends on what you mean

by substantial.

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Opposing counsel says

substantial means that it would independently have

sufficed.

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think -- I think

1

that's right.

11

12

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  If that's what you mean by

it, we'll all cheer.  But -- but I suspect that's not

13

what you mean.

14

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, it's not what -- it's

15

not what we mean --

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not what was found

17

in this case, right?

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I would point out -- I

would point out that -- I mean, I'm reading from the

Washington State Christman decision, which is the only

decision that the parties have cited that's actually --

factually deals with this scenario and it says, "Under

the substantial factor test, all parties whose actions

contributed to the outcome are held liable."  So I think

that's -- that's very much in line with what we're

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

saying.

            I'd also say that the Brown Commission and

those --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that's what you

call a substantial factor?  That all contributed to the

outcome?  The one grain of heroin would -- would --

            MR. HORWICH:  No, because we think it

does -- we think it does have to be substantial.  I

think that's -- that's why the word "substantial" --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then -- then you

don't agree with that -- that stuff that you just read

1

point.

13

16

17

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, all parties whose

actions substantially contributed to the outcome.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So then you -- you're

saying that the government's position is that

contributing factor should be a substantial contributing

18

factor; you're happy with that.

19

20

21

22

            MR. HORWICH:  I think -- I think we would

not -- we wouldn't have an objection if the Court states

that as the law.  Now, if the Court does that, it would

be appropriate, I suppose, to ask the court of appeals

23

to examine the record here.

24

25

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what is substantial?

What do you think is substantial?  10 percent,

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20 percent --

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think substantial --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  5 percent, what?

            MR. HORWICH:  -- substantial -- I wouldn't

put it -- well, I would put it in relative terms, right?

The question would be:  Is this cause substantial

relative to what?  Well, relative to the other causes at

issue.  And we have here overwhelming testimony that the

heroin --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So is that the question?

Is -- in other words, is the heroin more likely to have

caused the death than the cocaine, than the marijuana,

than the sleeping pills?  So we can't really say that

the heroin caused the death, but it's more likely to

have caused the death than anything else he took?  Is

that the -- is that the question?

17

18

19

20

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, we know that it can --

we know two things; one, it causally contributed in a

way that, say, the marijuana did not contribute to what

the experts are testifying was the physiological

21

process.  And two --

22

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But -- but maybe not to the

23

death.

24

25

            MR. HORWICH:  -- of the things that

contributed to that, we would agree that the

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

insubstantial, the one pill out of a thousand

hypothetical, would certainly not be substantial.  How

substantial, I guess, is going to be very fact-specific.

Here it's --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And is the one question

is -- is how this all relates to the "beyond a

reasonable doubt" instruction in criminal cases?  I

mean, the idea of a test which focuses in the way yours

does on probabilities and likelihoods, and then we go

tell the jury, find beyond a reasonable doubt that this

was more likely to have caused the death than anything

else, or find beyond a reasonable doubt that this

increased the likelihood of death by 50 percent.

            I mean, that seems a very odd kind of

question for a jury to consider, but that's exactly what

you would be asking a jury to consider.

            MR. HORWICH:  I disagree with that.  Because

what we're asking the jury to decide is beyond a

reasonable doubt, did this drug have the physiological

effects that the medical examiners described as being

the integral process that resulted in death.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the statute -- the

statute says did it result in death.  It did not -- the

statute does not say -- does not criminalize a drug that

has physiological effects.  It criminalizes a drug when

it results in death.  And you can't say anything about

resulting in death except as -- except by reference to

probabilities and likelihoods.

            MR. HORWICH:  I -- I think that there is

going to be testimony about probabilities and

likelihoods that will inform the substantiality

question, but it's not a question of likelihood that

it -- that it contributed to the central nervous system

depression that killed the victim here.  That -- that is

10

unequivocal in the testimony.

11

12

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you wanted to

incorporate in the statute your friend's understanding

of but-for cause, what word would you use that would be

14

better than "results"?

15

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I would -- you could use

16

but for or accept.

17

18

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know.  But

you want -- you want a word that's going to be readily

19

understandable.

20

21

22

23

24

25

            MR. HORWICH:  Or solely.  I guess I would

refer the Court to the -- the jury instructions that

Petitioner proposed here, which are on 238, which say

that, that the -- the proximate cause must be one that

except for the cause the death would not have occurred.

That's the instructions that are proposed there.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

            And our point is that the insight in -- in

these sources, it's an insight that's in the Brown

Commission report, it's an insight that's in the

numerous cases we have cited going back, is that that is

not the only test that is used.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Horwich, just if

I could get back, that is the instruction on proximate

cause.

            MR. HORWICH:  Well --

1

17

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, the way they are

structured for -- in Petitioner's submission, it's --

it's sort of built into the proximate cause instruction.

They weren't separated in the way Petitioner did it.  So

there's -- the first part of the second sentence on 238,

the "direct result or reasonably probable consequence"

gets at what we would more conventionally describe as

proximate cause.  But the second part is classic

causation in fact:  "Except for the cause the death

would not have occurred."  So what Petitioner here is

trying to defend is a test that produces --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but it doesn't say --

the one they quote in their brief, all they wanted the

judge to say was it could be -- they say, you are right,

proximate cause, but they're interested here in is it a

cause at all.  And they say:  "As long as the subject

cause contributes substantially to producing the death."

That's what they wanted him to say.  And he didn't say

it.

            And actually when I read that, I thought,

well, what they want is to say that it's an important

factor, rather than just saying it's some unimportant

factor.  And they seem, I don't know what these words

really mean, but it seems they are closer to what you're

saying should be the law than you are.

            MR. HORWICH:  That is a convenient excerpt

from the instruction on 238, but the other part of the

instruction insists that except for the cause the death

15

would not have occurred.  So --

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I agree with you the

language -- their position now is not that it's enough

that it's an important factor.  Rather, and I would like

to know your view on this, your opposing counsel

contends that the courts and commentators who use the

"substantial factor" terminology mean by "a substantial

factor" a factor that would by itself have been

23

sufficient.

24

25

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, certainly, certainly

they can pull up cases that say that.  But what I would

emphasize for this Court is that in four briefs to this

Court Petitioner has not cited a single case that does

what he's asking this Court to do, which is reject a

contributing cause approach and exonerate him under a

but-for test that applied to this case would lead to the

conclusion that nothing and nobody caused the victim to

die here.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to get back to

it, you were reading from the proximate cause

instruction.  They've got -- the very next instruction

says:  You have to find that he died as a result of

using the heroin distributed by the defendant.  So I

think it's a little unfair to suggest that they were

willing to go with the same concept of cause that you

15

were proposing.

disagree that a court could just use the unadorned

statutory language.  That -- that -- that would not be

error to do so.  Our point is only -- our point is only

that a contributing cause, as these courts have

recognized for a long time, can be a cause in fact,

particularly in these scenarios where otherwise they are

going to conclude there was no cause at all.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you want us to say?

You know what's actually worrying me about this case?

It took quite a long time, and there are like three

levels of complexity, and we are from but for into

concurrent and then the sufficient condition and the

necessary condition.  And we are trying to argue whether

this thing that the Model Penal Code wouldn't even pick

up in Brown ought to be the Federal law of the United

States.

            And Professor Wechsler's reaction was:

Look, this is -- this going to arise so infrequently,

it's so complicated to talk about, that you are going to

mix everybody up once we start to write on this.

            And that is worrying me as a real problem.

Once I start to write in this area, we are going to get

people so mixed up no matter what we say --

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think the Court --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that I hesitate to go

backwards from the very vague and open language,

substantive, substantial versus contributing, and just

sort of why not just say substantial and leave it there

and let the lower courts figure it out, so we don't

confuse the entire bar and the entire Congress and

22

everything.

23

            MR. HORWICH:  Yes.  If Your Honor is

to be a but-for test, but we are not going to go on to

define "substantial factor."

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because of that

imprecision, some poor devils will have to go to jail

for a longer period than otherwise, you know.  Tough

luck.

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I this isn't -- I think

this isn't something that would catch Congress by

surprise.  The problem of multiple drug use is a well

13

recognized situation.

            If I might turn to foreseeability.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Horwich, I just don't

understand what "substantial factor" means in the way

you are using it.  I understand what Ms. Campbell said,

because she said "substantial factor" just means

independently sufficient.  But you are saying

"substantial factor" can mean more than that, but it

doesn't have to mean a but-for cause.  How is something

that is a substantial factor in a death without their

being able to say that it was a but-for cause of the

24

death?

25

            MR. HORWICH:  The situations that we're

48

Alderson Reporting Company

11

talking about here are ones in which nothing would be a

for cause of the death and nothing would be

independently sufficient to cause the death.  So in some

sense --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So it's not a substantial

factor in causing the death, because that assumes that

it actually played a role in causing the death and you

can't say whether it played a role in causing the death.

That's what creates this problem.

            MR. HORWICH:  I disagree with that.  It

absolutely played a role in causing it.  That's exactly

12

what the toxicologist --

13

14

15

16

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  In the sense of if it hadn't

been there, the death would not have occurred.

            MR. HORWICH:  That's true.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  You can't say that, that's

17

the point.

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, that's true, but I don't

think, to take my example of the assailants, the three

assailants beating the victim to death, I think it would

be very strange to say that none of those assailants

played a role in the victim dying, none of them

contributed to the victim dying.  That seems -- that

seems to be contrary to ordinary usage and ordinary

25

intuitions about cause and effect.

            Now, I agree in this situation because we

are talking about something that happens at a molecular

level, it's perhaps less -- it's less part of common

experience and we have to rely on the doctors.  But what

they are saying is no different than saying that he had

three drugs in there and they were each knocking him

down to a state of unable to -- to repress his gag

reflex, essentially.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The problem with

your hypothetical, it's the sort of thing where there's

no way that a doctor could say three people beat the guy

up, which one threw the fatal punch.  But here we have a

situation where the experts could tell you:  Yes, the

heroin alone would have killed him.  Or, as in this

case, I can't tell you the heroin alone would have

16

killed him.

17

18

19

20

            MR. HORWICH:  Yes, I think that's right, but

I can imagine a doctor similarly testifying in the three

assailants situation to exactly that point.  I can't

tell you which is the fatal punch, precisely.  I agree

21

with that.

22

23

24

25

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if you can't put

-- but my point is that they would not be able to tell

you in any case, where here they can tell you in every

case whether it's clear that the heroin caused the death

50

Alderson Reporting Company

or not.

            MR. HORWICH:  That may be true, but there

will be cases in which no single drug caused the death

and yet the victim died.  That's what produces the

problem here.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But this

statute does not say if you die from taking drugs, then

the person who gave you drugs, who gave you any kind of

drug is responsible.  It says the heroin has to result,

            MR. HORWICH:  It does.  And I think it's

ordinarily -- I think it's an ordinary usage of language

to describe this as resulting from the heroin and some

other things, too.  But the testimony is certainly to

the effect that it resulted from the heroin.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What result if a heroin

dealer persuades a first time user to please try heroin,

it's wonderful.  He does.  Three days later the addict,

the new addict, the new user buys heroin from a

different dealer and overdoses and dies?  Does the first

dealer contribute, is a substantial contributing cause?

            MR. HORWICH:  Contributing cause there?  I

guess -- I guess I would need to know more medically.  I

24

suspect that yes.

25

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  The heroin has

disappeared, but he has become addicted.

            MR. HORWICH:  Okay.  So he's become

addicted.  I think possibly yes.  I am skeptical that

that would be a substantial contributing cause.  And

then there would be -- there would be in our view

questions about proximate cause that would be raised in

that situation as well.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about you give

the guy a heroin and he drives away, but as a result of

using it he's driving under the influence, has an

accident and is killed?  Is that -- does his death

12

result from the heroin in that case?

13

14

15

16

17

18

            MR. HORWICH:  We think in that situation,

certainly factually, causation in fact, it does.  In

that situation we are lying farther away from the

central harms that the Controlled Substances Act is

addressing, and so we think you would get into some sort

of proximate cause inquiry there as well, that you

19

wouldn't here.

20

21

22

23

24

25

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Now I'm

really confused.  I thought you were pointing the

causation, the factual causation, into proximate cause.

You are saying there's a difference.  So what do you

think gets folded into proximate cause?

            MR. HORWICH:  So in proximate cause, our

13

basic point on proximate cause in an overdose situation

is that you already have the indicia you need to know

that this is the harm for which Congress wants to hold

the defendant responsible.  In the Chief Justice's --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In one other case --

there has been one other case, but you are suggesting

that there are cases in which there might be a proximate

cause problem, you just --

            MR. HORWICH:  Absolutely.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- as you just said to

Justice Kennedy.  In what other case have we said that

you don't have to charge a jury on an element of the

crime on proximate causation?  Is there any in which we

14

have ever said that?

15

            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I -- I have to

16

disagree with --

17

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because in -- in the

vast majority of cases, it won't be a problem.

            MR. HORWICH:  I guess I have to -- I guess

my answer to your hypothetical has to be to disagree

with the idea that this is an element.  We're not

dispensing with an element.  The element is that a death

resulted.  The question is how, in a particular case,

should a district judge explicate the scope of harms for

which defendants should be held responsible?

            And sometimes you can do that with a

foreseeability instruction.  Sometimes you might do it

with an intervening or superseding cause instruction or

other proximate cause concepts.

            But in a case where you know there's an

overdose at issue, and we're talking about heroin here,

which is controlled, in large part, precisely because it

kills people --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So foreseeability --

            MR. HORWICH:  -- you don't need --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- is an element in only

some ways of killing people, in which some people die.

            MR. HORWICH:  It is necessary to instruct on

it if we're in a situation where we're worried about

consequences running out to infinity.  That's the usual

concern, the Palsgraf-type concern about foreseeability,

but this is not running out to infinity.  This is

18

just --

19

20

21

22

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, I'm having a

really hard time because of Paroline, where you

basically admit that proximate cause, i.e.,

foreseeability, because I see them --

23

            MR. HORWICH:  Yes.

24

25

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- as almost

interchangeable, is almost always to be charged, is

almost always an element that is required when you have

a -- results from --

            MR. HORWICH:  Yes.  To be clear, we're not

saying there's no proximate cause requirement.  We're

saying that there is a sufficient assurance that the

function of proximate cause, of limiting defendant's

responsibility to the matters about which Congress is

concerned, is served in an overdose case when you know

that you have a substance that is controlled in large

10

part because of precisely this risk, that then it causes

11

exactly that harm.

12

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANGELA L. CAMPBELL,

                APPOINTED BY THIS COURT,

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

            MS. CAMPBELL:  It's our position that

but-for cause is the first question, and only when you

reach a point where there is no but-for cause do you

then go on to say, is this one of these circumstances

where there is a -- two independently sufficient harms.

If no, end of question, which was the motion for

judgment of acquittal at the time of trial.  There was

no but-for cause.  We made the motion for judgment of

acquittal on but-for cause.  You don't need to make that

inquiry in this particular case.  There may be cases

where you make that inquiry.

            Of course, we didn't win, so we had to keep

going along, and we asked for a substantial factor test

because we thought maybe we could influence the judge to

give us a better instruction, like the substantial

factor test that the Eighth Circuit had already

approved, and he rejected it and gave them a

contributing cause instruction, which is clearly not

encompassed within the common law standards of

causation.  But-for cause is substantial factor.

            Now, to address the concerns about letting

defendants go free, that just simply doesn't play a part

in this analysis.  Every criminal defendant in any of

these hypotheticals would have some sort of criminal

liability, either a lesser included offense.  This

particular defendant, Mr. Burrage, could go to prison

for 20 years for the lesser included offense.  You have

accomplice liability.  You have conspiracy.  You have

21

attempt.

22

23

24

25

            All of these individuals are going to be

punished.  You have sentencing discretion.  The judge

can look at the fact that there was a death -- well,

maybe not a primary cause in the death -- there was a

death, and enhance the sentence under the -- beyond the

guideline range.

            All of those concerns are already addressed

in the criminal law, and we do not need to change the

criminal law of causation and relax it to encompass more

harms.  Because if we aren't willing to do that in a

civil context where you have contributing negligence and

shifting of burdens of -- shifting of the costs in

having -- your hypothetical, you have different

percentages' likelihood of causing the harm.  So maybe

you give 5 percent to the marijuana dealer and

10 percent to the oxycodone dealer and 20 percent to the

heroin dealer.  We don't have that in criminal law.

That's a -- that's a policy consideration that is

different between civil law and criminal law.

            In criminal law, the person's going to go to

prison under a mandatory minimum sentence, and in some

cases for life with no parole based on this relaxed

causation standard that the government is asking this

Court to incorporate into a statute where it doesn't say

21

it.

22

23

24

25

            And so we would respectfully ask for the

Court not to engage in that process, not to relax

causation for the criminal -- criminal statute at play

here and in all of the criminal statutes that use

57

Alderson Reporting Company

"result in," and instead rely upon the general notions

of causation that are already established in the law.

            Thank you.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

            The case is submitted.

            (Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m. the case in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
