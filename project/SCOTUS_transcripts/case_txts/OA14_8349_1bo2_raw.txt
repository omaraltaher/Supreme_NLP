CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­8349,  Foster  v.  Chatman. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Bright. 

 

         

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MR.  STEPHEN  B.  BRIGHT 

 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  prosecutors  in  this  case  came  to  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  morning  of  jury  selection  determined  to  strike 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  black  prospective  jurors. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Mr.  Bright,  maybe 

  

 

 

 

 

you  could  address  first  the  ­­ the  question  we  raised  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Friday  with  respect  to  which  court  certiorari  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directed  to. 

 

            

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

We  filed  this  petition  originally  certiorari 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Georgia.  And  of  course  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  in  Sears  v.  Upton  had  issued  certiorari  ­­ this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  2010  ­­ to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Georgia  in  a  similar 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation. 

            

It  appears  to  us,  from  looking  at  this  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  weekend,  that  R.J.  Reynolds  Tobacco  Company  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Durham  County,  which  the  Court  has  decided  in  eight  ­­

in  1986,  the  Court  said  that,  unless  there  was  positive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assurance  that  the  decision  was  not  a  ruling  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits,  then  the  writ  went  to  the  State  supreme  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

And  the  Georgia  court,  while  it  has  rules 

 

 

 

 

and  statutes  and  its  own  opinions  that  are  not  totally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  harmony  with  one  another,  the  rule,  nonetheless,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  certificate  of  probable  cause,  which  is  what  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied  in  this  case,  is  to  be  granted  if  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguable  merit  to  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Do  you  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

affects  the  scope  of  our  review?  In  other  words,  are  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressing  just  whether  there's  arguable  merit  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  or  are  we  addressing  the  claim  on  its  own  merits? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  what  this 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Court  has  done  in  ­­ in  all  these  cases  is  apply  Yist  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nunnemaker  to  look  through  to  the  last  reasoned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  and  that  would  be  the  decision  of  the  habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corpus  court.  In  Georgia,  typically  the  habeas  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules,  an  application  is  made  for  certificate  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable  cause  to  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court,  and  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

often  denied  summarily.  It  is  denied  summarily  as  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  in  this  case.  It  was  denied. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  really  don't  understand 

    

 

 

 

that.  You  ­­ you  say  we  would  be  reversing  the  Georgia 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court,  not  the  ­­ not  the  habeas  court,  right?

And  ­­ and  all  that  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court  held  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  ­­ there  ­­ is  that  there  was  no  arguable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  for  ­­ for  its  accepting  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  we  reverse  that  decision,  we  ­­ we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court,  you're  wrong;  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  arguable  basis  for  your  accepting  review.  So  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ought  to  remand  to  that  court,  requiring  them  to  accept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review,  it  would  seem  to  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

How  can  we  reverse  them  on  ­­ on  an  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ they  never  considered? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Well,  that's  what  happened  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

R.J.  Reynolds.  I  mean,  there  you  had  almost  an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical  situation  where  you  had  an  intermediate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate  court  that  had  ruled,  and  then  you  had  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

North  Carolina  Supreme  Court  denied  review.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  was,  do  you  issue  the  writ  to  the  intermediate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate  court  or  to  the  North  Carolina  Supreme  Court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  this  Court  decided,  and  Justice  Blackman, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

writing  for  the  court,  said,  "We  want  to  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practitioners"  ­­ "We  want  to  end  the  confusion  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this." 

            

            

And  so  it  goes  to  the  State  supreme  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  is  no  difference  in  our  situation  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  situation  that  R.J.  Reynolds  ­­

that  case  or  in  other  cases?  And  if  so,  which  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  that,  in  that  situation,  we,  nonetheless, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed  the  reasoning  of  the  intermediate  court?  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  what  you're  saying? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  You  ­­ you  did  in  Sears  v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Upton,  a  case  out  of  Georgia,  561  U.S.  945  in  2010. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  was  certiorari  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Georgia,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  came  up  on  exactly  the  same  posture  of  our  ­­ our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  there  an  argument  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  petition  for  certiorari  could  go  to  the  trial  court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  our  statute  says  that  it  goes  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highest  court  in  which  review  could  have  ­­ could  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  had,  I  think  is  the  ­­ the  statutory  phrase,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  sounds  like  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On  the  other  hand,  as  Justice  Scalia  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  haven't  really  directed  their  attention  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  before  us. 

 

 

              

I  ­­ I  ­­ I'm  not  sure  to  me  that  it's  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

option  to  ­­ to  go  to  the  superior  ­­ to  the  Georgia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  court. 

 

            

            

incorrect? 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Well,  let  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Or  ­­ or  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  BRIGHT:  Well,  what  this  Court  has  said,

both  in  the  R.J.  Reynolds  case  and  then  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

followed  in  Grady  v.  North  Carolina  last  year  ­­ 2015 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  this  year,  in  which,  once  again,  there  was  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intermediate  court  decision  denied  by  the  ­­ the  North 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carolina  Supreme  Court. 

 

 

              

I  mean,  I  can  remember  all  the  way  back  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

1960.  There  was  Thompson  v.  Louisville,  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certiorari  was  to  the  police  court  in  Louisville, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kentucky,  because  no  court  in  Kentucky  could  take  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  because  the  fine  was  less  than  $20. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  these  cases,  much  more  recent, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decided  by  the  Court  1986  and  this  year  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You're  putting  together 

  

 

 

 

two  rules  that  you  say  we've  established.  One  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Blackman  said,  to  end  the  confusion,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition  should  be  addressed  to  the  Supreme  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  you  said,  we  have  cases.  Look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  cases.  If  ­­

  

 

 

            

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ the  Supreme  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  just  "denied,"  nothing  more  than  "denied,"  we  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  the  last  reasoned  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Those  are  both  decisions  of  this  Court,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  you're  relying  on. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Well,  and  ­­ and  they're  not

mutually  exclusive.  This  Court  can  look  back  through  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  last  reasoned  decision  in  making  its  decision  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  and  I  believe  that's  what  it  should  do.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  same  time,  the  Court's  opinions  appear  to  us,  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  quick  research  we  did  over  the  weekend  on  this,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

R.J.  Reynolds  and  ­­ and  the  subsequent  case  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certiorari  would  issue  to  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  we  listed  it  that  way,  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  case  was  docketed  here,  it  was  listed  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower  court  was  the  superior  court  of  Butts  County. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  if  the  State  supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court  wrote  a  short  opinion  and  said,  We're  not  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  whether  there  was,  in  fact  ­­ the  only  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  determine  is  whether  there's  any  arguable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merit  to  this?  And  then  you  say  that  the  whole  issue  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it  was  a  correct  application  in  Batson  is  ­­ is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  issue  that  we  have  to  decide? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  think  in 

    

   

   

 

 

R.J.  Reynolds,  I  think  that's  this  Court's  law,  yes. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Could  I  ask  you  another  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  another  preliminary  issue  before  you  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  underlying  question  in  the  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Superior  Court  said,  on  page  175  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Joint  Appendix,  that  the  issue  of  the  Batson  violation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  reviewable  based  on  the  doctrine  of

res  judicata. 

 

            

And  then  it  later  said,  and  this  is  192  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Joint  Appendix,  that  it  will  review  the  Batson  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  to  whether  Petitioner  has  shown  any  change  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  sufficient  to  overcome  the  res  judicata  bar. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  you  put  those  two  together,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  argue  that  the  superior  court  decided  only  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  State  law,  namely,  whether  the  situation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  was  such  that  there  could  be  review  of  the  Batson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

            

What  is  your  response  to  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  BRIGHT:  Well,  the  State  doesn't  argue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And  I  think  the  reason  for  that  is  because  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said,  we're  moving  ­­ the  Court  is  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  step  three  of  Batson.  And  it  said,  Foster's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Batson  claim  is  without  merit. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  but  is  it  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  Federal  or  State  law  as  to  whether  or  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  has  shown  a  change  in  facts  sufficient  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

overcome  the  res  judicata  bar?  The  one  ­­ the  page  192 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  that  Justice  Alito  quoted,  is  that  ­­ is  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  question  or  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  That's  a  State  law  question.

MR.  BRIGHT:  ­­ the  Court  decided  it,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  point  out,  Justice  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  if  it's  a  State  law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question  and  they  resolved  it  against  you,  what  do  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  ­­ then  what  do  you  have  to  argue? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  No,  no,  no. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  think  you  have  to  say 

    

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  Federal  question. 

   

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  No.  In  order  to  decide  it, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ this  is  exactly  like  Ake  v.  Oklahoma,  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court,  the  Oklahoma  court  had  to  decide  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  in  order  to  decide  whether  it  had  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  the  issue. 

 

 

            

And  this  Court  held  in  Ake  that,  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  has  to  decide  the  Federal  issue  ­­ and  it  did  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case.  It  clearly  decided  the  Federal  issue  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felt  that  the  ­­ found  that  the  Batson  claim  had  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merit.  So  it  is  decided,  the  Federal  issue,  and  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  contest  about  that  in  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Explain  to  me  why  deciding 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  issue  was  essential  to  its  deciding  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  res  judicata  issue. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Because  it  ­­ it  ­­ it  framed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  as  being  that  it  would  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ake  v.  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ they  would  look  at  the  Batson  v.

Kentucky  claim  and  that,  if  there  was  merit  to  that

MR.  BRIGHT:  I  think  ­­ I  think  it's 

    

   

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  a  very  strange

there  ­­ there  were  changed  facts  sufficient  enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Well,  the  Georgia  law  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  bring  an  issue  that's  been  litigated  already

Even  if  it  would,  you  know,  produce  a  different  result, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Right.  If  the  ­­ if  the  facts 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  such  that  it  would  produce  a  different  result,

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Bright,  did  the 

  

 

 

 

 

court,  in  your  judgment,  do  de  novo  review?  Didn't  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  it  did  ­­ basically,  it  was  going  to  do  step 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  of  the  Batson  charge  ­­ challenge? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Yes,  that's  exactly  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court  said,  yes. 

 

 

            

the  merits. 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  that's  a  ruling  on 

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  I  think  ­­ I  think  the  court 

    

   

 

 

 

 

said  the  Batson  claim  is  without  merit.  That  seems  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ruling  on  the  merits  to  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  it  ­­ I  think  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

said  after  ­­ after  redoing  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  After  considering  these  other 

  

 

 

 

 

facts.  And  we  think  there  was  some  legal  errors  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there.  But  yes,  after  considering  these  facts,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  said  that  the  claim  was  without  merit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  court  said  that  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  reach  step  three  again  on  the  basis  of  the  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  presented,  and  so  they  did  it  all  over.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  that's  ­­ we  must  take  that  as  what  happened. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  did  not  apply  a  res  judicata  bar. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  No.  I  mean,  in  Ake  this  Court

question  depends  upon  a  Federal  constitutional  ruling, 

   

 

 

 

 

the  State  law  prong  is  not  independent  of  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  And  this  Court  has  jurisdiction.  That's  on  page 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

75  of  47  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I  don't  want  to 

   

  

 

 

 

belabor  the  point  too  much,  but  you  ­­ are  you  arguing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Georgia  res  judicata  law  is  this:  If  someone  comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  with  any  new  fact,  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  thinnest  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  that  is  sufficient  to  wipe  out  the  res  judicata 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bar  and  allow  the  court  to  get  to  the  merits  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim?  Is  that  your  argument?  That's  your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

understanding  of  Georgia  res  judicata  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  That's  not  my  understanding. 

  

 

 

 

 

My  understanding  is  the  evidence  has  to  be  sufficient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  that  the  court  does  what  it  did  in  this  case  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  on  the  merits  of  the  issue.  And  that's  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  here.  This  was  not  a  matter  of  just  adding  one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  leaf  to  the  basket. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  we  really  want  you  to

Batson  issue  to  decide  the  underlying  State  law  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  Ake  is  pretty  clear  on  this,  and  I  commend 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  to  the  Court's  attention.  We  didn't  ­­ it  wasn't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  the  State  had  raised  this,  either  in  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposition  to  cert  or  in  their  brief,  it's  not  briefed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  this  Court,  but  I  think  that's  the  deciding  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  this. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thanks,  counsel.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

think  we  have  your  argument  on  the  point.  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Okay.  Thank  you  very  much. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

If  I  could  just  say  what  happened  here  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  prosecutors  had  identified  the 

 

 

 

 

 

African­Americans  by  race,  they  had  rated  them  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  other  in  case  it  came  down  to  having  to  select  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

black  juror. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  prosecutors  said  the 

  

 

 

 

 

reason  for  concentrating  on  the  black  jurors  was  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  had  informed  them  you  would  present  a  Batson 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge,  and  therefore,  it  was  necessary  for  them  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  if  there  was  a  race­neutral  ground  for  disqualifying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case. 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Right.  Two  answers  to  that, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg. 

 

              

I  mean,  what  the  lawyers  did  here  was  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers  have  practiced  here  for  a  long  time  in  Rome,

Georgia.  They  said  the  prosecutor  always  strikes  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  blacks  from  the  jury.  That's  been  the  historic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice.  We  think  they're  going  to  strike  all  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blacks  on  the  jury  in  our  case.  But  last  year  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  decided  Batson  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kentucky,  and  we  asked  the  Court  not  to  let  that  happen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case. 

 

 

            

Now,  of  course,  if  the  prosecutor  is  willing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  avoid  a  Batson  challenge,  they  could  have  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminated.  That  would  have  been  the  first  thing  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do. 

            

But  ­­ but  secondly,  with  regard  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  that's  collected  here,  it  doesn't  seem  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  information  just  to  exercise  strikes  when  they  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  it  comes  down  to  having  to  take  an  African­American, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Hardge,  or  in  another  place,  Ms.  Garrett,  might  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay.  And  the  district  attorney  himself  said  Marilyn 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Garrett  has  the  most  potential  of  the  black  prospective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors. 

            

In  other  words,  the  blacks  were  taken  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  picture  here.  They  were  taken  and  ­­ and  dealt  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separately.  And  over  the  weekend,  the  jury  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questioning  ended  on  a  Friday.  And  the  judge  said,  all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  Over  the  weekend,  you've  got  your  chance  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  who  you're  going  to  strike.  And  they  knew

exactly  who  they  were  going  to  strike  because  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  jurors  are  listed  in  order.  The  State  goes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first,  and  if  it  accepts  a  juror,  then  the  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepts,  and  that  juror  is  on.  There's  no  going  back. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  no  backstriking  or  there's  no  striking  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  and  there. 

 

 

            

They  developed  three  strike  lists.  And  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  strike  lists  was  a  list  headed  "Definite  NOs." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These  are  the  people  absolutely  are  not  going  to  be  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  jury.  There  are  only  six  jurors  listed  on  the  list 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  "Definite  NOs,"  and  the  first  five  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­Americans.  The  sixth  is  a  juror  who  made  clear 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

during  the  voir  dire  process  that  she  could  not  impose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  death  penalty  under  any  circumstances.  The  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

moved  to  strike  her  for  cause.  The  judge  probably  erred 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  not  granting  that  strike.  But  even  she  ranked  behind 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  black  jurors  in  terms  of  the  priorities  that  the

MR.  BRIGHT:  The  Court  had  not  held  in  JEB 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Batson  applied  to  women,  but  the  Court  did  say  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JEB  that,  of  course,  it  could  be  used  as  a  pretext, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

women,  for  striking  on  the  basis  of  race. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  this  case,  the  prosecutor  struck  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

white  jurors,  and  then  he  struck  the  three  black  jurors, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

women,  the  three  black  women  and  the  three  white  women.

no,  it  was  on  the  motion  for  a  new  trial  hearing  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  he  had  done  the  same  extensive  background  check 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  all  the  jurors,  white  and  black. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Did  you  find  any  evidence  of  that  extensive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

black  background  search? 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  No.  The  only  ­­ what  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  ­­ and  ­­ and  the  investigator  said  this

Appendix  in  which  the  blacks  are  marked  with  a  "B"  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  highlighted  in  green  with  a  marker  up  at  the  corner 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  green  designates  black. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  ­­ so  your  ­­ your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  of  that  statement  was  that  all  ­­ he  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  done  an  extensive  search  on  the  blacks  on  the  list? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Well,  it's  clear,  Mr.  Lundy  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepared  a  ­­ a  list,  notes  in  which  he  talked  about 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  the  black  jurors  in  ­­ in  the  case.  And  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  concedes  in  its  brief  that  the  focus  was  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  black  jurors. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  During  the  trial,  did 

  

 

 

 

 

defense  counsel,  when  he  made  his  initial  Batson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  ­­ not  in  the  papers,  but  at  trial  ­­ did  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again  say  that  this  was  part  and  parcel  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor's  pattern?

MR.  BRIGHT:  He  didn't  say  that,  but  I  point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  interesting  thing  out.  When  they  discussed  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Batson  motion  before  trial,  there  was  never  a  suggestion 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  wouldn't  be  a  Batson  hearing.  Everybody  knew 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  was  going  to  happen,  that  all  the  blacks  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

struck,  and  then  they'd  have  a  hearing  after  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened.  But  the  defense  had  basically  put  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion  in  writing  and  relied  upon  that  throughout  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  selection. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  was  just  surprised 

    

 

 

 

that  we  didn't  hear  about  this  preparation  for  a  Batson 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing  until  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ the  habeas. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  The  ­­ the  defense  lawyers  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  did  move  for  the  prosecution's  notes.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution  opposed  that.  They're  very  strict  in  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  giving  up  their  notes.  Then  when  the  prosecutor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified  on  the  motion  for  a  new  trial,  he  did 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  I've  never  seen  a  lawyer  do  before.  He  cut  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bargain,  sort  of,  with  the  judge  and  the  lawyer  saying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  will  testify,  but  only  if  I  don't  have  to  show  them  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notes. 

              

I  mean,  basic  rules  of  evidence  are  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testify  and  rely  upon  notes;  the  other  side  can  see  the

notes.  But  here,  these  notes  were  guarded  until  2006, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  we  obtained  them  through  a  Freedom  of  Information 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  what  they  call  Open  Records  Act  in  Georgia. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  prosecutors  said  that 

  

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ they  said,  we  never  ­­ we  never  wrote  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  or  relied  on  those  notes.  And  you  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call  the  prosecutors  to  test  the  veracity  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assertion. 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  No,  but  all  the  prosecutor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

talked  about  were  the  color­highlighted  notes.  Each 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor  filed  an  affidavit  which  are  in  the  ­­ in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Joint  Appendix  at  168.  And  all  they  said  was,  we  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highlight  it  in  green,  and  we  didn't  tell  anybody  else 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  highlight  it  in  green.  And  then  Mr.  Lanier  says  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  don't  have  anything  else  to  say  beyond  what  I  said 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  Batson  hearing  and  the  motion  for  a  new  trial. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Pullen  said  ­­ the  only  other  thing  he  said  is,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  use  those  green­highlighted  lists  in  choosing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury;  but,  of  course,  that's  just  the  first  few  pages. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What's  damning  about  this  is  not  so  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  but  the  "Definite  NOs"  list,  the  misrepresentation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  trial  court  that  Ms.  Garrett  ­­ that  they  wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Garrett.  That's  what  they  told  the  trial  court. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  trial  court  relied  upon  that  in  denying  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Batson  motion,  that  this  showed  their  openness  to

having  ­­ Ms.  Garrett  was  on  the  "Definite  NO"  list. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

She  was  on  each  of  the  strike  lists.  Ms.  Garrett  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  in  the  running  to  be  on  this  jury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  they  represented  to  the  court  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  another  African­American,  Shirley  Powell,  was 

 

 

 

 

 

excused  for  cause  ­­ there  were  five  African­Americans 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  venire  at  the  start  when  they  got  ready  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruct  the  jury.  But  one  said,  turns  out  I  know 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  in  the  family.  She  was  excused  for  cause.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prosecutors  said  ­­ made  it  ­­ implied  clearly  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  it  not  been  for  that,  that  extra  strike,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Garrett  would  have  sat. 

 

 

 

 

            

At  the  same  time  ­­ and  they're  still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing  this  both  ways,  that  they  both  wanted  her  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  want  her  ­­ they  give  eleven  reasons  for  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Garrett  would  not  be  a  good  juror.  That  she's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

impudent  and  she  doesn't  respect  the  court.  If  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  all  the  things  they  said  about  her,  they  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  want  her  as  a  juror. 

   

 

 

 

            

But  those  things,  I  would  submit,  are  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

really  valid  in  terms  of  ­­ in  terms  of  the  reasons, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  reasons  they  gave  here,  many  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrably  false  and  not  supported  by  the  evidence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including  reasons  they  gave  about  Ms.  Garrett.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  inconsistent,  some  were  completely  incredible,  and

they  applied  to  white  jurors  ­­ some  of  these  reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  to  white  jurors  who  had  the  same  characteristics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  African­Americans  who  were  struck. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  lastly,  and  what's  so  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Miller­El,  they  didn't  question  the  jurors  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reasons  for  striking  them.  They  gave  reasons  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

striking,  and  one  question  would  have  cleared  up  some  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these.  And  Miller­El  says  that  the  failure  to  engage  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  meaningful  voir  dire  about  whatever  your  reason  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  evidence  suggesting  that  the  explanation  is  a  sham

that  where  the  peremptory  strike  was  shown  to  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivated  in  substantial  part  by  race,  that  it  could  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  sustained.  And  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ I  ­­ I  would  suggest 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  you,  it  shouldn't  even  really  say  substantial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  if  this  Court,  as  it  said  so  many  times,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged  in  unceasing  efforts  to  end  race  discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  criminal  courts,  then  a  strike  that  ­­ strikes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivated  by  race  cannot  be  tolerable. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  of  course,  as  ­­ as  pointed  out  here  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ in  the  amici,  this  is  a  serious  problem,  not  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case,  but  in  other  cases  where  people  come  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  with  their  canned  reasons  and  just  read  them  off. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  happened  in  this  case,  where  one  of  the  reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  given  was  just  taken  verbatim  out  of  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

two 

of  the  reasons  given  were  taken  verbatim  out  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reported  case.  So  you  don't  have  the  reason  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer  in  this  case.  He  said  my  personal  preference. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  wasn't  his  personal  preference.  It  was  the  personal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preference  of  some  U.S.  attorney  in  Mississippi  who  gave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  reason,  and  then  it  was  upheld  on  appeal  by  ­­ by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fifth  Circuit. 

 

 

            

But  I  ­­ we  would  suggest  that  the  standard

Justice  Sotomayor's  question  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ if  the  prosecutor 

  

 

 

 

 

argues  a  laundry  list  of  reasons  for  striking  the  black 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juror  and  some  of  those  are  reasonable  and  some  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implausible,  how  should  the  Court  approach  the  Batson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis? 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  I  think  the  Court  looks  at 

    

 

 

 

 

 

which  reasons  are  pretextual.  I  think  the  fact  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  laundry  list  suggests  in  and  of  itself  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  should  scrutinize  the  reasons  very  carefully, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  suspect  of  the  reasons.  Because  otherwise, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  Court  is  going  to  do  is  just  simply  encourage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutors  or  any  party  in  a  case,  since  Batson  applies 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  everyone  ­­ is  going  to  encourage  a  party  to  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  as  many  reasons  as  possible  and  hope  that  one  will

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Don't  you  think  this  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  a  case­by­case  thing?  Suppose  there's  one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

reason  that's  a  killer  reason?  Like  this  ­­ this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

individual  has  numerous  prior  felony  convictions,  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  And  then  the  prosecutor  says  in  addition,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ this  person  didn't  ­­ he  looked  down  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

floor  in  answering  the  questions  and  didn't  seem  to

questions. 

            

So  under  a  circumstance  like  that,  couldn't 

   

 

 

 

 

the  Court  say,  well,  the  one  ­­ there's  one  reason  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  ­­ that  is  clearly  a  justification  for  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peremptory  strike?  We  don't  have  to  determine  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  evidence  that  the  person  was  looking  down  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

floor. 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Well,  of  course,  Batson  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  subsequent  cases  say,  you  look  at  all  relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  It  may  be  if  all  the  circumstances  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  there,  the  ones  you  said,  then  you  would  come  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  that  of  those  two  reasons  that  there  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid  reason. 

 

            

But  I  would  suggest  that  where  you  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

indicia  like  we  have  here,  I  mean,  we  have  an  arsenal  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

smoking  guns  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  A  lot  of  those  smoking  guns 

    

 

 

 

 

 

were  in  the  original  decisions  by  ­­ by  the  Georgia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts.  It  seems  to  me  what  ­­ what  you  would  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish  to  reverse  the  Georgia  courts  is  that  the  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

smoking  gun,  assuming  that  all  the  rest  were  not  enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  demonstrate  a  Batson  violation  ­­ the  new  smoking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

guns  would  tip  the  scale.  Isn't  ­­ isn't  that  the

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ that  the  Georgia  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  BRIGHT:  When  the  ­­ when  the  new 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

decided? 

            

smoking  gun  tells  you  that  the  prosecutor  misrepresented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  and  gave  reasons  that  were  absolutely  false, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrably  false  reasons,  and  those  are  not  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before,  but  you  have  that  now,  I  mean,  Batson  turns  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  feasibility  of  the  reasons.  It  turns  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credibility  of  the  prosecutor. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yes,  but  all  ­­ all  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  ­­ and  you  seem  to  be  agreeing  ­­ is  that  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  overall  Batson  judgment  that's  before  us  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  the  judgment  that  the  ­­ that  the  new  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  not  suffice  to  create  a  Batson  violation  where  none 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existed  before. 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  No.  Our  position  is  that  when 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  look  at  the  new  evidence  with  all  the  evidence  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial,  that  all  relevant  circumstances  considered 

 

 

 

 

 

together,  considering  that  a  lot  of  these  reasons  we  now 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  from  the  notes,  we  now  know  from  the  notes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  misrepresentations  with  regard  to  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons. 

              

I  mean,  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court  ­­ just  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  example,  Justice  Scalia  ­­ upheld  the  strike  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Garrett  on  two  bases:  That  she  was  a  social  worker

and  that  her  cousin  had  been  arrested  for  drugs.  She 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  a  social  worker,  and  secondly,  the  prosecutor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  find  out  until  after  trial  about  her  cousin's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrest,  so  it  couldn't  have  possibly  been  a  reason  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  strike. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Are  you  saying  in  answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  Justice  Scalia  that  when  you  had  the  notes,  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notes  cast  doubt  on  some  of  the  prosecutor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justifications  in  the  first  round? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  They  ­­ they  do  that,  and  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  show  misrepresentations  to  the  court,  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  an  overarching  goal  of  separating  out  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  citizens,  treating  them  differently  and 

 

 

 

 

 

then  putting  them  on  this  list  of  "Definite  NOs." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  Mr.  Bright,  just  to  make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  I  understand,  all  the  notes  in  the  prosecutor's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

files  were  new;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  New.  New  to  this  case,  yes. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes.  Okay. 

  

  

 

MR.  BRIGHT:  And  there  were  three  people: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It  just  involved  the  two  prosecutors  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigator  who  put  those  together. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

I'd  like  to  reserve  the  balance  of  my  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  BETH  A.  BURTON 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

              

I  believe  there  are  two  important  factors  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  when  reviewing  the  entirety  of  the  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  is  Petitioner  bears  the  burden  of  establishing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  ­­ I'll  ask  you  as 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

well  to  address  the  certiorari  question  first. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  And  ­­ and  respectfully,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

disagree  with  Petitioner's  counsel  on  this  issue.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  Norfolk  &  Western  Railway  v.  Hiles,  which  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  opinion,  indicates  that  ­­ or  states  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  there  is  an  issue  raised  in  the  lower  court  and  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  in  the  State's  highest  court,  in  this  case,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Georgia  Supreme  Court,  but  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denies  discretionary  review,  then  it  is  before  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  on  certiorari  from  the  lower  court.  So  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  the  problem  is  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  this  is  discretionary  review.  The  Eleventh 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  found  it's  not  under  Georgia  law.  Read  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion.  It  seems  pretty  grounded  in  the  stated  law  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Georgia. 

            

MS.  BURTON:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  and  that  is  ­­

that's  a  pretty  hot­button  issue  I  know  right  now  in  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  Federal  courts  in  Georgia.  But  our  position  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ in  that  ­­ those  cases  and  in  ­­ I  think  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  case  before  this  Court  on  rehearing  on  that  same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  ­­ is  that  Georgia  statute  ­­ the  Georgia  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  says  that  is  a  discretionary  appeal.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

1975  Habeas  Corpus  Act  made  it  a  discretionary  appeal,  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  because  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court  was  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  inundated  with  appeal  after  appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  has  the  Georgia  Supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court  ever  ­­ ever  said  anything  one  way  or  the  other  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  whether  it's  discretionary  or  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  In  two  of  their  cases,  Reed  v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hopper,  which  is  219  S.E.2d  409,  and  Smith  v.  Nichols, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  270  S.E.2d  550,  1999.  They  both  state  those  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary.  But  they  have  not  ­­ they  have  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answered  a  ­­ a  certified  question  on  that  issue. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  give  me  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Reed  v.  ­­ what? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  219  S.E.2d 

  

  

 

 

 

 

409.  That's  a  1975  case. 

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Are  certified  questions 

  

 

 

 

available  in  Georgia?  Could  ­­ could  we  certify  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  to  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court?

opinion,  is  the  Georgia  statute  that  says  that  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  you  just  held  do  not  govern  this  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  I  believe  it's  ­­ and  ­­ and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct.  I  ­­ I'm  certainly  open  to  correction. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

19­14­52  states  that  State  habeas  is  taken  out  of  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals,  which  are  normally  directly  appeals,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner  appeals,  and  they  are  discretionary. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Thank  you. 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  I  ­­ I  suppose 

   

   

  

 

that  ­­ that  ­­ that  a  court  could  have  a  discretionary 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  but  could  provide  by  rule  that,  in  the  exercise  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  discretion,  we  will  grant  any  of  these  unless  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patently  wrong. 

 

            

Could  ­­ couldn't  ­­ and  ­­ is  ­­ maybe

cases  of  a  certain  court,  does  ­­ does  the  taking  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  cases  still  remain  discretionary? 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  a  nice  question,  isn't  it? 

   

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MS.  BURTON:  I  think  the  ­­ I  think  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

taking  of  the  case  does  remain  discretionary.  If  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  it  has  arguable  merit,  it  is  discretionary.  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  two  cases  I  cited  specifically  reference  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  why  would  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You've  ­­ you've  just 

  

 

 

 

 

decided  that  you  will  uniformly  exercise  your  discretion

MS.  BURTON:  Correct.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  ­­ but  I  ­­ maybe  I'm

there  is  no  such  uniform  determination  that  they  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  their  discretion  in  a  certain  way,  that  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  insisting  upon  their  discretion  being  discretionary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is  that  correct?

MS.  BURTON:  That  is  ­­ that  is  my

confused  I  can't  even  ­­

   

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  State  habeas  process 

  

 

 

 

 

is  different  than  the  regular  appeal  process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  On  the  regular  appeal 

  

 

 

 

 

process,  they  look  at  each  case  ­­ each  case  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion. 

            

MS.  BURTON:  On  a  direct  appeal  process, 

   

  

 

 

 

it  ­­ it  ­­ and  certainly  a  capital  case,  it  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  review. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.  In  State  habeas 

  

  

 

 

 

they  have  a  rule,  an  internal  rule  that  says,  we'll  take 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  habeas  case  unless  it's  ­­ has  no  arguable  merit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

MS.  BURTON:  I  ­­ if  I  may  rephrase:  I 

    

   

  

 

 

 

think  the  rule  says  that  they  will  take  a  case  if  it  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguable  merit.  Generally  they  would  not  take  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  In  the  positive. 

  

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  Right,  right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what  would  lend  us  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  that  they  didn't  look  at  the  merits  and  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  no  arguable  merit?  That  they  just  said,  we're

too  busy.  We  don't  care  if  there  is  arguable  merit. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Do  you  believe  they  did  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  BURTON:  I  would  never  ­­ I  would  never 

    

   

 

 

 

 

say  they  were  too  busy  to  take  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  What? 

  

  

 

 

MS.  BURTON:  But  ­­ I  said  I  would  never  say 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

they  were  too  ­­ that  that  would  be  the  reason. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  they  would  say,  we've  looked  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  ­­ because  they  do  have  the  records  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  ­­ and  we  don't  see  arguable  merit  to  take  this  up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  that  is  a  decision  on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  merits.  There  is  no  arguable  merits. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  I  think  it  is  a  fine  ­­ there 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  no  arguable  merit  to  the  application  that  there  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  error  below. 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Okay. 

  

 

MS.  BURTON:  If  that  makes  it  any  clearer. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Now  it's  clear. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  in  your  view,  cert

both  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court  and  in  the  Eleventh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit? 

            

MS.  BURTON:  It  is  ­­ it  is  currently  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eleventh  Circuit.  I  don't  believe  we  have  a  case 

    

   

 

 

 

 

pending  now  in  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court  on  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  issue.  But  I  ­­ I  do  believe  it's  up  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  an  issue  up  here  in  a  case,  Jones  v.  Chatman, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  is  they've  asked  for  rehearing  on  the  issue  ­­

certify  the  question  to  the  Supreme  Court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  We  would  certainly  like  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer  from  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court  on  that  issue.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­ I  think  the  Eleventh  Circuit  would  like  that

Okay. 

            

Look.  You  have  a  lot  of  new  information 

   

  

 

 

 

 

here  from  these  files  that  suggests  that  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutors  were  doing  was  looking  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  prospective  jurors  as  a  group,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

they  had  basically  said,  we  don't  want  any  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  Here  is  the  one  we  want  if  we  really  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  one.  But  that  there  ­­ the  ­­ all  the  evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests  a  kind  of  singling  out,  which  is  the  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

antithesis  of  the  Batson  rule. 

 

 

 

 

            

So,  you  know,  I  mean  ­­ well,  isn't  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  ­­ I'm  just  going  to  ask  you:  Isn't  this  as  clear  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Batson  violation  as  a  court  is  ever  going  to  see? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  I  don't  think  it  is.  And  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

think,  because  these  notes  that  we  have,  they  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermine  any  of  the  findings  that  were  given  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor  in  his  strikes,  particularly  of  Mr.  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Hood  and  Ms.  Garrett. 

 

 

 

 

            

They  certainly  can  be  interpreted  in  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways.  In  ­­ in  our  response  brief  to  this  Court  ­­ we

highlights  are  there.  There  is  a  reasonable 

   

  

 

 

 

explanation,  just  as  Mr.  Foster  is  given  speculation  in

this  case  is,  four  months  prior  to  trial,  as  was

a  motion  and  says,  the  strike  of  any  black  juror,  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  a  Batson  challenge.  Two  weeks  prior  to  trial,  he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  ­­ he  files  a  motion  and  says,  I'm  ­­ there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial  disparity  in  179  jurors.  And  that's  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  list  that's  challenged,  the  179.  There  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial  disparity  of  black  prospective  jurors  on  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list. 

            

The  day  of  trial,  he  re­files  that.  So  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  more  surprised,  quite  frankly,  if  there  wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  sort  of  highlighting,  or  if  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  In  other  words,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

argument  you're  making  here  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  BURTON:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ is  that  ­­ is  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  he  highlighted  all  the  black  jurors  in  green  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thus  said  black  ­­ what  about  the  black  jurors  and  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  these  different  things  was  because  he  was  preparing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  defense  in  case  of  a  Batson  challenge. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  Correct.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  Now,  if  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

correct,  why  this  is  ­­ is  this  the  first  ­­ is  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  this  argument  made  before  your  main  brief  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

            

Yes  or  no? 

 

 

            

and  ­­

 

            

            

MS.  BURTON:  And  it  was  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER?  It's  been  several  years. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  BURTON:  And  it  was  not.  And  that's  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  was  not. 

  

 

 

 

So  if  that  had  been  his  real  reason,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  it  a  little  surprising  that  he  never  thought  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ or  didn't  tell  anybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until  you  raise  this  argument  in  your  main  brief? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  And  ­­ and  I  ­­ I  would  ­­ I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  say  that's  on  State  habeas  counsel.  We  relied  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  res  judicata  bar  throughout  State  habeas;  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  that,  basically  defended  the  factual  findings  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  habeas. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  It  seems  to  me 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  two  arguments. 

 

 

 

            

One  is  this  argument  that  he  never  thought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of,  apparently,  or  at  least  never  thought  to  tell  you

until  quite  recently.  And  the  other,  after  years,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  it's  hard  to  believe  that's  his  real  reason. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  there's  the  second  argument  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  about  40  different  reasons.  And  at  least  some  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  could  be  valid.  Okay. 

  

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  my  grandson  tells  me,  I  don't  want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  watch  ­­ I  don't  want  to  do  my  homework  tonight  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7:00  because  I'm  just  so  tired.  And  besides,  I  promised 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  friend  I'd  play  basketball.  And  besides  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  great  program  on  television.  And  besides 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that,  you  know,  I  really  ­­ my  stomach  is  upset,  but  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  eat  spaghetti.  And  so  he's  now  given  me  five 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  reasons. 

 

            

            

What  do  I  think  of  those  reasons? 

   

 

 

 

 

MS.  BURTON:  Well,  in  this  case  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  I  think  this  is  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  One  may  be  valid. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  BURTON:  Correct,  and  the  other  ones 

  

 

 

 

 

 

also  may  be  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Which  one? 

  

 

 

MS.  BURTON:  Well,  they  all  may  be  valid, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  they  all  may  not  be  as  strong  as  ­­ as  the  ­­ as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  one.  But  in  this  case,  I  think  the  important 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  wait.  The  point  is

he  gave  40  different  reasons.  And  the  very  fact  that  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  40  different  reasons  ­­ and  many  of  them  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­contradictory,  obviously  not  applicable,  totally 

 

 

 

 

different  from  ­­ you  know,  that's  why  I  used  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grandchild's  analogy.  All  right? 

  

 

 

            

And  so  I  would  say  my  answer  to  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

grandchild  is,  look,  you're  not  too  tired  to  do  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

homework.  And  I  think  any  reasonable  person  looking  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  would  say,  no,  his  reason  was  a  purpose  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminate  on  the  basis  of  race. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Now,  tell  me  why  I'm  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  BURTON:  I  think  because  you  have  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  time  period  this  was  done.  This  was  done 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  ­­ you  know,  a  year  after  Batson  came  out.  And  even 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout  the  transcript,  people  ­­ defense  counsel  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prosecutor  says,  we're  ­­ we  don't  really  know  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Batson  is  going. 

 

 

            

So  in  this  case,  the  prosecutor,  dealing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  Batson  for  the  first  time,  the  first  time  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  anybody  has  had  to  put  strikes  on  the  record. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  he's  simply  wrong.  He 

  

  

 

 

 

 

puts  down,  if  it  comes  ­­ if  it  comes  down  to  having  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pick  one  of  the  black  jurors  ­­ was  it  Ms.  Garrett?  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  be  okay. 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  And  that's  ­­ that's  Mr.  Lundy.

That's  the  investigator. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  it  ­­ it  ­­ it  ­­ well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  that  seems  to  me  to  undercut  the  argument,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  just  feeling  their  way  and  so  forth.  They've  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've  made  a  mistake  ­­ they've  made  a  mistake  of  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Batson.  Sure  it  was  new;  but  they're  wrong. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  Well,  first  let  me  say,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  there  was  a  laundry  list  because  he  was  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

espousing  every  reason  he  had.  But  with  regard  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Lundy's,  notes,  and  that  was  the  investigator  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  if  we  have  to  choose  a  black  juror,  she  may  be  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best  one. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Who  was  responsible  for 

  

 

 

 

 

the  definite  no  list? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  The  definite  no  list,  nobody  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  person  that  was  asked  about  that  was  Mr.  Lundy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  was  deposed  and  said  he  could  not  identify  who  wrote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  list.  So  we  don't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  There  are  only  three 

  

 

 

 

 

possible  choices. 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  We  ­­ right.  We  know  it  came

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  it  ­­ and  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exists  ­­ the  paper  exists.  It  says  "Definite  NO."

that  is  ­­ I  don't  think  that  was  a  ranking  of  jurors, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  when  you  look,  they  did  score  jurors  throughout. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  there  were  five 

  

 

 

 

 

African­American  jurors  ­­

 

 

            

            

MS.  BURTON:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ on  the  definite  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

well,  one  of  them  was  Garrett  ­­ this  ­­ as  was  pointed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out.  They  said,  if  we  have  to  have  one,  let  it  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Garrett.  But  Garrett  then  shows  up  on  the  definite  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list. 

            

            

MS.  BURTON:  Correct.  And  ­­

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Were  we  told  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

only  three  people  who  did  the  investigation  on  Batson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  the  two  prosecutors  on  the  case  and  Mr.  Lundy?  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  Mr.  Lundy  says  I  didn't  make  that  list,  it  has  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  the  two  prosecutors. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  It  has  to  be  one  of  the  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutors,  and  one  was  not  there  on  the  day  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

struck  ­­ the  jury  was  struck;  only  Mr.  Lanier  was.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  that's  not  Mr.  Lanier's  thought  process  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definite  ­­ this  definite  no  list  ­­ and  I  don't  see

Mr.  Hood  or  Ms.  Garrett.

false  statement.  The  reason  that's  given  ­­ one  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  for  Garrett's  being  struck  is  that  her  cousin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  arrested.  But  then  the  prosecutor  doesn't  know  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  time  of  the  voir  dire.  He  doesn't  know  until 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  the  voir  dire  that  the  cousin  was  arrested.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  could  it  possibly  be  a  reason  at  the  time  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voir  dire? 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  And  I  don't  think  the  record 

   

  

 

 

 

 

bears  that  out.  These  notes  ­­ the  highlighted  notes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Petitioner  wants  to  say,  these  were  used  during 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voir  dire,  these  were  using  during  the  strikes,  in  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notes  ­­ and  this  is  at  Joint  Appendix  page  256  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Angela  is  written  out  beside  Ms.  Garrett's  name.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Lundy's  notes  where  he  said  he  wrote  down  things  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew  prior  to  the  strikes,  prior  to  voir  dire  of  what  he

the  overall  theme  was,  we  don't  want  younger  jurors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  looking  for  older  jurors  closer  to  the  age  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim,  age  79. 

 

 

            

So  I  think  ­­ you  know,  maybe  ­­ I  know  it's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  ­­ not  the  most  articulate  framing  of  it,  but  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  more  of  a  generational,  she  was  younger.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  the  age,  I  don't  think  was  a  make­or­break  factor. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Working  at  Head  Start  with  underprivileged  children,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make­or­break  factor;  a  similarly  situated  white  juror 

   

 

 

 

 

also  struck  for  that  same  purpose. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  ­­ but  Ms.  Burton,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  wouldn't  you  agree,  in  a  lot  of  these  Batson 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  you'll  have  purported  justifications,  which  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  support  a  valid  peremptory  strike,  right?  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  the  question  for  a  court  is,  well,  but  did  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support  this  valid  peremptory  strike?  In  other  words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  was  the  prosecutor  thinking?  Batson  is  a  rule 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

about  purposeful  discrimination,  about  intent. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  it  doesn't  really  matter  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  have  been  a  bunch  of  valid  reasons  out  there,  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ if  it  was  clear  that  the  prosecutor  was  thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  race. 

 

            

            

You  agree  with  that,  right? 

 

 

 

 

MS.  BURTON:  I  think  if  his  intent  was  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

strike  based  on  race.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes,  if  his  intent  was  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

strike  based  on  race,  it  doesn't  matter  that  he  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  had  a  different  intent  that  would  have  supported  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  peremptory  strike.  And  so  the  question  of  whether, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  someone  or  other  might  have  been  properly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

struck  by  ­­ by  a  prosecutor  isn't  really  the  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  question  is  on  the  total  amount  of  evidence  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us,  including  all  these  prosecutors'  notes,  what  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  on  with  respect  to  each  of  these  peremptory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strikes. 

            

And  then  you  have  to  deal  with  not  just,  oh, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  could  have  been  this  or  it  could  have  been  that,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  deal  with  all  this  information  that  what  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  was,  was  they  wanted  to  get  the  black  people  off 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury. 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  And  ­­ and  I  don't  think  these 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

notes  show  that.  What  the  notes  show,  again,  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Hood  ­­ Mr.  Hood  and  Ms.  Garrett,  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemporaneous  notes  taken  at  the  time  of  trial  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  of  these  jurors,  are  the  reasons  they  struck  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  there's  no  derogatory  comments  within  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notes.

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It's  sort  of  hard  for  us  to

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  mean,  it's  harder.  It's 

    

  

 

 

 

harder,  not  impossible,  but  harder. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  Justice  Scalia  raises, 

  

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  course,  a  good  point  in  the  mine  run  of  cases, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  not  in  a  case  where  all  the  evidence  of  intentional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination  was  not  before  the  judge  at  the  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  And  ­­ and  again,  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's  ­­ I  don't  think  there's  clear  error  here  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  notes  of  racial  discrimination.  Their  strikes  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sound  as  to  Mr.  Hood.  You  would  not  want  Mr.  Hood  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  regardless  of  his  race,  based  on  his  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  what  ­­ reason  that  he  gives  a  laundry  list,  like  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  may  well  have  been  because  we're  in  1987,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  just  putting  out  everything  you  can  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not  exactly  sure  what  you're  supposed  to  do.

MS.  BURTON:  The  ­­ the  notes  were  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

turned  over  earlier,  although  it  was  brought  up  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion  for  a  new  trial  in  November,  right  after  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  in  1987.  And  the  prosecutor,  Mr.  Lanier,  says,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  ­­ said,  I  will  give  my  notes  to  the  court  to  look 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  en  banc  if  defense  counsel  will  do  the  same. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Defense  counsel  chose  not  to  do  so.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  was  raised  on  appeal  to  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  appeal.  The  Georgia  court  ­­ Georgia  court  found 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  work  product;  it  didn't  have  to  be  turned  over. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  we  got  to  State  habeas  proceedings, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  found  an  open  records  request  under  Georgia  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  they  were  immediately  turned  over.  I  ­­ I  don't 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  was  any  argument  about  it  at  that  point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  did  they  do  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  failure  to  ask  Ms.  Garrett  any  questions  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  that  troubled  the  ­­ troubled,  for  example,  her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cousin's  arrest.  There's  an  assumption  that  she  has  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship  with  this  cousin.  I  have  cousins  who  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  have  been  arrested,  but  I  have  no  idea  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  in  jail.  I  hardly  ­­ I  don't  know  them.  So  ­­

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  he  didn't  ask  any  questions.  Doesn't  that  show 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretext?  I  don't  ­­ I'm  not  going  to  inquire  because 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she  might  get  off  the  hook  on  that.

questions  is  particularly  in  voir  dire  as  to  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  as  to  a  number  of  issues,  I  think  when  you're  in

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  stealing  hubcaps,

about  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  ­­ I  want  to  ask  you  a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

different  question  before  your  time  is  up.  And  I'd  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  to  respond  to  the  question  that  Justice  Alito 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initially  asked. 

 

            

            

MS.  BURTON:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  that  is,  is  there  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  State  ground  here?  Now,  you're  familiar 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  record. 

 

 

            

            

MS.  BURTON:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  I  read  on  page  192  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ of  your  record  the  decision.  And  the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph  supports  your  ­­ the  view  that  you  would  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  hold,  I  think,  that  this  is  based  upon  res  judicata, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  a  State  matter. 

   

 

 

            

And  then  there  is  the  paragraph  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  to  you  on  page  195  and  196  where  the  judge  says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"The  reason  that  I  reach  that  conclusion  is  because  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notes  and  records  submitted  by  Petitioner  failed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrate  purposeful  discrimination  on  the  basis  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  race  was  the  basis."  Okay?  That  sounds  like  Batson 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me. 

 

            

And  then  he  goes  on  to  say,  "And  in  addition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  good  reason  given,  now  or  then."

And  then  he  concludes,  "Accordingly,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

court  finds  the  renewed  Batson  claim  is  without  merit." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  I  read  just  that  paragraph,  I  would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

think  the  reason  that  the  judge  found  in  your  favor  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  decided  the  Batson  claim  in  your  favor.  He  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to.  He  could  have  gone  on  some  other  ground,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  ground  he  did  go  on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  at  worst,  why  isn't  it  ambiguous?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  it  is  ambiguous,  then  why  don't  we  take,  you  know  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  it's  what's  in  the  ­­ Long,  you  know,  all  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  If  it's  ambiguous,  then  aren't  we  required  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume  that  the  judge  went  on  the  Federal  ground?  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  both  Alito's  question.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

what  I  think  is  the  hardest  point  for  you  to  overcome. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  want  to  hear  your  response. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  I  actually  agree  that  it's 

    

 

 

 

 

unclear.  I  think  ­­

    

 

            

isn't  it? 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  that's  the  end  of  it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  BURTON:  It  is  ­­ it  is  the  end  of  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  it's  unclear. 

 

 

 

            

            

The  other  ­­ one  other  issue  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  do  you  think  is  Georgia 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

res  judicata  law? 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  I  think  res  judicata  in  ­­ in

case  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  I  didn't 

    

  

 

 

hear  that.  Then  this  Court? 

  

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  In  ­­ in  ­­ in  this  case,  once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  new  facts  or  new  evidence,  if  the  Court  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  finds  that  they  can  review  the  evidence  anew  and  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  review  is  had,  then  I  think  you  are  beyond  that  bar. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  ­­ I  don't  understand 

    

   

 

 

what  you've  just  said.  Say  it  again. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  BURTON:  Okay. 

  

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MS.  BURTON:  If  you  have  ­­ if  the  issue  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  decided  on  direct  appeal  and  you  cannot  go  back  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ a  superior  court  obviously  can't  overturn  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's  highest  court.  But  when  you  have  new  evidence, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  as  in  this  case,  and  it  is  strong  evidence,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  feels  like  it  has  to  go  ­­ it  has  to  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  evidence  ­­ and  in  this  case  it  did  ­­ then  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  are  beyond  the  res  judicata  bar.

that's  exactly  how  the  decision  is  framed,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  the  decision  talks  about  claims  that  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewable  due  to  res  judicata.  It  lists  many,  many, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  claims,  and  then  it  lists  a  whole  bunch  of  claims 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  procedurally  defaulted.  And  then  this  is  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  section,  the  Batson  issue,  and  it's  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section  that's  with  ­­ with  all  the  other  claims  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  merits  determinations  being  made  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  court  is  very  clear,  first  sentence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  sentence.  First  sentence:  "The  court  finds  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution  did  not  violate  Batson  versus  Kentucky." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Last  sentence:  "On  the  merits  the  person, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the"  ­­ "the"  ­­ "the  Petitioner  loses." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  ­­

 

            

            

            

MS.  BURTON:  As  much  as  I  would  like  it  ­­

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  do  you  make  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement  on  175,  "As  a  preliminary  matter,  this  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

notes  that,  as  cited  by  the  Respondent,  the  following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  are  not  reviewable  based  on  the  doctrine  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

res  judicata"?  And  the  first  one  it  lists  is  the  Batson

anything,  it  is  an  alternate  ruling. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  doesn't  Georgia  have 

  

 

 

 

 

the  rule  ­­ Georgia,  the  supreme  court  has  said,  Georgia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  allows  claims  to  be  revisited  on  habeas  when  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  have  developed  since  the  time  of  the  direct  appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  a  claim  that  is  based  on  facts  that  did  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  exist  at  the  time  of  the  direct  appeal,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  this  case,  is  essentially  a  different  claim.  That's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  Georgia  Supreme  Court  said. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  BURTON:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  New  facts  is  essentially 

  

 

 

 

 

a  different  claim. 

 

 

            

            

MS.  BURTON:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  may  be  right  or  wrong 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  matter  of  conclusion  law,  but  that's  the  law  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Georgia. 

            

MS.  BURTON:  That  is  the  law.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  BURTON.  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

Mr.  Bright,  you  have  two  minutes  remaining. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  STEPHEN  B.  BRIGHT 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRIGHT:  Thank  you.  Very  quickly,  let 

  

  

 

 

 

 

me  first  say  that  with  regard  to  what  Justice  Alito 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quoted  that  it's  just  come  to  our  attention  since  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  of  the  case  that  Ms.  Garrett  cousin  was  arrested. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  was  on  May  the  1st.  That  was  after  the  death 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict  had  been  returned  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Secondly,  if  you  look  at  the  Joint  Appendix 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  page  56  and  57  where  they  give  the  reasons  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

striking  Ms.  Garrett,  there  is  no  mention  of  her  cousin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatsoever  in  there.  That's  the  time  when  she  should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  mentioned,  after  the  strikes  were  made.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet  there  is  no  mention  of  that  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  think  there's  any  way  ­­ and  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

six  months  later,  there  is  a  motion  for  new  trial,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  the  prosecution  is  adding  new  reasons  that  it  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  at  the  Batson  hearing. 

 

 

 

 

            

It's  saying  she  was  a  social  worker.  She 

   

  

 

 

 

 

wasn't  a  social  worker.  It's  saying  her  cousin  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

arrested.  They  didn't  know  that  at  the  time  they  struck 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury.  They  said  she's  low  income,  taking  another

thing  out  of  United  States  v.  Cartlidge.  But  you  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

add  reasons  on  into  perpetuity.  The  reasons  are  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  articulated  in  ­­ in  Miller­El,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor  has  got  to  stand  or  fall  on  the  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With  regard  to  the  questions,  I  ­­ I  just 

   

   

 

 

 

 

want  to  make  one  quick  point  on  that  because  there's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  time.  But  with  regard  to  Ms.  Garrett  and  Martha 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Duncan,  who  were  both  teachers  aides,  who  were  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schools  that  were  literally  right  in  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neighborhood  ­­ Ms.  Duncan  had  kindergarten  students; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Garrett  was  Head  Start  ­­ no  questions:  What  kind 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  children  do  you  have,  Ms.  Duncan? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  Ms.  Duncan,  if  you  look  at  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  also  said  familiarity  with  the  neighborhood. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Garrett  lived,  like,  18  or  20  miles  away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Duncan  lived  200  ­­ her  ­­ her  school  was  250  yards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away,  and  she  lived  a  half­mile  from  the  school. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Both  of  them  answered  that  they  weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

familiar  with  the  area  where  the  victim  lived.  Now  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  more  questions  after  those  answers  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided  a  difference.  But  instead,  Ms.  Garrett  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

treated  as  a  liar,  and  Ms.  Duncan  is  accepted  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  serves  as  a  juror  in  this  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  there  are  other  examples,  with  Mr.  Hood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly,  with  regard  to  the  child.  If  you  had
