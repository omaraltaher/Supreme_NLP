CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS: 

 

 

   

We'll  hear  argument 

 

 

next  this  morning  in  Case  14­940,  Evenwel  v.  Abbott. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Consovoy. 

 

         

 

 

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  WILLIAM  S.  CONSOVOY 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  APPELLANTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

This  appeal  presents  a  fundamental  question. 

   

 

 

 

That  question  is  whether  the  one­person,  one­vote  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affords  eligible  voters  any  reasonable  protection.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

submit  that  the  answer  must  be  yes  under  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions,  and  as  a  consequence,  Appellants  have  stated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

a  claim  under  the  the  Equal  Protection  Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  districts  at  issue  here,  District  1  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

District  4,  have  deviations  as  measured  by  eligible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters  approaching  50  percent  under  any  metric  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  voters.  No  decision  of  this  Court  has  ever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sustained  vote  dilution  of  that  magnitude  under  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­person,  one­vote  case.  Beginning  with  Gray, 

  

 

 

 

 

continuing  to  Wesberry,  through  Reynolds,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  many  decisions  since  then,  the  issue  has  always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  vote  dilution. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  about  the  many  times

the  Court  has  said  that  the  ­­ the  principle  is  equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation  of  the  population?  And  we  have  had  now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  half  a  century,  population  ­­ that  the  population  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  legitimate  standard.  We  have  never  held  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  contrary. 

 

            

So  we  have  the  States  overwhelmingly  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  a  century  using  population  as  shown  in  the  census, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  now  you're  saying  they  can't  do  that  anymore. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  I  can  answer  the  question 

    

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  three  different  ways. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  with  respect  to  the  phrase  "equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation  for  equal  numbers  of  people."  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  originated  in  Wesberry.  But  that's  only  half 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sentence.  There's  a  dash,  and  it  continues: 

   

  

 

 

 

 

"Therefore,  for  us  to  hold  that  within  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislatures  may  draw  the  lines  of  congressional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  in  such  a  way  as  to  give  some  voters  a  greater 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voice  in  choosing  a  congressman  than  others  would  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional." 

            

And  in  fact,  in  every  time  the  Court  uses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  phrase,  which  is  the  only  one,  I  believe,  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friends  rely  on,  it  is  either  within  the  same  sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  bracketed  on  one  side  or  the  other  by  protection  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters. 

            

Now,  as  to  tradition,  to  ­­ actually,  to  the

word  "population,"  we  don't  ­­ we  ­­ we  see  that  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  the  question,  not  answering  it.  Burns  explains 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Reynolds  used  population  without  distinguishing. 

 

 

 

 

 

Burns  itself  reserved  on  the  question.  Hadley  confirms 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Burns  reserved  on  it.  And  here  we  are  today. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  thought  ­­ I  thought 

    

   

 

 

Burns  said  it  approved  a  deviation  from  population  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  took  great  pains  to  say,  we're  not  saying  you  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  that  in  every  case.  Burns  seems  to  be  the  only  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  case  that  you  have,  and  Burns  involved  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  peculiar  situation  of  Hawaii  with  a  tremendous 

   

 

 

 

 

 

military  temporary  population. 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  I  ­­ I  read  Burns  as 

    

   

 

 

 

reserving  on  it  completely,  to  not  choose  one  way  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.  It  certainly  did  say  that  you  do  not  have  to  use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  census  to  draw  districts.  That  supports  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position.  It  certainly  says  that  you  can  protect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  voters.  That  supports  our  position. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  further  back  to  Your  Honor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  tradition,  if  tradition  were  the  rule, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Baker  would  have  come  out  the  other  way.  Before  Baker, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  centuries,  geography  was  the  basis.  And  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  Baker,  as  a  matter  of  jurisdiction,  and  then  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reynolds  as  a  matter  of  ­­ of  equal  protection  law,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tradition  doesn't  trump  the  individual  rights  of  a  voter

to  be  protected. 

 

 

            

And  we  don't  have  to  guess  about  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  know  from  standing.  In  all  of  those  cases, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing  was  predicated  on  the  right  of  the  voter. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  would  be  unusual  if  someone  who  couldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vote  came  to  this  Court  and  says  ­­ said  my  one  ­­ a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child,  for  instance  ­­ my  one­person,  one­vote  rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  violated. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  problem  is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  you're  forgetting  is  the  dual  interest.  There  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voting  interest,  but  there  is  also  a  representation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

interest,  and  it's  that  which  has  led  us  to  ­­ to  accept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  total  population  base  because  States  have  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  discretion  to  figure  out  who  should  be  having  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representational  voice. 

 

            

Burns  made  it  very  clear  that  we  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferring  to  the  State  because  it  had  a  legitimate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  for  its  need. 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ but  Burns  was  in  the  1960s,  when  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picked  total  population  as  a  perfectly  legitimate  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

because  there's  a  representational  need  at  issue  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

well.  Not  just  voting.  A  State  has  to  be  able  to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  ­­ I  think  just  as  the  Federal  government  did  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  ­­ the  legislature  is  protecting  not  just  voters; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  protecting  its  citizens  ­­ or  noncitizens.  The

people  who  live  there. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So  if  I  can  just  clarify: 

   

  

 

 

 

 

It's  not  really  a  representational  interest  that's  being 

   

 

 

 

 

 

claimed  on  the  other  side.  They  ­­ a  non­voter  will 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  ­­ there's  31  senate  districts  in  Texas.  A  non­voter 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  have  one  representative  under  our  rule,  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  have  their  one  representative  under  theirs.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  access  claim  that's  being  made.  That's  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Garza  opinion  from  the  Ninth  Circuit  said. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  it's  not  even  really  an  access  claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  a  diminishing  access  claim.  That's  how  far  from 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

voting  the  interest  on  the  other  side  goes.  It  is  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  we  have  districts  that  are  overpopulated  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­voters,  we  will  have  diminishing  access  to  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative. 

            

We  don't  deny  that  access  is  an  interest, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along  with  county  lines,  along  with  other  interests  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  can  take  into  consideration,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  framework  allows  for  that.  This  is  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  where  we  are  here  complaining  about  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviation  of  15  percent  or  10.1  percent.  We're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaining  about  a  deviation  of  nearly  50  percent.  No 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

interest  such  as  diminishing  access  could  ever  overcome 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  individual  right  of  a  voter  to  an  equal  vote. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  ­­

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Consovoy,  of  course  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

true  that  when  we  apportion  House  members,  we  use  total 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population  as  the  metric.  And  the  question  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  by  your  position  is  why  it  would  be  the  case  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Constitution  requires  something  with  respect  to  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apportionment  that  it  prohibits  with  respect  to  another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Apportionment  and  intrastate 

  

 

 

 

districting  are  fundamentally  different  concerns. 

 

 

 

 

Apportionment  at  the  time  of  Article  I's  framing  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused  on  taxation  issues,  on  giving  States  autonomy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  voter  qualifications.  And  there  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  concern.  That's  why  it  was  a  ­­ the  great 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

compromise. 

            

What  the  Court  held  in  Reynolds,  as  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  equal  protection,  is  that  that  compromise  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justify  this  kind  of  injury. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  don't  have  to  guess  about  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either.  In  ­­ in  Reynolds  Alabama  came  to  the  Court  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  "semi"  we  surrender.  How  about  a  plan  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

mirrors  the  House  precisely?  Every  county  gets  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative,  and  the  rest  is  done  on  a  population 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis.  Not  only  on  a  population  basis.  The  precise 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

formula  used  for  the  House  of  Representatives.  Reynolds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  no.

Reynolds  is  the  reason  they  caved  was  because, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally,  the  Arizona  Constitution  required 

 

 

 

 

total  population.  It's  that  fact  that  they  deviated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  their  own  Constitution  that  led  them  to  court.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  wasn't  a  caving  compelled  by  Federal  law.  It  was

is  that  we  ­­ we  acceded  on  the  ground  that  using  total 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

populations  was  permissible. 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  There's  no  doubt  that 

  

 

 

 

 

Reynolds  thought,  in  that  case,  total  population.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  in  Reynolds  thought  it  was  permissible. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Of  course,  Baker,  the  Tennessee  constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

apportioned  unqualified  voters,  and  there  was  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion  in  Baker  that  that  was  an  additional  problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  Tennessee  constitution. 

 

 

 

            

But  the  fundamental  issue  has  always  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  individual  right.  And  I  think  Gray  is  the  best  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  show  that. 

 

 

            

Gray  is  about  election  for  statewide 

 

 

 

 

 

offices,  so  it  can't  be  a  representational  issue.

There's  going  to  be  one  governor.  That  governor  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone  is  going  to  have  the  same  access  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governor  or  not.  There  are  no  districts. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  yet  Gray  is  the  case  that  establishes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  rule.  Gray  is  the  case  that  says,  voters  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  an  equal  vote.  You  can't  marry  up  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representational  interest  that's  asserted  on  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  with  Gray.  It  doesn't  ­­ it  doesn't  make  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense. 

            

We  also  know  from  ­­ with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  districting,  as  late  as  1969,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kirkpatrick,  the  Court  assumed,  for  purposes  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  that  Missouri  could  district  at  the  congressional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

level  on  the  basis  of  eligible  voters.  So  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  be  fair  to  say  that  this  issue  has  somehow  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clouded  or  decided  by  uses  of  the  words  "population"  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  the  census  in  prior  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I'm  ­­ I'm  sorry.  Did  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  understand  you  to  say  that  you  think  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  House  apportionment  rule  is  not  clear? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  No.  The  ­­ that 

  

  

 

 

 

congressional  districting  intrastate  at  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

level  as  opposed  to  the  State  level. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  ­­ if  1969  Kirkpatrick  v.  Chrysler

only  is  apportionment  required  at  the  Federal  level  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intrastate  congressional  districting.  And  my  point  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ and  they  rely  solely  on  Westbrook  for  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excuse  me  ­­ Wesberry  for  that  proposition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

My  point  is  in  1969  the  Court  flatly 

 

 

 

 

rejected  Wesberry  as  having  decided  that  issue.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  no  decision  of  the  Court  that  resolves  this  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  ­­ it  is  completely  open. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  only  way  to  make  sense  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­person,  one­vote  rule  is  to  make  it  about  eligible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters.  They  are  the  ones  who  have  standing.  They  are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ones  who  can  bring  a  claim.  They  are  the  ones  who 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  injured.  And  not  only  is  that  our  view  and  the  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law's  view,  that  was  ­­ that  was  Congress's  view. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Is  it  your  view  that  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fourteenth  Amendment  means  is  that  in  all  the  years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  ­­ what  was  it?  ­­ 1868  and  1920,  it  was  wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  States  to  include,  for  these  purposes,  women? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  were  not  eligible  voters. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Any  ­­ there  is  no  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  a  problem.  It  was  an  ­­ it  was  an  issue  in  the

that  was  wrong.  I  mean,  in  your  interpretation  of  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourteenth  Amendment  from  1868  until  1920,  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  not  have  been  counting  women  for  ­­ for  purposes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  determining  representation  in  the  State  legislature. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  For  purposes  of  the  ­­ of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Equal  Protection  Clause,  the  one­person,  one­vote  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protects  voters.  If  disenfranchisement  of  women  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

minorities  is  an  issue,  those  cases  could  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought.  Eventually,  that  issue  was  resolved  by  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

country,  as  was  minority  representation. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  Warren  court  in  Reynolds  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accomplishing  several  things.  And  equal  weight  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

voters  has  to  matter.  A  noncitizen  or  any  other 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

disenfranchised  person  would  not  have  the  ability  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring  a  one­person,  one­vote  claim. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes,  but  here  we  have  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  go  back  to  Justice  Kagan's  question.  And  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  something  that  ­­ it  seems  everyone  is  arguing  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  as  if  this  is  an  equal  protection  problem.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly,  the  ­­ Reynolds  v.  Sims  does  deal  with  equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection.  And  it  did  deal  with  instances  in  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters  and  everything  else  were  malapportioned.  So  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  the  court  really  considered  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  you  step  back  from  the  Equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Protection  Clause  and  say  there  are  other  parts  of  the

Constitution  that,  in  fact,  are  relevant  here  ­­ maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  the  Republican  Form  of  Government  Clause.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  that  Justice  Kagan  read  are  words  about  what  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  democracy  people  wanted.  And  those  words  say  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  other  parts  of  the  Constitution,  such  as  those, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  Republican  Form  of  Government,  that  what  we  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  is  the  kind  of  democracy  where  people,  whether  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose  to  vote  or  whether  they  don't  choose  to  vote,  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  receive  a  proportionate  representation  in 

   

 

 

 

 

Congress. 

            

And  if  you  take  that  as  a  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

principle,  that  shows  an  objective  of  some  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clauses  of  the  Constitution.  Then  you  have  to  retreat 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  idea  that  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted  in  Reynolds  v.  Sims,  solves  this  case.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeed,  it  argues  against  you. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So  two  answers. 

  

 

 

 

            

One  is  to  argue  that  this  is  justiciable  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  side  as  a  Guarantee  Clause  claim,  I  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

shows  just  how  far  the  logic  has  to  go  to  come  up  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  on  the  other  side  of  the  ledger  here.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  never  ­­ in  fact,  in  Baker,  the  Court  rejected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Guarantee  Clause  as  a  basis  for  hearing  these  cases. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To  turn  around  now,  and  turn  180  degrees,  so  that  a  ­­ a

MR.  CONSOVOY:  If  I  could  ­­ but  Reynolds,  I

But  second,  the  reason  we  didn't  come  to  a

populations  over  65,000.  Just  on  that  ground  alone, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  going  to  be  districts  that  can't  rely  on  it.

in  Tennant  just  recently,  it's  our  burden  to  bring  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  showing  that  total  population  census  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect  individual  rights. 

 

 

            

We  believe  ­­ at  this  stage,  we  have  alleged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  so  it  has  to  be  taken  as  true.  If  we  can't  prove 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  then  we  have  failed  to  meet  our  burden. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  would  be  a  different  question  if  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Court  held  yes,  the  evidence  you  brought  in  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  to  show  that  your  rights  have  been  violated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  ACS  data,  but  not  sufficient  to  draw  a  new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

map.  Then  I  think  the  Court  is  in  a  very  unusual  place, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  I  think  the  answer  is  we're  back  to  Baker,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  then  become  ­­ that  would  be  the  argument  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissent  in  Baker,  which  is  you  have  a  violation  but  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicially  manageable  way  to  solve  it,  so  now  we're  back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  political  question. 

 

 

            

But  if  I  could  get  back  to  the  fundamental 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise,  which  is  the  ACS  data,  the  ACS  data  ­­ I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor  was  talking  about  the  1­year  ACS  data,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  for  redistricting  used  the  5­year  ACS  data.  That

because  it's  used  in  Section  2  every  day,  and  not  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  vague  and  general  purpose.  Under  Strickland, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

under  Bartlett  against  Strickland,  to  bring  a  successful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2  claim,  you  have  to  show  that  you  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority  of  the  citizen  voting­age  population  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  to  ­­ to  get  through  the  first  factor  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2. 

 

            

That  means  if  there's  50.1  percent  minority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  voters  in  your  district,  you  can  proceed;  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  49.9  percent,  you  cannot.  This  data  is  used  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  that  question. 

 

 

            

If  it  can  do  that  in  every  circuit  court  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  country  ­­ and  in  this  Court's  opinions  in  LULAC  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland  supported  using  this  data  for  that  purpose  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  it  can  do  that,  it  can  bring  a  deviation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  percent  to  somewhere  between  10  and  20. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  don't  want  to  leave  this  abstract.  If 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  look  at  the  Supplemental  Appendix,  the  data  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  in  there.  If  you  turn  to  page  5  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supplemental  Appendix,  there  is  a  column  called  "CVAP" 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  lists  all  of  the  CVAP  numbers  for  every  Texas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Senate  district.  I  would  point  out  that  Texas  asked  for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  numbers  to  draw  this  map.  They  used  CVAP  to  draw 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  map. 

 

            

If  you  pull  those  numbers  and  look  at

District  1,  it  has  557,000  people.  Right  next  to  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  plus  or  minus  with  numbers.  It  says  6,784. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  margin  of  error.  That's  the  margin  of  error 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  CVAP  data. 

 

 

            

So  if  you  took  all  of  those  margins  of  error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  used  them  against  our  position  at  every  turn  ­­ so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  under­populated  district,  assume  up;  for 

 

 

 

 

 

overpopulated  district,  assume  down  ­­ assume  it  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  turn  against  us,  and  you  ran  the  numbers,  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

move  the  deviation  from  47  percent  to  45  percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  is  not  an  issue  about  margin  of  error, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  data.  This  is  not  an  issue  about  the  availability 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  data.  This  data  is  used  if  ­­ by  every  demographer

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Consovoy,  could  I  go

Amendment  explicitly  considered  this  issue,  and,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  made  a  decision. 

   

 

            

So  Senator  Howard,  who  introduces  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  on  behalf  of  the  joint  committee  that  drafts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  talks  about  these  deliberations.  And  he  says  the

satisfactory  basis,  and  that's  the  principle  upon  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Constitution  itself  was  originally  framed,  referring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  the  original  drafting.  And  then  he  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers,  not  voters;  numbers,  not  property;  this  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory  of  the  Constitution. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  this  is  the  theory  of  the  Constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  to  one  thing,  which  is  not  the  thing  that  you  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about.  This  is  the  theory  of  the  Constitution 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  to  House  apportionment. 

 

 

 

            

But  again,  I'll  go  back  to  this  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  is  such  a  clear,  explicit  choice  that  was  made 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  it  meant  to  ­­ to  have  equal  representation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  that  area.  And  how  you  go  from  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  mandated  to  it  being  prohibited  in  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  is  something  that  I  still  can't  quite  work 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

myself  around. 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Justice  Harlan  agreed  with 

  

 

 

 

 

you.  He  did. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That's  a  good  person  to  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

on  the  side  of. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Yes. 

  

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  But  his  ­­ his  position  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected  8­1  in  Reynolds.  Because  that  exact  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  brought  forth  by  Alabama.  They  presented  a  plan

that  was  not  only  somewhat  generally  modeled  on  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apportionment  standard,  it  mirrored  it  exactly.  So  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  are  reasons  why  that's  not  correct  as  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  legal  matter,  because  apportionment  was  concerned 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  many  other  things.  They  wanted  the  States  to  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taxation  basis.  They  wanted  ­­ there  was  an  issue  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffrage,  for  sure.  There  was  an  issue  with  voter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualifications.  It  was  a  complex,  Federalism­based, 

   

  

 

 

sovereignty  comprise  that  does  not  apply  within  a  State. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  can't  do  any  better,  I  apologize,  than  say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Reynolds  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  hear  you  as  to  that  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  apply.  I  mean,  I  guess  I  can  ­­ I  can 

    

   

   

   

 

 

 

understand.  I  might  not  agree  with,  but  I  can 

    

   

 

 

 

 

understand  the  position  that  says  that  the  requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  not  apply.  But  you  are  suggesting  that  we  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  that,  and  to  say,  not  only  does  the  requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  apply,  but  that  States  have  to  do  it  the  exact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite  way. 

 

            

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  So,  two  answers. 

  

 

 

 

We  take  our  cue  on  that  from  the  right  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  supposed  to  be  protected.  It  all  follows  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right,  and  it  starts  with  voting.  We  start  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposition  that  one  person  can't  be  given  two  votes

the  Court  moved  in  Gray  to  say,  well,  you  can't  do  it  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calling  it  weighting  under  some  sort  of  electoral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

college  model.  That's  the  same  thing. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Then  the  third  step  was  you  can't  accomplish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  same  invidious  voter  discrimination  by  drawing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines.  Now  if  you  accept  all  of  that  as  true,  that  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  be  given  five  votes  and  my  neighbor  be  given  one, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  even  if  it  follows  from  the  apportionment  model  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ and  you  defend  it  on  that  basis,  if  it  causes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  injury,  I  have  a  claim.  And  to  say  that  I  don't 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

have  a  claim  because  a  different  constitutional 

   

   

 

 

provision  protects  a  different  right  in  a  different  way, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ we  find,  you  know,  not  a  satisfactory  response 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  which  Reynolds  itself  rejects  ­­ rejects  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument. 

            

And  turning  back  to  Section  2  for  a  moment, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Congress  agreed  with  our  position.  Congress  relied  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reynolds  being  a  vote­dilution  case  to  enact  Section  5, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  only  in  the  Senate  report  that's  been  so  widely  used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  those  cases,  but  in  this  Court's  opinions  as  well,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Perkins  and  in  later  cases.  The  Court  has  held  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  in  Bolden,  both  the  plurality  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Marshall's  dissent,  said  Reynolds  is  about  vote

made,  Justice  Kagan,  about  Section  2.  Section  2  only 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

counts  eligible  voters.  No  one  argues  that  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminating  against  non­voters  by  not  taking  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  consideration.  If  the  Court  were  to  proceed  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  kind  of  representational  model,  we  would  have  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  that  minorities  get  the  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ the  benefit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  under  Section  2,  and  no  protection  for  people  who  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  minority  status  under  one­person,  one­vote.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  ­­ there  is  a  real  fundamental  disconnect  there. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  In  ­­ in  your  view,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  would  have  a  choice  between  the  citizen 

   

 

 

 

 

 

voting­age  population  or  they  could  use  the  registered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters?  Either  one  would  be  okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Well,  we  start  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

proposition  that  Burns  said.  It's  not  the  method  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  you  distribute  legislators  that  count.  It's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribution  of  legislators  that  count. 

 

 

 

 

            

Therefore,  as  Burns  explains,  the  State  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

truly  use  any  metric  that  adequately  and  fairly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distributes  legislators.  We  think  registered  voters  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  ordinarily  going  to  be  the  right  one  for  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons: 

            

Gray  says  those  who  hold  the  one­person, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­vote  right  are  those  who  meet  the  basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualifications  of  voting.  So  there,  registered  voters

run  into  trouble. 

 

 

            

And  then  Burns  essentially  doubles  down  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  argument  by  saying  it  depends  upon  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity. 

            

And  where  we're  drawing  lines  at  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  beginning  of  the  game,  we  shouldn't  make  the  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depend  upon  who  ends  up  deciding  to  enter  the  fray  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose  to  vote. 

 

 

            

So  we  think  the  data  that  we  principally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely  on,  the  ­­ the  ACS  measure  of  citizen  voting­age 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population  is  ordinarily  going  to  be  the  fairest  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  accurate  measure.  But  that's  for  the  legislature 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  decide  when  it  ­­ when  it  reviews  all  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information. 

            

And  the  Texas  legislature  ­­ I  think  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

important  to  keep  in  mind  when  they  drew  this  map,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  everything  that  we're  asking  to  be  done  here.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took  all  of  this  data  ­­ the  total  census  data,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship  data,  the  registered  voter  data,  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precinct  data  ­­ and  they  put  it  all  into  a  computer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  they  drew  their  districts. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  they  used  our  data  to  draw  districts  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  map.  They  just  used  it  to  comply  with  Section  2 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  when  ­­ and  then  closed  their  eyes  and  didn't  want

All  we're  asking  the  legislature  to  do  is

we'll  ever  know  because  they  were  handcuffed  by  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  There  was  an  attorney  general  interpretation  from

eligibility.  It  ­­ so  it's  really  arbitrary  ­­

establish,  as  we  ­­ we  argue  as  a  matter  of  eligible

plenty  of  case  law  that  says  you  can  have  deviations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greater  than  10  percent  ­­ Hawaii  did  ­­ if  you  have  a

representational  need  that  Justice  Kagan  was  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  not  be  an  adequate  reason? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  We  think  it  is  a  ­­ a  reason 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  go  over  10  percent.  That's  ­­ we  do  not  want  the

nothing  more  than  to  bring  them  within  the  10  to

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You're  ­­ you're  now  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're  now  saying  10  to  20  percent  is  okay  instead  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  when  we  use  total  population. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  The  ­­ the  Court  has  up  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held  up  the  16.5  percent,  and  ­­ and  Mahan  20  percent  as

See,  they're  not  voters.  So  suppose  ­­ if  we  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children  out  of  it,  what's  the  deviation? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  We  haven't  examined  it.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

only  examine  on  the  basis  of  eligible  voters.  But

Texas  validly  used  Federal  census  data  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equalize  total  populations  States  have  done  for  decades. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  framers  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  accepted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total  population  as  a  permissible  apportionment  base  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  as  Justice  Kagan

MR.  KELLER:  The  Voting  Rights  Act? 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes. 

  

 

 

MR.  KELLER:  Section  2  of  the  Voting  Rights 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Act  for  tax  voters  ­­ and  our  position,  unlike  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States's  position,  is  that  only  voters  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected  under  the  Voting  Rights  Act.  So  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering  whether  there  is  an  opportunity  to  elect  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

candidate  of  one's  choice,  only  voters  would  count  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  inquiry.  Indeed  I  ­­

   

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it  is  ­­ it  is

designed  to  protect  voters. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  It  does  protect  voters,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  multiple  legitimate  bases  here  on  which  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  can  redistrict.  Electoral  equality  is  one  of

them.  Representational  equality  is  another. 

  

 

 

 

            

And  if  I  can  back  out,  what  we're  dealing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  here  is  the  general  Equal  Protection  Clause's  test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  ­­ it  guards  against  invidious  discrimination. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Court  has  noted  before  a  mere  disparate  impact  does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  violate  the  Constitution.  And  so  really  the  claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  being  alleged  here  is  one  of  invidious  vote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dilution. 

            

But  Texas,  by  using  total  population,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  have  done  for  decades,  and  no  State  today  uses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voter  population,  did  not  invidiously  target  groups  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cancel  out  their  voting  power  or  reduce  their  ability  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elect  representatives  of  their  choice. 

 

 

 

 

            

Rather,  what  Texas  was  doing  was  making  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate  choice  to  use  representational  equality, 

 

 

 

 

 

which,  as  this  Court's  cases  have  noted,  is  a  legitimate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  that  the  State  can  account  for  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting. 

            

What  the  State  cannot  do  is  submerge  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population  principle.  In  other  words,  as  Reynolds  held, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  cannot  base  apportionment  on  geography.  We  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  account  of  population.  And  we  have  done  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  no  allegation  here  that  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.04  percent  deviation  of  total  population  would  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy  the  Court's  one­person,  one­vote  doctrine  unless

we  are  required  to  use  voter  population. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  There  are  at  least  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  that  could  support  your  position.  One  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  one­person,  one­vote,  and  what  counts  is  giving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  person  an  equal  chance  of  affecting  the  outcome  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  election.  But  total  population  figures  are  a  good 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

enough  proxy  for  eligible  voters.  That's  one  possible 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument. 

            

And  that's  ­­ that's  what  the  census 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measures,  and  that's  close  enough. 

 

 

 

 

            

Another  argument  is  that  representational 

 

 

 

 

equality  is  the  real  basis,  and  therefore  that's  why  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  population. 

 

            

So  which  argument  are  you  making? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  I  don't  believe  we're  making 

    

 

 

 

 

either  of  those  arguments,  Justice  Alito. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Total  population  is  not  permissible  because 

 

 

 

 

 

it  tracks  voter  population.  At  the  same  time,  while  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  doesn't  have  to  reach  this  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representational  equality  is  not  the  only  basis  on  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  State  can  redistrict. 

 

 

 

            

It's  our  position  that  we  could  choose  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliable  measure  of  voting­eligible  population  without 

 

 

 

 

 

running  afoul  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guaranteed  against  invidious  discrimination.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It  seems  to  me  that  the  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  are  not  always  consistent.  They  can  be  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

great  conflict. 

 

            

You  can  have  a  situation  if  you  ­­ if  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  equalize  population,  you  may  have  a  situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  cause  great  inequality  in  the  ­­ the  chances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  any  ­­ of  voters  affecting  the  outcome  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

election.  On  the  other  hand,  if  you  choose  eligible 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters  only,  then  you  may  have  a  situation  where  every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  within  two  districts  does  not  have  an  equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation  defined  in  some  way  in  the  legislature. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  don't  think  you  can  just  say,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ you  know,  we  serve  both.  What  do  you  do  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  come  into  conflict? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  I  believe  what  this  Court  said 

    

 

 

 

 

 

in  Burns  is  you  allow  the  States  to  choose  the  theory  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation.  And  indeed,  the  decision  to  include  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclude  non­voters,  Burns  said,  was  left  to  the  States, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  part  of  what  this  Court's  doctrine  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  is  States  need  leeway,  and  that  this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

core  sovereign  function.  It  is  part  of  the  dignity  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  sovereignty  to  be  able  to  structure  elections. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  when  a  ­­ when  a  State  is  choosing 

   

   

 

 

 

 

either  representation  or  equality,  when  the  two  are  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tension,  that's  not  an  illegitimate  basis  upon  which  to

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  if  the  voter 

  

 

 

 

 

population  is  a  permissible  basis  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

Constitution,  I  assume  that's  because  there  is  ­­ is  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ethical,  a  good  government,  a  liberty  interest  in 

   

   

 

 

 

protecting  these  voters.  That's  a  valid  interest, 

   

  

 

 

 

correct? 

            

            

MR.  KELLER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  if  in  a  case  like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this  where  there  is  a  45  percent  deviation,  something  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  order,  then  why  isn't  Texas  required  at  that  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  recognize  that  these  interests  that  are  legitimate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  Constitution,  which  are  voter  based,  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  accommodated,  and  so  that  you  should  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  some  consideration  to  this  disparity  that  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

among  voters? 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  first  off,  the  court  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gaffney  upheld  the  use  of  total  population  while 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognizing  that  there  could  ­­ there  was,  in  New  York 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  least,  a  different  State,  a  29  percent  deviation  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

voter  population.  Yet  the  court  there  said  it  was  quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  that  a  prima  facie  case  in  invidious  discrimination 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  not  been  made  out. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  while  a  State  can,  and  legitimately 

   

 

 

 

 

 

does  consider  both  representational  equality  and

electoral  equality,  the  Equal  Protection  Clause's 

 

 

 

 

 

general  language  doesn't  mandate  that  either  must  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedence  over  the  other. 

 

 

 

            

So  of  course  it  would  be  legitimate  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  to  look  at  that  data.  At  the  same  time,  when  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  Federal  census  data,  which  is  the  most  robust  data 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  available,  it  is  not  invidious  for  Texas  to  use  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enumeration  rather  than  a  different  data  set  when  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reapportions.  And  all  we  have  under  the  census  data  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total  population  data. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  we  have  ­­ and  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  I  think  Justice  Alito's  question  is  important  ­­ is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  table  on  page  9  of  the  Blue  Brief. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

Now,  just  looking  at  that  table,  by 

 

 

 

 

inspection,  I  don't  know  whether  the  true  ­­ whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  true  or  false.  So  I  thought  the  major 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  the  two  here  is  probably  that  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

areas  of  ­­ of  the  State  ­­ there  are  a  lot  of  people 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  are  working  and  they  have  children.  I  mean,  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  all  be  explained  on  the  basis  of  illegal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration  or  something.  It  just  can't  be,  given  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers.  I  don't  think  so. 

    

 

 

            

And  if  we  accept  the  principle  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voter  equality,  we  are  saying  that  the  family  of  two  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  age  that  has  eight  children  or  whatever  is

getting  no  representation  for  those  other  people  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

human  beings.  And  if  we  accept  the  opposite,  we  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  up  with  inequality  of  ­­ of  power  of  voters.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  ­­ you  have  to  say  the  one  or  the  other.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  could  take  your  position  it's  up  to  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  mean,  that  seems  to  me  to  be  what's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  behind  the  numbers  that  he's  ­­ that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  being  quoted,  but  I'm  not  sure.  So  I'd  like  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaction. 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Sure.  Justice  Breyer,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

believe  there's  a  difference  between  diminishing  access 

   

 

 

 

 

to  representatives  and  actually  having  representation. 

 

 

 

 

 

The  United  States  has  said  that  if  Texas  or  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  reapportioned  on  the  basis  of  voter  population, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  non­voters  would  be  invisible  to  the  system. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  not  right.  They  would  still  be  represented. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  issue  is  does  State  ­­ does  a  State  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  the  same  amount  of  constituents  per 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative?  And  a  State  can  do  so.  It's  a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

legitimate  ­­

what  they  had  in  1750  or  something,  where  the  British 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Parliament  said,  well,  don't  worry,  America,  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represented  by  the  people  in  England  because  after  all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  represent  everybody  in  the  British  Empire.

MR.  KELLER:  Which  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean,  that  people  are 

    

 

 

 

 

being  represented  through  somebody  else  is  a  little  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible,  but  tough. 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  for  instance,  a  child  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

my  congressional  district  would  still  be  represented  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  member  of  Congress.  So  the  issue  is  ­­ really  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminishing  access  to  the  representative.  And  while 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  legitimate  basis  for  a  State  to  reapportion 

   

   

 

 

 

 

under,  there  is  no  Equal  Protection  principle  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elevate  that  as  a  rule  of  constitutional  law  that  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  the  Sate  of  Texas  invidiously  discriminated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  why  is  one  option 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  of  the  other?  Why  can't  you  have  both?  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  population  equality  and  voter  equality,  both, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially  when  you  have  indicated  that  a  voter­based 

   

 

 

 

 

 

apportionment  is  ­­ is  valid  and  serves  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes.  And  here  it's  being  completely  ­­ it's  being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  substantially  disregarded  with  this  huge  deviation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why  can't  you  use  both? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  first  of  all,  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been  no  demonstrative  plan  that  was  submitted  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  legislature,  which  has  a  notice­and­comment 

   

 

 

 

procedure  on  this,  or  to  the  district  court,  that  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  these  could  have  been  equalized  within  10  percent.

Indeed,  their  demographer  didn't  specify  the  extent  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  deviations.  Their  demographer  simply  said,  well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  deviations  can  be  reduced. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  Court  were  to  try  to  go  down  the  road 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  requiring  States  to  equalize  within  10  percent  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviation,  both  total  and  voter  population,  States  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inevitably  have  to  disregard  many  other  traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  factors,  like  compactness,  continuity, 

 

 

 

 

keeping  communities  together.  And  that  would  be  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite  of  what  the  Court  has  said  that  States  have  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  context,  which  is  the  leeway  to  structure  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elections  as  part  of  the  core  function  of  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That  sounds  highly 

  

 

 

 

probable  to  me. 

 

 

            

 

 

Has  anything  been  written  on  this,  or  any

this  would  be  practically  feasible.  Indeed,  if  they  had

in  the  litigation. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Do  you  have  any  idea 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  often  this  is  a  problem?  I  mean,  it  is  a  case  that, 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  course,  around  the  country,  people  use  total 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population.  But  it  seems  to  me  that  there  will  be  a  lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  areas  where,  in  terms  of  the  actual  numbers,  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  make  a  difference. 

   

 

 

            

            

Do  you  have  any  idea? 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KELLER:  I  believe  New  York's  amicus 

    

 

 

 

 

brief  suggests  that  in  places  such  as  California, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alaska,  possibly  New  York,  certainly  New  York  City,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  will  absolutely  come  up.  However,  even  ­­

State  had  to  consider  voter  population,  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  the  nature  of  redistricting.

many  of  the  areas  where  it's  a  problem? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  reasons  I  just  suggested  to  Justice  Kennedy,  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  that  would  be  quite  an  onerous  burden  and  change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  nature  of  redistricting.  Could  there  possibly  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  out  there  in  which  a  plan  might  be  able  to  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  a  10  percent  deviation  of  total  population  and  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  deviation  of  the  five­year  rolling  average 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sampling  in  the  American  Community  Survey?  Maybe.  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  aware  of  any  such  scenario. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  to  back  out  to  first  principles,  I  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  that  would  be  a  test  of  invidious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination.  That  would  be  moving  much  further  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  direction  of  a  disparate,  impact­like  test  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  never  fashioned  to  determine  whether  someone's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voting  power  is  being  canceled  out,  or  is  fenced  out  of

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  explain  why 

  

 

 

 

 

the  ACS  ­­ your  adversary  says  ACS  is  fine;  it's  used  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2  and  Section  5.  Why  would  it  be  inappropriate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  use  it  in  ­­ in  deciding  the  impact  on  an  equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voting  analysis?

the  ACS  data  is  reliable  enough  to  hold  the  State  liable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Section  2  of  the  Voting  Rights  Act,  it  would  also 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  reliable  enough  to  use  in  apportionment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  there  could  be  issues  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

granularity  of  the  data.  For  instance,  the  five­year 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

averages.  We  do  get  at  census­block  level,  which  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  five  to  600  to  3,000  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  smaller  you  would  get  for  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

levels,  depending  on  if  you  were  at  a  city  plan  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed  to  our  State  Senate  plan.  There  may  be  issues 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  couldn't  use  the  data  to  get  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent­deviation. 

 

            

But  certainly  in  larger  districts,  like  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  State  Senate  plan,  you  could  use  the  five­year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CVAP  data,  and  you  could  do  that  to  get  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  deviation.  Of  course,  we're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally  compelled  to,  because  as  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  in  Burns,  that  is  up  to  the  States  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choosing  a  legitimate  population  basis. 

   

 

 

            

If  I  could  briefly  address  the 

   

 

 

 

United  States's  argument  on  Section  2  of  the  Voting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights  Act.  We  disagree  on  this  point. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Section  2  of  the  Voting  Rights  Act  does  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect  non­voters.  And  earlier  when  we  discussed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2,  I'd  like  to  return  to  that  to  cite  to  the

Court  the  Persily  amicus  brief  of  page  26,  because  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  this  cuts  against  the  United  States's  theory  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2. 

 

            

Persily  brief  says,  "If  the  minority  group 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  very  low  rates  of  citizenship,  then  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  plan  is  not  to  blame  for  their  lack  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation.  Rather,  their  lack  of  sufficient  voters 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is." 

            

So  the  United  State's  suggestion  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  packing  or  cracking  claims  of  communities  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  nothing  to  do  with  packing  or  cracking  voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blocks,  that  is  an  incorrect  interpretation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2.  It  is  not  consonant  with  the  tax,  and  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  render  Section  2  unconstitutional,  as  not 

   

 

 

 

 

congruent  and  proportional  with  the  right  to  vote  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  being  protected. 

 

 

            

If  the  Court  has  no  further  questions,  thank

of  equal  representation  for  equal  numbers  of  people  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  at  the  heart  of  Reynolds  and  Wesberry.  We  thus  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Texas  was  not  required  to  redistrict  on  the  basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  some  as­yet­undefined  measure  of  voter  population. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

However,  we  disagree  that  the  Court  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  on  to  decide  that  Texas  is  free  in  the  future  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistrict  on  the  basis  of  some  measure  of  population  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voter  population  if  it  so  chooses. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  are,  in  our  view,  at  least  four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  why  voter  population  cannot  be  required. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  is  the  one  mentioned  by  Justice  Kagan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  think  it  would  be  a  very  odd  interpretation  to  say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Constitution  forbids  for  State  legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  what  it  requires  for  congressional 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting. 

            

Second  is  the  very  long  history  of  States  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  States  redistricting  on  a  basis  other  than  ­­ other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  voter  population.  At  the  time  of  the  framing  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  there  were  the  vast  majority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  states  redistricted  on  other­than­voter  population. 

 

 

 

 

 

In  the  wake  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  Congress  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apportionment  acts  required  districting  on  the  basis  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inhabitants.  And,  of  course,  over  the  last  50  years,

States  have  unanimously  redistricted  on  the  basis  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total  population,  not  voter  population. 

 

 

 

 

            

Third  is  the  ­­ is  ­­ are  the  data  problems, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  are  real.  The  ACS  data  has  a  number  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations.  First  of  all,  it  is  not  constitutionally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

required,  unlike  the  census.  It  would  be  very  odd,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  for  the  Court  to  demand,  as  a  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  data  that  does  not  even  have  to  be  collected. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second,  it  does  not  measure  what  the  ­­ what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plaintiffs  suggest  is  required.  It  is  not  a  measure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  voter  eligibility.  CVAP  does  not  include  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen­voting­age  population  data,  for  example,  does 

 

 

 

 

 

not  include  felons.  It  does  not  include  overseas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters.  It  does  not  include  the  mentally  ill.  That 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  data  just  does  not  exist. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  third  with  respect  to  the  data,  picking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  on  Justice  Sotomayor's  point,  the  data  in  the  ACS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  exist  at  the  level  of  granularity,  accuracy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  timeliness  needed  to  redistrict.  To  be  clear,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data  level  does  not  exist  at  the  census  block  level, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  where  districting  happens.  It  is  not  issued  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  timely  basis.  The  census  data  comes  out,  for  example, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  April  2021.  The  ACS  data,  the  five­year  average 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  out  in  December,  and  it  has  data  from  2016  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That's  often  used 

  

 

 

 

 

for  Section  2. 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Your  Honor,  it's  used  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  very  different  purpose  with  respect  to  Section  2.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2  it  is  used  as  one  factor  among  many  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  whether  electoral  opportunity  has  been  ­­ has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  given.  So  it's  used  along  with  ­­ with  population 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data,  voting  data,  turnout  data,  a  whole  variety  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

socioeconomic  factors. 

 

            

That's  very  different  than  this  Court  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  State  and  thousands  of  local  jurisdictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout  the  country  have  to  use  that  data  as  the  sole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure  for  redistricting. 

 

 

            

 

I'd  like  to  then  pick  up  on  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy's  question. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  can  I  ask  you  this? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Who  has  standing  to  bring  a  Reynolds  v.  Sims  claim?  Is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  anybody  who  is  counted  in  the  census? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So  Your  Honor,  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  this  Court  noted  and  reserved  in  Baker  v.  Carr 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  footnote  23.  And  it's  a  question  that  this  Court  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  had  to  resolve  in  the  context  of  Wesberry,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  course  has  the  exact  same  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  think  that  nothing  ­­ not  much  turns  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  because,  as  a  practical  measure,  you  can  get  a  voter.

You  can  always  find  a  voter  in  the  district.  But  let  me 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  why  we  don't  think  it,  sort  of,  is  dispositive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  and  this  goes  to  a  number  of  those  issues  ­­

morning. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Are  you  going  to  tell  me  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  ­­ we've  heard  this 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Are  you  going  to  tell  me  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  standing  or  not? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  We  think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  it  is  ­­ we  think  that  the  ­­ the  better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  is  that  a  non­voter  would  have  standing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

But  I  ­­ here's  why  I  don't  think  it  matters:  Because 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  view  our  position  as  through  either  lens, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  a  representational  lens  in  which  what's 

   

 

 

 

 

happening  is  that  the  Reynolds  v.  Sims  right  is  a  way  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensure  that  all  persons  covered  by  the  Equal  Protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause  who  can't  ­­ even  those  who  cannot  cast  a  ballot

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  But  let  me  explain  why  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  it's  necessary. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  does  it  include  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

those  groups? 

 

            

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  I'm  sorry,  Your  Honor? 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Does  it  include  members  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  those  groups? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So  we  think  it  might,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  don't  think  that  you  have  to  agree  with  that  to  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  way.  Because  we  do  think  that  the  right  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reynolds  is  also  viewed,  as  we  said  on  page  14  of  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  ­­ and  we  think  this  is  important  ­­ as  a  voter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  The  way  to  think  about  this,  as  Reynolds  did, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  to  view  this  as  a  right  ­­ consistent  with  the  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reynolds  thought  about  it,  was  to  say  that,  when  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  twice  the  representatives  in  ­­ twice  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inhabitants  in  a  district,  you  get  half  the  vote. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  Reynolds  said,  picking  up  on 

 

 

 

 

 

Plaintiff's  counsel's  position,  was  that  of  course  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  violate  the  Constitution  to  count  somebody's  vote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  two  or  five  or  ten  times.  But  then  what  it  said  in

the  next  sentence:  "Of  course,  the  effect  of  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative  districting  schemes  which  give  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  representatives  to  unequal  number  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constituents  is  identical."  That  is  exactly  the  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  making  here. 

 

 

            

And  if  I  could  pick  up,  then,  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy's  and  the  Chief  Justice's  point  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  can't  you  do  both. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  reason  is  very  much  ­­ and  we  agree  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  Keller  that  the  problem  with  doing  both  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ it  largely  eliminates  a  State's  flexibility  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal  with  the  traditional  redistricting  factors.  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  are  forced  to  do  is  take  a  large,  for  example,  Anglo 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population  in  one  part  of  the  State  that  has  high 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen  rates  and  pair  it  with  the  situation  where  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  ­­ with  ­­ with  populations  that  have  low 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship  rates  in  another  part  of  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

Or  to  take  an  example  from  the  amicus 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs,  Manhattan  has  9  percent  children.  Brooklyn  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

30  percent.  If  you  have  to  do  both,  what  you're  doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  pairing  people  from  the  ­­ from  part  of  Manhattan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  pairing  them  with  part  of  ­­ of  voters  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brooklyn.  What  ends  up  happening  is  to  do  both  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

level  of  10  percent  is  to  eliminate  a  State's  ability  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  into  account  things  like  political  subdivisions,  to

things  that  this  Court  has  said  is  critical  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting. 

            

 

 

As  to  the  Chief  Justice's  question  about 

 

 

 

 

whether  this  is  a  big  deal  or  not,  or  whether  it's  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"big  deal"  isn't  the  right  word  ­­ whether  it  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  large  practical  effect  ­­ I  would  assume  it's  a  big 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal.  That's  why  we're  here. 

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  ­­ as  to  whether  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  large  practical  effect.  I  think  the  answer  to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  yes. 

 

 

            

What  we're  talking  about  is  not  just  50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  but  thousands  of  jurisdictions  around  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country,  local  jurisdictions,  none  of  whom  use  voter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population  as  a  measure  for  redistricting. 

   

 

 

 

            

What  the  amicus  briefs  show  is  this  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  situation  in  which  things  are  affected  ­­ States 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  affected  where  there  are  citizenship  differences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  citizens  and  noncitizens,  but  that  children 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  are  a  critical  part  of  it.  It's  not  just  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Manhattan  is  9  percent  and  Brooklyn  is  30  percent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

children.  In  Texas,  the  counties  range,  the  amicus 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs  suggest,  from  9  percent  in  some  counties  to  35 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  in  other  counties.  In  Alaska  the  difference

between  rural  and  urban  is  20  percent  children  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  30  ­­ 37  percent  in  another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  is  an  issue  that  is  going  to  affect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  and  local  jurisdictions  throughout  the  country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  local  jurisdictions,  to  be  clear,  don't  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data  at  the  level  and  ­­ at  the  level  in  which  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  would  now  be  requiring  as  a  constitutional  matter. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I'd  like  to  pick  up  on  one  other  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Plaintiff's  counsel  raised,  which  is  that,  in  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view,  it's  quite  unclear  as  to  what  Wesberry  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holds.  We  think  that  that  is  really  a  fundamental 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

misreading  of  Wesberry. 

 

 

            

What  Wesberry  said  was  ­­ the  whole  point  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wesberry  was  that  the  ­­ the  method  of  apportioning  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allocating  representatives  to  the  States  had  to  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  as  the  method  for  allocating  within  districts  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  That  was  the  reason  that  ­­ when  what  Wesberry 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  was  that  the  great  compromise  had  to  be  reflected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  ­­ into  redistricting. 

 

 

 

            

That  principle  in  Wesberry  was  exactly  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  that  then  the  Court  adopted  in  Reynolds, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ what  the  Court  said  in  Reynolds.  It  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wesberry  that  clearly  established  the  fundamental 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  of  representative  government  in  this  country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  one  of  equal  representation  for  equal  numbers  of

people,  without  regard  to  race,  sex,  economic  status,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  of  residence  within  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it  is  precisely  that  same  principle  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wesberry  which  looked  at  the  ­­ looked  at  the  ­­ looked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  framing  and  looked  at  the  discussion  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calculation  of  representatives  at  the  framing,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  at  the  drafting  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took  that  history,  and  then  translated  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Isn't  your  argument  that 

  

 

 

 

 

voters  are  ­­ are  irrelevant? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So  Your  Honor,  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

think  our  argument  is  that  voters  are  irrelevant.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  of  all  ­­ so  a  couple  of  points  on  that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  of  course,  the  question  here  is,  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  has  chosen  to  use  total  population,  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissible?  And  we  think  that  clearly  is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second,  we  don't  think  voters  are  irrelevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  reasons  that  I've  said.  The  ­­ what  Reynolds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  was  ­­ and  the  Reynolds  line  of  cases  was  to  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

total  population  to  vindicate  the  voters'  right.  It  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  voters'  right  ­­ because  Reynolds  understood  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  have  twice  the  inhabitants  in  the  district,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  half  the  ­­ half  the  voice  before  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative.

extreme  case  ­­ I  mean,  your  time  is  going  to  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expire  ­­ an  extreme  case.  And  maybe  this  would  never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  up,  but  what  if  it  did? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Suppose  you  have  a  district  ­­ you  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rural  district,  and  suppose  it's  a  State  where  the  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  total  number  of  ­­ the  total  population  per  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ is  fairly  small.  You  have  a  rural  district  with  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

huge  prison  and  very  few  other  inhabitants.  So  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  have  a  neighboring  district  that  has  no  prison. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  one  district,  you  have  that  10  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  population  are  eligible  voters;  and  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district,  90  percent  of  the  ­­ the  population  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  voters.  That  would  be  okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So  Your  Honor,  two  points 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  response. 

 

            

 

First,  this  Court  has  recognized  ­­ and  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  dispute  ­­ that  census  data  isn't  the  sole  data. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A  State  can  ­­ and  this  Court  approved  it  in  Mahan  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  adjustments  to  census  data  to  more  accurately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capture  actual  residents  in  the  State.  We  think  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  has  been  happening  in  Hawaii,  and  that's  what  Mahan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said. 

            

Remember  in  Mahan,  what  the  State  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  ­­ what  Virginia  had  done  was  count  all  of  the  Navy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personnel  as  home  ported,  which  is  what  the  census  had

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  WILLIAM  S.  CONSOVOY 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  APPELLANTS 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

Justice  Breyer,  to  your  question  about 

 

 

 

 

 

representation  of  children.  If  that  were  the  principle 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Reynolds  against  Sims,  in  a  statewide  election,  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  could  give  five  votes  to  a  family  of  five  and  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vote  to  an  individual. 

 

 

 

            

That  would  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  just  thinking  that  I'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

like  to  know,  before  knowing  whether  this  is  mandatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not,  your  position.  I'd  like  to  know  an  awful  lot 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  I  know  about  who  these  people  are  who  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  represented  on  the  representational  theory,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  are  not  being  represented  on  the  voter  theory.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now  I  don't  know  who  they

MR.  CONSOVOY:  The  data  shows  that  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mix  of  noncitizens,  children,  all  the  categories; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disenfranchised  felons.  It's  a  ­­ it's  a  mix.  There 

   

   

  

  

 

 

are  children  involved,  of  course. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  ­­

 

            

            

But  ­­ but  our  point  is  more  fundamental. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Illegal  immigrants. 

  

 

 

MR.  CONSOVOY:  Some.  But  who  have  not  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

who  the  State  has  chosen  not  to  allow  to  vote.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  can  solve  this  problem  themselves.  These  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  enfranchise  these  people  and  give  them  the  vote. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  States  come  here  to  say  we  do  not  want  them  to  vote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  we  want  them  to  count  for  districting.  That  should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  rejected  by  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

            

Second  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  not  quite 

  

 

 

 

accurate.  For  ­­ for  most  States,  too  many,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disenfranchise  prisoners,  except  for  those  who  come  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  locale,  which  is  quite  rational.  Most  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disenfranchise  the  mentally  ill.  So  how  are  they  ­­ who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else  are  they  going  to  disenfranchise? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CONSOVOY:  I'm  not  suggesting  ­­ we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  suggesting  we  should  choose  for  the  State  who  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow  to  vote.  We  are  ­­ we  are  arguing  that  we  should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  allow  the  States  to  come  to  this  Court  and  argue

that  they  should  get  the  benefit  of  them  counting  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  make  the  choice,  that  is  their  right,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disenfranchise  them. 

 

            

You  cannot  disconnect  this  rule  from  voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  allow  it  to  stand  up.  The  whole  thing  collapses. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wesberry  has  the  famous  sentence  now  that  says  all  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  are  illusory  if  the  right  to  vote  is  taken  away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  ­­ the  authors  of  that  sentence  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  surprised  to  learn  that  the  one­person,  one­vote  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  literally  nothing  to  do  with  voting;  that  you  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  system  that  crowds,  in  31  Senate  districts,  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  voters  but  30  ­­ 30  of  them  into  one,  and  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  other  person  their  own  district.  That  plan  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  sustainable,  absent  some  evidence  of  racial  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  discrimination. 

 

            

The  State  comes  in  to  say  we  know  we  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  it,  but  we'll  never  try.  That's  not  how  one­person, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­vote  works.  The  State­by­State  law  forced 

  

 

 

 

 

themselves  not  to  try  this  by  saying  they  weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  to.  If  they  were  told  by  this  Court  that  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  at  least  ­­ to  your  point,  Justice  Kennedy  ­­ do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both,  they  would  go  back  to  the  drawing  board  and  try. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  they  failed,  they  may  win  that  case.  We  suspect,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  alleged,  so  it  must  be  taken  as  true,  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  do  both.

And  Justice  Kennedy,  it  will  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional  interest  like  districting,  or  county  lines, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  anything  like  that  will  be  ­­ that  will  inhibit  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  political  and  racial  gerrymandering  that  they  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do,  and  that  our  rule,  and  especially  a  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balancing  both,  will  stop  them.  And  we  don't  know  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abstractly;  we  know  that  from  the  case  the  Court  heard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  before  us. 

 

 

            

The  actual  deviations  in  Arizona  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  case  ­­ they  are  claiming  it's  an  8  percent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviation.  On  page  26  of  their  own  jurisdictional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement,  they  concede  that  the  CVAP  deviations  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  percent.  And  in  District  8,  the  district  mostly  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue,  is  underpopulated  by  22  percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  Arizona  had  to  go  back  to  the  drawing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board  with  the  Districting  Commission  and  accommodate  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  voter,  but  at  least  ­­ or  maybe  both,  there  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  no  opportunity  to  engage  in  the  political  and  racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gerrymandering  that  has  come  to  dominate  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  process.  That  would  not  involve  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  those  issues  anymore.  It  would  be  solved 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislatively,  as  they  should. 

 

 

 

            

Section  2  does  not  work  without  this 

   

 

 

 

 

understanding.  As  Justice  Scalia  pointed  out  in  his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissent  in  Chisom  v.  Roemer,  there  is  nothing  to  measure
