CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

first  today  in  Case  No.  14­1504,  Wittman  v.

Mr.  Carvin. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MICHAEL  A.  CARVIN 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  APPELLANTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  sum  total  of  the  alleged  Shaw  violation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  that  the  legislature  treated  black­majority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  3  the  same  way  as  it  treated  the  10 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority­white  districts.  It's  undisputed  that  with 

  

 

 

 

 

respect  to  all  of  those  districts,  they  preserved  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cores  of  the  districts,  and  whatever  minor  injustice  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Is  that  ­­ is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

undisputed?  How  did  they  preserve  the  core  when  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shifted  something  like  180,000  people  around? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right.  Your  Honor,  83  percent 

  

  

 

 

 

 

of  the  prior  occupants  of  District  3  were  in  the  core. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  plaintiff's  alternative  only  had  69,000.  If  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  who  spent  a  minute  doing  redistricting  knows 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  simply  because  they're  63,000  short,  that  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  you're  going  to  move  anywhere  near  63,000.  If  I

may  explain:  For  example,  District  11  in  Virginia  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64,000  short.  They  moved  480,000  people  to  fill  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up.  The  district  directly  adjacent  to  District  3  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

District  2.  That  was  the  most  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Was  there  any  holding 

  

 

 

 

 

that  that  preserved  the  core? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Yes.  Obviously,  they  said  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

core  preservation  was  the  most  important  interpretation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  district  court  found  that  incumbency  protection  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics  were  inarguably  motivating  the  district.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

way  they  were  protecting  incumbents  was  through  core 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preservation.  And  the  key  problem  here  is,  they  never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  that  race  subordinated  incumbency  protection  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics,  or  that  it  was  in  any  way  inconsistent  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  how  can  we  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

politics  when  the  drafter  of  the  plan  ­­ rightly  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrongly,  the  drafter  of  the  plan  represented  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court,  I  haven't  looked  at  partisan  performance.  It  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  one  of  the  factors  I  considered  in  drawing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts.  Now,  we  have  to  take  that.  That's  what  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafter  of  the  plan  said.  He  didn't  take  into  account 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisan  performance. 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  He  said  he  didn't  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisan  performance  statistics.  In  the  face  of  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement,  the  court  found  as  a  fact  that  politics

inarguably  motivated  these  districts.  Every  incumbent 

  

 

 

 

 

was  re­elected  in  the  district.  The  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Politics  motivates  the 

  

 

 

 

change  in  district.  That  is  our  objective.  That  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  seek  to  do,  to  preserve  incumbency  or  whatever. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  May  we  then  use  race  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

move  people  from  one  district  to  another,  simply  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  easiest  way  to  do  it?  We  know  that  this  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ a  race  that  votes  strongly  for  a  particular  party,  so 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  can  use  race  for  this  ultimate  neutral  purpose? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  You  can't  use  race  as  a  proxy, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy,  and  it's  very  important  to  note  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  find  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  The  ­­ the  district  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  your  argument  to  be  that,  so  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

me. 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  perhaps  you  can  correct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  It's  the  difference  between 

  

 

 

 

 

Cromartie  II  and  using  race  as  a  proxy.  Cromartie  II 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells  the  Federal  judiciary  you  can't  use  politics  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proxy  for  race. 

 

 

            

Here,  when  it's  conceded  by  the  plaintiffs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  everything  we  did  made  perfect  sense  if  everybody

in  District  3  was  white,  we  know  that  they  wouldn't  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

led  to  a  dramatic  exodus  of  Democratic  voters  into  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four  adjacent  districts,  all  of  which  had  Republican 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbents,  if  all  of  those  people  were  white.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  since  they  were  pursuing  exactly  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbency  protection  and  political  motivation  with 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  District  3,  they  are  not  somehow  disabled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  doing  that  simply  because  the  predominantly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Democratic  voters  happen  to  be  black. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  did  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  That  is  why  Cromartie  II 

  

 

 

 

 

 

insisted  that  plaintiffs  show,  meet  the  demanded  burden 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  showing,  that's  ­­ race  ­­ traditional  districting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  were  subordinated  to  race  rather  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  do  you  show  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  motive  of  the  legislature  was?  Let's  say  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  of  the  legislators  say  this  is  because  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race  ­­ that's  their  motive  ­­ 10  percent  say  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  partisanship,  and  80  percent  say  nothing  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  What  ­­ what  is  the  motive  of  that  legislature? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right.  I  think  it's  very 

    

  

 

 

 

difficult  to  discern  motive  in  a  multimember  legislative 

   

 

 

 

 

 

body,  which  is  why  this  Court  has  always  looked,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  in  Cromartie  II,  what  are  the  effects?

If,  for  example,  there  was  a  way  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

achieving  the  political  objectives  without  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  racial  composition  of  the  enacted  district,  then  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  simple  as  pie  for  plaintiffs  to  come  in  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  alternative  that  doesn't  rely  on  race  that  achieves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  legitimate  political  objectives,  and  yet 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  in  the  district  court  here  have  proved  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  realteration  of  District  3  which  results  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminution  of  the  black  voting­age  population  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely  contrary  to  the  normal  political  agenda  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  motivating  the  legislature  if  everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  was  white. 

 

 

            

The  plaintiff's  alternative  only  reduced  the 

 

 

 

 

 

BVAP  by  3  percent  to  50  percent,  and  yet  that  converted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  2  with  a  brand­new  Republican  incumbent  from  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

toss­up  district  to  what  plaintiffs  themselves 

 

 

 

 

 

characterize  as  a  heavily  Democratic  district.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

Court's  remedy  demonstrates  that  the  reduction  was  to  45 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent.  And  what  did  that  do?  It  dismantled  entirely 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  3  and  District  4.  It  took  away  about  half  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  it  ­­ but  it  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  3  more  compact. 

   

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  The  only  way  to  make  it  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compact  is  to  split  the  district  in  half.  That  was  the

point  we  are  making. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  this  district  was 

  

 

 

 

 

never  compact  to  start  with. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  mean,  it's  ­­ it's 

    

 

 

 

 

contiguous  only  by  water,  not  by  land. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  it  runs  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

unusual  route. 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  It's  certainly  reasonably 

  

 

 

 

compact  within  the  meaning  of  the  Supreme  Court  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virginia  Supreme  Court's  definition  of  compactness, 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  have  to  look  at  whether  or  not  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserving  the  core  of  the  existing  district  to  assess 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  new  plan  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  ­­ capacity. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ splits  less 

  

 

 

 

districts.  It  ­­ all  of  these  plans  have  their  flaws, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  new  one  at  least  splits  less  districts,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  more  compact  under  traditional  criteria. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  That  is  only  half­accurate, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor.  It  splits  just  as  many  political 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

boundaries,  county  lines,  as  ours  does,  14.  That's  what

It  is  more  compact,  but  I  want  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

re­emphasize,  the  only  way  to  make  it  more  compact  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

split  District  3  in  half  and  to  split  District  4  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

half.  And  what  happens  when  you  do  that?  It  puts 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Representative  Forbes  in  a  60  percent  Democratic 

   

 

 

 

 

district,  and  he  loses  half  of  his  incumbency  advantage. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Worse  still,  the  avowed  purpose  of  splitting  them  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  was  to  create  two  black  opportunity  districts,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  actually  more  race­conscious  than  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  did. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Would  you  spend  a  few 

   

  

 

 

 

minutes  on  whether  this  case  is  moot  or  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  I  understand  it,  the  vast  majority  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  of  the  representatives  who  are  parties  to  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  have  not  been  changed  in  any  meaningful  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Forbes  is  the  only  one  who  had  a  ­­ who  had,  perhaps,  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

live  claim,  but  he's  decided  to  run  in  another  district. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  how  do  we  have  a  live  claim  or  controversy? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Oh,  because  what  they  did  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Representative  Forbes  was  to  severely  hamper  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  ­­ make  impossible  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  he  has  decided  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  run. 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right,  and  that  means  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

injury  is  so  severe  that  it  forced  him  out  of  the

Let's  assume  you  had  paired  two  Republican 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbents,  and  what  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Is  he  going  to  go  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  run  in  the  old  district? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  But  for  the  remedial  order,  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  obviously  be  running  in  District  4.  That's  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  lives,  that's  where  he's  a  16­year  incumbent,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  where  he's  got  a  huge  incumbency  advantage.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  ­­ the  injury  that  they  imposed  on  him  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  4  was  so  severe  it  pushed  him  out. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Plaintiffs  don't  need  to  continue  down  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  doing.  This  Court  has  found  that  the  worst 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  injury  is  when  the  challenge  back  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Are  you  representing 

  

 

 

 

that  if  the  map  goes  back  to  the  enacted  form,  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  one,  that  he  will  run  in  his  old  district? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Absolutely.  He  will  run  in  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

district  that  he  lives  in,  that  he  has  been  reelected  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  16  years,  and  that  he  has  a  huge  incumbency 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advantage,  rather  than  going  to  a  new  district,  where

I  mean,  we  do  have  a  rule  that  ­­ District  A  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegedly  gerrymandered.  Voters  in  District  B  can't 

   

  

 

 

 

challenge  that.  You  have  to  be  a  voter  in  the  district 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  allegedly  gerrymandered.  So  how  is  it  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voter  in  District  4  could  not  bring  a  challenge,  but  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative  of  the  voters  in  District  4  can? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Because  they're  asserting  the 

  

 

 

 

 

constitutional  right.  And  as  this  Court  held  in  Hayes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  these  people  in  adjacent  districts  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured;  they  are  just  not  injured  in  a  way  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cognizable  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  because  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal  right  to  discrimination  has  not  been  validated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  we  are  defendants  appealing  an  adverse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order.  Defendants  appealing  an  adverse  order  never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argue  that  the  adverse  order  violates  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  rights.  They're  arguing  that  it  disrupts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  status  quo  by  changing  the  rules,  and  the  status  quo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  what  they  are  defending. 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  has  made  it  clear  repeatedly,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ASARCO,  Swann,  Electronic  Fittings,  that  obviously,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  remedial  order  puts  the  defendants  in  a  worse 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  than  they  were,  they  have  a  direct  stake  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome  of  the  appeal  and  they  can  appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  rule  were  otherwise,  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg,  no  defendant  could  ever  appeal  an  adverse

order,  because  the  adverse  orders  virtually  never  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged  to  violate  their  rights.  So  it's  precisely  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  sort  of  injury  suffered  by  Representative  Forbes  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  ­­ would  be  suffered  by  an  incumbent  who  lived  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  3. 

 

            

Let's  assume  the  incumbent  in  District  3  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

intervened,  and  they  dropped  the  BVAP  to  30  percent  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  it  a  60  percent  Republican  district.  Is  anyone 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguing  that  that  incumbent  couldn't  challenge  the  order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  severely  hampers  his  or  her  chances  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

re­election,  the  answer  is  clearly  yes.  Since 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Representative  Forbes  in  the  adjacent  district  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffered  precisely  the  same  kind  of  injury,  as  I  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothesized  for  the  incumbent  in  District  3  by  analogy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Hays,  obviously  he  has  standing  to  appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  about  Brat? 

  

 

 

 

 

What  about  Brat? 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  I  could  argue,  Your  Honor,  if  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  that  Brat  and  Wittman,  who  had  seven  and  one, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  had  their  districts  changed  in  a  way.  But  I  must 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

admit,  the  palpable  negative  political  consequences  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

de  minimis  compared  to  that  suffered  by  Representative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Forbes.  So  while  I'm  certainly  not  abandoning  it,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  face  the  reality,  if  you're  not  accepting  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  for  Appellant  Forbes  in  842R,  you  won't  accept

it  for  Brat  and  Wittman  in  one  and  seven. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Normally,  the  defendant  is 

  

 

 

 

 

the  State  in  a  voting  rights  case.  They  are  the  ones 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  have  the  plan  until  someone  attacks  the  plan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These  were  Intervenors  because  they  were  affected.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  you  could  intervene.  Now  the  State's  gone. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm  looking  for  some  kind  of  ­­ of  rule  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  kind  of  workable  standard  such  that  a  new  plan  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  puts  in  would  allow  some  people  in  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  to  remain  to  defend  it,  but  not  everybody.  Or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  you  think  everybody?  I  mean,  after  all,  a  plan  in  a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

smaller  State  that  affects  one  district  and  makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes  likely  affects  people  in  every  district,  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  some  of  them.  Some  people  will  find  it  easier  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  elected,  some  harder.  I  haven't  found  a  case  that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

supports  you,  but  you'll  tell  me  which  one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  I  ­­ I  will  give  you  two.

MR.  CARVIN:  ASARCO  ­­ ASARCO  articulates

suffer  a  threat  to  your  current  injuries  because  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower  court  opinion?  And  the  best  case  is  actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Meese  v.  Keene  in  applying  that  injury  to  hurting  your

MR.  CARVIN:  Meese  v.  Keene,  where  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  that  because  they  had  attached  the  propaganda 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

label  to  this  California  Democratic  legislator's  acid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rain  documentary,  that  hurt  his  chances  for  re­election. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor  General  says,  let's  use  the  word  "reputation." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  true,  but  reputation  was  only  relevant  because  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hurt  his  chances  for  re­election.  If  you  look,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  carefully  at  the  case,  you  will  see  there  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  scintilla  of  evidence  suggesting  that  his  reputation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  harmed. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  ­­

  

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  And  after  all  ­­ I'm  sorry.

between,  let's  say,  the  best  one  is  the  split  district, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  the  one  you  were  just  talking  about,

If  he  has  standing,  who  doesn't? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Well,  the  standard  is  Meese  v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Keene,  and  this  was  the  argument  that  this  California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Democratic  legislature  running  an  acid  rain  documentary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said.  He  said  he's  hurt  for  re­election  because  Ed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Meese  and  the  Reagan  Justice  Department  labelled  it

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But,  I  mean,  in  the  voting 

   

  

 

 

 

 

context,  the  standard  for  saying  that  a  person  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  district  is  hurt  enough  to  be  able  to  maintain  a

MR.  CARVIN:  I  want  to  quibble  that  ­­ with 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  premise,  Justice.  It's  not  that  you  believe  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hurts  you.  It's  that  it's  undisputed  that  it  hurts  you. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  what  it  said  the  evidence  shows. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  ­­ but  I  ­­ but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that's  the  rule.  Do  you  have  a  right  to  claim?  It's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  thing  to  say  I'm  a  voter  and  I've  been  racially 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminated  against.  What  is  the  incumbent  claiming? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  racial  discrimination  against. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  That  the  remedial  order  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hurt  dramatically,  indeed,  irretrievably,  his  chances

legally  recognized  interest.  So  it's  not  just  that  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  have  an  injury­in­fact,  although  you  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  that,  but  that  there  needs  to  be  an  injury  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legally  recognized  interest. 

 

 

            

So  what  is  the  legally  recognized  interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  that  the  ­­ the  legislators  are  banking  on? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  That  he  wants  to  be  elected. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  that's  ­­ that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's,  you  know,  he  wants  to  be  elected.  He  has  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injured­in­fact  in  the  kind  of  practical  ways  we  can  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  for  the  injury.  But  this  other  part  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  really  suggests  that  you  need  a  kind  of  legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  of  your  claim,  and  that's  what  I'm  searching 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  here. 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Well,  two  points:  You  surely 

  

  

 

 

 

 

don't  need  to  show  any  cognizable  right.  Nobody  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing  that  they  have  a  right  to  these  districts.  If, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  appealing  defendants  had  to  show  a  legally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

cognizable  right,  then  nobody  would  be  able  to  appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  are  never  arguing  that  the  adverse  judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprived  them  a  legal  right. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Are  you  saying  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  our  standing  doctrine  which  does  look  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  there  is  a  legally  cognizable  right  is  only  good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  plaintiffs,  and  that  once  the  inquiry  shifts  to  the

defendant,  it  just  completely  drops  out  of  the  picture? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  It  just  recognizes  the  reality 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  difference  between  a  plaintiff  filing  a  complaint 

   

   

 

 

 

challenging  a  State  law  and  the  defendant  who  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defending  the  State  law,  who  is  obviously  not  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argue  that  his  legal  rights  have  been  violated,  he  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  interest  as  the  people  who  are  supposed  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defending  the  State  law,  which  is  he  was  well  benefited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  status  quo  ante,  and  he  has  suffered  direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury­in­fact  because  of  the  alteration  caused  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedial  order.  And  ­­ and  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Justice  Kagan  can  ask  her 

  

 

 

 

 

 

own  question,  but  he  suffered  injury­in­fact  to  what? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  To  his  ability  to  be  reelected. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  same  injury­in­fact  that  was  recognized  in  Meese  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Keene,  Davis  v.  FTC,  and  a  host  of  cases  like  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  they  are  right  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

assert  that  you  have  a  legally  recognized  interest  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  re­elected  without,  I  don't  know,  improper 

   

 

 

 

 

interference  or  something  like  that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Not  having  a  State  entity,  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this  case  a  Federal  entity,  affirmatively  intervene, 

   

 

 

 

 

override  the  sovereign  prerogatives  of  the  State,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create  an  electoral  system  which  substantially 

 

 

 

 

 

diminishes,  indeed  eliminates,  his  chances  for  election.

Why  is  that  not  injury­in­fact?  There  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

injury­in­fact  every  time  this  Court  says  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  wasn't  ­­ I  wasn't  ­­ I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

wasn't  contesting  the  injury­in­fact  requirement.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

think  I  was  ­­ I  was  asking  about  ­­ and  it  really  is  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  ­­ how  this  other  separate  requirement,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  the  invasion  of  ­­ that  has  to  be  to  a  legally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected  interest  applies  in  the  context  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant.  And  you're  just  suggesting  it  drops  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely.  And  I  guess  I'm  suggesting  ­­ I  mean,  I  might 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

be  right,  but  it  seems  odd  that  a  plaintiff  would  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  show  it,  and  a  defendant,  it  ­­ it  just  disappears 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  inquiry. 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  May  I  clarify?  They  need  to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

show  a  legally  cognizable  interest.  What  they  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

have  to  show,  unlike  the  plaintiff,  is  that  legally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cognizable  interest  is  a  protected  Constitutional  or 

   

 

 

 

 

statutory  right. 

 

            

legally  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  would  they  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  the  legally  cognizable 

  

 

 

 

 

interest  is  ­­ just  finish  the  sentence  for  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  That  he  has  been 

  

 

 

 

 

injured­in­fact  and  has  a  direct  stake  in  the  outcome 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  he  wants  to  be  re­elected.

the  legally  cognizable  interest  the  same  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury­in­fact  requirement. 

 

            

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Fair  enough  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I'm  sorry.  Go  ahead. 

  

  

 

 

 

MR.  CARVIN:  Okay.  No,  I  ­­ I  apologize. 

   

   

  

  

 

But  I  ­­ I  do  want  to  make  ­­ eliminate  any  confusion 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  Justice  Kagan. 

 

 

            

Here  is  the  point:  Why  would,  of  all  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harms  in  American  society,  harms  to  re­election  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legally  cognizable?  As  the  Solicitor  General  points 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out,  the  point  of  standing  is  to  keep  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judiciary  in  its  proper  role  ­­ limited  role  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

democracy.  If  two  unelected  judges  have  falsely  altered 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State's  sovereign's  view  of  redistricting,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  the  situation  where  we  would  want  to  find  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  most  cognizable  because  that's  where  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercises  extraordinary  caution  and  extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

abilities.  I  apologize. 

    

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  There  are  two  questions. 

  

 

 

 

 

There's  the  question  injury­in­fact,  which  you've  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about. 

 

            

Now,  on  the  issue  of  legally  cognizable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest,  does  a  member  of  Congress  who  wants  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

re­elected  have  a  legally  cognizable  interest  in  running

in  a  district  that  was  lawfully  enacted  by  the  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature? 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Yes,  he  certainly  does,  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  the  interference  ­­ and  you  have  to  accept  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  for  standing  purposes  ­­ the  improper  interference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Federal  judiciary  into  that  political  thicket, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  harms  him  and  rearranges  the  entire  district,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  injury­in­fact,  and  is  just  the  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  that  this  Court  would  want  to  find  cognizable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  after  all,  it's  most  concerned  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  judiciary  hijacking  the  political  process  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  in  any  other  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Here  ­­ here  is  the  basic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  I  ­­ I  can't  get  the  right  analysis.  Look, 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

normally  a  plaintiff  is  suing  because  somebody  did 

   

 

 

 

 

 

something  to  him.  So  the  defendant  is  the  person  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  it.  And  normally  we're  looking  for  the  standing  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  plaintiff,  and  there  are  all  kinds  of  rules  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  person  who  did  this  to  the  plaintiff  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State.  They're  not  in  it  anymore.  So  what  ­­ of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course  the  ­­ the  difficulty  comes  from  the  fact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  congressmen  aren't  the  people  who  did  it.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  particular  people  aren't  the  ones  who  did  it,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  still  in  the  case.

about  incumbency  protection  generally.

classic  tool  of  political  gerrymandering.  Is  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conceivable  that  ­­ that  paired  incumbents  would  have  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing  to  the  challenge  the  fact  that  a  court  has  put 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  in  the  same  district? 

 

 

 

 

            

Your  Honor  is  recognizing  that  incumbency 

 

 

 

 

 

protection  is  one  of  the  neutral  districting  principles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  different  than  compactness  or  anything  else,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  incumbents  special  factual  distinctions  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

run­of­the­mill  people. 

 

            

In  Term  Limits  v.  Thornton,  this  Court  held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  unconstitutional  to  make  it  more  difficult  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbents  to  be  reelected  because  they  had  to  engage  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mail­in  campaigns  rather  than  be  on  the  ballot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  are  talking  about  a  well­recognized 

   

 

 

 

 

constitutional  right  where  incumbents  do  ­­ are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similarly  situated  to  average  voters  and  do  have  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  factual  interests.  If  it  is  undisputed,  as  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  that  the  sole  reason  that  Representative  Forbes  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  facing  doom  in  District  4  is  because  of  this  order, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  can't  understand  any  reason  why  the  Court  would  sit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  and  allow  the  Federal  judiciary  to  hijack  the  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intensely  partisan  kind  of  litigation  we  have. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Carvin,  can  I  ­­ can  I

MR.  CARVIN:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Let's  say  that  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

            

some  racist  mapdrawers,  and  ­­ and  they  say,  here's  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  do.  We're  going  to  set  districts,  and  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  want  to  segregate  African­Americans.  And  so  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  say,  that's  our  ­­ that's  our  first  aim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  we  also  have  a  second  aim.  It  turns  out 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  African­Americans  vote  in  a  particular  way.  And  so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

our  second  aim  is  that  we  are  going  to  achieve  some  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  partisan  advantage  as  a  result  of  this  segregation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Uh­huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Now  what  should  be  the  right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  to  that  question?  Is  there  strict  scrutiny  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  a  case? 

   

            

MR.  CARVIN:  I  give  precisely  the  answer 

    

 

 

 

 

this  Court  gave  in  Alabama  where  they  had  an  absolute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

BVAP  floor  which  you  could  argue  was  trying  to  segregate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  cases. 

 

            

This  Court  didn't  say  that  ipso  facto

making  my  hypothetical  more  complicated  than  it  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  just  ­­ this  it  one  district,  we're  just  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segregate  all  the  African­American  voters  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district.  We're  doing  that  primarily  because  of  racial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  We  don't  like  African­American  voters,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're  just  going  to  keep  them  all  in  one  district.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secondarily,  that  has  politically­beneficial 

 

 

 

consequences  for  us. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Is  ­­ and  ­­ and  so  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  is,  is  that  unconstitutional,  because  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  I  look  at  that,  I  say,  okay,  that's  ­­ the  race  was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  primary  motivation.  That  triggered  strict 

  

 

 

 

 

scrutiny.  You  failed  strict  scrutiny;  you're  out  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ball  game. 

 

            

But  you  suggest  that  you're  not  out  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ball  game  because  you  have  this  secondary  interest  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coincides  with  the  clearly  racist  conduct.  And  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  that  I  want  you  to  answer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  If  it  coincides,  and  if  it  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivating  factor  like  it  was  here,  then  obviously  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  to  show  that  race  was  the  but­for  cause  of  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alteration  of  district  lines.  You  need  to  show  that  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subordinated  the  neutral  principle,  and  you  need  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show,  to  quote  Alabama,  that  it  had  an  effect  on  ­­

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  So  then  ­­ then 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you're  ­­ then  it  seems  to  me  you're  changing  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  because  in  my  hypothetical,  both  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  run  together.  They're  not  in  conflict  with  each 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other. 

            

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  you're  saying  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical  question  is  not  conflict.  I  had  thought  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  thought  that  the  critical  question  was  conflict. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rather,  the  critical  question  is  which  is  the  primary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivation  or  which  is  the  but­for  purpose,  and  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  secondary  motivation,  even  if  both  run  in  line  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  other.  That's  a  different  kind  of  test. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  No.  I'm  ­­ I'm  happy  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

clarify,  Justice  Kagan.  If  they're  completely 

  

 

 

 

 

co­extensive,  if  as  here,  the  only  way  to  accomplish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  incumbency  protection  in  political  purposes  was  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  where  race  predominated,  then  obviously  it  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  the  but­for  cause.  If  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  This  is  ­­ this  is  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  clear,  just  as  it  is  in  this  case  I  have  to  say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  have  a  list  of  criteria,  and  number  one  on  the  list 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  race.  And  then  we  have  a  lot  of  direct  evidence  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  hypothetical  that  this  is  for  the  most  heinous  racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  imaginable.

MR.  CARVIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  the  question  is,  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

the  fact  that  it  also  has  political  benefits,  does  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insulate  these  line  drawers  from  what  you  would  think  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  obvious  conclusion,  which  is  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional  conduct? 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  In  every  context,  Mount 

  

 

 

 

 

Healthy,  Gross,  even  outside  of  the  Shaw  cases  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  have  a  special  burden  to  show,  it's  race 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than  politics.  Even  in  those  cases,  you  need  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  the  impermissible  factor  was  the  but­for  cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  challenge,  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  he  says,  this  is  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  priority. 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Yes.  And  every  legislature  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

every  court  in  the  United  States  has  ranked  the  Voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights  Act  higher  than  other  things  because  they  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  the  Supremacy  Clause. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  in  my  hypothetical  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  But  ­­ but  ­­ but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ it's  his  first  priority 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  he  is  a  racist  line  drawer. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Great.  Let's  assume  that  he 

  

  

 

 

 

 

picked  55  percent  BVAP  out  of  the  air  and  just  wanted  to

on  district  lines?  If  it  is  undisputed  and  clear,  as  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  here,  that  they  would  have  drawn  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely  the  same  way  to  protect  incumbents  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics,  that  if  you  diminish  below  that  BVAP  floor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  to  50  percent,  we  know  to  a  certainty  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  have  proved  to  us  that  that  would  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  ­­ that  sounds  to  me  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  it's  a  harmless  error  rule  for  racial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination.  And  we've  never  had  a  harmless  error 

   

  

 

 

 

 

rule  for  racial  discrimination.  What  we've  said  is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look,  we  just  found  racially­discriminatory  purpose,  end 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  case. 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  What  you  found  in  Cromartie, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  harmless  error.  You  need  to  show  but­for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation  or  effect,  as  they  said  in  Alabama. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Cromartie  held,  as  a  matter  of  law,  the  fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  was  racial  percentages,  lack  of  compactness, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  breaking  of  county  lines  is  insufficient  as  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  law  to  find  a  violation.  Why?  Because  there  is  an 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

equally  plausible  explanation,  which  is  politics.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  the  plaintiffs'  demanding  burden  to  prove  race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than  politics.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Could  I  ask  a  question, 

   

   

  

 

which  is  really  highlighted  by  Justice  Kagan's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical?  Because  normally,  were  ­­ were  it  not  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Voting  Rights  Act,  there  would  be  a  very  simple 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  to  all  of  these  questions,  and  that  is  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  take  race  in  account  at  all.  It's  invidious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination  to  take  governmental  action  on  the  basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  race. 

 

            

Does  Shelby  County  have  any  relevance  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case?  Is  this  the  type  of  case  that  will  never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  up  again  in  the  future  if  the  Voting  Rights  Act  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  amended? 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Right.  You  need  not  worry 

  

  

 

 

 

 

about  this  in  2022,  but  the  issue  here,  Justice  Alito, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  what  was  the  reality  confronting  the  legislature  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2012?  And  they  had  to  get  preclearance  by  the  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department  in  record  time,  so  they  needed  to  get  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quick  preclearance,  which  is  why  it  made  eminently  good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  not  to  go  ­­ go  below  the  benchmark  BVAP. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  even  if  we  assume,  to  get  back  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan's  question,  that  they  just  plucked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  percent  out  of  the  air,  it  still  doesn't  establish  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  because  this  Court  has  said  countless  times, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race  is  always  a  factor  in  redistricting.  So  it's  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  employment  in  another  context.

And  here's  what  the  Court  said  in  Cromartie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

II,  and  the  lower  court  completely  defied,  it  said,  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  such  as  this  one  where  majority­minority  districts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  at  issue,  and  where  racial  identification  correlates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highly  with  political  affiliation,  the  party  attacking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legislative­drawn  boundaries  must  show  at  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  that  the  legislature  could  have  accomplished  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate  political  objective  in  a  different  way. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  the  first  seven  words 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  that  quote  are  "in  a  case  such  as  this  one." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  the  question  is  what  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  mean  by  that?  And  one  understanding  of  what  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant  when  they  said  "in  a  case  such  as  this  one"  is  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  case  in  which  there  was  no  direct  evidence  of  racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivation  but  only  circumstantial  evidence,  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ and  the  absence  or  the  presence  of  a  map  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeed  relevant  to  the  question  of  whether  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstantial  evidence  added  up  to  the  conclusion  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race  was  the  motivator. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  I  ­­ I  must  respectfully

MR.  CARVIN:  It's  ­­ why  didn't  we  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said,  remand  to  find  out  which  districts  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected  by  the  BVAP  floor.  Under  this  theory,  all  35 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  in  Alabama,  all  majority­black  districts,  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ipso  facto  violations  of  Shaw.  And  by  the  way,  every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority­minority  district  in  the  country  is  ipso  facto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violative  of  Shaw,  because  every  legislature  and  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  that  has  created  one  has  invoked  the  supremacy  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Voting  Rights  Act. 

 

 

 

            

But  that's  not  what  the  court  did.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  said,  go  back  and  figure  out  if  race  had  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  effect  on  the  lines.  It  didn't  say,  go  turn 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  majority­black  districts  into  45  percent­black 

 

 

 

 

 

districts.  And  that  would  be  the  great  evil  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepting  this  tautological  rule.  That  is  why  the  Court

evidence  supported  the  district  court's  finding  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  55  percent­BVAP  floor  that  was  used  to  move 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  44,000  African­American  voters  into  CD3.

the  clear­error  standard,  we  chose  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  I  understand. 

   

  

 

 

But  your  position,  if  you  were  taking  a  considered 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  at  trial,  is  that  the  ­­ the  district  court  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong,  because  that  was  ­­ you  presented  the  facts  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  defended  those  facts,  under  your  view.  And  then  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal,  they  overturned  it,  and  you  say,  okay,  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong,  but  not  clearly  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  That's  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  mean,  there's 

    

 

 

 

nothing  wrong  with  that.  I  just  want  to  make  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  That's  exactly  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

 

exactly  right.  And  we  didn't  ­­ and  that's  why  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  appeal.  But  the  evidence  supporting  the  district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court's  finding  was  amply  sufficient  under  the  clear

today? 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  You  may  be  referring  to  Judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ Judge  Payne's  surmise  that  because  of  a  change  in  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  administration  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  No.  I'm  just  asking  you: 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Was  there  anything  relevant  that  happened? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  Your  Honor,  our  ­­ our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

administration  came  into  power  in  January  2014.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  was  pending  on  summary  judgment.  We  defended  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  on  summary  judgment.  We  defended  it  at  trial. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  same  career  attorney  argued  it  at  trial.  When  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  ruled  against  Virginia,  we  had  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluate  whether  we  could  win  on  a  clear  error  standard, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  concluded  we  could  not. 

 

 

 

 

            

In  addition  to  the  ­­ to  our  own  expert's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sworn  report  that  said  that  there  was  a  55  percent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

floor,  Virginia's  Section  5  submission  referred  to  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

55  percent  threshold  as  well.  That's  at  page  77  to  79 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Joint  Appendix. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Which  expert  are  you  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about? 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  John  Morgan,  Your  Honor.  At 

  

  

 

 

 

 

page  518  of  the  Joint  Appendix,  you'll  see  his  sworn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

report,  where  he  refers  to  a  55  percent  floor  that  was

actually  served  as  a  consultant  to  the  Republicans  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  House  of  Delegates  and  served  as  an  expert  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  One  ­­ it  was  also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  your  experts  that  said  that  if  every  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  in  these  swaps  were  white,  the  results  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  be  the  same,  right?

MR.  RAPHAEL:  ­­ who  was  the  plaintiffs' 

  

 

 

 

 

 

expert,  he  was  asked,  can't  ­­ can't  a  lot  of  these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

swaps  be  explained  based  on  ­­ based  on  politics?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  said  they  could  be,  with  the  exception,  I  would  say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Plaintiffs'  Exhibit  57,  which  showed  that  there  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five  ­­ that's  on  page  439  of  the  Joint  Appendix.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  showed  that  there  were  five  voting  districts  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  dropped  from  the  benchmark  district  which  had  above 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  percent  performing  ­­ Democratic  performance,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  very  low  in  BVAP.  And  I  think  that  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  supports  his  ­­ his  argument  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Would  there  ­­ would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  be  a  violation  here  if  the  district  that  were

rather  than  race? 

 

 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  If  ­­ if  the  only  evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  statistical,  just  like  in  Easley  v.  Cromartie,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  could  equally  be  explained  based  on  partisanship, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  right,  I  think  we  would  have  won  the  case  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'd  be  defending  that  position  here.  But  I  think  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  killed  us  was  the  Morgan  ­­ our  own  expert's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

report  that  said  that  there  was  a  55  percent  floor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  was  other  evidence  that  there  was  a  floor.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  did  not  commit  clear  error  in  ­­ in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  that  that  was  the  driving  factor  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It's  a  ­­ a  question 

   

   

  

 

 

I  asked  Mr.  Carvin.  You're  talking  about  the  motive  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legislature,  right?  What  do  you  do  when  it's  10 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  race,  10  percent  partisanship,  and,  as  is  often 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case,  I  suspect,  80  percent  of  them  don't  say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  at  all? 

 

 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  Right.  It  would  be  a  lot 

   

  

  

 

 

 

harder  if  you  had  that  kind  of  case  here.  But  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  there  was  one  sponsor.  He  said  that  the  BVAP  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  at  least  the  same  in  the  new  district  as  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benchmark  district.  He  said  that  twice.  And  then  he 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  order  to  have  certainty  of  preclearance,  we  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  bump  it  up  to  55  percent.  And  if  you're  ­­

legislature  and  you  say,  okay,  I  understand  now  what  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said.  But  I  suspect  most  of  them  looked  at  the  map  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  you  know,  how  a.m.  I  doing  here?  What's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

percentage  of  Republican?  What's  percentage  of 

  

 

 

 

 

Democrat?  What's  the  change?  They  may  not  have  cared 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  sponsor  thought  about  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  Yeah.  Yeah,  I  think  ­­ I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

think  there  may  be  two  ways  to  look  at  the  evidence  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case.  There  is  the  way  that  the  district  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did,  which  was  to  say,  there  was  a  55  percent  floor;  did 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics  trump  that?  No,  because,  as  Justice  Ginsburg 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  out,  the  sponsor  said,  I  didn't  do  a  partisan 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

analysis.  That  wasn't  a  factor.  And  so  on  that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

scenario,  the  district  court  didn't  commit  clear  error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  saying  there  was  a  floor.  It  triggered  strict 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny,  politics  didn't  ­­ didn't  control. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  a  simple  case.  The  harder  case  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  one  that  you're  describing,  where,  you  know,  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  look  at  this  55  percent  floor  and  think,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  actually  pretty  good  for  Republicans,  so  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  quietly  go  along  with  it.  But  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance,  race  would  be  used  as  the  proxy  for  justifying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ the  plan,  and  I  don't  think  race  can  be  used  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proxy,  to  Justice  Kennedy's  point,  nor  can  it  be  used  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  excuse,  and  that's  how  it  was  ­­ was  used  here.

The  other  evidence  included  statements  by 

 

 

 

 

 

members  of  the  House  and  Senate  in  the  House  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Delegates  redistricting  at  page  533  and  527.  There  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  really  appears  to  have  been  a  mantra:  "This  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  at  least  55  percent  performing."  Senator  Vogel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that,  and  she's  an  election  lawyer.  She  said,  "The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lowest  that  DOJ  will  preclear  is  55  percent."  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  533  of  the  Joint  Appendix.  And  then  Janis's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements  that  the  most  important  factor  to  him  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtaining  preclearance,  and  it  ­­ that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Wouldn't  there  be  a  basis 

   

  

 

 

 

for  the  legislator  who  said,  the  Department  of  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't  accept  it  if  we  go  below  55  percent?  Is  it  ­­ was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­ was  it  something  she  made  up,  or  did  she  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  basis  for  that? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  The  record  in  this  case  has  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

showing  as  to  where  that  55  percent  number  came  from. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  fact,  the  record  shows  that  this  exact  district  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precleared  previously  at  53  percent  and  at  50  percent.

to  that  question.  The  record  shows  that  DOJ  precleared 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  district  as  low  as  33  percent.  That's  at  page  205  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Joint  Appendix.  That  was  in  South  Carolina. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  ­­ I  agree  with  Mr.  Carvin  that  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  enough  to  say  that  we  are  complying  with  the  VRA  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  triggers  strict  scrutiny.  I  don't  think  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

does.  But  when  you  say  we've  got  to  comply  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

VRA,  and  the  way  we  do  that  is  by  having  a  55  percent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

floor,  then  I  think  the  trial  court  got  that  right,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  does  trigger  strict  scrutiny. 

 

 

 

 

            

Once  we  lost  the  issue  of  race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominating,  that  was  the  end  of  the  case  for  us, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  didn't  put  any  evidence  ­­ Mr.  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Carvin  put  no  evidence  in  to  justify  narrow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tailoring  as  to  where  that  number  comes  from.  It  simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  there. 

 

            

The  ­­ the  ­­ Congressman  Scott  had  been

State's  interest,  for  an  officious  intermeddler  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prolong  litigation  like  what  ­­ what's  happening  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  we  looked  at  the  law  in  Meese  v.  Keene,  and  we  read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  as  standing  for  the  proposition  that  where  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervenor  can  argue  injury  to  his  election  opportunity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  adequate  for  a  standing. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  in  this  case,  it's  true:  Congressman 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Forbes,  the  fact  that  he  had  to  switch  from  CD4  to  CD2 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  does  prove  the  injury.  And  the  Special  Master 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  that  his  district  would  go  from  48  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Democratic  to  60  percent  Democratic.  I  think  that  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffices  to  prove  the  injury. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Meese  was  the  case,  wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it,  about  ­­ was  that  the  case  involving  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  California  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ supporting  a  lobbyist? 

   

  

 

 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  That  was  the  California 

  

 

 

 

 

Senator  who  wanted  to  show  a  Canadian  film  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dubbed  political  propaganda. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah,  yeah.  Political 

  

  

 

 

propaganda.  Okay.  So  it's  a  harm  to  reputation.  I  see 

    

   

  

  

 

 

 

that.  All  right. 

  

 

            

If,  in  fact,  this  is  a  sufficient  injury, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  injury  that  now,  the  plan  will  make  it  harder  for  me

indeed,  if  it  gives  rise  to  their  claim  in  their  hands, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  not  in  the  voters'  hands? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  Yeah,  I  ­­

   

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  have,  in  a  State  like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Virginia,  several  million  people  who  could  attack  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  plan  and  any  variation  on  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  plan.  That's  quite  a  lot  to  read  into 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Meese. 

            

MR.  RAPHAEL:  Justice  Breyer,  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

it  means  that.  Forbes  has  a  special  justification 

   

  

 

 

 

 

because  he  clearly  goes  from  a  safe  seat  to  a  seat  he  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  going  to  lose,  and  that's  why  he  switched.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Special  because  it's  more

MR.  RAPHAEL:  Yes.  I  think  normal 

    

  

 

 

Article  III  jurisprudence  explains  this.  Others,  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Wittman,  for  example  ­­

is  complaining  about  his  reputation.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  there  anything  better? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  RAPHAEL:  I  think  that's  the  best  case. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Take  a  look  at  Footnote  8  of  the  brief  that  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  filed  in  that  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  did.  I  ­­

    

    

 

MR.  RAPHAEL:  The  government  argued  in  Meese 

  

 

 

 

 

 

v.  Keene  the  damage  to  reputation  isn't  ­­ a  damage  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

candidacy  isn't  enough  because  it  depends  on  the  actions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  voters  and  third  parties.  This  ­­ not  one  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissented  from  the  holding  in  Meese  v.  Keene  that  injury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  candidacy  was  an  adequate  Article  III  injury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  as  I  mentioned  earlier,  Justice  Alito's  opinion  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  in  Clapper  referred  to  Meese  as  standing  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  proposition  that  it  was  impairment  of  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

career. 

            

So  we  read  that  case.  We  looked  at  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  said.  We  think  it  gives  them  standing.  Are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  happy  about  it?  Not  ­­ no,  we  don't  want  officious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intermeddlers  to  prolong  litigation,  and  maybe  they'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  responsible  for  the  State's  attorneys'  fees  if  we  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  we  have  to  pay  the  Plaintiffs'  attorneys'  fees.  But

MR.  ELIAS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  State  of  Virginia  has  twice  decided  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  appeal  the  decision  below.  This  Court  has  said  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several  occasions,  and  most  recently  in  Hollingsworth, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  has  never  upheld  standing  of  a  private  party  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defend  the  constitutionality  of  a  State  statute  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  itself  has  not  chosen  to  do  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  is  not  the  first  time  that  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  venture  into  this  new  ground.  The  fact  is  that

in  ­­ under  the  American  system,  voters  choose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

candidates.  They  choose  their  elected  officials.  It  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  other  way  around.  I  listened  intently  to  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  of  counsel,  and  the  fact  is,  this  is  not  a

defend  the  legality  of  a  districting  plan  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted  by  the  legislature,  and  that  decision  was  made

the  legality  of  this  ­­ of  the  districting  plan  was  a

the  same  party  as  the  members  of  Congress  affected, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neither  body  nor  the  legislature  as  a  whole  has  chosen 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  intervene  in  this  case,  which  is  quite  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than,  for  example,  in  the  Arizona  case  that  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handled  ­­ resolved  where  it  found  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Under  your  view,  could  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  as  a  whole  intervene? 

   

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  I  think  that  the  legislature 

    

 

 

 

 

could  have  intervened  and  would  ­­ and  would  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better  claim  to  standing  again  under  the  ­­ the  Arizona 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  case  that  this  Court  decided. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  a  legislature  who 

   

  

 

 

passes  the  law  has  greater  standing  than  the  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  is  affected  by  the  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  Well,  we  are  all  affected  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  I  say  "we"  because  I  live  in  the  Commonwealth. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

All  Virginia  voters  are  affected  by  the  law,

and  members  of  Congress  have  to  ­­ the  ­­ the  Appellants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case  have  to  do  better  than  that.  They  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  say  they  are  affected  by  the  law.  They  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  why  they  have  a  legally  protected  interest  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  sounds  to  me  like  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbency,  which  is  the  very  thing  you  say  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  individual  cannot  protect.  Why  can  a  legislature  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  whole  legislature  say  it,  but  not  one  legislature.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  understand  it. 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  So,  Your  Honor,  one  thing  I  want 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  clarify  just  from  the  record,  it  is  not  the  case  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  conceded  nor  is  it  the  case  that  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found,  nor  are  the  underlying  facts  of  the  case  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virginia  legislature  endeavored  to  protect  incumbents. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  Mr.  Janis  said  was  quite  specific.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  not  want  to  pair  incumbents.  He  did  not  want  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draw  them  ­­ their  houses  out  of  their  districts.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  quite  different  than  saying  that  the  Virginia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  had  a  policy  of  protecting  incumbents.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

fact,  the  only  way  to  protect  incumbents  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  use  partisan  data  or  race  as  a  proxy  for  partisan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data.  The  second  of  which  would  be  unconstitutional  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Race  ­­ you  say  race 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  proxy.  If  ­­ and  this  is  why,  easily,  I  think  it's

so  important.  The  way  you  check  is  to  come  up  with  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  that  would  achieve  the  same  partisan  objectives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  respect  to  race,  and  you  weren't  put  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that  that  is  true  in  the  circumstances  in  a  case  such 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  ­­ as  Cromartie  where  the  evidence,  the  direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  race  predominated  was  quite  weak.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  it  ­­ arguably  the  direct  evidence  went  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way,  suggested  that  politics  was  what  drove  ­­ what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drove  the  map. 

 

 

            

And  the  Court  was  ­­ was  evaluating  what  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  do  in  a  circumstance  where  there  is  no  direct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  race  predominated,  but  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstantial  evidence  that  maybe  it  did,  maybe  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't.  And  in  that  case,  one  way  to  tease  out  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it  was  partisanship  or  race  ­­ is  to  say,  okay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  me  the  map  that  teases  that  out.  In  this  case,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  no  need  to  tease  it  out.  It  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No.  I  mean,  it 

    

  

 

 

 

makes  it  ­­ I  guess  you  have  a  greater  degree  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

confidence  if  you  have  an  alternative  that  said,  look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  wanted  partisanship,  which  is  usually  a  pretty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

high  priority  for  politicians,  if  they  wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship,  they  would  have  done  this,  but  instead

they  did  this.  But  if  you're  not  ­­ if  you're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forced  to  show  that,  then  you  have  reliance  on,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  however  many  quotes  you  can  find,  and  ­­ and  I  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  the  question  I  asked  before.  What  do  you  ­­ how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  you  analyze  it  if  it's  10  percent  race,  10  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship  and  80  percent  who  say  nothing  at  all? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  So  in  this  case,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  as  a  factual  matter,  it  was  the  person  who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sponsored  the  bill,  the  person  who  drew  the  map. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  that  Janis? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  ELIAS:  Janis. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  He  wasn't  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  when  this  took  ­­ was  approved,  was  he? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  I  believe  he  ­­ I  believe  he  was 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  ­­ at  the  time  that  the  ­­ that  the  map  was

But  in  any  event,  the  ­­ the  fact  is  that  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  look  at  Exhibit  57,  which  Mr.  Raphael  pointed  to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  you  see  is  that  Professor  McDonald  did  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  calculation.  What  he  looked  at  is  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters  that  were  added  and  the  voters  that  were  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  taken  out.  And  what  he  found  is  that  the  voters 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  added  were  much  higher  propensity  ­­ had  a  higher 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage  of  black  voters  than  they  were  Democratic. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  fact,  he  found  ­­ to  use  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

colloquialism,  he  found  the  blackest  parts  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters  ­­ the  voter  pool,  and  added  them,  and  skipped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  white  Democratic  voters  instead.  The  differential 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was  about  2­1.  So  in  fact,  there  was  an  analysis  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teased  out  based  on  statistics. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you  could  have  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  think  you  could  have  drawn  a  map  under  Cromartie 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  show  if  you  wanted  to  protect  incumbency  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ and  Republican  or  Democratic  advantage,  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  done  this,  and  instead  you  did  this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  I  don't  think  that  that  ­­ that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  question  is  whether  we  could  have  drawn  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

map.  The  question  is  whether  or  not  Cromartie  requires, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  case  where  ­­ where  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  why  isn't  it  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  where  you  could  have  drawn  the  map  another  way?

Are  ­­ are  you  saying  that  you  can  draw  a  map  only  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  race,  then  you  can't  draw  the  map?  Is  that  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position?  I  can  see  where  you  could  take  that  position, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  is  that  what  you're  saying? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  Yeah.  Well,  my  position  is  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

as  ­­ as  Mr.  Raphael  suggested,  the  analysis  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  involved  a  handful  of  VTDs.  So  I  ­­ which  are 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  precincts.  So  we  could  have  potentially 

  

 

 

 

 

 

drawn,  after  that  analysis,  a  district  that  made  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

few  changes.  But  I  don't  think  that  that's  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Cromartie  had  in  mind. 

 

 

 

              

I  think  Cromartie  had  in  mind  a  circumstance 

   

 

 

 

 

where  you  are  not  using  race  as  a  proxy,  and  you  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawing  a  significantly  different  district  that  shows 

   

 

 

 

 

that  race  and  ­­ that  race  predominated  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship.  Whereas,  in  this  case  the  use  of  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

VTDs  was  to  try  to  get  at  something  different,  which  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  intent  of  what  Mr.  Janis  and  the  legislature  had  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Let's  not  forget  that 

  

 

 

 

 

there  was  ­­ counsel,  I'm  over  here  ­­ you're  skipping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  it.  And  I'll  bet  the  map  might  have  been  slightly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  It  still  was  going  to  be  different  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  Yes,  it  was  ­­

MR.  ELIAS:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  the  whole  purpose 

  

 

 

 

 

race. 

            

            

of  the  exercise,  correct? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  you're  race  neutral, 

  

 

 

 

 

you  move  people  not  on  the  basis  of  their  skin  color, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  on  some  ­­ some  neutral  principle.  And  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shown  that  in  at  least  five  precincts  were  moved  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  wasn't  on  the  base  of  partisanship,  it  was  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  of  race. 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

moved  those  districts,  then  you'd  have  to  move  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  to  make  up  for  ­­ for  it.  And  again,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  Cromartie  does.  It  says  we  don't  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculate  about  10  percent,  10  percent,  80  percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  you  have  to  show  is  that  partisanship  could  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  a  factor,  because  you  couldn't  have  drawn  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  differently  without  affecting  partisanship. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  I  think  that  our  burden  was  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  race  predominated.  And  I  don't  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Cromartie  puts  a  straightjacket  on  Miller  and  Vera  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  the  only  way  ­­ or  Shaw  ­­ that  the  only  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  do  that  is  through  the  alternative  map.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  who  loses  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  tie? 

   

            

MR.  ELIAS:  We  would  lose  ­­ we  would  lose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  it's  a  tie,  but  in  this  case  there  is  no  tie. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  nothing  even  approaching  a  tie.  The  legislature 

   

  

 

 

 

 

set  a  55  percent  threshold. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Suppose  the  legislature 

  

 

 

 

had  set  the  same  number  as  what  was  referred  to  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Benchmark  Plan.  Suppose,  instead  of  making  it  56.3  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kept  it  at  53.1,  kept  it  exactly  the  same  as  in  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prior  plan.

show  that  there  was  a  ­­ a  very  good  reason  for  doing 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Is  that  what  you're  making 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  right  on?  Do  you  agree  with  the  Solicitor  General 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  simple  statement  from  the  line  drawers  that  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  trying  the  best  they  can  to  comply  with  the  Voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights  Act,  that  that  is  not  sufficient  to  ­­ to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strict  scrutiny  apply? 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  So  I  think  that  this  Court  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alabama  made  clear  that  the  fact  that  the  State  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virginia  may  have  been  under  the  mistaken  belief  ­­ a

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes.  No.  I  got  that. 

    

  

  

 

 

            

I'm  saying  assume  a  different  ­­ a  different

strict  scrutiny? 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  No,  of  course  not.  That's  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Supremacy  Clause.  So  the  fact  that  the  ­­ the  fact  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  of  Virginia  understood  it  needed  to  comply

strict  scrutiny  is  essentially  the  use  of  a  mechanical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

target  here? 

 

            

            

MR.  ELIAS:  Correct.  Correct. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It's  not  related  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ability  to  elect? 

 

 

            

MR.  ELIAS:  Correct.  And  in  fact,  if  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  what  Professor  Grofman  did  as  the  Court  ­­ as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court's  Special  Master,  you  can  see  he  did  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thoughtful  analysis  that  weighed  all  of  the  traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  criteria,  and  then  looked  at  the  impact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  would  have  on  the  ability  of  African­Americans 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  elect  a  candidate  of  choice.  And  that  is  a  model  of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  kind  of  analysis  that  ­­ that  the  State  of  Virginia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  have  engaged  in  but  didn't. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Instead,  it  started  with  a  50.  It  said  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

district  was  53.1.  If  we  go  under  53.1,  we  are  breaking

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Gershengorn. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  IAN  H.  GERSHENGORN 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

                  

SUPPORTING  APPELLEES 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  make  two  points  on  the  merits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I'd  like  to  start  where  this  Court  is  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start,  with  standing. 

 

 

            

We  believe  that  Appellants  lack  standing  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal.  Appellants  allege  that  the  district  court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  may  cause  them  harm  by  adding  voters  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  of  a  different  political  party  who  may  vote 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  them.  But  candidates  have  no  legally­cognizable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  the  particular  composition  of  the  voters  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  district  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  that  ­­ is  that  true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  legislature  specifically  has  adopted  incumbency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection  as  a  matter  of  State  law  or  a  matter  of  State 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy? 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So  Your  Honor,  I  think  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

they  had  adopted,  as  a  matter  of  State  law,  incumbency

protection,  that  might  be  different,  because  then  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  would  have  established  that,  actually,  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legally­cognizable  right.  But  that's  not  what's  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interest  here. 

 

            

And  if  I  could  say,  Your  Honor,  what's  at  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  at  issue  here  is  whether  a  candidate  has  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  a  particular  composition  of  his  voters.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  actually  Your  Honor's  own  opinion  in  Lulac  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  instructive  on  this. 

 

 

 

            

What  Your  Honor  said  in  Lulac,  if  you'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recall,  is  Congressman  Bonilla  had  alleged  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegation  was  that  the  Latino  voters  there  were  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer  voting  for  Congressman  Bonilla,  and  that  was  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  redistricted. 

 

            

And  what  you  ­­ what  your  opinion  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  there  was  that  that  kind  of  voter  protection, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  for  the  candidate  and  not  for  ­­ not  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  voter,  is  fine  for  the  realm  of  politics,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  did  not  justify  the  ­­ could  not  justify  the  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  to  save  it  for  Section  2.  That's  the  same  point. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  the  area  District  5, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

District  5  in  the  State  which  is  heavily

member  of  Congress  have  standing  to  contest  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So  a  voter  would  have 

   

  

 

 

 

standing  to  contest  it.  A  candidate  would  have  standing 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  contest  it  if  he  or  she  were  a  voter  in  the  district. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  under  Hays,  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  as  a  congressman,  not. 

   

  

 

 

 

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  As  a  congressman,  I  think 

   

   

  

 

not,  at  least  this  Court  has  not  said.  But  remember, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  have  here  is  a  quite  different  situation  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  a  candidate  ­­

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  I  know  it's  different, 

   

  

 

 

 

but  what  I'm  looking  for  throughout  is  the  ­­ I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  that  there  has  been  no  case  which  discusses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ that  I've  been  able  to  find.  They  have  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Meese  case,  which  is  in  a  different  context,  but  why  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  different?  And  what's  bothering  me  about  it,  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ I  don't  want  you  to  just  say  I'm  right;  I  want  you  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  why,  if  I  a.m.,  or  why  I'm  wrong  ­­ is  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  potentially  dozens  of  remedial  plans  and  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  hundreds  of  possible  plans  for  a  State,  and  every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  will  hurt  someone.  And  if  one  district  in  a  State 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  changed,  suddenly  you  open  the  door  to  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  and  every  Congressman  from  every  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  challenging  the  plan. 

 

 

 

            

That  strikes  me  as  a  big  shift  in  the

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  what's  worrying  me. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  And  I  think  you're  right

would  be,  given  your  comments. 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

why. 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Now  I'm  going  to  tell  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

See  ­­ but  I  ­­ and  I  do  think  there  are  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple  of  responses  to  that.  I  mean,  we  do  normally 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely,  in  that  instance,  on  the  State  to  be  the  principal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defender.  But  when  the  State  is  not  there,  what  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  recognized  in  Hollingsworth  is  often  that  means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ the  bill  goes  undefended,  and  that's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  concerns  the  Court. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  reason  why  we  have  to  be  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

careful  about  legislators  and  why  choosing  their  own  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think,  as  plaintiffs'  counsel  said,  we  don't  usually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let  legislators  choose  their  own  ­­ choose  their  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voters,  and  there  is  good  reason  for  that.  That's  not

the  way  the  system  is  supposed  to  work.  And  I  do  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  have  quite  expansive  effects.  It's  not  clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  us  there  is  a  huge  difference  between  this  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line­drawing  and  a  challenge;  for  example,  that  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

legislator  might  seek  to  appeal  the  relocation  of  a  base 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  a  university  in  his  or  her  district  on  the  grounds 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  would  radically  change  the  number  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republican  or  Democratic  voters  in  the  district. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  do  think  Meese  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  if  you  ­­ yeah,  I  ­­ I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry.  I  ­­

    

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  I  was  just  going  to  say 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  think  Meese  is  very  different,  because  Meese  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  about  choosing  the  voters  in  the  district.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  ­­ we're  not  saying  that  you  don't  have  an  injury

saying,  look,  there  has  been  an  act  of  the  legislature, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ­­ the  act  of  the  legislature  has  given  me  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  set  of  voters,  and  why  don't  I  have  a  legally 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cognizable  interest  in  relying  on  that  legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  when  some  court  has  taken  it  away? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Your  Honor,  I  think  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

for  the  same  reason  that  this  Court  rejected  that  idea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  ­­ in  Hays  itself.  There  isn't  a  ­­ a  ­­ a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cognizable  interest  among  the  voters  or  among  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

candidates  in  just  seeing  that  a  ­­ a  lawfully 

   

   

 

 

 

 

legislated  districting  plan  is  enacted.  Otherwise,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  every  voter  in  the  State  would  have  standing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  legislature  said,  you  should  be  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district,  you  should  have  a  fair  opportunity  to  vote. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  that's  not  the  direction  the  Court  has  gone. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  do  think  that  the  combination  of  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewing  the  office  as,  one,  that  the  officeholder  gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  choose  the  constituents,  and  the  potentially  broad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact  of  that  is  one  that  should  give  this  Court  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pause.  And  particularly  ­­ again,  just  to  pick  up  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  plaintiffs'  ­­ plaintiffs'  counsel,  Mr.  Elias,  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  ­­ I  think,  particularly  in  a  situation  where  you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  State  statute,  in  this  Court's  observation  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hollingsworth,  it  would  be  quite  unusual,  I  think,  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  standing  here.

If  I  could  switch  over  to  the  merits  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

quickly,  a  couple  of  ­­ a  couple  of  points. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

              

I  wanted  to  start  with  the  observations  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy  and  Justice  Kagan  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could­have,  would­have  standard  that  Mr.  Carvin  has  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  put  forth,  which,  as  I  understand  it,  is  basically, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  is  okay  even  if  based  on  race  as  long  as  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  been  drawn  on  the  basis  of  politics  or  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been.  We  think  that  really  flies  in  the  face  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Shaw  and  Miller  line  of  cases,  that  what  those  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  about  at  core  are  two  principal  things:  That  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  use  race  as  a  proxy,  and  you  can't  sort  voters  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  basis  of  race.  And  when  you  do  that,  it  is  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  to  say,  well,  I  could  have  done  the  same  thing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  basis  of  politics.  You  can  send  it  back.  If  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature,  in  fact,  does  the  same  thing,  taking  race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  the  equation,  then  fine.  The  injury  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shaw  line  of  cases  was  designed  to  get  at  is  eliminated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  precisely  the  sorting.  And  so  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would­have  or  could­have  test  that  Mr.  Carvin  has  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward  is  really  quite  at  odds  with  ­­ with  the  ­­ with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  jurisprudence. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But,  I  mean,  people 

   

  

 

 

 

have  objected  to  some  extent  that  Cromartie  cut  back  on

least,  would  feel  on  much  more  solid  ground  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  had  been  put  to  the  test  of  saying,  show  us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  say  this  isn't  about  partisanship;  this  is  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race.  Okay.  Show  us.  You  draw  the  district  that  would 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect  the  partisanship  interest  that's  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  And  yet  the  ­­ the  lower  court  did  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  them  to  that  inquiry. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So,  Your  Honor,  we  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Cromartie  is  a  very  important  case,  but  it  actually  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  the  ­­ the  exact  opposite  of  the  situation  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  think  Cromartie  is  the  situation  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legislator  ­­ there  was  direct  and  substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  the  legislature  acted  on  the  basis  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics,  and  statistics  were  put  forward  that  said  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equally  explained  by  race.  And  what  this  Court  said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we  think  it  was  sensible,  is  there's  basically  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thumb  on  the  scale  for  politics  at  that  point,  to  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  legislatures  their  room. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  in  a  situation  like  this,  where  there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  and  substantial  evidence  that  race  was  at  issue, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  same  evidence  that  it's  equally  consistent  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politics  just  doesn't  cut  it.  That  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  okay,  if  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  evidence  that  race  is  at  issue.  I  will  give  you  a

others.  I  wouldn't  want  to  deprive  you  of  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity. 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  you're  looking 

  

 

 

 

 

to  see  whether  race  was  the  motive.  What  do  you  do  if, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  I  said,  you  know,  10  say  yes,  10  say  something  else, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  80  don't  say  anything?  How  can  you  say  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive  of  the  legislature  was  ­­ was  this  or  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So,  Your  Honor,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

it's  obviously  a  difficult  question,  but  I  would  say  two 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

things  on  that. 

 

 

            

First  is,  this  Court's  cases  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairly  unanimous  in  looking  to  the  ­­ to  the  intent  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  drafter.  That's  what  they  look  to,  for  example,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bush  v.  Vera.  And  in  Alabama,  this  Court  had  a  policy, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  didn't  look  to  see  whether  each  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislators  individually  had  embraced  that  policy.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was  something  that  the  Court  accepted.  So  I  think  there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  long  line  of  case  law  going  that  way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  second,  of  course,  it's  not  solely  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent  of  the  drafter  here.  There  are  objective 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicators,  which  this  Court  has  indicated  in  both  Shaw 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Miller  are  extremely  important,  things  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks  to  ­­ the  traditional  redistricting  factors,  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  contiguity,  compactness,  are  counties  being  split  ­­

that  reinforce  that  kind  of  intent.  And  those  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  that  are  open,  that  ­­ that  are  ­­ are  part  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plan  that  was  enacted  by  all  of  the  legislature. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  here  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  if  the  drafter  or  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  of  the  legislature  say,  race  was  our  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration,  and  by  that,  what  we  mean  is  that  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  take  race  into  account  under  the  Voting  Rights  Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that's  what  we've  done?  Would  that  ­­ what  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ what  would  be  the  result  there? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So,  Your  Honor,  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

think  that  that  necessarily  results  in  strict  scrutiny. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  this  Court  has  said  over  and  over  is  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  race  must  predominate.  The  mere  intentionally  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  consciousness  of  race,  or  even  the  intentional  use  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race,  is  not  sufficient. 

 

 

 

            

And  we  think  that  makes  sense,  because  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  has  said,  the  redistricters  are  always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conscious  of  race  and  always  aware  of  race,  and  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  legislatures  need  room  and  ­­ need  room  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maneuver.  And  so  the  mere  ­­ the  mere  fact  that  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conscious  of  race  or  even  that  race  ­­ you  intentionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  race  is  not  sufficient  by  itself  to  have  strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny.

Mr.  Carvin,  you  have  four  minutes  remaining. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MICHAEL  A.  CARVIN 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  APPELLANTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  I'd  like  to  begin  with  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan's  questions. 

 

            

We've  heard  a  constant  theme  that  if  it  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  because  of  race,  a  post  hoc  political  explanation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  justify  it  ­­ I  fully  agree  with  that  ­­ with  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed  motive  case  here.  That's  what  the  district  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said:  Race,  politics,  and  incumbency  protection.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  only  reason  that  race  was,  quote,  "ranked  higher" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  because  he  said  that  it  was  a  Federal  mandate  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Supremacy  Clause.  So  if  that's  not  a  justification, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  committed  legal  error. 

 

 

 

            

If  you  turn  to  33a,  why  was  politics  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbency  subordinate?  They  told  you:  Because  that, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

quote,  "goal  was  permissive  and  subordinate  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  criteria  of  compliance  with  the  VRA."  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  said  that  they  implemented  it  by  not  reducing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benchmark  BVAP,  but  that  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  rank 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordering  of  VRA  over  these  other  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To  get  to  your  question:  If  two  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  take  the  point, 

   

  

 

 

 

Mr.  Carvin,  but  isn't  that  really  exactly  what  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confronted  in  Alabama,  which  is  ­­ you  know,  the  number

one  priority  was  the  VRA,  but  then  it  turned  out  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  misunderstood  the  VIA,  so  it  turned  out  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  number  one  priority  was  a  racial  quota,  which  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  to  do  with  the  way  the  VRA  is  really  supposed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operate? 

            

MR.  CARVIN:  That's  fine,  and  that  goes  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrow  tailoring,  but  what  we  are  trying  to  figure  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  whether  or  not  there  is  a  prima  facie  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  assume  with  me  that  in  30  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  in  Alabama,  race  was  completely  coextensive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  didn't  assert  politics,  but  with  county  lines. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Would  you  ever  say  that  race  predominated  over  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  subordinated  something  when  they  are  entirely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coextensive? 

            

Let's  take  it  out  of  the  racial  context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Compactness  is  number  two;  county  lines  are  number 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three.  You  draw  a  nice,  compact  district  that  complies 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  county  lines.  No  one  in  their  right  mind  would  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"compactness  predominated  over  county  lines"  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  result  was  ordained  by  these  two  motives.  And  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  search  this  opinion  for  any  finding  that  race  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  with  or  subordinated  incumbency  protection 

 

 

 

 

 

or  politics,  and  you  won't  find  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Therefore,  they  haven't  made  their  basic 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  of  showing  that  traditional  districting

Cromartie  II  burden  of  showing  it  was  subordinated  to

in  Cromartie  II.  Why?  Because  the  racial  effect  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical  to  the  political  effect.  He  made  a  big  deal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  fact  that  there  was  a  16.5  percent  gap  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  VTDs  in  District  3  and  those  outside  of  District  3 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  terms  of  race.  But  what  his  own  index  shows  on  JA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

439  is  there  was  also  a  16  percent  gap  in  Democratic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percentages.  So  it's  exactly  the  same  flaw  that  was  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  in  Cromartie  II  is  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  unless  this  Court  is  prepared  to  allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  courts  to  engage  in  naked  defiance  of  the  plain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  and  holding  of  Cromartie  II,  this  case  needs  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  reversed. 

 

            

As  to  your  direct  evidence  point,  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan,  what  was  the  direct  evidence  in  Cromartie  II? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Partisan  and  racial  balance.  The  Court  said  as  clear  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible  since  he  said  partisanship  and  race,  it  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  or  nothing  about  the  relative  predominance.  What

do  we  have  here?  Incumbency  protection,  politics  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

race.  Therefore  the  direct  evidence  says  little  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  about  the  relative  predominance.  What  you  need 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  is  to  show  that  they  could  have  accomplished  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate  political  objectives  in  some  other  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  to  standing,  I've  heard  the  slogan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeated  by  all  of  my  opponents,  "voters  choose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representatives  not  vice  versa."  That's  a  lovely 

   

  

 

 

 

slogan.  But  the  relevant  point  here  is  that  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislatures  choose  which  districts  those  voters  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into,  not  the  Federal  judiciary. 

 

 

 

 

            

If,  as  you  must  assume,  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judiciary  has  exceeded  its  proper  role  and  created  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  which  dramatically  hurts  the  incumbents  who  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed  to  be  protected  by  this  law,  how  can  they  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  legally  cognizable  injury­in­fact? 

   

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon,  at  11:16  a.m.,  the  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
