CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­232,  Harris  v.  The  Arizona 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Independent  Redistricting  Commission. 

 

 

            

Mr.  Hearne. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MARK  F.  HEARNE,  II 

 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  APPELLANTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  one­person,  one­vote  principle  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Equal  Protection  Clause  requires  an  apportionment 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  make  a  good­faith  effort  to  equally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

apportion  the  population  as  ­­ as  practically  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible,  and  while  deviations  are  tolerated,  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  minor  deviations  made  for  legitimate  purposes  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rational  State  policy  intended  not  to  be  discriminatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  arbitrary. 

 

            

Here,  the  Arizona  Redistricting  Commission 

 

 

 

 

malapportioned  Arizona  State  legislature  by  almost 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent,  8.8  percent,  and  the  district  court  below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  it  did  so  for  two  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  first  reason  was  to  obtain  a  partisan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

advantage  for  the  Democrat  party. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  reason  was  a  perceived  belief

that  malapportioned  districts  were  necessary  to  obtain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Department  preclearance  approval. 

 

 

 

            

Neither  of  these  reasons  justifies  a 

 

 

 

 

 

deviation  from  the  constitutional  principle  of  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person,  one  vote. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Hearne  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  The  second  part,  do  ­­ do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  want  us  ­­ do  you  want  us  to  overturn  the  factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  that  compliance  with  the  Voting  Rights  Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  preclearance  procedures,  was  the  reason  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  reason  for  the  deviation?  Do  you  want  us  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overturn  that  as  a  factual  finding? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  No,  I  don't,  as  a  factual 

   

   

  

 

 

finding.  But  when  you  say,  Justice  Kennedy,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclearance  obtaining  Voting  Rights  Act  compliance,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  said,  as  we've  noted  in  the  briefing,  it  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  to  under­populate  districts  to  obtain 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance  with  the  Voting  Rights  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  May  I  ask  you  a  ­­ a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

question?  It's  ­­ it's  odd  that  you're  making  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge  that  there  was  an  impermissible  effort  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase  the  Democratic  authority,  power,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature,  but  the  end  result  was  that  the  Arizona 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  gave  Republicans  more  than  their  proportionate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

share  of  seats  in  the  State  legislature.  And  I  think

the  numbers  are,  in  total,  Republicans  won  56.6  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  State  Senate  seats,  60  percent  of  the  State  House 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seats.  And  that  exceeded  the  Republican  party's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Statewide  registration  share  of  54.4  percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  there  was  an  attempt  to  stack  this  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor  of  Democrats,  it  certainly  failed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  we  would  say,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  ­­ an  incompetent  gerrymander  is  no  less  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gerrymander  when  it  unequally  apportions  the  population 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  a  competent  gerrymander  that  obtained  the  partisan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

objective. 

              

I  think  the  objective  that  we  are  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

achieve  here  is  the  one­person,  one­vote  standard.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why,  whatever  the  ultimate  political  outcome,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  that  vindicates  the  fact  that  these  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unequally  apportioned. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  ­­ it  ­­ it's  still  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  to  me  what  ­­ what  you  want  us  to  say  about  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Commission's  rationale  for  compliance  and  Voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights  Act  compliance  that  was  wrong  as  a  matter  of  law, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  if  you  don't  overturn  the  factual  finding  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  a  ­­ a  good­faith  belief  that  what  they  were 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  is  correct,  then  ­­ then  you  have  ­­ then  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  problem,  it  seems  to  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Or  do  you  have  a  problem?

MR.  HEARNE:  I  don't  believe  I  do,  because  I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

think  it's  not  ­­ the  good­faith  ­­ what  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  found  was  that  their  advisor  told  them,  you  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depopulate  districts  up  to  10  percent,  and  in  fact,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  do  that  because  you  need  to  create  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under­populated  minority  districts  to  obtain 

 

 

 

 

preclearance. 

            

That  is  wrong.  The  Voting  Rights  Act  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  command,  does  not  compel  or  require,  under­populated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  to  obtain  preclearance.  The  Solicitor 

  

 

 

 

 

Generals  noted  that  as  well  in  their  briefing  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Department  guidelines.  And  that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  ­­ how 

   

  

 

 

 

confident  are  you  of  that?  I  mean,  the  ­­ the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclearance  process  at  the  Department  of  Justice  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

famously  opaque,  and  usually  the  States  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipalities  have  to  go  through,  or  had  to  go  through, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several  layers  of  back  and  forth,  here's  a  proposal  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  sort  of  a  bargaining  process.  I  don't  know  how 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

confident  you  can  be  that  ­­ that  it  wasn't  necessary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  We  certainly  agree  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

preclearance  process  was  very  opaque,  as  you  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice.  I  mean,  we  said  it  was  like  reading 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chicken  entrails,  because  no  one  really  knows  what  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  or  don't  need  to  do  to  ­­ to  obtain  preclearance.

But  just  fundamentally,  the  Voting  Rights 

 

 

 

 

 

Act,  even  prior  to  Shelby  County,  could  not  compel  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  authority  to  under­populate  districts.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

the  advice  they  had  been  given,  you  must  under­populate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  ten  districts  in  order  to  obtain  preclearance  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flawed  as  a  matter  of  legal  advice  that  doesn't  justify 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malapportionment. 

            

So  they  could  have  achieved  as,  in  fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  own  expert,  Dr.  King,  said.  In  the  first  map  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  two  maps.  They  had  a  draft  map  and  a  final 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

map.  The  draft  map  had  a  4  percent,  roughly,  deviation, 

     

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  their  own  expert  said  this  map  satisfies  the  Voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights  Act. 

 

            

Then  they  went  and  depopulated  further  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  an  8.8  percent  deviation. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  they  were  mistaken.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

mean,  you're  ­­ you  say  they  ­­ they  could  have  done  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  ­­ without  disproportioning,  but  they  ­­ they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  that  that  was  okay.  They  thought  that  they  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  this  in  order  to  comply  with  the  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department. 

            

What's  the  test?  Is  the  test  what  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended,  or  is  it  an  objective  test? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  I  think  you  have  to  look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

at,  actually,  both.  I  think  you  look  at  the  objective

test  is:  Does  the  Voting  Rights  Act  require  you  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depopulate  districts?  That's  bad  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  let's  assume  the  answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  that  is  no. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  the  people  who  ­­ who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  this  apportionment  were  mistaken,  and  they  thought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  allowed,  and  indeed  may  require,  you  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So?  That  doesn't  show  a  bad  motive  on  their  part,  does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it? 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  No,  but  I  don't  think  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court's  ever  held  that  bad  legal  advice  justifies  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  violation,  which  in  this  case  that's  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  saying  is  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  bad  legal  advice  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  an  impermissible  motive. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  we  have  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Justice  Scalia  is  asking 

  

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ what  ­­ what  the  test  ­­ what  is  the  test  here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  I  would  say  this  case,  as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court  noted,  and  all  three  judges  split  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  burden  of  proof  was,  is  a  mixed­motive  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  have  one  assumed  illegitimate  motive,  partisan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advantage,  and  you  have  another  motive  which  is,  oh, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  okay  because  we  needed  to  do  this  because  our

advisor  said  that  was  necessary  for  preclearance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then  I  think  it  ­­ the  task  falls  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commission  to  justify,  under  this  Court's  decisions  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mt.  Healthy  and  Arlington  Heights  standard  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed­motive  case  to  justify,  oh,  this  was  necessary  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  to  comply  with  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  that  was  not  done. 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  ­­ and  it  was  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  mixed  motive.  It  was  a  finding  of  dominance,  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  dominant  purpose  of  this  was  to  attempt  to  meet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  5. 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Two  of  the  judges,  Judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Clifton  and  Judge  Silver,  did  find  that  that  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominant  motive  or  primary  motive. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  that's  a  ­­ that's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

fact­finding  which  you  ­­ you  have  a  burden  if  you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking  to  overturn  it. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  But  they  also  found  that  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  another  illegitimate  motive  that  they  assumed  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Silver  didn't  necessarily  agree,  but  she  assumed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  purposes  of  decision,  that  this  partisan  advantage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  illegitimate  motive. 

   

 

            

So  you  have  a  case  where  this  body  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutionally  departing  from  one­person,  one­vote. 

 

 

 

 

They  come  forward  with  two  explanations,  one

illegitimate,  one  supposedly  legitimate:  This 

  

 

 

 

preclearance  based  on  erroneous  legal  advice.  And  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  basis  of  that,  the  court  split  on  what  the  burden  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proof  was.  We  would  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Just  to  pin  this  down  a  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  bit,  Mr.  Hearne:  You  ­­ you  are  not  contesting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  factual  finding  that  the  predominant  motive  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply  with  the  Voting  Rights  Act;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  We  ­­ we  take  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual  findings  from  the  district  court.  We  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

protest  those.  But  what  we  do  believe  is  that  the  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  the  wrong  burden­shifting  standard  in  that,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  analysis  of  those  facts. 

 

 

 

 

            

When  they  have  a  mixed  motive,  the  proper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

response  would  have  been  to  say,  okay,  you've  shown,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  one  illegitimate  motive. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  you  keep  on  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mixed  motive,  and  I  guess  people  keep  on  coming  back  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  and  just  trying  to  figure  out  whether  you  are,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  or  are  not,  in  fact,  contesting  that  ­­ that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominant  motive  was  the  Voting  Rights  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  The  ­­ when  ­­ when  we  say  the

with  the  Voting  Rights  Act? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  this  ­­ and  the  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  found,  and  it  is  a  factual  finding,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  predominant  motive? 

 

 

 

            

And  I  don't  mean  to  harangue  you  on  this.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  want  to  understand  what  your  argument  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  No.  We  ­­ we  ­­ we  ­­ to  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  clear,  yes,  we  accept  the  factual  finding  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  judges,  that  that  was  ­­ what  they  said  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primary  motive.  But  they  erred  when  they  did  not  shift 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  burden  in  a  mixed­motive  case,  under  Arlington 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Heights,  I  think  footnote  21,  or  Mt.  Healthy,  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard. 

            

Secondly,  they  erred  when  they  gave  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification  and  found  it  legitimate  when  there  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  a  legal  need  to  do  what  they  did.  There  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  ­­ the  Voting  Rights  Act  can't  compel  vote  dilution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  justification,  even  if  it  was  had  in  good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith,  does  not  excuse  a  constitutional  violation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

one­person,  one­vote. 

 

            

So  at  minimum,  it  would  need  to  be  remanded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  an  opportunity  for  them  to  somehow  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commission  ­­ explain  why  they  can  justify  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population  deviations.  And  that's  ­­ that  is  our

position,  Justice  Kagan. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  ­­ I'm  ­­ I'm  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  confused.  I  ­­ I  understand  that  you  gave  up 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

any  racial  or  ­­ or  political  gerrymandering  case.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  just  a  voter­dilution  case. 

   

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  That's  absolutely  correct, 

  

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Now,  I  understand 

   

  

 

there's  one  case  you're  relying  on  that  was  summarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmed,  but  is  there  any  other  case  from  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  has  ever  said  that  a  ­­ a  deviation  of  this  amount 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  significant? 

 

              

I  think  we've  always  called  it  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

below  9  percent  de  minimis,  correct? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  What  the  Court  has  said,  as  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  the  jurisprudence,  is  that  a  deviation  of  over 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  is  prima  facie  constitutional,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements  justify  it. 

 

 

            

If  it's  a  deviation  of  less  than  10  percent, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  obligation  is  on  the  party  challenging  it  to  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward  and  present  some  evidence  showing  that  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  for  an  arbitrary  or  discriminatory  purpose. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  what  we  understand  that  standard  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  out  of  Brown  v.  Thomson.  And  again,  that  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plurality  opinion.

But  under  that  standard  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  don't  actually 

    

   

 

 

            

            

understand.  I  don't  know  of  any  case  where  we've 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  an  explanation  under  10  percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  I  think  two  ­­ I  have  two 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

responses  to  that,  Justice  Sotomayor.  First  in  Cox  v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Larios,  certainly  this  Court  had  a  summary  affirmance, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  concurring  opinion  in  that  case  by  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Stevens  and  Breyer  does  say  that  there  is  not  this  magic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bright  line,  and  then  other  decisions  of  this  Court  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  disavowed  creating  some  simple  bright­line  test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  deviations  from  the  constitutional  standard  below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  tolerated. 

 

 

            

So,  for  example  in  Karcher,  that  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  we  specifically  don't  want  to  set  some  line, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  minute  we  do  that,  legislators  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  authorities  will  immediately  use  that  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  new  standard. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  in  fact,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

have.  They've  pretty  much  used  10  percent.  We've  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

discouraged  them  from  doing  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  It  is  certainly  ­­ it  certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeared  in  some  of  the  district  court  decisions  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­

have  looked  at  that.  And  again,  we  see  that  as  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  shift  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  it  says,  actually,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Brown  v.  Thomson,  it  says  our  decisions  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established,  as  a  general  matter,  that  an  apportionate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

plan  with  a  maximum  population  deviation  under 

   

 

 

 

 

10  percent  falls  within  this  category  of  minor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviations.  And  what  we  held  previously  was  that  minor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviations  from  mathematical  equality  among  State 

 

 

 

 

 

legislatures  are  insufficient  to  make  out  a  prima  facie 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  of  invidious  discrimination. 

 

 

 

            

All  right.  So  that's  the  holding  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court.  And  this  seems  to  be  within  the  category  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor  deviations  where  you  have  to  make  out  ­­ you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  something  more  than  you  would  have  to  do  if  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  a  ­­ larger  than  10  percent. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

have  to  do? 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  what  do  you  think  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  I  think  we  have  to  do, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer,  what  we  did,  which  is  to  come  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  ­­ to  come  to  a  district  court  and  to  present  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  evidence  which  the  district  court  found  of  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  deviation  that,  though  minor,  is  done  for  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegitimate  purpose.

And  yes,  there  was  this  other  pretext  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclearance  issue.  That  satisfied  the  burden  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

requiring  judicial  scrutiny  of  that  redistricting,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  we  have  satisfied  that  burden. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  bother  having  a 

  

 

 

 

 

minor?  Don't  you  think  this  will  lead  every  single  plan 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  challenged  as  voter  dilution? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  no.  I  think  that  you 

    

  

 

 

 

 

would  have  to  still  have  a  showing  of  an  illegitimate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  behind  the  deviation. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You  didn't  show  that.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

didn't  just  establish  it  by  the  fact  of  the  deviation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  kind  of  evidence  did  you  present  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court? 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  I  think  in  this  case, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ this  case  is  a  very  unique  case  because,  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Wake  found  in  his  dissent,  the  chart  shows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statistically  that  there  was  systematic,  partisan 

 

 

 

 

 

malapportionment  done  for  that  partisan  reason.  Just

MR.  HEARNE:  Yes.  I  think  that  if  it  is  ­­

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It's  got  the  color  chart. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

 

MR.  HEARNE:  Yes.  And  it  shows  that  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

districts  were  systemically,  statistically 

 

 

 

malapportioned  for  that  purpose. 

 

 

 

            

So  that  would  be  the  kind  of  showing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia,  that  you  would  be  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  I  ­­ I  thought  ­­ I  ­­ I 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

thought,  Mr.  Hearne,  that  you  were  saying  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  thing  that  you  had  presented  had  to  do  with  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impermissible  motive,  and  the  impermissible  motive  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  didn't  have  to  do  all  this  for  Voting  Rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  compliance;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  I'd  say  there's  two  ­­ the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  impermissible  motive  or  illegitimate 

 

 

 

 

 

justification  is  partisanship,  to  gain  an  advantage  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Right.  But  that's  the  very 

  

  

 

 

 

 

thing  that  you  said,  you  weren't  challenging  the  factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding,  that  that  was  a  subsidiary  part  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting. 

            

            

MR.  HEARNE:  That  was  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  dominant  part  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

voting  rights  compliance,  and  I  take  it  you  want  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermine  the  voting  rights  compliance  rationale. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  then  I'm  stuck  on  the  same  question  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia  is  stuck  on,  is  what  evidence  did  you

present  that  ­­ that  there  was  an  impermissible  motive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  that,  as  opposed  to  different  views  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  what  the  Voting  Rights  Act  compelled. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Two  quick  answers  to  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan. 

 

            

First  is,  legally  the  justice  ­­ the  Voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights  Act  couldn't  compel  them  to  do  what  they  did,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  justification  legally  is  invalid. 

 

 

 

 

            

Secondly,  we  bring  up  that  point  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  shift  with  Arlington  Heights  and  Mt.  Healthy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  when  we  show  an  illegitimate  motive  partisanship, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  the  burden  ­­ task  falls  to  the  Commission  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justify  that. 

 

            

            

And  I  would  reserve  the  balance  of  my  time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

GENERAL  BRNOVICH:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice.  May  it  please  the  Court: 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Fortunately  or  unfortunately,  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  many  facts  that  are  not  in  dispute,  addressing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy's  questions.  The  State  does  not  dispute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Independent  Redistricting  Commission  did  indeed

draw  districts  of  unequal  population.  All  sides  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  these  deviations  were  not  random,  or  that  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  incidental. 

 

            

We  also  know,  and  the  record  shows  and  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  disagrees,  that  this  pattern  to  under­populate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minority  districts  was  done  to  help  create  or  further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability  to  elect  districts.  And  we  also  know  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  evidence  is  they  did  it  intentionally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  why  are  we  here  today?  In  the  background 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

versus  Reynolds  v.  Sims,  this  Court  has  always  held  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal  protection  is  not  a  criteria  ­­ another  factor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  comes  to  redistricting,  but  it  is  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  background  in  which  all  redistricting  ledges  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place. 

            

The  State  of  Arizona  and  the  Secretary  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  dispute  the  compliance  with  the  Voting  Rights  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  legitimate  or  is  a  legitimate  State  interest.  And 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

we  don't  dispute  that  maybe  there  was  an  ­­ a  good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive  on  the  part  of  drawing  these  districts.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  is  those  motives  don't  matter  when  what  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  undermining  of  the  fundamental  principle  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­person,  one­vote. 

 

            

So  in  this  case,  what  we  have  is  a  violation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  because  by  intentionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  systemically  under­populating  those  minority

ability­to­elect  districts,  the  IRC  violated  Equal 

 

 

 

 

 

Protection  Clause  in  that  principle  of  one­person, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­vote. 

            

So  essentially  what  happened  was  by 

 

 

 

 

 

overpopulating  the  other  districts,  the  voters  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overpopulated  districts  had  their  votes  diluted.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

by  ­­ by  diluting  those  votes,  it  violated  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  sounds  fundamental  that 

  

 

 

 

 

a  statute  can't  authorize  a  constitutional  violation,  so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  even  an  attempt  to  comply  with  the  Voting  Rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  is  not  sufficient  if  it  violates  the  Equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Protection  Clause. 

 

            

Have  we  ever  said  that  ­­ I  mean  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious,  but  have  we  ever  said  that  in  the  context  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  voting  rights  requires? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  Your  Honor,  this  ­­ this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  consistently,  from  Reynolds  v.  Sims,  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  held  that  the  concept  and  the  principle  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­person,  one­vote,  any  attempts  to  undermine  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  we  have  said  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

even  ­­ you  read  our  cases  saying  even  minor  deviations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  permitted  if  they  are  statutorily  required?

would  violate  the  one­person,  one­vote. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  that's  what  Judge  Wake 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  his  dissent. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  And  that's  exactly  what  Judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Wake  said  in  his  dissent. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  is  the  State's  position,  is  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  dispute  ­­ or  we're  not  saying  that  complying  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Voting  Rights  Act  may  indeed  be  a  legitimate  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  What  we  are  saying  is,  is  that  when  it's  done 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  systematic  way  where  you  have  a  one­way  ratchet, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  have  consistently  minority  ability­to­elect 

 

 

 

 

 

districts,  essentially  using  votes  based  on  racial  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ethnic  classifications,  and  under­populating  those 

 

 

 

 

districts  and  then  overpopulating  other  districts,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  done  is  essentially  undervalued  or  violated  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­person,  one­vote  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Would  you  say  it's  correct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  compliance  with  the  Voting  Rights  Act,  the  desire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  obtain  preclearance,  is  at  least  like  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional  districting  considerations,  like  respecting 

 

 

 

 

county  lines,  respecting  municipal  lines,  having 

 

 

 

 

 

contiguous  districts?  Would  you  agree  with  that?

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  if  ­­ if  that  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  then  is  this  what  you  were  asking  us  to  say  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  Voting  Rights  Act,  that  the  things  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  really  necessary  to  obtain  preclearance  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate,  but  you  can't  go  ­­ but  they  went  further. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  ­­ they  went  beyond  what  was  really  necessary  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain  preclearance,  so  we  would  have  to  determine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  that  was  true  or  not,  or  some  court  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  determine  whether  that  was  true  or  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  In  this  instance,  because  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  systematic  way  the  deviations,  the  under­population 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred,  as  well  as  the  intention  ­­ we  know  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Independent  Redistricting  Commission  that  they 

 

 

 

 

intentionally  under­populated  those  districts.  So  we 

  

 

 

 

 

have  all  that  evidence. 

 

 

 

            

However,  we  do  believe  that  the  Voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights  Act  is  like  any  other  criteria.  So  if  you  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  population  deviations  and  they're  incidental,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  ­­ and  that  is  the  key,  I  believe,  is  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  intentionally  under­populate  and  systemically 

 

 

 

 

under­populate  these  districts  ­­ that's  what  causes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  harm. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  what  if  the  only  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  ­­ that  a  State  could  obtain  preclearance  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  5  was  still  in  force  was  to  under­populate  some

districts?  Would  that  be  permissible? 

  

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  BRNOVICH:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Just  as  you  might  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  where  the  only  way  in  which  you  could  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipal  lines  or  county  lines  was  to  under­populate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  districts  to  some  degree. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  Justice  Alito,  the  irony  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  draft  maps;  seven  of  the  ten  minority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability­to­elect  districts  were  under­populated. 

 

 

 

However,  when  the  Independent  Redistricting  Commission 

 

 

 

 

 

went  from  the  draft  maps  to  the  final  maps,  there  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­way  ratchet.  They  intentionally  and  systemically 

  

 

 

 

 

under­populated  those  districts. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  Justice  Alito  can 

  

 

 

 

 

protect  his  own  question,  but  he's  asking  you  whether  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  deviation  is  permissible  for  protecting 

   

 

 

 

 

communities  of  interest,  protecting  municipal  lines, 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  some  slight  deviation  is  permissible. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  Yes.  Yes,  Justice  Kennedy, 

  

  

 

 

 

if  it's  incidental  and  not  intentional. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

that  means. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  I'm  not  sure  what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yes,  I'm  not  sure.  I  had 

    

  

 

 

 

 

thought  you  ­­ I  had  thought  you  were  saying  that  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  matter  whether  you  were  doing  it  to  obtain

that  is  unconstitutional. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  That  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  If  in  fact  you're  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  equally  apportioned  districts,  it  goes  beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  tolerable.  It's  a  violation,  regardless  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

whether  you're  ­­ you're  actually  trying  to  comply  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Justice  Department.  Isn't  that  what  you  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying? 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  Yes,  Justice  Scalia,  but  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  it's  important  to  note  that  we  look  at  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  qualitative  not  a  quantitative  analysis.  So  there 

   

   

  

 

 

 

isn't  like  some  magic  number  where  you  say  at  this  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  becomes  unconstitutional  or  it  doesn't. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  State's  position  is,  is  that  compliance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  Voting  Rights  Act  was  like  other  neutral  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional  criteria,  like  protecting,  as  Justice  Alito 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alluded  to,  communities  of  interest,  geographical 

 

 

 

 

 

boundaries.  And  so  in  that  ­­ in  considering  that,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  have  incidences  where  you  get  somebody  ­­ some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  above  or  below  the  line. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  fact  that  a  district  may  be  below  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  in  and  of  itself  is  not  a  constitutional  violation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  harm  occurs  when  the  Independent  Redistricting

says  we  want  to  respect  county  lines.  And  we  also  know

have,  basically,  some  leeway  up  to  10  percent.  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  there's  a  policy.  We  want  to  respect  county  lines, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  though  that's  going  to  cause  a  little  bit  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviation  on  the  one­person,  one­vote  metric.  Are  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  that's  impermissible?

MR.  BRNOVICH:  Justice  Kagan,  we  are 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It's  a  policy.  I  mean,  it's 

    

   

  

 

 

an  intentional  policy. 

 

 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  I  guess,  you  know,  the  road 

    

 

 

 

 

 

to  hell  is  paved  with  good  intentions.  And  so  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  is,  regardless  of  their  intention,  if  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  it  in  a  systematic  way  or  intending  to

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ in  the  sense  of  we  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  to  maintain  county  lines,  that's  impermissible? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  Yes,  Justice  Kagan.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

position  of  the  State  is  that  when  it's  done  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

systematic  and  intentional  manner,  when  you  create, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially,  barrios  of  ­­ boroughs,  excuse  me  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  folks,  and  then  you  overpopulate  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts,  that  violates  this  Court's  one­person, 

 

 

 

 

 

one­vote  principle. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  General  Brnovich,  just  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  curiosity,  how  do  you  end  up  being  on  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  of  the  case?  You  ­­ you  were  defended  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court,  weren't  you? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  The  ­­ the  Secretary  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  thought  the  principle  of  one­person,  one­vote  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upholding  that  principle  was  very,  very  important,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  we  felt  compelled  to  be  involved  in  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  but  only  on  appeal.

an  election  in  between  or  something? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  Yes,  and  I  won 

   

  

 

 

overwhelmingly. 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  knew  it. 

    

 

 

MR.  BRNOVICH:  Thanks.  Thank  you  very  much. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

I  will  be  up  for  reelection  in  three  more  years,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ...  anyway. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Do  you  ­­ do  you  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  your  colleague  that  it  doesn't  make  any  difference; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  the  end  result,  the  ­­ the  legislature  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Republicans  were  disproportionately  advantaged,  had 

 

 

 

 

 

a  disproportionate  share  of  the  seats? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BRNOVICH:  Yes,  Justice.  Our  ­­ our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

position  is,  is  that  that  really  is  irrelevant  as  far  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  numbers  ultimately,  whether  the  percentage  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Whether  it  would  have 

  

 

 

 

 

ended  up,  if  you're  right,  an  even  greater 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disproportion  ­­ a  greater  disproportion  of  Republican

MR.  BRNOVICH:  And  so  ultimately  the 

  

 

 

 

 

number  ­­ this  is  not  a  line  drawing  case;  this  is  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overpopulation/under­population  case.  So  how  the  lines 

  

 

 

 

 

are  drawn,  and  what  the  Republican  or  Democratic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation  is  in  the  State  House  or  the  State  Senate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  important  or  not  key  to  our  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  ­­ the  key  to  the  State's  argument  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  intentional  and  systematic  one­way  ratcheting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  under­populating  minority  ability­to­elect  districts 

 

 

 

 

is  what  undermines  the  one­person,  one­vote  principle, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  what  makes  the  actions  of  the  IRC  unconstitutional.

There  is  no  basis  for  concluding  that  the

Honor. 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Oh,  really?  Why?

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Predominant  motive.  That's 

  

  

 

 

MR.  SMITH:  It  said  that  ­­ that  there  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  two  of  the  five  commissioners  who,  as  to  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district,  District  8,  had  some  mixed  motives  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

urging  that  that  district  be  made  more  competitive,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  not  find  that  the  Commission  as  a  whole  acted,  even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  one  instance,  with  partisan  motivations,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ that  district  is  not  one  of  the  ones  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significantly  under­populated. 

 

            

The  decision  to  move  population  around  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  that  district  somewhat  more  competitive,  even  if  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  motivated  by  partisanship,  has  nothing  to  do  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we're  really  talking  about  here,  which  is  the  8.8

the  district  court  found  after  a  full  trial.  What  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

found,  after  giving  them  a  full  opportunity  to  try  to

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  the  district  court 

  

 

 

 

 

found  ­­ and  this  is  on  79a  of  the  Appendix  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jurisdictional  Statement  ­­ "partisanship  played  some 

 

 

 

 

 

role."  So  do  you  want  us  to  interpret  that  to  mean  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  there  was  no  partisanship,  everything  would  have  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  exactly  the  same  way?  It  had  no  affect  whatsoever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  districting? 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  What  the  court  said  was  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  changes  to  District  8,  which  by  the  way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remained  a  largely  Republican­leaning  competitive 

   

 

 

district,  that  two  of  the  commissioners  may  have  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed  motives,  both  thinking  about  aiding  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclearance  arguments  and  also  thinking  about  bringing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Democratic  party  up  closer  to  parity,  it  still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  get  to  parity. 

 

 

 

            

            

And  I  think  that  to  say  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  that's  a  ­­ that's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

red  herring.  We  don't  need  to  discuss  the  issue  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parity.  If  you  have  a  system  of  proportional 

   

  

 

 

 

 

representation  and  you  get  55  percent  of  the  vote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'll  get  55  percent  of  the  ­­ of  the  representatives. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  in  the  kind  of  electoral  system  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  United  States,  with  single­member  districts  and

What  do  we  do  with  this  statement:  Partisanship  played 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  role? 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Your  Honor,  partisanship  by 

  

 

 

 

 

itself  cannot  violate  the  Constitution.  You  have  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  ­­ even  if  it  ­­ even  if  you  inflate  that  far 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  what  was  intended  by  the  judges  who  wrote  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion,  the  case  of  Gaffney  v.  Cummings  was  a  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  had  partisanship  being  the  dominant, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlling  factor  in  every  single  line  that  was  drawn. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  This  is  what  ­­ this  is  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  me  about  the  case.  If  we  assume,  as  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  did,  that  partisanship  is  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate  consideration,  and  it's  not,  like,  respecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

county  lines,  and  if  we  interpret  the  district  court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  as  finding  that  partisanship  was  part  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  for  the  plan  that  was  adopted,  then  is  the  test, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Mt.  Healthy  test  ­­ which  in  my  understanding  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  normally  apply  in  a  constitutional  mixed  motive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation. 

            

So  that  if  an  illegitimate,  unconstitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration  is  one  of  the  reasons,  the  burden  shifts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  defendant  to  show  that  things  would  have  come  out

the  same  way,  even  if  that  factor  had  not  been  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  or  is  it  what  the  court  said  in  Bush  v.  Vera  and  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

few  other  cases,  that  in  this  particular  context,  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  test?  The  test  is  whether  the  illegitimate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor  there,  race,  was  the  predominant  consideration. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  that's  ­­

of  the  question,  which  I  think  are  counterfactual,  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  opinion  and  ­­ and  what  was  found  here  and  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  it  does  seem  to  me  that  even  if  you're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  partisanship  something  illegitimate  and 

 

 

 

 

redistricting,  which  seems  kind  of  like  a  fool's  errand, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

frankly,  it  ought  to  at  least  have  to  be  predominate.  I

that  it's  illegal  to  consider  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  that's  one  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

issues  in  the  case.  We'll  talk  about  that  later,  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship.  If  you  ­­ if  you  want  to  say  it  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  any  difference  because  partisanship  is  ­­ is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid  consideration,  fine.  That's  your  point.  But  my 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is,  it  sounds  to  me,  in  response  to  your  answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Justice  Alito,  that  you're  saying  that  it  is  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  use  an  illegal  standard,  in  part,  to  reduce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal  ­­ equal  representation. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  For  all  the  same  reasons  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  has  many  times  said  we're  not  going  to  say  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial  consciousness  is  enough  to  invalidate  it  unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  predominates,  I  would  think  you  would  want  to  follow 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  approach,  even  if  you're  going  to  adopt  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parity  between  racial  considerations  and  partisan 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations,  which  makes  no  sense.  You're  entire 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Shaw  v.  Reno  line  of  cases  is  about  trying  to  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  race  or  party,  and  when  you  come  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  easily  that  it's  party,  then  it's  okay.

you're  arguing  that  partisanship  is  a  valid 

   

 

 

 

 

consideration  in  redistricting?  Is  that  what  you  want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  to  say? 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  You  ­­ you  ­­ you  certainly  can, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  You  said  it  last  year  in  the  Alabama  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  said  political  affiliation  is  one  of  the  legitimate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional  redistricting  criteria  that  line  drawers 

 

 

 

 

 

always  can  consider.  That  it's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  the  problem. 

  

 

 

 

There  ­­ there  is  ­­ I'm  suddenly  waking  up  here  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  ­­

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  That's  your  opinion,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well  ­­ well,  how  ­­ how  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ it's  a  ­­ how  ­­ how  do  we  write  this?  There  are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  areas  that  are  difficult  to  write. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One  is,  I  know  there  is  this  10  percent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule,  but  it  doesn't  say  we  don't  look  at  it  at  all.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institutionally  can't  review  thousands  of  pages  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  in  every  redistricting  case.  So  what  are  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  there  that  describe  the  standard  we  should  bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  this? 

 

            

And  the  second,  which  is  a  direct 

   

 

 

 

 

application  of  the  first,  is  you're  quite  right.  How 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  we  say  that  partisanship  can't  be  used  at  all  when

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  I  didn't  ask  you  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

we  shouldn't  say.  I  asked  you  what  we  should  say. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  What  you  should  say  is  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  should  apply  is  the  rule  that  ­­ that  applied  in  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  these  cases  about  minor  population  deviations:  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  a  rational,  legitimate  policy  that  the  State  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

articulate  which  is  the  reason  why  they  arrived  at  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference?  And  here  we  have,  the  Voting  Rights  Act  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rational  and  legitimate  State  policy. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  let's  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

let's  talk  about  that  for  a  second.  If  action  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting  or  overpopulation  would  constitute 

 

 

 

 

illegitimate  racial  discrimination,  can  the  answer  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  doing  that  to  comply  to  get  preclearance  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Department  legitimize  that? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  This  Court  has 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  a  number  of  times  that  complying  with  the  Voting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights  Act  is  a  compelling  State  interest.  It  ­­ it

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  my  ­­ my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  if  the  action  that  is  taken  would  otherwise

discrimination  on  the  basis  of  effects. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SMITH:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  I'm  wondering  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  somehow  different.  If  the  Justice  Department  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

insisting  on  conduct  that  would  constitute  a  violation, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

if  they're  insisting  on  more  than  they  should  be,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  defense  for  the  ­­ for  the  redistricting? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  Your  Honor,  the  one  thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  clear,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  is  that  the  Voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rights  Act  does  require  people  drawing  lines  to  consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race.  And  Section  5  required  it  to  avoid  retrogression. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2  requires  it  right  now. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  understand  that. 

    

 

 

 

MR.  SMITH:  So  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  it  doesn't  say

the  line  this  Court  has  drawn  is  between  maps  which  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too  far  and  maps  which  don't,  maps  in  which  the  racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations  predominate  and  subordinate  all  other 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional  districting  principles  here.  And  what  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  in  this  case  is  the  quintessential  map  where  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  true,  where  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  avoiding  my  question. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SMITH:  Sorry. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

requirements  that  the  Justice  Department  asks  for,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclearance  go  too  far? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  I  think  if  the  ­­ the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Department  reads  the  Voting  Rights  Act  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manner  that  requires  them  to  do  something  that  would  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too  far  in  the  predominant  sense,  there  might  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  problem.  There's  no  indication  here  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  happens.  Nobody  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right.  So  ­­ so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  preclearance  is  a  defense  depends  upon 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  Justice  Department  is  insisting  on  too  much. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  It  ­­ it  could  be,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  ­­ but  there's  no  indication  of  anything  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  that  here.  This  is  a  case  where  they  simply  said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  retrogression.  This  is  not  like  the  '90s,  where  they

were  saying  you  have  to  create  new  districts,  no  matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  ugly,  to  comply  with  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Look  at  the  finding  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

support  what  the  ­­ the  Chief  Justice  is  drawing  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

While  partisanship  played  a  role  in  the  increased 

   

 

 

 

 

 

population  deviation  associated  with  changing 

 

 

 

 

District  8,  so,  too,  did  the  preclearance  goal  play  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

role  in  motivating  the  change.  It's  the  first  half  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sentence  which  is  raising  the  issue  that  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  are  trying  to  ­­ to  get  you  to  say  how  we  write 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  You  see?  Because  it  says  it  played  a  role. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  we're  going  to  be  asked  here  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  side  to  expand  on  what  that  means,  "play  a  role," 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we  have  to  write  an  opinion.  And  if  you  win  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  there  will  have  to  be  words  that  support  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  how  do  we  take  this  thing?  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  you  say  about  the  words  "play  a  role"? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  I  would  say  two  things,  Your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Honor. 

            

First  of  all,  it's  a  tiny  role  in  this  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  second  of  all,  even  if  it  were  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  why  you  had  a  ­­ population  deviations  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent,  I  think  it  would  be  not  defensible  for  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  to  say  that,  by  itself,  is  unconstitutional.

it's  simply  not  something  that  ought  to  be  taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seriously  as  a  constitutional  problem. 

   

 

 

            

But  here,  where  the  predominant  motive  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  make  sure  these  districts  will  pass  preclearance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  less  than  50  ­­ 50  percent  of  the  commissioners  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  had,  for  one  district,  where  they  increased  the

partisanship  as  well  as  the  Voting  Rights  Act  in  mind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  District  8.  Not  one  of  the  ten  that  were  offered  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Justice  Department  as  ability­to­elect  districts. 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  a  tiny,  tiny,  tiny  sliver  of  partisanship  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  than  the  full  commission.  It  was  never  ­­

an  egregious  gerrymander,  massive  disparate  pairing  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbents,  plus  the  not  ­­ intentional  abuse  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  rule  at  9.98  percent,  all  of  that  together, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  summarily  affirmed  a  finding  of  unconstitutionality.

and  over  again,  we  want  to  give  States  leeway  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area,  because  representation  is  often  better  if  you  give

band.  And  if  you  allow  them  to  do  what's  ­­ what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  suggested  here,  to  accuse  ­­ to  bring  partisanship 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  and  they  can  get  to  Federal  court  and  they  can  get  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  just  by  that,  then  exactly  what  you  said  is  going

partisanship,  leaving  aside  the  little  story  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  8,  is  simply  the  pattern,  that  the  Hispanic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  they  under­populated  and  the  Native  American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  happened  to  vote  Democratic.  So  you  have  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pattern.  The  chart  on  ­­ they  point  to  on  page  112a, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  that's  not  evidence.  It's  equally  consistent  with

make  these  districts  more  persuasive  as  ability­to­elect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  so  they  could  get  preclearance.  And  voila,

It's  within  the  10  percent  boundary.  They  ­­ they  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  in  open. 

 

 

            

Everything  that  ­­ that's  being  complained 

 

 

 

 

 

about  here,  all  of  this  under­population  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  that  was  done  at  the  ­­ was  done  unanimously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  all  five  commissioners  who  adopted  the  goal  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  preclearance,  who  adopted  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  idea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  had  to  get  10  districts,  not  eight  districts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  every  single  change  to  those  10  districts  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increased  their  under­population  was  unanimously  voted 

 

 

 

 

 

by  all  five  commissioners.  This  is  a  case  where  there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  simply  nothing  seriously  being  argued  here  that  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibly  amount  to  a  constitutional  violation. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  it  seems  to  me  that  we  can  talk  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  a  pure  partisan  case  ought  to,  by  itself,  if  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  ­­ if  the  only  problem  is  deviation,  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional,  I  would  recommend  that  you  not  do  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  reasons  you  said  in  your  dissent  in  Larios.

preclearance. 

            

The  State  of  Arizona  wants  very  much  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  map  go  into  effect  for  the  first  time  since  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1960s  when  it  became  covered  by  the  Voting  Rights  Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than  having  a  Federal  court  have  to  put  the  map 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  effect  because  preclearance  was  denied. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  they  ­­ they  hire  lawyers  who  worked  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Justice  Department,  told  them  how  many  districts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  needed,  told  them  that  if  necessary  in  rejiggering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  lines,  they  could  go  down  ­­ up  to  the  10  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit.  They  then  tried  very  hard  to  minimize  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  one  of  the  things  that's  important  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  here  is  you  could  have  probably  equalized  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population  here  and  still  gotten  districts  to  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

level  of  Hispanic  population,  but  you  would  have  had  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draw  tentacles  of  the  kind  that  the  Court  has  many  times 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criticized.  There's  lots  and  lots  of  other  Hispanic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  in  the  State  of  Arizona  who  are  not  in  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts,  but  that's  because  they're  spread  out  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  the  place. 

 

 

            

And  so  if  you're  going  to  draw  compact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts,  if  you're  going  to  draw  districts  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  county  boundaries,  if  you're  going  ­­ and  census 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tracts  and  communities  of  interests,  something  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give.  And  what  gave  here  was  this  modest,  tiny,  small

amount  of  population  variation  that  seems  to  me  just  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  serious  candidate  for  any  kind  of  constitutional

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  SARAH  E.  HARRINGTON 

 

 

 

 

 

    

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE,  SUPPORTING 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

APPELLEE  ARIZONA  INDEPENDENT  REDISTRICTING  COMMISSION 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice,  and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  question  in  this  case  is  not  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  5  can  compel  deviations  from  a  perfect 

   

   

 

 

 

population  standard.  The  question  is  whether  de  minimis 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviations  are  permitted  by  the  Constitution.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  made  very  clear  that  when  State  districting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans  are  within  the  10  percent  deviation,  total 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviation  from  a  perfect  population  equality  standard, 

   

 

 

 

 

those  plans  are  presumed  to  be  constitutional. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that  presumption  is  a  substantive  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

that  serves  three  important  principles. 

 

 

 

 

            

Just  if  I  can  briefly  tick  them  off,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  is  that  such  de  minimis  deviations  do  not  by

themselves  violate  equal  protection.  The  second  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving  States  a  10  percent  leeway  actually  enhances 

   

 

 

 

 

 

citizens'  fair  and  equal  representation  by  allowing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  to  pursue  other  important  districting  principles. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  third  is  that  limiting  Federal  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervention  in  de  minimis  deviation  cases  protects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's  sovereign  right  to  draw  districts  for  their  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  ­­ is  10  percent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  de  minimis?  I  mean,  I  think  you  can  say  it's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor,  but  de  minimis  strikes  me  as  misleading  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  talking  about  10  percent. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  I  certainly  don't 

   

  

 

 

mean  to  be  misleading  about  this  term  that  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  used  ­­

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  know  it  has,  yes. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  I  would  never  accuse  the 

    

 

 

 

 

Court  of  being  misleading.  I  mean,  I  think  the  point 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Court  has  made  is  that  these  sort  of,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  deviations  from  perfect  population  equality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  enough  of  a  dilutive  effect  to  really  affect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  citizen's  right  to  fair  and  equal  ­­

side  is  willing  to  ­­ to  concede  that  it's  presumptively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay,  which  means  they  have  to  come  forward  to  show  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  invalid  reasons  why  there  is  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrepancy.  Right? 

  

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  That's  true.  And  our  view, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia,  is  that  the  case  should  begin  and  end  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prima  facie  case  requirement.  Our  view  is  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  did  not  make  a  prima  facie  case  of  invidious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination  in  this  case,  and  so  the  district  court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual  findings  about  the  Commission's  actual  motives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  aren't  relevant  at  this  point. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  understand  that.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

thought  a  prima  facie  case  means  if  ­­ if  you  haven't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  a  prima  facie  case,  it  means  you  have  to  bring  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  evidence.  It  doesn't  mean  you're  out  of  court. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  if  you  haven't  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  prima  facie  case,  it  means  that  the  State  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  justify  its  reasons  for  the  deviations.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  context,  in  order  to  make  ­­ in  really  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context,  to  make  a  prima  facie  case,  what  you  have  to  do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  put  in  enough  evidence  from  which  an  inference  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invidious  discrimination  can  be  made. 

 

 

 

 

            

What  that  generally  requires  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenger  has  to  put  in  enough  in  evidence  to  rebut  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumed  reasons  for  the  challenged  action.  In  this

So  are  you  saying  that  that  finding  can't  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sustained  because  it  wasn't  based  on  sufficient  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  forward  by  the  plaintiffs? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  first,  just  a  point 

   

  

 

 

 

of  clarification.  Part  of  the  opinion  that  you  read  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  talking  about  District  8,  and  so  it  wasn't  defining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  partisanship  played  any  role  with  respect  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest  of  the  map.  And  if  you  read  on  in  the  paragraph 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  which  you  were  quoting,  the  district  court  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  amount  of  deviation  that  was  attributable  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  attempts  to  make  the  district  more  competitive  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  than  1  percent.  I  think  it  was  .7  percent. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  so  it's  really  a  small,  very  small  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  was  it  a  factor  or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

not?  Was  partisanship  just  irrelevant,  that  it  played 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  role,  everything  would  have  come  out  the  same  way  ­­

MS.  HARRINGTON:  The  district  court  found  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ without  partisanship 

  

 

 

 

according  the  district  court's  finding? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  The  district  court  found 

  

 

 

 

 

that  with  respect  to  one  district,  two  of  the  five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commissioners  were  motivated  in  part  by  ­­ by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship  motives. 

 

            

But,  again,  our  ­­ our  first  position  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  Court  doesn't  need  to  get  to  what  the  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

findings  were  as  to  the  motives  because  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  needed  to  do  was  come  in  and  demonstrate  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  front  end  that  the  lines  on  the  map  couldn't  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained  as  an  effort  to  comply  with  legitimate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districting  criteria.

permissible  to  intentionally  take  partisanship  ­­ to  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship  as  a  guiding  principle  in  redistricting? 

   

 

 

 

 

Is  that  permissible  or  not? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  We  haven't  taken  a  position 

   

  

 

 

 

on  that  that  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  know  you  haven't.

us  to  address  it  since  that's  one  of  the  main  questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  case. 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  the  United  States  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

never  participated  in  the  political  gerrymandering 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  It  certainly  ­­ you  know,  there  are  lessons  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  drawn  from  this  Court's  cases.  In  Gaffney,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  indicated  that  certainly  consideration  of  politics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  partisanship  does  not  necessarily  make  a  plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional. 

            

But,  again,  in  this  case,  I  think  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

order  ­­ before  you  even  get  to  the  question  of  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's  actual  motives  were,  there  has  to  be  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstration  that  the  motives  were  not  the  announced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motives  that  are  in  the  Arizona  Constitution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you're  ­­ you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

unwilling  to  tell  me  whether  intentional  use  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship  in  redistricting  is  acceptable  or  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  I  think  this  Court's 

   

  

 

 

 

decision  in  Gaffney  indicates  that  it  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissible.  The  districting  body  in  Gaffney  was  driven 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  a  desire  to  equalize  partisanship  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  took  it  that  the  position 

    

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  United  States  is  at  least,  since  many  commissions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  nonpartisan  because  they  have  two  people  who  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  partisan  on  one  side,  two  people  on  the  other  side

commissions  ­­ commissioners  don't  account  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority,  the  partisan  motive  is  not  held  by  a  majority 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  commission,  then  it  is  constitutional  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  That  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ for  some  members  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

commission  to  take  partisan  considerations  into  account 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  they're  not  a  majority  and  where  the  result  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  10  percent. 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  I  think  that  was  the 

    

 

 

 

 

district  court's  conclusion.  Our  position  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  your  conclusion  as 

  

 

 

 

 

representing  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  again,  we  haven't 

  

 

 

 

 

taken  a  position  on  how  one  would  analyze  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship  ­­ if  there  was  a  finding  that  you  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  about  a  partisanship  ­­ partisanship  motive. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  ­­

saying,  well,  two  members  of  the  commission  out  of  five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  have  a  partisan  motive,  in  part. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  I  have  to  ­­ you  have

pitch  one  more  time  for  the  ­­ for  having  a  robust  prima 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facie  case. 

 

            

So  the  ­­ what  the  Plaintiff  needed  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  come  into  this  ­­ come  into  court  and  say,  here  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

map;  it  can't  be  explained  by  the  criteria  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  in  the  Constitution  that  the  Commission  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  go  by.  The  very  first  criterion  listed  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Constitution  is  complying  ­­ includes  compliance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  Voting  Rights  Act. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  look  at  the  map  and  you  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  ­­ which  districts  were  under­populated  and  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  ability­to­elect  districts,  there's  almost  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfect  correlation.  And  I  think  ­­ I  think  that  was  a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly  legitimate  explanation  for  why  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviations  in  the  case. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  understand  this  two 

    

 

 

 

 

out  of  five.  Do  you  ­­ do  you  think  if  four  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justices  of  this  Court  voted  a  certain  way  in  a  case 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  were  racists,  the  opinion  would  still  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid  because,  after  all,  five  of  us  weren't?  Would  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  consider  that?  And  why  is  it  any  different  for  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ for  a  commission  like  this?  The  mere  fact  that  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  them  are  ­­ if  ­­ if  partisanship  is  indeed  bad  ­­

that  no  members  of  a  redistricting  commission  can  ever 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  ­­ can  ever  have  partisan  views,  I  don't  know  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to  get  your  membership  from. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean  that  ­­ that  is  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  many  of  these  commissions,  I  would  think,  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance  people  who  know  about  districting  and  who  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  Republicans  with  people  who  know  about  it  and  are

neutral  ­­

here,  by  the  way. 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  I'm  sorry  to  interrupt. 

  

 

 

 

 

This  Court  has  repeatedly  said  that  politics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  always  going  to  be  a  part  of  redistricting.  And  so  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  ­­

 

 

            

            

­­

court's  opinion.  In  footnote  10  of  the  district  court's

please? 

            

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Can  you  give  me  the  page, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It's  on  62  ­­ I'm  sorry  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63a,  running  over  into  64a.  And  in  the  ­­ the  final 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph  that  begins  at  the  bottom  of  the  page,  "For 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  purposes,  a  majority  of  the  panel  made  up  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Clifton  and  Judge  Silver  have  concluded  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plaintiffs  have  not  demonstrated  that  partisanship 

 

 

 

 

 

predominated  over  legitimate  redistricting 

 

 

 

considerations."

the  opinion.  I  think  ­­ I  haven't  heard  the  other  side 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree  with  that,  but  you  can  ask  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  know,  if  this  Court  makes  it  too  easy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  plaintiffs  to  come  in  and  point  to  deviations  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisan  correlations,  then  it's  going  to  totally  wipe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away  the  10­percent  leeway,  which  itself  serves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  districting  principles. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,

General  Hearne,  you  have  four  minutes 

 

 

 

 

 

         

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MARK  F.  HEARNE,  II 

 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  APPELLANTS 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  about  footnote  10?  Do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you  agree  with  ­­ with  the  characterization  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  side  has  made?

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  footnote  10,  no,  I  do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

And  the  portion  I  would  quote  was  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

not. 

            

limited  just  to  District  8.  Partisanship  was  rank  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  redistricting  process,  and  is  demonstrated 

 

 

 

 

 

objectively,  not  just  with  Judge  Wake's  chart.  But  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  demonstrated  by  the  fact  of  District  8,  which  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  submitted  for  preclearance. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  want  a  finding.  I  want  a 

    

    

   

 

 

finding.  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  want  to  look  at  a  chart  ­­

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ to  make  my  own  factual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination. 

            

is  there? 

 

            

What  factual  finding  other  than  footnote  10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  HEARNE:  Then  I  would  quote  from  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Appendix  at  107a,  which  is  where  the  statement's  made, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Judge  Clifton  correctly  finds  that  the  IRC  was  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivated  by  both  partisan  advantage  and  hope  for  voting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  preclearance." 

 

            

fact. 

            

So  we  have  a  majority  for  that  finding  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  that  is  two  members  of  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  found  that  partisanship  was  one  of  the  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motives  to  explain  these  deviations  from  one­person,

one­vote.  So  clearly,  it  was  a  motive  at  that  point,  as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  Judge  Silver  noted,  this  is  a  mixed­motive  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yes,  but  to  what  extent?  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  the  other  side's  going  to  say,  yes,  that's  true, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it's  only  true  as  to  that  one  district  discussed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote  10. 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  if  that's  so,  then  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  stopped  and  adopted  the  initial  map  and  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continued  to  deviate  from  4  percent  to  8  percent  for  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  map.  The  initial  map,  the  draft  map,  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4­percent  deviation. 

 

            

Dr.  King,  their  own  expert,  said  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

map  complied  with  the  Voting  Rights  Act.  And  yet,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went  after  that  and  continued  deviating  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under­populating  districts  to  get  to  the  8.8  percent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  included  the  machinations  with  District  8. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  the  only  legitimate  reason  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain  preclearance,  then  they  would  have  accepted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draft  map,  and  it  would  have  been  game  over.  But  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't.  They  went  ahead  and  conducted  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

deviations  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  thought  it  was  because 

    

 

 

 

 

they  wanted  to  make  super  sure  that  they  complied  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Voting  Act.  I  think  ­­ I  think  that  that's  why  they 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  they  kept  going.

MR.  HEARNE:  The  explanation  that  was  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  they  were,  quote,  "strengthening"  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  by  continuing  to  under­populate  districts 

 

 

 

 

 

because  their  consultant  said,  oh,  that  does  help  us  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Voting  Rights  Act  preclearance  approval.  That  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation  made. 

 

            

But  if  their  own  expert  said  the  original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

map,  the  draft  map  satisfied  the  Voting  Rights  Act,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  reason  to  additionally  depopulate  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

districts  was  to  achieve  a  further  partisan  skew,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Wake's  chart  demonstrates,  then  that  shows  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship  was  a  very  ­­ I  understand  two  of  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

members  said  that  it  was  not  the  primary  motive,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  was  a  pervasive  motive  in  the  process  by  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  districts  were  drawn. 

 

 

 

            

And  our  position  is  a  very  narrow  one  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  ask  the  Court  to  hold,  is  that  partisanship  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justify  deviating  from  one­person,  one­vote,  and  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistaken  belief  that  preclearance  was  necessary  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under­populate  certain  districts  also  does  not  justify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deviating  from  one­person,  one­vote. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  where  ­­ where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  district  in  which  ­­ or  the  State  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship  does  not  play  a  role  in  redistricting? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  Well,  we  think  partisanship  is

always  going  to  play  a  role.  We  ­­ we  would  say,  but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  an  outer  limit,  as  certainly  ­­ as  ­­ as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia  noted,  a  articulateable,  justiciable 

   

 

 

 

standard  of  one­person,  one­vote.  That's  a  rule  that  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  cabin  the  partisanship. 

 

 

 

            

You  can  be  partisan.  And  we  don't  fault  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commission  for  having  partisan  interests,  Republican 

 

 

 

 

 

members,  Democrat  members.  Even  if  this  fifth  member 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ended  up  being  partisan  interest  for  the  Democrats, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  fine.  The  problem  here  isn't  that  they  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisan  motives.  It's  that  they  deviated  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­person,  one­vote  principle  to  further  those  partisan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motives.  And  that's  what  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  I  could  ask  the  ­­ the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  Ms.  Harrington  left  with,  was  that  ­­ I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry. 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  please.  Finish. 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Even  ­­ if  ­­ if  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  even  within  the  10  percent,  you  know,  to  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  1  percent  to  2  percent,  or  from  2  percent  to 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

3  percent,  and  then  somebody  can  come  in  and  say  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partisanship,  it  means  that  every  single  plan  will  be  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  grabs  in  every  single  place,  doesn't  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HEARNE:  I  don't  think  it  does.  And  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer  would  be  it  doesn't,  because  in  this  case,  there
