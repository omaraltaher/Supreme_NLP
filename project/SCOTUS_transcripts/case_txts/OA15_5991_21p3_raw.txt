ORAL ARGUMENT OF KOREN L. BELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MS. BELL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Clause (1) of the Federal Bank Fraud Statute

16 

17

22 

23

25 

premises culpability on intent to defraud a financial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

institution, and this case concerns what that element 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entails.  The settled meaning of clause (1)'s text based 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on a century of this Court's precedent, its fraud 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent, makes clear that intent to defraud a bank 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires intent both to deceive the bank and wrong the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank in its own property rights.  Intent to wrong a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank's property rights, which includes its own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possessory rights, in bank-held property means intent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause the bank, not the customer, to bear the proper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loss of a fraud scheme.  And in this sense --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Possessory 

  

  

 

 

right means I own something.  I'm holding it.  In most 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

criminal charges for larceny, the issue is whether I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a possessory right, regardless of what I want to do 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

with this property, over you who's taken it from me.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where do you get the next step that possessory right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means I have to lose something of value or that I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to ultimately bear the loss?  Isn't the loss 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merely the loss of the possessory right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

MS. BELL:  Your Honor, the statute turns on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

intent, and were the government to prove the defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent to deprive of you of your possessory right, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would be sufficient.  And where that comes from is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from this Court's settled fraud precedent.  Going back a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundred years, the Court has interpreted the term 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"defraud" to mean property lost to the victim.  And we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see that --

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So if you're insured and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

the -- or at least the defendant believes he's insured, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it isn't theft? 

 

 

17 

            

MS. BELL:  If the defendant believes that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

the bank is insured and therefore that another party 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will bear the loss? 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Even Kardashian's thief, if 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

there is one, believes that all that jewelry is insured. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indeed over insured.  So it's not theft? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MS. BELL:  Well, so it would depend on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

language of the statute. 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it says defraud.  She 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

5 

lied.  He says I'm knocking on the door -- you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll go as far as you want.  But I don't see that that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has anything to do with it.  You mean if he -- if he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defrauds him out of the money, he defrauds her out of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jewelry, says here I a.m., your local jewelry 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cleaner.  Gets the jewelry.  Wouldn't you think that was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud?  Even if she's insured.  Even if he thinks she's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

triple insured.  Even if he thinks that, in fact, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't even her jewelry, that it was just loaned her on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occasion by a good friend, the necklace.

10 

11 

            

MS. BELL:  It would depend on whether the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

statute in that case required the intent to defraud --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

defraud. 

15 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What the statute says is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. BELL:  Defraud.  In that case it's much 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

like the mail and wire fraud statutes which do not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specify a required victim for the fraud scheme, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore provided the government could prove the two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undisputed components of the term "defraud" which come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

from --

 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not asking you to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

repeat it.  I'm asking you, if the local person comes to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the door and says, dear Miss Kardashian, I a.m. your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

local jewelry cleaner.  Please give me your jewelry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

She does.  And that's not fraud.  He wanted to get the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

jewelry.  He tried to get the -- he also believed that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the friend had just loaned it for the evening, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she's triple insured, that she won't even lose any money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the publicity will be worth it.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

MS. BELL:  Right.  And that --

  

  

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, my question is: 

  

 

 

 

 

There's the statute.  I would have always thought from 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

first year of law school, criminal law, that that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud, but perhaps I was wrong.  So I would like you to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

explain it. 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  That would be a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme to defraud the insurer.  If the scheme -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- and in this case of the mail and wire fraud 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes which penalize a scheme to defraud anyone, for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, and provide heightened penalties for schemes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that defraud anyone and happen to affect the bank, then, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes, that would -- would satisfy the statute.  But if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute specified a particular victim as clause (1) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

does here, and clause (1) says the intended victim must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the bank, not the customer. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so our argument depends on that -- on --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on two steps based on this Court's long-standing fraud 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent.  The first is how we define defraud.  But the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second is the presence of the direct object there.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the example that Your Honor posited, there -- there was

no required object of the fraud scheme, and therefore at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the very least it would certainly constitute a scheme to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain money or property by means of false pretenses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You get -- you get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mired in some very abstract concepts of property rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yes, someone is insured, but here if they keep getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their property stolen, their insurance rates go up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here, okay, it wasn't that if you -- correct, it wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bank's own property, but it's somebody else's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property that they use in making loans.  And, again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they will have less money to make loans if the property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is being taken. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, does your case turn on what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant knows even if that's not right?  I mean, the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument may as well -- people commonly think you put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your money in the bank, it's your money, and they'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give it back, but of course it's loaned out by the bank. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But if the defendant really thinks I'm not -- I don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to take anything from the bank.  I'm taking this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from two -- and he's wrong, is -- is he off the hook? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  So first of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

all, the standard here is not what he knows but what he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intends, which this Court, going back to the Durland case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1896, has equated with purpose, which makes sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because we're talking about a scheme which is a plan 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

with a purpose.  And precisely for that reason this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

particular liability scheme avoids the effect-based 

 

 

 

 

 

technicalities that the government complains of, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't matter whether the bank in fact has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possessory interest or whether the insurer is going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in fact bear the loss.  The only thing that matters is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as Your Honor says what the defendant intends, what his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose is in devising this scheme. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is that 

  

 

 

 

 

making -- is that ignorance of the law being the defense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the law -- he thinks the bank -- the bank 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have any property interest at all, but in fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bank has the property interest as either a bailee or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bailor or -- I forget which one it is -- and the bank 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has the property interest because it actually uses the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money in its own effect, but he's wrong about that legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of property.  So his ignorance of the law is a

23 

            

MS. BELL:  Your Honor, it wouldn't be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ignorance of the law.  This -- there's nothing anomalous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about an intent-based liability scheme.  And the answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that particular fraud scheme would be punished under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause (2) of this statute.  It's not that it's not bank

Do you recognize, do you concede that Shaw could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been charged and convicted under the obtaining property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owned by or under the custody or control of a financial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institution if the -- if the government had charged that

7

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

the appropriate charge in this case.  And the reason why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bank fraud statute works as a whole exactly as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress intended based on this intent-based liability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme is because the schemes that arise in the federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits sort neatly into clause (1), clause (2), or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both depending on the design of the scheme.  So the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design is in most every practical case in every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real-world example going to reflect the intent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, design here, the 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

intent here is to harm whoever has a lawful possessory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

interest. 

19 

            

MS. BELL:  Your Honor, the intent required 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

under clause (1) -- and that's quite clear because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifies the bank -- is to harm the bank in its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

property right. 

 

23 

            

24 

interest --

 

25 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it has a possessory

interest is harmed.  It's the harm to the interest, not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the harm to the entity. 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MS. BELL:  It -- it -- in fact it may be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

harmed, although in this case, of course this is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example where the banks never suffered any loss, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was no dispute on that point.  But certainly, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, it's true that the --

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it was -- was it not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

harm to the possessory interest? 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  Insofar as the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

bank was deprived for a momentary period of those funds 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in its coffers, yes, in fact it was deprived. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Ms. Bell, I guess -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

guess what Justice Kennedy is suggesting and maybe I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confused about the same thing, it now seems to me that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no difference between your view and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

government's view. 

 

19 

            

So, Mr. Yang, I'm putting you on notice that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

this is a question to you too, because both of you are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, look, there needs to be an intent to deceive the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

bank. 

23 

            

24 

            

MS. BELL:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And there needs to be an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

intent to deprive the bank of some form of property

interest, but with the recognition that property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests includes possessory interests, as well as more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classic ownership interests.  And you agree with that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm going to think, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Yang you'll tell me, that Mr. Yang would agree with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that too.  So what are we fighting about? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Then it's just -- Mr. Yang 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would say, well, look, a bank has a possessory interest 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

in assets that are part of its depositor's account, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so, you know, that's -- whether you target the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depositor's account or you target something else, you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still manifesting the same intent to deprive the bank of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a property including possessory interest. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Right.  I understand, Your Honor. 

    

  

 

 

 

I think there are two issues here.  The first one is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether an intent to deceive is sufficient for an intent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to defraud.  And the Ninth Circuit approved of jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions that permitted a conviction on that basis. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

That alone --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That seems right to me.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

want to point, you know, that you might say all of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is right and that the government and you agree, and what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you really disagree on is whether these instructions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

reflected that correct understanding of the law.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that seems fair to me.  And we should talk about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

instructions. 

4 

            

5 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it seems to me that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

understanding of the law is now you are in perfect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

harmony. 

8 

            

MS. BELL:  It -- it -- it may be the case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

but let me explain.  I think that on the -- the second 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prong, in terms of if intent to deceive requires more --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm sorry -- if intent to defraud requires more than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just intend to deceive, what is that second piece?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there we get to what it means to wrong a bank and its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

property rights. 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What it says in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

instructions is, "Intent to deceive, cheat, or deprive a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial institution of something of value." 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

would --

 

20 

            

21 

            

MS. BELL:  Correct, Your Honor.  And that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what's the problem? 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. BELL:  That would -- because it's worded 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

in a disjunctive, in other words, or, it permits a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction on the basis --

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So the "or" goes between 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

"to deceive, cheat, or deprive." 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

MS. BELL:  Correct.  And so it was --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But what you have to cheat, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

deceive, or deprive them of, is something of value. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

5 

            

MS. BELL:  Correct, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And a possessory interest 

   

  

 

 

6 

is something of value.  So what are you arguing about? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MS. BELL:  Your Honor, two things.  First of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

all, the -- I would disagree, respectfully, with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's interpretation of -- of the scheme to defraud 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction.  I do not think that the "deprive the bank 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of something of value" is plausibly read to modify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"deceive" and "cheat." 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words, you think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

it means "deceive, cheat, or deprive"? 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

MS. BELL:  Correct, your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But not of anything.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

doesn't say anything, what it seeks to deprive them of. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

And then it comes out of the blue and 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

says --

 

20 

21 

22 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think it --

    

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- someone intends a 

  

 

 

 

 

financial institution of value.  That's what you think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

it means. 

 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Did you make that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

1 

argument in the court below? 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  That was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

3 

precisely the argument --

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What page?  Do you have it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

here, by chance, what page you made that particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

argument? 

7 

            

MS. BELL:  Sure, Your Honor.  I get that on 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

rebuttal.  I don't want to take the Court's time now, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but let -- let me be clear:  Here -- we're here because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the scheme to defraud requires the intent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defraud, and that -- that's really undisputed that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the element. 

 

 

13 

            

The intent to defraud instruction simply 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

required the intent to deceive or cheat. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My colleague Justice 

  

 

 

 

16 

Alito has written extensively on this issue of intent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

versus knowledge. 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Why don't we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

just, instead of using intent --

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  You can 

  

  

 

 

 

deceive someone without taking property, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Certainly.  Yes. 

  

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Someone can 

  

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

open up an account in a false name.  They've deceived 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bank, but it's not to cheat the bank of anything its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding.  But it's to the cheat the wife who he wants to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hide money from, right? 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

6 

            

MS. BELL:  Okay.  Yes. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So nothing of value has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

been taken.  You can cheat the bank in that way, too, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of moving something somewhere, but not to take it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

Okay?

24 

25 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you can deprive 

  

 

 

 

 

someone of property without deceiving or cheating them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You can rob them, right? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So I 

  

  

 

 

 

thought -- and this is what Justice Kagan was getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- it has to be that you deceive or cheat and deprive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone of property, correct? 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Your Honor, the cheat, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is synonymous with the concept of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Of defrauding. 

  

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  -- of -- of -- well, defrauding. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor is correct. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You -- you defraud 

  

 

 

 

 

someone by deception. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

            

MS. BELL:  Deception in order to cause them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

to bear the property loss --

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's why you say it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

two different elements. 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  They're two -- no.  I'm sorry. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

They're not two different elements.  It's one element. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's the intent to defraud. 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

But there are two components of defraud, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

the government doesn't dispute that.  That comes from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Hammerschmidt case in --

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So far, I perfectly 

   

  

 

 

12 

understand your point. 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

MS. BELL:  Thank you.  Yes. 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That the defraud element 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

has two prongs to it; deception, for the lack of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deception is one prong and deprivation is the other. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're taking the money by -- or the possessory interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

by deception. 

 

19 

            

And you're saying that by using the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

disjunctive, the "or," the jury could have convicted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merely for deceiving the bank, but didn't find that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deceived "and" deprived the bank of a possessory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

23 

interest, correct? 

 

24 

            

MS. BELL:  That's exactly right, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

That's exactly right. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, Justice Breyer has 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

asked the operative question. 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and it's what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

confused me throughout, both in the discussions below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

and here. 

 

7

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

At first, I thought this case was only about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading your brief about whether the deprivation had to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be of something the bank owned. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As opposed to had a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

possessory interest in.  And Justice Kagan rightly says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you seem to have backed off from that claim.  You seem 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be saying "owned" can mean merely a possessory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  Is that correct, now? 

  

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Your Honor, we don't see that as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a different formulation, and let me explain why, 'cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I certainly understand the confusion. 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the standard is that comes from this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's fraud precedent, the mail and wire fraud 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent that everybody agrees is the operative body of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law is the intent to wrong the bank in its property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights.  That's --

  

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In its what? 

  

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  In its property rights.  In its 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

1 

property rights.  In its own property rights. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Which you -- which you now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

include can include possessory interests. 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MS. BELL:  Correctly.  And we certainly 

  

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

never meant to -- to disavow that.  The issue is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does that mean in practice?  And in practice what that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means is the intent to cause the bank, and not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customer, to -- to bear the property loss of the scheme. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

means. 

11 

            

12 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  That's not what it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's not what it means. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

And maybe something more is required.  Maybe it has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be deprive of an ownership interest or cause a loss, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depriving of a possessory interest is not the same as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causing a loss to the bank. 

   

 

 

 

17 

            

MS. BELL:  Well, let me explain how I mean

it.  I mean it in the sense that, as this Court has 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized, when you intend a deprivation of a victim, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

you -- you also -- the mirror image of that is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended acquisition.  And that's where we're getting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the idea that when you intend -- if a defendant were --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I have never seen a case in my personal practice, or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anywhere in the Federal circuits, that approaches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything like an intent to actually deprive the bank of

its possessory interest.

What defendants think about when they posit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

these schemes to get customer deposits is to either --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is either that they are taking the customer's money, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are taking the bank's money, insofar as the bank is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to suffer the loss, or the customer is going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffer the loss.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Most of them don't care. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want us to write an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

opinion -- you want us to write an opinion and say it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly lawful under this statute, section (1), to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowingly deprive someone of a possessory interest by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

13 

deception? 

14 

            

15 

            

16 

            

MS. BELL:  Well, Your Honor, I think --

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want us to write that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. BELL:  No, Your Honor.  Insofar as first 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

of all, the standard would be the intent, right?  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about the -- the intent, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different than knowledge --

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Intend to deprive someone 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

by deception of a possessory interest is proper.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

need something more.  That's what you -- that's what you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

are saying? 

 

24 

            

MS. BELL:  The intent to deceive the bank 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

and deprive the bank of a possessory interest would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

2 

suffice.  That does not come up in practice, however. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The property --

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your point is you have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

have the intent to the hurt the -- the bank --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

6 

Honor. 

7 

            

8 

            

9 

            

MS. BELL:  Exactly, Your -- exactly, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- not the customer. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. BELL:  That is exactly right. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if you -- if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

customer will end up bearing the loss, then you say one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

doesn't apply. 

 

12 

            

What does one cover, in your view, other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

than check hiding? 

 

 

14 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  It -- it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

applies to -- it applies to any scheme designed to cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bank -- that -- that targets the bank as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial victim of the fraud by means of concealment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

omission, or any other kind of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  By watching the movies, 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

most -- I'd be afraid, in this case, that we're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

write something of five pages that nobody's going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand, with the simple thing, Jessie James goes up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the bank, says, your money or your life.  He sees 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behind the teller is a drawer, and you know he's -- that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that drawer, the last five customers have given him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

1 

some money.  That's the money he wants. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

It doesn't matter whether, in fact, the bank 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

is going to put that money in Joe Smith's account, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the bank has something called a possessory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

interest or something else.  And in fact, if Jessie 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

James' brother comes up and says, Jessie James is on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way, give me the money, it should be the same result. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

Now that's very simple-minded, but -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

it's built in me by the movies, but if, in fact, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a different approach, I would like to know where in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law that different approach is, and why it is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and how this does -- how this is -- I'm afraid, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in other words, of confusion. 

 

 

 

 

            

You unconfuse me, please. 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  And when 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Your -- when Your Honor says, if I have a different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach in terms of where our -- where our construction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of clause (1) comes from in -- in the Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedents?  Is that the question? 

  

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, my question is, why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

hasn't Jessie James or his brother committed a crime --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the brother, probably, because he's lied and says Jessie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

James is on the way, and whether the money behind the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

desk was put there, to everyone's knowledge, by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depositors, or whether the money happens to have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

1 

2 

3 

4 

there for 50 years by the bank -- put in by the bank's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

founder, makes no difference to this statute.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to know why it should, or anything else you want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say about that. 

 

 

5 

            

MS. BELL:  So that case where there's some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

ambiguity, and this gets back to Your Honor's question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg, that case would be best charged under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause (2), which covers schemes that intend to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victimize either the customer or the bank provided the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requisite means of a false statement. 

   

 

 

 

            

So whenever there's any ambiguity in terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of what as a practical matter does this cover, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause (2) will cover the customer scheme in Loughrin --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm sorry, the altered-check scheme in Loughrin, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will cover the deposit scheme here. 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

It will cover Your Honor's hypothetical, 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

provided the intent's also to deceive and it's not just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plain, let's say, bank larceny which is covered under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another statute and focuses on the effect of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

conduct. 

21 

            

And clause (1) then is reserved for other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

cases like check kiting, which was a major, major 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

impetus for this statute's enactment, and Congress knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the time, based on this Court's 1982 decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Williams that check kiting was not going to be covered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

under clause (2).  It's one of the most pervasive forms 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of bank fraud. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

So that's not a minor role that clause (1) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

serves.  But in addition, it's going to serve the loan 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud and the bank embezzlement types of cases no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative false statement. 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So if we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

disagree with you, if we were to say that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection 1 means that you are targeting property 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that -- depriving any bank of property in which it has a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possessory interest --

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and we say you don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

have to prove the bank is going to lose anything of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value, that it's going to be reimbursed by insurance or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that ultimately the customer is going to receive -- bear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the loss, so long as you have defrauded the bank, some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deception to the bank, and deprived it of some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possessory interest, whether it bears the loss or not, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if that's how we rule, do you lose this case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MS. BELL:  No, Your Honor, because it comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

down to the requisite intent and purpose. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We're disagreeing with 

  

 

 

 

24 

25 

you.  That's how we're going to say what it means. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, I understand.  And I --

   

   

  

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Do you 

  

  

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

think --

 

3 

4 

5 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Bell, I think your 

   

  

 

 

 

answer is, no, Your Honor, because the instructions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't reflect your understanding of the law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MS. BELL:  We certainly win on that basis. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

So reversal is required because the intent to defraud 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means more than just --

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm not saying it does.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

think it's a hard question as to whether the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions do or don't, but it does seem to me you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an argument about the instructions. 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MS. BELL:  Right.  That's -- that's correct, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

and I think we also, though, would not lose under that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second question about even if the Court construes --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which we agree with -- but the intent must be to harm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bank and its property rights.  It's the economic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury, and that is reflected in every single fraud 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision we see from this Court starting with --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

disagrees with you about that, if the Court thinks that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone doesn't require that you intend to cause the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank financial harm, only that you intend to deprive the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank of something of value, if that's -- by deception --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

1 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- should the Ninth 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

Circuit be affirmed? 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

MS. BELL:  No, but --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Should we reject your 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

theory that you have to intend to cause the bank a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

financial loss? 

 

7 

            

MS. BELL:  No, Your Honor, and let me be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

clear because I understand that it is confusing with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different theories, but our -- those two formulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Your Honor articulated are one in the same in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

view. 

12 

            

In other words, the intent to wrong a bank 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

in its property rights is the second component of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defraud, but what does that mean in practice?  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not nonsensical for a jury.  What that means is that the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank must bear the loss of the scheme.  And so --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

18 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's not what it means. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You have a lot of cases, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

and I think the model penal code started it, where you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the word "intent" in a statute normally, not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

always, but normally it covers both purpose and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledge.  So that if you try to murder the queen by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blowing up the carriage, a famous example, and that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would lead to the death of the footman, even though you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

love the footman, you are still guilty of killing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

footman through murder.  Okay.  That's the famous 

  

  

 

 

 

 

2 

example. 

3 

            

4 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So intent includes, unless 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

there's some contrary which you could argue, to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both.  The statute that can -- the instruction they have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to show, scheme to defraud, means that the person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intends, which means he has knowledge that, as I take 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, to deceive, cheat or deprive.  That's where the "or" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something of value. 

 

 

12 

            

So I looked at that and I thought, what's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

the problem?  What's the problem?  That's what I want 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

you to explain. 

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not saying intends to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

cheat or deceive somebody, and then a separate thing, or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprive the financial institution of value.  It's intend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to deceive, cheat or deprive.  Who?  A financial 

    

  

 

 

 

 

institution.  Of what?  Of something of value. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

21 

            

So what is wrong with that instruction? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

That's -- that's what I need explanation. 

   

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor, and I'll answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

that, and then if I may reserve the remainder of my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

time. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27 

1 

            

That -- the problem with that instruction is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

that it allows for a conviction on the basis of a scheme 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to deceive the bank alone. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now even if Your Honor disagrees with me, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it seems that you might, that problem is compounded by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the intent to defraud instruction, which plainly it does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not include the something of value reference.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plainly allows for a conviction on the basis of an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent to deceive alone.  That flies in the face of this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's fraud precedent, and we see this going from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hammerschmidt, in which the Court equated the idea of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wronging a bank in its property rights, to pecuniary or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

property loss. 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

We see it two years later in the Cone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision where the Court made it clear that an intent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take something from the United States, in that case the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute designated the United States, that that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insufficient to simply intend to take something from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States custody without showing the intent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause pecuniary and property loss.  And we see that all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way through to Pasquantino, the 2005 decision about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic injury, through to Skilling, where the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says traditional fraud involves the loss of property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So applying the meaning, the -- really the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undisputed meaning of defraud, to the undisputed intent

to defraud element here, where clause (1) specifies the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank, that, Your Honor, is what is wrong with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions that allow for a conviction on the basis of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a mere intent to deceive the bank.

time.

And if I may reserve the remainder of my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Yang.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

             

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. YANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

please the Court: 

 

 

13 

            

The intent required in this bank fraud 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

scheme -- case is an intent to deceive the bank for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of depriving it of something of value. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, all right. 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

Sorry to stop you so early on, but I did not understand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that to be the argument in your brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

I'm looking at the heading C on page 36. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Section 1344(1) requires proof of an intent to deceive a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank, not to cause it monetary loss.  It -- so I didn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand -- I'm not sure what -- when Justice Kagan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed, asked, suggested she was going to ask you the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, I guess I a.m., I did not think -- I did not 

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

think you agreed with the Petitioner because I think the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

1 

2 

Petitioner is saying very strongly intent to deceive is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not enough.  And I understand you to say that it is. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. YANG:  I'm sorry that the -- the heading 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

was a little incomplete, but I think the rest of our 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, when you take it in context --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's missing? 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, not just the heading, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

but analysis in that part C as well.  I mean, the part C 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just seems to contradict part A or B or whichever it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

was. 

11 

            

12 

            

MR. YANG:  What we were trying to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you really mean an intent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

to deceive is not enough, that you need something about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to deprive the bank of its property interest. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MR. YANG:  Yes.  And I think if you look, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

for instance, at page 14 and then at page 17 of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote 1, at page 31 we say what's required is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1344(1), which is on page 14, reaches deceptive schemes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed to deprive the bank of property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

21 

            

Then on --

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What does the -- do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

they have to have the intent to deprive the bank of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

property? 

24 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, when you're designing --

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

when you're -- there's only one schemer here, right, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

the scheme is his scheme.  And does the scheme have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprive the bank of property?  That's what the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

instructions --

 

4 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  I just want 

    

  

 

 

 

5 

to clear up that it is not enough to deceive a bank, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

right? 

7 

            

8 

            

MR. YANG:  No, no, no, of course --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, not of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

since that's what you said. 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. YANG:  My apologies.  I think, though, 

    

  

 

 

 

11 

12 

that when you take a look at the other parts of our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs, and apology that we were trying to -- trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

distinguish --

 

14 

            

15 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 

  

 

 

MR. YANG:  -- between intent to harm from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

the intent to deceive, and we used some words that may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have lead to confusion.  That's not our position. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then if that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

the case, then it all comes down to the instruction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

something of value. 

 

 

22 

            

Because you -- as I understand your position 

   

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

as clarified, you do have to have the intent to deprive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a financial institution of something of value. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. YANG:  Right. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

1 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well, then 

  

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

it's all a question of whether "deceive" and "cheat" 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

stand alone, or if they are also modified by "of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something of value." 

 

 

5 

            

MR. YANG:  I think there's actually a deeper

10 

11 

12

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

disagreement here, and I'm happy to talk about the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions, and the jury instructions, of course, have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be read as a whole.  And when you read that, and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly in conjunction with the materiality 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement, which is discussed -- in a material matter, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to deceive the -- defraud the bank as to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material matter, and a material matter is one that has a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tendency that causes the bank to part with money or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property -- I think when you read the instructions as a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole, there's really no problem with the instructions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but there's a really -- there is a deeper argument here. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that is the argument that Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says that you have to intend to take something that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know is a property interest of the bank.  You have to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have knowledge of that.  And I had thought until today 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they were disputing whether a possessory interest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

was enough, but they've given that up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, so it seems to me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Yang, that the real disagreement that you have is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Ms. Bell wants to equate and intends to deprive a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

bank of a property interest with an intent to have a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank suffer a pecuniary loss in the end.  She says those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the same things.  You say they're different things. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Let's assume you're right.  Let's assume that that's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that whether the bank in the end suffers a monetary loss 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is utterly irrelevant to the form of intent that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required by this statute.  All right?  So you won that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one, let's say.

10 

            

MR. YANG:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Go back to the Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

Justice's question about how these instructions reflect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there needs to be an intent to deprive the bank of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a posessory interest in property. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

MR. YANG:  I will go to those instructions, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

and I'm kind of happy to discuss them, but I don't think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the end of the matter.  I do think that there are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually two questions that are -- that Petitioner is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to merge that are distinct.  And they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

actually --

 

20 

            

21 

them. 

22 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I thought I was giving you 

    

   

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  No, no.  They're making two 

  

  

 

 

 

 

23 

arguments.  One --

  

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But could we talk about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

the instruction?  I know --

    

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

1 

            

2 

            

MR. YANG:  Yeah.  Yeah, I just want to --

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- that's the -- that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

the last part of your argument.  We want it first.  Do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you mind?  Okay. 

  

 

5 

            

MR. YANG:  Not at all.  I'm happy to discuss 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

it.  But in terms of the enduring legal consequence of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court's decision, the bigger ones I'd like to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to.  But I will discuss the instructions here. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we know there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

big picture in the world, but we want to know about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

instructions first. 

 

12 

            

13 

            

MR. YANG:  The instructions --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The enduring 

  

 

 

 

14 

consequence to Mr. Shaw is a little bit different, so --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MR. YANG:  Undoubtedly.  But the Court 

  

  

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

generally doesn't take cases for error construction, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I want to -- and in the government's interest goes to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the broader question of what does Section 1344(1) --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Say, Mr. Yang, the 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

instructions. 

21 

            

MR. YANG:  So on the instructions -- this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

at pages 17 through 19 of the joint appendix.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first instruction that's relevant is the instruction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the defendant has to have knowingly executed a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme to defraud -- that's a defined term -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

financial institution as to a material matter.


   

 

 

 

 

            

Now, we look -- if you turn the page to 18, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the scheme to defraud is a scheme in which someone


   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intends to deceive, cheat or deprive a financial


   

 

 

 

 

 

institution of something of value. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2


3 

4


5


6 

            

Here there's only one schemer.  So the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

schemer, the one that created the scheme, had to intend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something of value. 

 

 

10 

            

Now, remember the first instruction that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

discussed talks about -- has to be a scheme to defraud 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to a material matter.  If you go further down on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 18, a material matter is one that has the necessary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial institution to part with money or property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is what a scheme to defraud is. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, I don't think when you take that in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, and you have to read instructions holistically, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there's really any question --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 

  

Don't forget instruction 

 

 

21.  You're cherry-picking. 

  

 

            

MR. YANG:  Well --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 

  

An intent to defraud is 

 

 

 

 

an intent to deceive or cheat. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Right. 

  

 

  

And then we'll have to go

back to instruction 17 to see how that fits in.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second part is you also have to independently find that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you did so; that is, execute the scheme to defraud that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we discussed as to a material matter, with intent to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defraud the financial institution. 

 

 

 

            

So their intent to defraud simply says you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to intend or deceive or cheat, again, the financial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institution.  That's somewhat superfluous in a 

  

 

 

 

 

single-person fraud scheme like this because you've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already defined the scheme to embed those requirements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you've 

  

 

 

 

 

kind of -- instruction, you do read it in context, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if I read instruction 18 in the context of 21, it kind 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of highlights that you have deceive or cheat separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the deprivation of something of value. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So linguistically, you have to say that what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they meant in the instructions was somebody who intends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to deceive a financial institution of something of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

value.  And that's just not grammatical. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  It's not great, but it's not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it's not unacceptable here because --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's okay once you put in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the word "material" --

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I think --

    

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- which is what you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

in instruction 17. 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

MR. YANG:  I think that's --

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It says you have to execute

18 

a scheme or defraud a financial -- to defraud a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial institution as to a material fact.  So that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

assumes it was separate. 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  No, no.  But the material --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The deceive was separate. 

  

 

 

 

 

You would have to deceive the financial institution as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a material fact, which is defined in instruction 19 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as one that has a natural tendency to influence a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial institution to part with money or property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what you took away in instruction 21, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave back in instruction 19.  So it's a --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And so in 18, sales 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

deceive, cheat or deprive a financial institution of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

something of value.  "Something of value" goes right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

along with "deprive," but it doesn't go along with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

"deceive." 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. YANG:  I don't think that's correct.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

understand Your Honor's challenge here.  It's that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- you would say, like, out of something of value 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normally if you were saying it by itself.  But when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a series of verbs, it's not uncommon in -- in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common parlance simply to use the appropriate, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

37 

function word "hereof" with -- that connects to the last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word.  So when you say deceive, cheat or deprive a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial institution of something of value, the normal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juror is going to understand that that means you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deceiving the financial institution, cheating the 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

financial institution. 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not if they -- not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they -- not if they read instruction 21, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks -- has nothing to do with -- it just says intent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to deceive or cheat, nothing of something of value.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you quote the instruction on page 46 to make it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read, to make it make sense, you have to add in, as you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do, after deceive, deceive the bank out of something of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

value --

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

MR. YANG:  But I think --

   

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- Because it makes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

no sense to say deceive of something of value. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  It doesn't even parse under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's reading because I think Petitioner at least 

   

 

 

 

 

 

thinks that you have to deceive, cheat or deprive the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial institution -- like, deceive the financial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

institution. 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  They're kind of right.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

doesn't -- it doesn't parse neatly under either reading. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I have to say that if I'm a reader, the way I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

understand this is you have to -- you have to show --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the scheme has to be one to deceive a bank, to cheat a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank or to deprive a bank of something of value.  And in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that case, the "deceive a bank" is operating as a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disjunctive clause without the "of something of value." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

7 

read --

 

8 

            

MR. YANG:  No, I think actually you could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's to deceive a bank 

   

  

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

alone, cheat a bank alone, or deprive a bank of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

something of value.  And so I'm a juror.  I say, well, 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's enough if the bank was deceived. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. YANG:  I don't see how you can read --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

you might say just "deceive" in the abstract. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, it's got to be that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

you're deceiving somebody. 

 

 

16 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, but if you're deceiving the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

bank, if a financial institution, which follows, 

   

 

 

 

 

connects to deceive, then so does "of something of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

value." 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I don't think so 

   

  

 

 

 

because that would make no sense.  It would be the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme must be one to deceive a bank of something of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value.  Whoever would use words like that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  I understand that it's a 

    

 

 

 

 

slightly -- there is a slight grammatical issue with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

1 

this language. 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I think it's more than 

   

  

 

 

 

 

3 

grammatical.  It's just -- like, it doesn't make sense. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. YANG:  I think when you read it in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

context, right, you have to take this -- this is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of scheme to defraud.  When you read this in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context with what you are -- the jury is required to do, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowingly executed a scheme to defraud a financial 

   

   

 

 

 

institution as to a material matter.  Right?  So that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

scheme has to be with regard to a material matter.  That 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material matter has to lead the bank -- has a tendency 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to lead the bank to part with money or property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

So when you take that in context, what does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

that mean?  What's the material matter mean?  The only 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way you can make sense is if you're actually depriving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bank of money or property.  That is something of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

value. 

18 

            

Now, if the Court has concerns about how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

this parses, the Court could decide the legal question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the important issue here, and simply --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why has -- why has the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

government forgotten when it's at trial that simplifying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things for juries is always the best thing?  Do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really think that any juror reading this would parse it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the care that you are?  Why can't you just say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

something like a scheme to defraud a bank is a scheme 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

to -- what was the three words? -- to deceive or cheat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money and to -- to cheat the bank of some interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in money or property? 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

MR. YANG:  I completely agree that 

    

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

simplicity is the -- is preferable.  I don't think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a problem with what we have here, but I will 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

even one up you on the simplicity.  I think the proper 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction is scheme to defraud is one to intended to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deceive the bank for the purpose of depriving of it of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something of value.  Just get rid of the disjunctives, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  That would be the better -- the instruction for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a single-member bank fraud scheme. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, things get a little complicated when 

   

 

 

 

 

you have schemes with multiple members.  We don't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to discuss it.  It is discussed in footnote 10 of our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

brief. 

18 

            

But for the purpose of this case, that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

be simple.  We think that the instructions, they're not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfect, but they're -- they -- they convey and the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have found the requisite requirements of bank 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud.  And if the court has any doubts --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what is the -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

do we cite for that?  Is there something in our cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that say that the instructions had to be read in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

1 

context of what the jury heard or something like that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

MR. YANG:  I think the --

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, we'd say close 

    

 

 

 

 

4 

enough for government work. 

 

 

 

5 

            

MR. YANG:  I don't think we've quite said 

    

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

that, but I -- it's in pages 44 or 45 of our brief, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the general proposition that you just have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- that bank fraud -- excuse me -- that -- jury --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is 46 -- jury instructions must be viewed in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of the overall charge.  And when you look at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this in light of the materiality charge, any kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity that might have been interjected in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of scheme to defraud I think is sufficiently 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

displaced. 

15 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's just not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

instruction.  It's what the court of appeals held.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of appeals held, in short -- this is a quote --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"The defendant was guilty of bank fraud because he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to deceive the bank."  Full stop.  So it's not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just a problem with the instructions.  It's a problem 

   

   

  

 

 

 

with what the court of appeals held. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. YANG:  Again, I think this may be a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

problem with some brevity.  I don't think the court of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals meant to say if you walk into the bank and tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bank, you know, the nationals lost their game and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

don't have home field advantage that that's bank fraud. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Of course, the court of appeals knows it's an order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain something from the bank.  That's what bank fraud 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is.  And I don't think that, you know, just as the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heading for our brief in Section C might not have been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fully complete, the same thing for the court of appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

opinion. 

8 

            

But I'd like to get back to I think what's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

broader issue here, which is what is the intent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required.  And particularly --

  

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Just tell us:  Why 

  

  

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

didn't -- why didn't the government charge under (2), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which your colleague has agreed fits this case, that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he had been charged under (2) and convicted, that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

be fine? 

 

16 

            

MR. YANG:  Because under (2), you need to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

actually prove a misrepresentation. 

   

 

18 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because under (2) you 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

have to prove --

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. YANG:  You have to prove a false 

   

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

statement or false misrepresentation.  Now, in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

context of crimes that occur over the Internet, there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some complications that are involved with that.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

charging decision was to take (1) -- clause (1) remember 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is scheme to defraud.  This is the -- the mothership of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

language from the fraud statutes.  It comes from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mail fraud and the wire fraud.  Congress knew that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was broad, and Congress intended to adopt it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically because it was broad. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

And, in fact, Congress considered drafting 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

language that would have required scheme to harm, cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic loss to a financial institution, and 

   

 

 

 

 

specifically rejected it after the Department of Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, hey, that's too narrow.  Scheme to defraud is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broader, and this would unduly narrow the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

So the government chose clause (1) because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

it was the broader clause, and we didn't need clause (2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which -- it could have complicated proof a little bit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

Now, on the two questions that Petitioners 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

presented, two kind of legal questions are, does the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant have to have some knowledge of the legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property status of the thing that's being taken?  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the answer is clearly no. 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

Willie Sutton in the 20th Century, to move 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

off from Jessie James, he robbed banks because that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the money is.  Now, if Willie Sutton believed all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money he took was customer deposit accounts, didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belong to the bank, he didn't ever intend to harm the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank, he'd still be -- you'd still call it bank robbery. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And if he did the same thing through deceit, you'd call 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

it bank fraud. 

 

 

2 

            

Now, there's no reason to add this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3

additional intent knowledge about the property status of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the thing that's being taken.  It doesn't advance any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest that Congress is trying to advance is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect the integrity of banks.  The cost of the bank 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not depend on what's subjectively in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's mind, about what they think, is it owned by, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is it ownership interest, is it a possessory interest, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is there insurance, is there not insurance.  It depends 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the nature of the actual scheme and what's being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

taken.

Congress would not have wanted to

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what's the right words? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  The right words? 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  For the -- I mean, there --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there are many situations.  Do you -- you require an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent that there be property?  Well, how do you want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say it, an intent to injure the bank in its property? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How do you say it?  Look, some people, bank robbers go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into banks.  They take the customers -- they line the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customers up against the wall, and they take out their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

billfolds.  Is that defrauding the bank? 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. YANG:  No, no.  Because you're obtaining 

  

  

 

 

 

 

3 

it from the customer. 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, yeah.  So how do you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

want to do this one? 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. YANG:  So in bank fraud, the intent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

required -- and remember, there's more than just intent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As a fact we do have to prove there was a property 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest to the bank.  So, for instance, in your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

example --

 

11 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  There was, but it was a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

property interest in the bank.  What do you have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove in respect to that property interest is in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

defendant's mind? 

 

15 

            

MR. YANG:  So the only intent required is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

the intent to deceive the financial institution in order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to obtain something of value.  Now, that something of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

value --

 

19 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  In order to obtain 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

something of value, so that it could be of value and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belong only to the customer? 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. YANG:  That -- that complicates things I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

think in the --

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  That's why I want to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

25 

know -- that's why I need to know the words.

1 

            

MR. YANG:  There's no more required for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

intent.  Now, in order to --

  

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I quoted you it was, that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

it's an -- it's an intent to deprive the bank of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property, including a possessory interest. 

   

 

 

6 

            

MR. YANG:  No.  And the reason it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

something of value that in fact is a possessory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  Whether or not -- or a property interest. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Whether or not the defendant knows it's a property --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  But the bank -- the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

bank has to have a possessory interest in -- a property 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in this thing. 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. YANG:  Right.  And property interest is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

broad.  But the defendant doesn't have to know about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that property interest.  It just has to know I'm trying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to get money, that I want the money, and that's enough. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now, the money happens to, in fact, be a property 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest to the bank, but the defendant doesn't have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know that.  We don't require our defendants to have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken property law or banking law or studied the risk of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loss rules when frauds occur to banks.  None of these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things have to be in the knowledge or of -- or beliefs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What does he have to know

about?  Does he have to know that the bank is involved? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, what does he have to know about the bank? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

47 

MR. YANG:  He has to know that he --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That the bank is likely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

4 

involved?  I mean, this is pretty easy because he sent a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

check, but --

 

 

5 

            

MR. YANG:  Well, no, I think what's required 

   

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

is -- and let me take a step back.  When we're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking -- we're talking about financial institutions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it might help to refer to page 1A of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's appendix.  Financial institutions are not 

  

 

 

 

 

just banks.  Financial institutions include certain 

  

 

 

 

 

banks when they are FDIC insured, certain credit unions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then a whole slew with ten -- a list of ten other 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things.  It includes a small business investment 

   

  

 

 

 

14 

company --

 

15 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay.  But here we have a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

bank.  What did this defendant have to know about this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank, if anything? 

 

 

18 

            

MR. YANG:  It didn't have to know its status 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

as a bank under the statute.  It just had to know it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking something from this entity, which in fact, again, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a bank under the statute.  It could be a holding 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

company.  It could be -- it could be any of these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things.  If taking something from this entity by deceit, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that's the intent, right?  Something of value from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this entity by deceit.  It doesn't have to know does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

this entity -- is it a small business investment company 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined under Section 103 of the Small Business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Investment Act?  It doesn't have to know these things. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

And the reason is once you get into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

realm of fraudulently taking something from an entity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- that's criminal conduct.  And the additional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements that it is a bank, that's the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional hook.  It's similar to --

  

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It has to know that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

financial institution is involved? 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

13 

            

MR. YANG:  It doesn't have to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, that's Section 1. 

    

 

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  It doesn't have -- it has to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

it doesn't have to have any knowledge about whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity that it's depriving of property qualifies as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial institution.  It could be, for instance, a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

small kiosk in a grocery store that's conducting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

transactions and happens actually to be a bank outpost, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

but you don't know it's a bank.  But you rob a bank or 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- you defraud the bank, it's still -- you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to have knowledge of its status as a financial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

institution. 

23 

            

There are several examples.  Bank robbery or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

larceny, under Section 2113(a) and (b), the courts held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't need to know that the entity robbed is a bank.

us, what is in the overlap area?  What is covered only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by (1) and what is covered only by (2)? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. YANG:  They are, of course, cover 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

almost -- they are almost coterminous, but there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that are outside of (1), and there are things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are outside of (2).  What's outside of (1) are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schemes that -- schemes where you do not -- fraud is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

targeted at the bank or -- yes, so (2) -- let me -- let 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me start over.  It's a little confusing. 

   

  

 

 

 

18 

            

(2) is broader than (1) in the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

respect:  It covers --

  

 

 

20 

            

21 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  (2) covers what? 

  

 

 

 

MR. YANG:  (2) -- clause (2) is broader than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

(1) because it covers schemes to deceive the custodian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of bank property.  (1) does not because the deception 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to be directed at the bank.  But (1) covers things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that (2) does not, because (2) is limited only to false

statements.  This is what Loughrin explained in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote.  (1) covers frauds that are based on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonstatement-type deception; for instance, check hiding.

11 

12 

instance -- it's a little farfetched, but you could have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone that impose -- that, you know, dresses in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disguise and just walks into the bank.  The bank lets 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them into the -- it's a well-known customer, walks in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the safety deposit box, takes out the money.  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement's made.  (1) would cover that kind of thing. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

Now, these areas are, you know, on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

fringe.  The two terms, the two provisions largely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

overlap, and that's not surprising because the language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was the impetus for two was language that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted in Durland in construing the term "scheme to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defraud."  So there's a lot of overlap between these two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

things, and that's what Justice Kagan recognized in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

Loughrin. 

21 

            

But they both have independent meaning, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

a lot, and so, you know, they often can be used at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same time, but they are independent.

the same, right --

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

MR. YANG:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- if -- if somebody went in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

and said, I'd like to see the security deposit boxes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and made a false statement to the bank about his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement to see the security deposit boxes and took 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money out? 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

MR. YANG:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Doesn't -- you know, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

bank still has a possessory interest in that, even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

though it doesn't use that money in the same way; is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

that correct? 

 

13 

            

14

minute?  And then disappears, and then somebody else 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes up, the fraudster comes up, and says, oh, she just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told me to pick up her computer from her --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22

somebody said, why don't you take a look, you know --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know -- keep -- keep your eye on this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. YANG:  Gratuitous bailee is what they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

would be.  And I think the answer is -- I think we would 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say yes for purposes of the -- the fraud statute.

MR. YANG:  But -- but --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What you're essentially 

  

 

 

 

saying is that anything I can think of, any hypothetical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I can think of which involves my hanging on to something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for somebody else, that I have a possessory interest in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that sufficient to satisfy this scheme. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. YANG:  Yeah.  And I don't -- it's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

sufficient for this purposes.  And I don't think this is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusual.  Oftentimes, rights and interest in the law are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relative to other people.  So your possessory interest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not be superior to the person who owned the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laptop.  But it would be superior as to third parties 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having no claim of right -- no valid claim of right to

the laptop. 

 

2 

            

So yes, that, I think, could fall within the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

general understanding of a scheme to defraud. 

   

 

 

 

 

Obviously, not a scheme to defraud a financial 

   

   

 

 

 

5 

institution. 

6 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, that suggests to me 

    

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

that as long as the person knows that the money is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being -- is in the bank somehow, it just shouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter, because anything counts as a possessory 

   

 

 

 

 

10 

interest, right? 

 

11 

            

MR. YANG:  It shouldn't -- it shouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

matter at all.  And I think that emphasizes why Congress 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not have wanted to add some additional knowledge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement about the property status of the money.  Why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does it matter?  All it does is complicate things. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

Congress would not have wanted to carve out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

this type of conduct as noncriminal.  And in fact, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important to recognize, even Petitioner says she's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- he's not carving out anything that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

noncriminal. 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

In page 25 of the reply brief, Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says it's a -- essentially, a pleading game.  Well, why 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

would Congress have wanted to make the broad language of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme to defraud, which has a history going back more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than a century, to be a narrow appendage on something 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

54 

else in order to force the government into a pleading 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

game, when no -- at the end of the day, if it's pled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly, it's still an offense punished by the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time.  It just doesn't make any sense. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

This is not what Congress intended.  It has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

no -- no basis in the text or history of the bank fraud. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When you look at what Congress did in the legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history, it rejected language that would have adopted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same thing.  As far as I can tell, everything points 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against Petitioner here. 

 

 

11 

            

If the court has no further questions.  We'd

15 

16

ask that you affirm. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Ms. Bell, you have three minutes remaining.

MS. BELL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

To get back to Justice Breyer's question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about where in the record was this disputed, that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is at pages 646 to 647.  And there, counsel --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

myself -- specifically made the argument that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem with this -- this instruction, exactly as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor, and I believe Justice Kagan, pointed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

out, is the disjunctive wording of intent, the intent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

defraud.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, assume I 

  

 

 

 

2 

agree with you --

 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that there were parts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

of your argument, both below and here in your brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that suggested the instructional error.  But what I find 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is that the way you presented the argument was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

confusing. 

9 

10 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It took a lot of teasing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

11 

out. 

12 

13 

14 

15 

            

Does -- how does that affect what we do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that you weren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

clear in the instruction, don't you forfeit that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

argument? 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

MS. BELL:  No, Your Honor.  The -- the claim 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the intent to -- we challenge --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I know what your 

    

   

 

 

 

two claims are. 

 

 

            

MS. BELL:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The question is if I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

disagree --

 

24 

25 

            

MS. BELL:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- with your basic 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

56 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

premise that you need to prove pecuniary loss to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank -- I know you want to win that, but please accept 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my hypothetical.  I disagree with you that the only --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the only issue is that you have to cheat and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprive the bank of a possessory -- of something in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possessory -- in their possessory interest.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Simple as that.  It doesn't have to cause -- you don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to intend to cause pecuniary loss.  All right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

error? 

11 

            

Where does that leave your instructional 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. BELL:  It's -- it's still an error, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

Honor, because it permitted a conviction on the basis of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mere intent to deceive the bank.  And there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curing it, looking to, for example, the materiality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

component of the instruction, how --

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about if I find that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

what you -- that you didn't articulate your argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly enough to the court below, or to us?  Where does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that put you?  Have you forfeited?  Do you waive?  Have 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you done something? 

 

 

21 

            

MS. BELL:  No, Your Honor.  The -- the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

challenge was always to the disjunctively-worded jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction.  And that was consistently made from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court to the court of appeals and to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court.  The only question has been how to formulate; if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

57 

more than intent to deceive is required, then what more? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How do we explain that second component? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

Hammerschmidt itself, which is the 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

undisputed applicable definition here, uses a number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

different formulations, and that's part of where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusion comes from. 

 

 

            

Hammerschmidt says the intent to defraud is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the intent to deceive, and it also uses the -- and to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong a bank in its property rights.  It equates to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong a bank in its property rights with to deprive a --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm sorry -- a victim. 

   

 

 

12 

            

It equates to wrong a victim in its property 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

rights with depriving a victim of something of value, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it also equates that with cheating a victim out of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something of property, and also.  To make matters even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more confusing in terms of the number of formulations, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it says that the mail fraud statute is limited to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infliction of pecuniary or property loss.  And so our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formulations come out of the Hammerschmidt case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

And what we have always asked the Court to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

do here is to construe intent to defraud to require, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just the intent to deceive, as the lower court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions required, but also the intent to do that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second thing, which is --

 

 

 

 

25
