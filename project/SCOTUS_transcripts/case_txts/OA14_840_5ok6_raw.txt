CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  14­840,  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commission  v.  The  Electric  Power  Supply  Association  and

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  GEN.  DONALD  B.  VERRILLI 

 

 

 

 

 

 

           

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  FEDERAL  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Federal  Power  Act  expressly  authorizes 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  to  regulate  the  process  that  sets  wholesale  rates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  electricity,  and  that  is  exactly  what  FERC's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  demand  response  rules  do. 

 

 

 

 

            

Demand  response  is  a  resource  that  is  bid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  wholesale  auction,  and  the  wholesale  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operators  that  run  those  actions  rely  on  the  bids  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance  wholesale  supply  and  demand,  to  set  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rates,  and  they  particularly  rely  on  those  bids  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

periods  of  peak  demand  to  avoid  price  spikes  and  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoid  blackouts  and  brownouts. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  If  there  were  a  student  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Economics  I,  it  seems  to  me  that  he  would  conclude  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  professor  would  conclude  that  wholesale  affects

retail,  retail  affects  wholesale,  they're  interlinked, 

 

 

 

 

 

which  means  you  win  the  case,  except  that  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  the  distinction.  We  have  to  make  a  distinction. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Can  you  tell  us  what  the  distinction  is  that  marks  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end  of  the  Federal  power  and  the  beginning  of  local 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power? 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  I  ­­ I  have  several 

   

   

  

 

 

answers  to  that,  Justice  Kennedy. 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  we  completely  agree  that  what  ­­ any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  that  FERC  takes  at  the  wholesale  level  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  is  going  to  affect  the  retail  market.  All  things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal,  if  FERC  sets  ­­ FERC  will  set  a  higher  wholesale 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rate,  there  is  going  to  be  a  higher  retail  price.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  can't  be  a  basis  ­­ those  kinds  of  effects  can't  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  basis,  for  denying  FERC's  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  case  I  would  particularly  point  Your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Honor  to  is  the  Mississippi  Power  case.  Now,  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  case  in  which  what  FERC  did  was  conclude  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utility  could  recover  at  wholesale  its  investment  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nuclear  power  plant.  And  what  the  Court  held  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mississippi  Power  was  that  that  had  the  effect  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denying  the  State  regulator  the  ability  to  deny  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utility  recovery  of  those  costs  in  the  retail  rates, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  though  under  State  law  they  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprudent  costs  and  not  recoverable.  That  was  a  very

direct  effect  on  the  exercise  of  State  regulatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction,  which  you  do  not  have  here,  by  the  way,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  a  fortiori,  this  is  certainly  permissible  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rationale  of  Mississippi  Power. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  find  that  a  pretty  fuzzy 

    

   

 

 

 

line,  "very  direct  effect."  I  ­­ it  seems  to  me  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  distinction  between  affecting  retail  rates, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

which,  as  Justice  Kennedy  has  pointed  out,  always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens,  and  using  ­­ using  effect  upon  retail  rates  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  means  of  regulating  wholesale  rates.  And  the  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  that  that  is  what  has  occurred,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively,  FERC  has  raised  the  retail  price  during 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peak  hours  because  somebody  who  wants  to  purchase  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  during  peak  hours  not  only  pays  ­­ you  know,  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  forgo  the  benefit  that  that  person  would  otherwise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  from  FERC's  program.  That  raises  the  price  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail,  and  that  is  the  means  of  achieving  what  FERC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  achieve. 

 

 

            

Yes,  FERC  has  the  ­­ has  the  power  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  wholesale  rates.  But  ­­ but,  the  argument  is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  through  the  fiddling  around  with  retail  rates,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  what  is  asserted  is  happening  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  ­­ I  think  three 

   

  

 

 

 

points  to  be  made  in  response  to  that  argument,  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scalia.  First,  the  ­­ the  authority  that's  exclusively

reserved  to  States  by  Section  824(b)  of  ­­ of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Power  Act  is  the  authority  over  retail  sales. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Every  retail  sale  that  occurs  in  the  regime  in  the  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC's  ­­ under  FERC's  wholesale  demand  response  regime 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  retail  sale  that  will  occur  at  the  rate  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  regulator  has  set,  and  under  the  terms  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions  that  the  State  regulator  has  set,  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single  sale  that  occurs  that  is  true  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second,  what  they  have  said  is  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes  the  effective  rate.  But  what  I  would  say  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  to  that,  Your  Honor,  is  that  if  I  go  out  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy  a  Ferrari  for  $100,000,  everybody  thinks  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

price  of  the  Ferrari  is  $100,000.  Nobody  thinks  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  price  of  the  Ferrari  is  actually  $107,000  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  foregoing  the  $7,000  tax  credit  I  can  get  if  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bought  an  electric  car.  The  rate  is  what  it  is.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$100,000.  And  here,  the  rate  is  what  it  is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  third,  the  point  I  would  make,  it  seems 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me,  it's  a  very  odd  argument  to  say  that  what  FERC's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  do  here  is  increase  the  retail  price.  What  FERC's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  do  is  drive  the  retail  price  down  by  driving  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  price  down  by  very  considerable  amounts  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peak  periods.  This  is  ­­ this  is  a  system  that  results 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  lower  rates  for  retail  consumption. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Oh,  yes,  ultimately,  but

the  question  is  whether  that  is  achieved  by  the  means  of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  managing  retail  rates.  And  you  say  this  does
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.  What  if  FERC  ­­


  

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Those  ­­


  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ had  sufficient  funds
 

  

 

 

 

 

available  that  it  could  pay  people  to  not  purchase
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electricity  during  peak  hours?  It  just  said,  you  know,
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'll  give  you  so  much  per  day  not  to  use  more  than  X
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  of  electricity  during  peak  hours.  Would  that  ­­


  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  that  be  within  FERC's  powers? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  think  that  would  be  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

harder  case  than  this  one  because  all  of  the  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  FERC  regulates  here  occurs  in  the  wholesale  market. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  of  it.  The  ­­ this  is  about  what  bids 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be 

 

accepted  into  the  wholesale  market,  what  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  ­­ it's  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

difference 

between  turning  over  money  to  these  retail 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchasers 

and  simply  depriving  retail  purchasers  of  a 
   

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  that 

 

they  could  otherwise  obtain  in  the  wholesale  market. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  ­­ I  think  this  is  a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

more  straightforward  case,  because  all  of  the  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  FERC  regulates  occurs  in  the  wholesale  market,  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  actors  are  regulated  in  their  role  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  market,  and  FERC's  purpose  in  this  situation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  achieve  lower  wholesale  rates  and  to  allow  and  to

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  it's  still  based 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on  direct  price  regulation  of  the  retail  rate.  It  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  the  same  point  as  your  Ferrari  hypothetical,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  FERC  is  basically  standing  outside  McDonald's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  saying,  we'll  give  you  $5  not  to  go  in,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price  of  the  hamburger  is  $3,  somebody  goes  up  there, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­ the  price  of  a  hamburger  is  actually,  I  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  economists  would  say,  $8,  because  they  give  up  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$5,  they've  still  got  to  pay  the  $3. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  your  answer  is,  there's  no  impact  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  States  can  do,  because  they  can  still  say,  no, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  price  of  the  hamburger  should  be  $2,  or  it  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$4.  The  point  is  that  ­­ that  FERC  is  directly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affecting  the  retail  price. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  I  guess  there's  an 

   

  

 

 

 

additional  point  to  be  made  in  response  to  that,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  is  that  ­­ the  ­­ here,  of  course,  what  FERC  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  is  saying,  here  are  the  rules  by  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  market  is  going  to  operate,  and  if  you  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  wholesale  market,  these  are  the  rules  that  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  to  you. 

 

 

            

But  ultimately  it  remains  up  to  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  FERC  takes  State  law  as  it  finds  it  here,

whether  citizens  of  the  State  can  go  into  the  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market.  They  can  only  go  into  the  wholesale  market  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  ­­ if  States  agree  that  they  can  go  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  market.  So  it's  very  difficult  to  see  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  ­­ that's  interesting. 

  

 

 

 

 

If  FERC  has  this  power,  how  can  it  strip  itself  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  by  saying,  we  will  not  do  this  if  the  States  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  us  to  do  it? 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  I  think  FERC 

   

  

 

 

certainly  has  that  authority  in  the  course  of  deciding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  a  just  and  reasonable  practice.  And,  in  fact,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  that  that's  what  the  Court  held  in  New  York  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  with  respect  to  FERC's  decision  not  to  regulate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  bundled  element  of  transmission  there  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  concerned  about  jurisdictional  overlaps.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  FERC  didn't  exercise  its  regulatory  authority  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  And  so  it's  a  fortiori  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  quite  different. 

  

 

 

 

That's  quite  different  from  saying  we're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  it  unless  you,  the  States,  veto  it.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  that  if  ­­ if  FERC  really  has  that  power.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  how  it  can  confer  a  veto  upon  the  States. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  it  seems  to  me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  that  that's  not  an  argument  that  goes  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC's  jurisdiction.  That  may  be  an  argument,  although

no  one  has  made  it  in  this  case,  that  if  FERC  believes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  practice  is  ­­ that  this  practice  is  required 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  a  just  and  reasonable  wholesale  rate,  that  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  FERC  can't  then  let  States  opt  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But,  again,  that  seems  to  me  to  be  a  merits 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue,  not  a  jurisdictional  issue.  And  ­­ and  again,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  ­­ it's  just  incorrect  under  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding  in  FERC  v.  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  No,  I  think  it's  goes  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

whether  FERC  really  thinks  that  it's  meddling  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  rates. 

 

            

­­

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No,  Your  Honor  ­­ I  know 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  what  it  goes  to  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  mind.  I  think  it's  an  acknowledgment  by  FERC  that, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact,  you  know,  we  are  mucking  around  in  an  area 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  State's  area.  And  if  the  States  don't  want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us  to  do  it,  we  won't  do  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  appreciate  that,  that 

    

 

 

 

Your  Honor  dissented  in  New  York  v.  FERC  on  a  ground 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  much  like  that.  But  the  Court  held  that  that  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate  exercise  of  FERC's  authority  to  decide  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  and  reasonable  practices  were,  to  take  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  overlap  into  account.  And  that's  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  has  done  here.  It  seems  to  me  quite  clear  that

that  is,  under  the  logic  of  New  York  v.  FERC, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissible  exercise  of  ­­ of  FERC's  authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  in  a  situation,  it  seems  to  me,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  what  you've  got  is  FERC  taking  State  law  as  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finds  it,  you  really  can't  say  that  this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impermissible  interference  or  a  power  grab  or  any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

intrusion  into  State  authority  because  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  make  the  decision. 

 

 

 

              

I  ­­ in  fact,  I  think  the  Federalism 

   

 

 

 

 

argument  is  upside  down  here.  This  is  a  situation  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  what  you  have  is  a  FERC  rule  that  really  is  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong  version  of  cooperative  Federalism. 

 

 

 

 

            

What  FERC  is  saying  here  is  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  that  we  think  works,  we  think  brings  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

billions  of  dollars  in  consumer  benefits  by  lowering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  rates. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  it  fair  to  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  is  luring  retail  customers  into  the  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market?  And  if  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes,  well,  my  friend 

  

 

 

 

 

has  ­­ my  friend  has  used  that  term,  but  I  think  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  if  that  ­­ and  if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ well,  if  that  were  true,  would  that  not  be  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ a  serious  problem  for  the  government?

history  ­­ as  a  matter  of  history.  It's  wrong  as  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  law.  This  ­­ this  idea  of  wholesale  demand 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  was  not  FERC's  idea.  FERC  didn't  impose  it  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  market,  Justice  Kennedy.  This  is  a  practice  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

grew  up  organically  out  of  the  private  actions  of  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participants  once  the  wholesale  markets  were 

 

 

 

 

 

deregulated.  It's  exactly  the  kind  of  innovative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

private  market  conduct  that  you  would  hope  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deregulation  would  bring  about.  And  the  ­­ the  private 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actors,  the  wholesale  market  operators,  brought  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea  to  FERC  as  early  as  1999. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  One  of  the  briefs,  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way,  says  that  you  had  no  authority  to  deregulate  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  know,  we  had  a  case  involving  the  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Communications  Commission  which  wanted  to  dispense  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  of  tariffs  on  the  part  of  everybody,  I  think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except  AT&T.  And  we  held  that  the  statute  requires  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  to  regulate  rates  and  required  filed  rates. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Isn't  that  a  problem  here  too? 

   

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  I'm  very  familiar  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  case,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yes,  I'm  sure  you  are. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  this  case  is 

  

 

 

 

 

completely  different.  And  in  ­­ in  fact,  I  think,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  when  ­­

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  mean,  I  like  deregulated

authority  to  do  it? 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Sure.  I  think  that 

    

  

 

 

the  ­­ that  bridge  was  crossed  in  New  York  v.  FERC.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me  in  New  York  v.  FERC  held  that  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  deregulation,  that  deregulatory  impulse  was  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  authority  of  FERC,  and  that  there's  nothing  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  text  that  precludes  it.  And  I  do  think  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  key  point  here,  that  what  we're  talking  about  here  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  end  of  the  day  is  FERC's  authority,  which  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  comes  down  to  what  the  statute  says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  what  the  statute  says,  in  Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

824(e),  is  that  FERC  has  authority  over  practices  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect  rates  in  ­­ wholesale  rates.  And  there's  just  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  given  that  all  of  the  practices  FERC  is  regulating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occur  in  the  wholesale  auction.  They're  all  embedded  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  wholesale  auction. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  If  we're  ­­ if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're  ­­ obviously,  that's  true.  But  it's  just  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious,  it  seems  to  me,  that  you  have  to  have  some  sort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  limiting  principle,  otherwise  FERC  can  do  whatever  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants.  So  what  is  the  limiting  principle  that  you  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggest  to  us?

limiting  principle  has  worked  quite  well  in  D.C.  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  years  now  is  that  the  effects  have  to  be  direct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  it's  a  limiting  principle  akin  to  the  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limiting  principle  ­­ common  sense  limiting  principle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Court  has  used  in  the  ERISA  preemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contracts  with  respect  to  relating  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  with  respect  to  direct  effects,  what  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say  is  when  you  ­­ what  you're  talking  about  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  of  conduct  that  occurs  in  the  auction  itself, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participation  in  the  auction,  the  rates  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge  ­­ that  are  ­­ the  ­­ the  bids,  the  nature  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bids  that  can  be  accepted  at  the  auction,  the  use  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  bids  to  balance  wholesale  supply  and  demand, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment  of  the  bidders  at  a  rate  that  FERC  prescribes, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  recoupment  of  that  payment  in  the  wholesale  market, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  in  the  wholesale  market  that  you've  got  as  direct  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  as  you  can  have. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we're  quite  comfortable  with  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawing  a  line  that  would  exclude  the  kinds  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples  ­­ the  hypotheticals  that  the  D.C.  Circuit  came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  regulating  steel,  regulating  ­­ regulating  inputs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  electric  generation.  We  don't  think  FERC's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

authority  goes  anywhere  near  that  far. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  ­­ but  when  you're  talking  about  conduct

market,  it's  just  at  the  core  of  the  practices  affecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  that  the  statute  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  isn't  the  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  the  central  conduct  here.  The  central  conduct  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  refusal  to  buy  power  during  peak  hours.  That  occurs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  retail  market.  So  why  is  that  a  direct  effect? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  ­­ what  you're  ­­ what  you're  telling  people  is,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  agree  not  to  buy  power  at  retail  during  certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hours,  we're  going  to  pay  you.  I  ­­ that  seems  to  me  an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirect  effect,  not  a  direct  effect. 

   

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No,  the  ­­ what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  ­­ that  ­­ that's  ­­ that  is  ­­ it  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirect  effect  of  the  conduct  that  FERC  regulates  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market  participants,  the  wholesale  market  operators  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ and  the  participants  in  the  wholesale  auction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  that's  an  effect.  The  conduct  that  FERC  regulates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  occurs  in  that  auction.  It  creates  that  incentive, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes  it  does.  But  all  of  the  conduct  is  in  that  auction. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  clearly  within  the  text  of  824(e)(a).  And  there  is

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  That  ­­ that  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

correct,  Justice  Sotomayor.  And  if  I  ­­ I  would  like  to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

make  one  point  and  then  reserve  the  balance  of  my  time, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  I  could. 

   

            

And  the  one  point  is  this:  There  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  text  that  unambiguously  denies  FERC  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  that  it's  exercising  here  over  this  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct.  And  given  that,  Chevron  requires  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  uphold  FERC's  authority  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  General.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CARTER  G.  PHILLIPS 

 

 

 

 

 

          

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PRIVATE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  Kennedy,  I  think  I'd  like  to  start 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  first  question  you  asked,  which  is  what  ­­ what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  we  learn  essentially  from  Economics  101.  And  ­­ but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  the  way  that  you  have  to  think  about  it  is  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms  of  the  actual  market  that  operates  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  case,  which  is  a  wholesale  market. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

It's  not  a  market  that  covers  the  entire 

   

 

 

 

 

 

United  States.  It  covers  less  than  half  the  States.

But  it  is  an  important  market  that  was  created  in  order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  create  a  basis  for  competition. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  up  to  this  point,  up  prior  to  the  demand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  initiative  that  was  not  adopted  by  FERC,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was,  in  fact,  pushed  by  my  clients  and  those  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent  in  private  business,  what  we  were  trying  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  to  create  a  demand­side  component  to  that  wholesale 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

market.  Because  trying  to  regulate  exclusively  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  ­­ to  deal  exclusively  with  the  supply  side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  work,  or  it's  not  as  effective  as  it  could  be, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  certainly  wouldn't  necessarily  guarantee  you  just  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  rates. 

 

            

And  so  tariffs  were  filed  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  a  basis  for  putting  in  the  demand  side.  And  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  why  this  is  a  direct  effect  on  the  ­­ on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  rates  is  because  it's  an  absolute  one­to­one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship. 

            

If  I  put  in  a  unit  of  ­­ of  or  reduce  a  unit 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  demand,  I  don't  need  as  much  supply,  and  that  affects 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  price  directly.  And  that's  the  direct  relationship 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  derives  from  the  economic  principles. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  to  my  mind,  the  entirety  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  Power  Act,  in  201,  204,  205,  asks  you  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  instance  to  look  at  the  wholesale  market  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists.

And  then  once  you  do  that,  then  is  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  it's  not:  Does  it  affect  the  retail  rate? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clearly  it  will.  The  question  is:  Did  what  FERC  do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  in  the  order  directly  affect  the  wholesale  rate? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  on  that  score,  it  seems  to  me  there's  no  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Then  the  issue  becomes  what  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Excuse  me.  I  think  moving 

    

  

 

 

 

directly  to  control  retail  prices,  subsidizing  certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  purchases,  that  also  would  directly  affect  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  rate.  And  ­­ and  does  that  mean  FERC  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  to  do  that? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  I  don't  know  that  it  would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

directly  affect  the  wholesale  rate  in  nearly  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exquisite  a  fashion  as  the  regulation  in  this  case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  again,  you're  talking  about  the  exact  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions  going  on  in  affecting  supply  and  demand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nothing  can  affect  the  wholesale  rates  that  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  I  make  an  effort  to  manipulate  the  retail 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rates,  maybe  eventually  it  will  affect  the  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rates,  but  it  will  do  it  in  ways  that  are  very  indirect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  we  explained  in  our  reply  brief.  It  may  go  up;  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  go  down.  It's  impossible  to  know. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's  no  way  to  doubt  that  if  I  reduce 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

supply,  that  that  will  in  ­­ or  if  I  ­­ yeah.  If  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduce  supply,  that  will  cause  the  ­­ the  rates,  the

wholesale  rates  to  drop  as  a  natural  consequence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  don't  mean  to  jumped 

    

 

 

 

 

forward  too  ­­ too  quickly  to,  really,  the  second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  did  FERC  comply  with  its  obligation  to  explain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  reason  for  its  change,  but  it  ­­ it  does  seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me  that  ­­ that  they  come  close  together. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

FERC's  argument  is  essentially  circular. 

 

 

 

 

It  ­­ it  says,  well,  the  market  forces  will  ­­ will  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  out,  but  we  define  the  market.  That  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circular. 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  I  mean  ­­ I  don't  know 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that  we  define  the  market.  We've  allowed  the  market  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  created. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  mean,  there  are  two 

    

 

 

 

 

parts  to  this  argument:  One  is  jurisdiction;  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  whether  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right.  No,  I  understand 

   

  

  

 

that.  But  the  question  is  what  price  will  allow  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  ­­ will  promote  this  market,  to  create  incentives

demand  side,  I'm  sorry  ­­ in  order  to  make  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningful? 

            

And  what  the  FERC  said  was,  when  we  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience  with  one  of  the  regional  transmission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operations,  what  happened  when  they  reduced  the  price?

The  amount  of  the  demand  response  dropped  precipitously. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  as  a  consequence  of  that,  based  on  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience,  we  now  have  enough  evidence  by  which  to  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wait  a  second,  we  need  to  go  back  and  raise  the  price  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  to  bring  in  more  of  the  demand  response,  in  order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ensure  that  there  is  a  reasonable  balance  between  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supply  and  the  ­­ and  the  demand.  But  all  of  that's  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  wholesale  market. 

 

 

            

This  ­­ this  doesn't  come  close  to  violating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  principle  of  Louisiana  Power  where  this  Court  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  the  retail  authority  that  is  preserved  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State?  And  that's  to  set  the  rates  for  retail  sales.

MR.  PHILLIPS:  I'm  sorry,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ that  what  FERC  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  basically  leaves  the  States  with  the  pure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formality  of  setting  the  rate  that  is  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  affected  by  what  FERC  is  doing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  my  hypothetical,  if  you  remember,  I  mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

they  get  to  say  how  much  the  hamburger  costs  once  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  in  the  store,  but  FERC  can  respond  to  it  directly  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

setting  the  price  to  encourage  you  not  to  enter  the

effects  on  the  retail  rates  doesn't  deprive  FERC,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  is  the  supreme  authority  here,  as  long  as  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operates  within  the  sphere  of  adopting  ­­ of  dealing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  a  practice,  regulating  a  practice  that  will  in  fact 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

affect  the  wholesale  rates.  And  that's  precisely  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  has  tried  to  do  in  this  particular  context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and,  Justice  Kennedy,  I  don't  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  problem  with  respect  to  the  way  the  rates  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set,  because  again,  if  you  do  it  in  the  ­­ in  this  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  fundamental  Economics  101  approach,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr.  Khan  is  the  one  who  ­­ who  was  the  primary  proponent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  it,  said,  look,  if  you're  ­­ if  you're  taking  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand,  if  you're  ­­ if  you're  reducing  demand,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affects  supply  directly,  and  therefore,  you  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensate  them  exactly  the  same. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  FERC  looked  at  that  and  said,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  makes  perfect  sense  to  us.  That's  an  appropriate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  go.  That  will  ­­ you  know. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  not  a  ­­ that's  not  luring  people; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that's  just  providing  a  basis  upon  which  there  will  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  of  a  market  in  order  to  allow  the  wholesale  side 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  ­­ of  the  grid  system  to  operate  in  an  efficient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  Not  only  to  reduce  the  wholesale  prices,  which  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important,  but  even  more  fundamentally,  Your  Honor,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protect  the  reliability  of  the  grid.

That  was  what  prompted,  frankly,  the  initial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effort  to  deal  with  this  entire  demand  response  issue, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  to  figure  out  what  are  we  going  to  do  about

side. 

            

We  need  to  reduce  the  demand  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensure  that  in  response  to  these  kinds  of  crises,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  answer.

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Why  ­­ why  ­­ why  aren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  companies  in  agreement  with  you?  Why  are  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  ­­ some  private  companies  on  the  other  side? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  most  of  the  private 

  

 

 

 

 

 

companies  on  the  other  side  generate  electricity  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  prefer  not  to  manipulate  the  supply  side  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  ­­ they're  ­­ I  mean,  manipulate  the  demand  side 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  like  to  have  all  of  the  supply  side  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  as  far  as  you  can  take  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  they're  not  all 

  

 

 

 

 

generators  I  don't  think. 

   

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  They're  pretty  ­­ I  mean,

deference  on  the  question  of  the  scope  of  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction,  and  it  assuredly  deserves  deference, 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy,  in  deciding  as  between  locational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marginal  price  and  locational  marginal  price  minus  G  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

minus  G  plus  A,  or  however  you  would  go  about  that.

If  there  are  no  further  questions,  Your

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  PAUL  D.  CLEMENT 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

              

I  don't  usually  start  in  this  Court  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling  you  who  I  represent,  but  I  think  I  better  do  it 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

here,  which  is  I  represent  not  just  EPSA,  which  is  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

group  of  power  generators,  but  a  number  of  other  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  organizations. 

 

            

So  the  vast  majority  of  the  people  that  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent  are  load­serving  entities  who  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively  on  the  supply  side.  They're  actually  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulated  public  utilities  that  actually  could  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand  response  in  a  wholesale,  meaningful  level  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

working,  as  they  have  since  long  before  FERC  got  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business,  to  work  with  retail  customers  and  their  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulators  to  provide  for  reduced  retail  demand  at  peak 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time.  So  that's  who  I  represent. 

   

  

 

 

            

Now  what  I'd  like  to  start,  beyond  telling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  who  I  represent,  is  with  the  notion  of  what  FERC  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  do  here,  which  was  to  reduce  retail  demand  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing  payments  to  retail  customers  on  an  otherwise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  market  in  an  effort  to  change  the  effective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price  for  retail  sales. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that  sure  sounds  like  something  that

belongs  to  the  States.  So  the  answer  you  hear  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Where  is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  ­­ from  the  general  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Where  is  that  in  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

written  anywhere  that  that  was  their  goal?  That's  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  characterized  that  goal.  But  what  I've  heard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  say  is,  we're  trying  to  lower  the  price  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  to  a  more  just  amount.  That's  what's  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything  I've  seen  written.  You've  recharacterized  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  don't  think  it's  just  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

characterization  battle  ultimately.  But  even  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  stipulate  that  they  are  trying  to  reduce  retail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand  for  the  best  of  wholesale  reasons,  it's  still  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  They're  not  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

retail  market. 

 

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  What?  I'm  sorry? 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  They're  ­­ they're 

  

 

 

 

generators  selling  to  intermediaries.  The 

  

 

 

 

intermediaries  are  the  ones  who  are  in  the  market  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  retailers. 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  That's  not  correct,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor.  It's  crystal  clear,  and  I  don't  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor  General  will  contradict  me  in  his  rebuttal, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  what  FERC  does  uniquely  in  this  context  is  invite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  customers,  directly  large  retail  customers  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  true.  That  is  true. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  ­­ directly  on  the  wholesale 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That  is  true.  What  you  say 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  ­­

 

            

exchange. 

            

is  true.  Every  reduction  in  demand  for  a  unit  of  retail 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electricity  is  ipso  facto  a  demand  for  a  reduction  of  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unit  of  wholesale  electricity,  and  vice  versa.  So  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hardly  surprising  that  anything  they  do  in  the  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market  that  adds  to  demand  will  add  to  demand  in  retail, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  vice  versa. 

 

 

            

But  I  thought  that  their  motivation  here  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  following:  On  the  4th  of  August  at  4:00  p.m., 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  turn  on  electricity  for  air­conditioning.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  peak  hour.  The  industry,  leaving  reserves  out  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  as  a  fixed  matter,  has  to  supply  that.  So  if  there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  enough  generators  at  4:00  p.m.  on  August  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4th,  they  have  to  build  one. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  to  build  an  additional  generator  ­­ I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  what  gas  costs  now,  but  let's  imagine  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$500,000,  and  that  will  be  passed  on  in  the  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price,  and  then  probably,  though  the  States  are  free  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  what  they  want,  in  the  retail  price. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  FERC  thinks  I  have  another  way  of  doing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  For  only  $400,000,  I  can  be  sure  that  on  the  4th

of  August  at  4:00  p.m.,  the  demand  is  not  great  enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  spend  the  500,  and  so  we  group  the  people  who  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

promise  to  fulfill  their  air­conditioning  at  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times. 

            

That  way,  the  price  of  wholesale  electricity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

falls.  And,  therefore,  we  satisfy  all  demand  at  a  lower 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

price.  We  are  interested  in  wholesale.  We  are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

interested  in  how  to  satisfy  peak  wholesale  demand.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  worked  out  a  way  to  do  it  cheaper.  Of  course  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affects  retail  prices,  so  does  everything  we  do  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  wholesale  prices.  End  of  the  matter. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  accept  your  characterization,  but  I  do 

   

   

 

 

 

not  see  any  law  that  prevents  them  from  raising  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lowering  wholesale  price  despite  the  fact  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affects  retail  price. 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  And  I  certainly  wouldn't  be 

   

  

 

 

 

here  suggesting  that  anything  that  happens  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  market  that  affects  retail  price  is  somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verboten  to  FERC.  But  I  am  here  to  say  that  when  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  wholesale  prices,  essentially  as  Justice  Scalia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested,  through  the  retail  market,  that  that  crosses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  very  important  boundary  in  the  Federal  Power  Act.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  all  due  respect  to  your  question,  your  approach  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  would  make  perfect  sense  if  FERC  were  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulator  on  this  scene,  but  ­­

and  the  very  fact  ­­ and  this  is  what  I  ­­ where  I

changing  ­­ they're  changing  the  effective  price  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  electricity. 

 

            

The  only  ­­ the  saving  grace  for  them  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ah,  but  we're  limiting  ourselves  to  the  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market,  and  we're  the  wholesale  regulator.  So  why

shouldn't  we  do  it? 

 

 

 

            

Here's  the  problem:  These  retail  customers 

  

 

 

 

 

don't  belong  on  the  wholesale  market.  Whether  you  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  lured  in  or  you  think  they  walked  in  the  door, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  doesn't  matter.  They  are  on  a  market  where  they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  belong.  The  fact  that  they  are  regulating  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  and  this  context  alone,  retail  customers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly,  is  a  profound  signal  that  they've  overstepped 

   

 

 

 

 

 

their  jurisdictional  bounds. 

 

 

            

And  I  think  the  way  you  can  understand  why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  they're  on  the  wholesale  market  is  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete  answer  is  to  consider  the  following  scenario, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  doesn't  seem  all  that  farfetched,  which  is  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  large  retail  consumer  of  electricity,  let's  call  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wal­Mart,  decides,  you  know  what,  I  like  the  prices  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  wholesale  market  better,  and  I  buy  more  electricity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  a  lot  of  load­serving  entities  in  small 

   

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions.  So  I'm  going  to  walk  on  to  the  wholesale 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market  run  by  an  ITO  or  an  ITO,  and  I'm  going  to  buy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electricity  for  my  own  consumption  at  a  better  price. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  they  did  that,  I  don't  think  there  is  any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  that  would  be  a  retail  sale  that  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  be  regulated  by  the  States.  And  if  that  actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened,  then  the  RTOs  and  ISOs  would  have  to  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice.  They  would  either  open  themselves  up  to

they  probably  would  do,  which  is,  one  regulator  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plenty. 

            

We're  just  going  to  say  that  Wal­Mart  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  on  to  our  market  and  buy  retail  gas  directly  from  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generator.  And  that's  the  world  we  live  in.  Wal­Mart 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  walk  on  that  market  and  buy  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what's  the  ­­ what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  horror  here  of  concurrent  jurisdiction?  You  seem  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

posit  that  this  is  horrible,  but  if,  in  fact,  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lowering  prices,  Wal­Mart  sees  it  as  a  lowering  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prices,  I  ­­ hard  to  think  of  why  States  would  say  no, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  some  of  them  have.  But  I'm  not  sure  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  is  with  concurrent  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I'm  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sure,  ultimately,  that  my  burden  is  to  show  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

horrible  as  opposed  to  ultra  vires.  But  let  me  try  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  to  you  why  concurrent  jurisdiction  is  an  anomaly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  context  of  the  Federal  Power  Act.  I  mean,  this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court,  on  numerous  occasions,  has  said  that  although 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ sometimes  it's  hard  to  divide  the  lines.  Once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  do,  generally  the  Federal  government  operates  in  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  sphere  of  the  wholesale  market,  and  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  in  ­­ exclusively  in  the  retail  market.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  they  all  ­­ each  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  affect  each  other. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  But  here's  the  problem  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

yeah,  normally  they  stay  away  from  each  other  and  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other's  customers. 

 

            

Another  thing  that  is  a  complete  anomaly 

   

 

 

 

 

that  FERC  has  created  here  that,  as  far  as  I'm  aware, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists  nowhere  else  in  the  energy  world,  is  you  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  Federal  government  and  the  Federal  regulators 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  State  regulators  bidding  against  each  other  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  customers  to  reduce  their  same  retail  demand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  other  side  has  made  a  very  big  deal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  none  of  the  States  raised  a  jurisdictional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

objection  before  FERC  itself.  But  there  were  a  number 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  States,  Ohio,  Illinois,  and  all  of  the  States  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  participants  in  the  MISO,  one  of  the  ISOs.  And  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  told  FERC  is,  by  all  means,  do  not  set  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation  level  at  LMP,  because  that's  too  high.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  setting  it  so  high,  what  you  are  going  to  do  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to  crowd  out  our  own  efforts  at  dealing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  demand  response.  Because  we  love  demand  response. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  want  demand  response.  But  we  don't  want  to  pay  twice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  much  as  the  market  really  should  pay  for  demand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response.  And  if  you're  out  there  offering  our  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  customers  the  ability  to  get  demand  response  paid

at  huge  LMP  levels,  then  we're  going  to  be  crowded  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  only  response  that  FERC  can  offer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  that  is,  well,  then  just  opt­out,  come  on,  you  know. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  that's  the  third  anomaly  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there's  no  other  area  of  regulatory  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  FERC  allows  States  to  opt­out.  And  if  you  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  they're  opting  out  and  compare  it  to  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  theory,  it  doesn't  work.  I  mean,  since  when  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  all  of  a  sudden  enthusiastic  about  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

experimentations  with  practices  that  directly  affect 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  rates? 

 

            

In  every  other  context  where  they  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  jurisdiction,  wholesale  rates,  transmission,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

only  would  they  not  allow  State  opt­outs,  but  they  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  it's  going  to  lead  to  discrimination  in  a  way  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  unjust  and  unreasonable. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  opt­out  option  here,  though,  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  for  another  reason,  which  is  it's  worse  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  that  most  want  to  provide  for  demand  response. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  what  they're  being  told  is,  all  right,  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  subset  of  your  customers  who  are  actually  interested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  demand  response.  And  if  you  want  to  opt­out,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  tell  your  customers  who  are  interested  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand  response  is  we're  actually  going  to  pass  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  that  restricts  you,  and  you  can't  go  into  the

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  guess  if  you're  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  ­­ you're  going  to  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  a  lousier  rate. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  If  you're  right,  then  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guess  the  FERC  could  not  direct  the  grid  approvals  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  that  would,  in  fact,  prevent  certain  retail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customers  from  buying  electricity  at  certain  times.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  that  FERC  could  not,  in  fact,  allow  large 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumers  of  electricity  to  buy  at  wholesale,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  take  the  retail  customers  away  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  of  the  State. 

 

 

 

              

I  guess  that  FERC  could  not,  in  fact,  insist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  a  marginal  capacity  being  generated  from  natural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

gas  instead  of  from  other  things,  because  that  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect  the  price  of  natural  gas,  will  affect  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  rate,  thereby  raising  the  retail  rate,  thereby 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stealing  customers  away  from,  let's  say,  Ohio,  where  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes  up,  and  forcing  them  to  go  to  Texas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  I  have  not  been  surprised  that  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

have  found  no  case  in  which  FERC  ever  tried  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  roughly  comparable  or  even  by  the  roughest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogy  that  would  say  that  they  cannot  do  this  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  you  suggest.

lot  in  that  question,  but  let  me  just  respond  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  all  there  were  meant  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  was  three  examples,  and  I  don't  know  how  good  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are,  but  they  come  to  mind. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  with  all  due  respect,  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple  of  them  aren't  that  great  because  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  ­­ because  you  seem  to  suggest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  you  can't  do  this,  well,  then  FERC  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  tell  generation  resources  that  we  don't  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  more  coal  generation;  we  only  want  natural  gas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And,  of  course,  they  can't  do  that  because  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Power  Act  reserved  the  plenary  authority  of  regeneration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  States. 

 

 

            

You  also  suggested  if  they  can't  do  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  they  can't  allow  Wal­Mart  to  helpfully  walk  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  wholesale  market  and  buy  at  retail. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  was  grasping  your  point, 

    

 

 

 

 

which  I  hadn't  grasped  previously.  And  your  point  seems 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  that  the  problem  here  is  the  way  they  are  reducing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  demand,  and  therefore,  the  cost  of  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electricity,  is  by  taking  a  ­­ groups  of  people  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preventing  them  from  buying  electricity  at  all  at

retail.

Isn't  that  basically  your  point?  And  if  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  I  was  trying  to  think  with  that  argument.  That's  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  I  said  that  you  can  skip  the  whole  thing  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  want. 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  here  ­­ here's  a  way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  trying  to  harmonize  that,  which  is  I  think  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  line  that  the  Federal  Power  Act  divides  ­­ draws  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  retail  sales  and  wholesale  sales.  And  I  believe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  impermissibly  on  the  retail  side  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line. 

              

I  think  my  friends  on  the  other  side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  think  that  the  difference  isn't  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  and  wholesale  but  is  between  sales  and  nonsales, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  appear  to  concede  my  Wal­Mart  example  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  retail  world.  Which  is  to  say,  on  page  39  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SG's  brief,  I  think  they  pretty  much  concede  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wal­Mart  cannot  walk  on  to  a  wholesale  market  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchase  gas  at  retail  without  coming  into  the  scope  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  regulators. 

 

 

              

I  think  they  also  concede  that,  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  interest  here  was  not  to  suppress  retail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand  but  to  increase  it,  they  thought,  you  know,  if  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  just  sort  of  boost  retail  demand  a  little  bit, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'd  get  a  whole  bunch  of  these  new  green  resources 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

online  and  it  would  actually  make,  you  know,  everything

better. 

            

So  we  want  to  increase  retail  demand.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's  what  we're  going  to  do:  We're  going  to  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  directly  or  through  the  wholesale  operators  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  pay  a  bonus  to  people  who  increase  their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  purchases. 

 

            

That,  I  believe,  my  friends  on  the  other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

side  say,  well,  no  FERC  couldn't  do  that  because  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  affect  a  fully­consummated  sale. 

   

 

 

            

So  their  position  seems  to  be  although  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  pay  ­­ we  can't  pay  incentive  payments  to  increase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  demand,  we  can  pay  incentive  payments  to  reduce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  demand. 

 

            

Two  observations  about  that:  One  is,  why  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  world  would  that  make  sense?  I  mean,  why  in  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world  would  ­­ would  Congress  have  divided  the  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  in  a  way  that  allows  the  Federal  government  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppress  retail  demand  but  not  increase  retail  demand? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  thing  that  I  want  to  say  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  anomaly,  though,  is  the  line  between  sales  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonsales  can't  be  the  right  line  because  it  ­­ if  it  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  not  only  can  they  do  what  Justice  Scalia  suggested, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  have  FERC  pay  a  direct  bounty  not  to  purchase. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  was  actually  quite  surprised  by  the  Solicitor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

General's  answer  to  that.  And  he  ­­ and  he  didn't  fully

complete  the  answer.  He  said  that  would  be  a  harder 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  but  he  didn't  ultimately  say  how  that  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answered. 

              

I  think  he  has  to  say  that,  if  FERC  sort  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cut  out  the  wholesale  operators  and  just  said,  we  got  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  appropriation,  and  every  retail  customer  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduces  their  retail  consumption  gets  a  $200  check  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC,  that  has  to  be  consistent  with  their  position  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  can  do  it  because  it  doesn't  interfere  with  a  fully 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consummated  sale. 

 

            

But  we're  still  ­­ if  they're  right,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  FERC  can  do  tomorrow  is  solve  this  problem  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  directly.  They  can  say,  retail  customers,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  buy  at  peak  times.  You  simply  can't.  We're  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  allow  it.  Because  that's  going  to  reduce 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  ­­ the  wholesale  demand.  It's  going  to  avoid 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brownouts.  It's  going  to  take  all  the  pressure  off  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grid.  So  that's  it.  No  more  purchases  on  August  4th. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  they're  not  regulating 

  

 

 

 

 

the  rate  of  sales. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  They're  not  regulating  the 

  

 

 

 

 

rate  of  sales.  So,  you  know,  never  mind.  Or  ­­ or  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  the  rate  of  sales  is  ­­ is  either  zero  or  infinity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  can't  do  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  any  way  you  think  about  it,  that  has  to

be  the  implication  of  their  theory  that  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  difference  between  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  They  have  to  be  reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  what  they  do  under  Chevron.  It's  a  broadly­phrased 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  What  they  have  to  do  is  reasonable. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  really  the  question  is:  Is  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  doing  here  unreasonable? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  ­­ and  I  ­­ and  we're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  electricity  regulators;  they  are.  It's  pretty  tough 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  technical. 

 

            

And  ­­ and  so  that's  why  I  ­­ I've  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  figure  out  just  what  it  is  about  this  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  in  your  view,  makes  it  unreasonable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  And  what  is  unreasonable  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that,  before  you  get  to  a  Chevron  question,  certainly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  you  get  to  an  arbitrary  and  capricious  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  have  jurisdiction  for  FERC  to  do  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  basic  division  of  authority  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

201(b)  of  the  Federal  Power  Act  is  that  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  gets  sales  for  resales  and  the  States  get  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  sales. 

 

            

And  I  think  it's  important  to  recognize  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you  really  have  to  wrestle  upfront  with  the  201(b) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  because  the  other  side  loves  to  talk  about  205

and  206  in  the  practices  affecting  language.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  with  that  is  that  201(b)  specifically  says  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  provisions  of  this  subchapter,  which  include  205  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

206,  shall  apply  to  sales  for  wholesales  and  shall  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  to  all  other  sales. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  you  don't  get  to  205  and  206  if  what  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  regulated  front  and  center  is  a  retail  sale  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electricity.

to  discuss  your  point  that  section  ­­ that  Rule  745,

maybe  there's  some  other  point.  But  at  some  point

implications  of  your  argument  is  that  FERC  can't  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  with  respect  to  demand  response;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  No,  that's  not  right.  My 

  

  

 

 

 

 

position  is  that  FERC  can't  do  anything  with  demand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  with  retail  customers.  They  can  do  demand 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

response,  true  wholesale  demand  response,  which  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  actually  doing  before  they  went  down  this  route  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around,  you  know,  the  ­­ the  two  ­­ early  2000s. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  way  that  wholesale  demand  response 

 

 

 

 

 

 

works  is  the  way  you  sort  of  naturally  think  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work,  which  is  through  a  participant  in  the  wholesale 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

market,  namely  through  the  load­serving  entities  who  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mostly  my  clients. 

 

 

            

Because  the  way  you  can  sort  of  do  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  work  cooperatively  with  the  States  and  the  LSEs,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  encourage  them,  as  Congress  suggested  in  1252(e)  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ of  the  National  Policy  Act  or  the  Energy  Policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act.  You  encourage  them  to  do  all  sorts  of  things  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduce  their  demand,  and  then  there's  just  less  demand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bid  in  to  the  auction  in  the  first  place.  And  so  supply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meets  demand  at  a  much  lower  level. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Just  for  completeness  sake,  you  can  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  wholesale  participants  participate  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

demand/response  program  in  the  forward­capacity  markets, 

 

 

 

 

 

where,  again,  it  would  be  the  LSEs.  And  what  they  would

do  is  say,  we're  going  to  ­­ we're  going  to  ­­ three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  hence,  we're  going  to  reduce  our  compensation  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  our  ­­ our  consumption  by  this  level,  and  we're  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  it  on  the  local  level. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  just  to  further  complete  that  thought, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  it's  ­­ it's  nice  to  talk  that  FERC  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  this  since  2000,  but  the  States  have  been  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  long  before  that,  at  least  since  the  1980s. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  there  is  a  brief  for  other  respondents 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  don't  represent,  the  Midwest  load­serving 

   

 

 

 

 

entities.  And  it's  worth  a  ­­ it's  a  short  brief,  but 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  worth  a  quick  read  because  what  they  say  is,  look, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  been  doing  this  at  the  State  level  since  1984. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  a  local  utility.  We  work  with  our  local 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

regulator.  Because  we  have  plenary  authority  over  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  market,  we  can  deal  with  demand  response  in  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorts  of  ways  that  FERC  could  never  imagine.  And  we  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  things  like  basically  go  in  and  get  a  local  customer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  agree  with  us  to  change  the  way  ­­ their  thermostat. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  can  go  in,  send  somebody  in,  put  different  hardware 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  there,  and  then,  based  on  a  reduction  in  their  retail 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rates,  we  can  get  them  to  agree  that  basically,  on  a  hot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day  in  the  summer,  we  get  to  take  over  your  thermostat. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  we  directly  impose  demand  response  through  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  the  kind  of  thing  that  States

have  been  doing  since  the  '80s.  And  that's  the  kind  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  that  are  going  to  be  crowded  out  by  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­size­fits­all  rule  with  the  high  LMP 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation  recipe. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  so  this  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

practice,  though  ­­ so  I'll  just  narrow  the  question  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it's  retail  actors  who  are  bidding  into  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  market. 

 

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  take  it  that  there,  there 

    

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  regulatory  gap.  In  other  words,  FERC  can't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  anything  nor  can  the  States  do  anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  ­­ there  is  not  a  ­­ a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

regulatory  gap.  I  don't  think  FERC  can  do  anything. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  would  answer  it  by  reference  to  my  Wal­Mart  hypo 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  in  to  buy. 

 

 

 

            

If  Wal­Mart  went  in  to  buy  ­­ so  if  a  retail 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customer  on  the  buy  side  sort  of  walks  into  a  wholesale 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market  ­­ it's  not  that  lightning  strikes  and  they  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  it.  It's  that  it's  a  retail  transaction.  So  if 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  can  regulate  it,  it's  the  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  there's  not  a  regulatory  gap.  In  theory, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a  State  could  regulate  the  transaction  even  though  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

takes  place  on  an  otherwise  wholesale  market.

want  to  ­­ as  a  practical  matter,  I  don't  think  the  ISOs 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  RTOs  want  to  be  regulated  by  both  FERC  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States.  So  I  think  what  they  would  do  is,  ah,  if  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price  of  having  a  retail  customer  on  our  otherwise 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  market  is  we  get  State  regulation  on  top  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  regulation,  then  we're  going  to  bar  the  door  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  retail  customer. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Maybe  you  can  turn 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  question  Justice  Kennedy  asked  you  to  address. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

to. 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  would  be  delighted 

    

   

   

 

 

 

If  I  could  say  one  last  thing  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction,  which  is  simply  I  ­­ I  do  think,  though, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  premise  of  the  other  side's  argument  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sky  will  fall  if  you  don't  have  this  precise  type  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  customer  on  wholesale  market  demand  response. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  there,  I  think,  it's  worth  taking  a  look  at  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Southern  company's  brief,  because  they  operate  in  a  part 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  country  that  doesn't  have  an  RTO  or  an  ISO. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It  ­­ it  is  an  odd  result, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  this  Energy  Policy  Act  which  made  it  so  clear  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  liked  demand  response  that  it  wanted  FERC  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower  barriers  to  demand  response,  to  then  say,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  has  no  jurisdiction  to  do  exactly  what  the  policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  articulated  is.

MR.  CLEMENT:  But  the  problem  with  that  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  looking  it,  Justice  Kagan,  with  all  due  respect,  is  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  looks  only  at  1252(f),  which  is  the  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference  to  what  FERC's  supposed  to  do,  and  it  ignores 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1252(e)  where  Congress  recognized  that  the  States  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  primary  actors  here. 

 

 

 

            

And  the  point  I  was  making  about  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Southern  company  brief  is  operating  in  an  area  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ISOs,  without  RTOs,  so  without  FERC,  they  actually  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  greater  level  of  demand  response  than  other  parts  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  country  that  have  the  Federal  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  to  bring  us  to  the  arbitrary  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capriciousness  question,  I  think,  Justice  Kennedy,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

way  I  think  about  it  is  that  we  have  both  procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objections  and  substantive  objections. 

 

 

 

            

The  procedural  objections  are  essentially 

 

 

 

 

that  there  are  all  sorts  of  objections  to  using  LMP  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  price  to  provide  compensation. 

 

 

 

 

            

That  wasn't  just  my  clients.  That  was  also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  States  that  I  alluded  to  who  were  worried  that  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high  level  of  compensation  would  crowd  out  their  effort. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  was  a  particularly  poignant  comment  from 

   

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  ­­ some  of  the  ITOs  and  RTOs  who  design 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  ­­ run  these  wholesale  markets. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  ones  that  I  thought  were  most

persuasive  in  some  respects  was  the  operators  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MISO,  the  midwestern  one,  because  at  FERC's  direction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  basically  spent  two  years  trying  to  come  up  with  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  all  the  stakeholders  in  a  room  and  come  up  with  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formulation  ­­ a  compensation  formula  that  worked.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

what  they  came  up  with  was  essentially  LMP  minus  G. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  after  having  spent  two  years  with  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  stakeholders  coming  up  with  LMP  minus  G,  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  told  by  the  Federal  government  at  a  late  breaking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hour  that  there  was  a  one­size­fits­all  solution,  and  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  LMP. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  wait  a  minute. 

   

  

 

 

That's  the  classic  choice  that  we  give  agencies.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  expert  testimony,  Dr.  Khan,  who  was  undisputed  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  leading  expert  in  this  field,  say  the  opposite.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  how  do  we  choose  to  go  into  the  weeds  of  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  technical  as  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ when  that's  been 

  

 

 

 

 

entrusted  to  the  agency? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Surely  it  has.  But  the  reason 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  started  with  the  procedural  way  of  coming  at  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  D.C.  Circuit  has  lots  of  arbitrary  and  capricious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  and  they  are  quite  comfortable  in  saying  that,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  like  this,  you  didn't  respond  adequately

to  the  comments  that  were  put  before  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Would  you  tell  me  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one?  I  mean,  I  looked  through  everything  that  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

dissenter  said,  and  there  is  at  least  one  or  two  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  paragraphs  in  the  FEC's  report  on  this  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  explains  why  they  chose  a  different  route. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  there  is  certainly  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  ­­ the  ­­ the  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

below  didn't  give  us  one  comment  by  the  dissenter  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  addressed  by  something  said  in  the  report. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  can  give  you  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

example,  Justice  Sotomayor,  if  it  will  help,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Chairman  Mueller  in  his  dissent  ­­ Commissioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mueller  in  his  dissent  actually  used  a  hypothetical  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  very  similar  to  the  hypothetical  discussed  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  and  the  SG's  brief  about  a  factory  and  how  if  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  have  full  LMP,  a  factory  will  essentially  reduce 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  production  at  time  periods  where  it's  economically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inefficient  for  them  to  do  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  they  ­­ and  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  that,  and  what  did  they  say? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  They  ­­ they  had  no  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Only  when  it's 

  

 

 

 

economically  feasible  will  we  pay  this  price. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  the  way  I  read  the  ­­

the  way  I  read  the  record,  Your  Honor,  is  that  there  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  response  to  that  hypothetical,  just  as  there  was  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  in  the  SG's  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  The  response  was  where  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  work,  we  won't  use  it,  which  I  didn't  find  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  satisfactory  response.  Isn't  that  essentially  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  said? 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I'm  not  even  sure  they  ­­ they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  much,  but  I  don't  think  they  really  grappled 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  it. 

 

            

And  to  whatever  extent  they  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  thought  that  the  response 

    

 

 

 

 

was  what  Justice  Sotomayor,  and  the  way  ­­ I  wouldn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterize  it  that  way,  but  it's  called  the  "net 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits  test."  And  the  net  benefits  test  means  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  one  size  fits  all. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  then  in  the  order,  at  paragraph  17,  18, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  67,  they  go  through  a  bunch  of  methodologies,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ I  mean,  they  say,  we're  picking  this  one. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  reason  that  they  pick  this  one,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess,  is  they  think  it's  ­­ if  you  try  a  G  thing,  that 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  is  a  problem  administratively. 

   

 

 

            

Okay.  Now,  I'll  just  read  those.  Is  there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything  else  you're  going  to  tell  me  that  ­­ I'll  read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  and  see  what  they  say,  right?

MR.  CLEMENT:  Sure.  Well,  I  would  ­­ I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

would  ­­ I  would  encourage  you  to  look  at  the  FTC 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comments,  the  Joint  Appendix  page  281,  the  comments  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  States. 

 

              

I  mean,  I  would  think  that  when  you  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

another  coordinate  part  of  the  federal  government  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  and  say,  you  are  picking  the  wrong  compensation  level 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  will  be  affirmatively  inefficient  and  will  crowd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  other  uses  for  demand  response,  that  you'd  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owe  them  something  more  of  an  explanation  than  grouping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  in  a  footnote  with  every  other  commentator  you  got 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say,  we're  not  persuaded  by  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is,  though,  I  think  ­­ and  I  would  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

actually,  you  know,  I  ­­ I  didn't  think  I  would  come  up 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

here  talking  about  net  benefits  test,  but  I  actually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'll  read  ­­ Cicchetti  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

writes  about  that  in  the  brief,  doesn't  he? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Yes.  Yes. 

  

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  so  I  think  that's  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

best  brief  to  read  on  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Right?  Okay. 

  

  

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  And  ­­ and  ­­ and  what  I  would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  beyond  that  about  the  net  benefits  test  is  here's

another  way  in  which  the  ­­ the  compensation  formula  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  I  would  call  substantively  arbitrary  and 

   

 

 

 

 

capricious. 

            

The  whole  formula  is  built  on  the  idea  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  an  ­­ an  equivalence  between  less  demand  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  actual  supply  of  energy.  But  of  course,  when  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  to  the  nitty­gritty  of  it,  it  turns  out  that's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true,  because  the  great  thing  about  actual  supply  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

energy  is  that  other  wholesale  ­­ real  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customers  buy  it,  and  then  the  market  clears  naturally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  when  you  start  getting  a  third­party  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there,  a  retail  customer  who  really  doesn't  belong  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  start  saying,  we're  going  to  pay  you  money,  but  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  doesn't  actually  result  in  load  that  ­­ a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

load­serving  entity  pays  for,  that  creates  a  deficit  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  wholesale  account. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  one  way  to  think  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  that  the  ­­ FERC's  argument  is  circular.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  well,  the  market  will  take  care  of  this,  but  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

define  the  market. 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Yes.  And  yet,  it's  ­­ the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

market  really  can't  take  care  of  it  because  the  market's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed  to  simply  get  a  bunch  of  wholesale  sellers  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  bunch  of  wholesale  buyers  together,  and  the  price  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sales  and  the  price  of  the  purchases  equal  each

other  out,  and  everybody  goes  home  happy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  when  you  invite  retail  customers  on  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  guess  what,  we're  going  to  pay  you  not  to  buy,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creates  a  market  imbalance. 

   

 

            

The  FERC  euphemistically  refers  to  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  billing  unit  effect.  And  then  they  have  to  solve 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  by  making  adjustments  to  the  market  clearing  price. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  then  to  make  sure  they  don't  go  too  far  down,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  the  net  benefits  test,  which  is  not  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind­bogglingly  complex,  but  FERC  itself  recognizes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  imperfect. 

 

            

The  last  thing  I  want  to  say,  though,  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  the  substantive  unreasonableness  about  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  more  fundamental  problem  here,  and  it's  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  economist's  brief  on  our  side  gets  at  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  well,  which  is  at  the  end  of  the  day,  if  FERC  gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  this  on  the  wholesale  markets,  what  is  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchased  is  not  energy,  actual  energy  that's  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bought  and  then  sold.  What  is  being  sold  is  an  option 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  buy  electricity  at  a  subsidized  retail  rate. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  any  other  market  ­­ I  mean,  think  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  stock  where  I  have  an  option  to  buy  it  at  20  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market  price  is  40.  Lots  and  lots  of  people  are  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  offer  me  20,  19  for  that  option  because  I  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valuable  right  to  buy  something  at  a  below­market  price.

But  nobody  is  going  to  offer  me  40  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

option  to  buy  at  20  just  because  the  market  price  is  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40.  But  that  is  exactly  what  FERC  has  done  by  setting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  compensation  rate  at  LMP. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  they  made  mincemeat  out  of  poor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr.  Kahn,  because  what  Dr.  Kahn  really  says  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market  signal  that  the  customer  ought  to  get  is  LMP. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  the  market  signal  they  get  is  LMP  if  it  accounts  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoided  costs. 

 

            

If  you  take  the  avoided  costs  out  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  then  you  get  LMP  plus  the  retail  costs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  of  course,  another  irony  here  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distortion  is  greatest  in  those  markets  where  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  done  exactly  what  FERC  would  like,  which  is  adopt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  price  ­­ real  time  pricing,  because  then  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retail  price  is  LMP. 

 

 

 

            

And  so  what  is  the  compensation  rate  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand  response  providers?  It's  twice  LMP. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  thought  ­­ you  don't

and  which  was  wrong,  but  that  ­­ but  that  FERC  did  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  it  by  giving  specific­enough  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Yes.  That  ­­ that  is  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

principal  reason.  But  I  ­­ but  I  don't  want  to  suggest 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  just  purely  procedural  because  I  don't  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  are  things  they  can  fix. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  of  course,  we  hope  that  you  don't  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  to  that  question  because  you  find  they  don't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

Thank  you. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

text,  my  friend  pointed  to  Section  824(b),  which  you  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  at  1(a)  of  the  appendix  to  our  brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  it  says  is  not  that  FERC  shall  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  sales  of  electricity  at  wholesale.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  the  provisions  of  this  subchapter  shall  apply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales  of  electricity  at  wholesale. 

 

 

 

 

            

One  of  those  provisions  is  824(e)(a),  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  FERC  shall  have  jurisdiction  over  practices 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affecting  wholesale  rates. 

 

 

            

So  we're  within  the  plain  terms  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  and  there  is  no  statutory  text  that  plainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forecloses  FERC's  exercise  of  jurisdiction.  And  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

friend,  in  30  minutes,  didn't  even  try  to  identify  one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  terms  of  applying  Chevron,  there's  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  that  ­­ that  FERC's  interpretation  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upheld. 

            

With  respect  to  the  Wal­Mart  example  that  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend  identifies,  I  think  it  shows  why  his  argument 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  hermetically­sealed­off  retail  and  wholesale 

 

 

 

 

spheres  really  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  real  world. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  the  real  world  today,  large  customers  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy  directly.  They  can  do  it  through  contract,  and  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  also  go  into  the  wholesale  market  auctions  and  buy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  their  States  permit  it,  and  that  does  happen  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  world.

And  this  is  really  no  different  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand  response  entities  that  want  to  come  in  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participate  can  only  do  so  if  their  State  law  allows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  to  do  so.  So  it's  no  different  than  what's  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  on  in  the  real  world  for  quite  a  long  time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Third,  with  respect  to  the  load­serving 

 

 

 

 

 

entities,  the  ­­ the  utilities,  my  friend  says,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  worry  about  it;  they'll  do  all  the  demand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response.  It  will  work  great. 

  

 

 

 

            

FERC  addressed  that.  It  addressed  it 

  

 

 

 

 

directly.  It  found  that  load­serving  entities  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  sufficient  incentives  to  engage  in  demand  response. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  it's  obvious  why  they  don't,  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannibalize  their  own  profits.  The  higher  cost  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have,  the  higher  their  rate  of  return  profits  are  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  generated.  They  will  do  it  under  commands  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  regulatory  agencies  to  do  it,  but  they'll  do  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grudgingly.  And  what  FERC  said  is  you  want  people  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  in  who  have  a  real  profit  motive  to  do  it,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that'll  incent  the  LSEs  to  get  in  there  and  try  to  get  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

piece  of  the  action  rather  than  letting  it  go  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  else. 

 

            

            

But  FERC  addressed  that  issue  specifically. 

 

 

 

 

 

Now,  the  idea  that  demand  response  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work,  the  State­level  demand  response,  retail  demand

response  can't  work  where  wholesale  demand  response  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operating,  you  know,  again,  the  real  world  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contradicts  that.  We  have  24  States  in  which  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  on.  And  if  this  were  a  problem,  you'd  expect  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  in  this  administrative  proceeding  some  evidence  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  a  problem,  and  there  is  zero  evidence.  You  look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  all  these  briefs;  there  isn't  a  citation  to  anything 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  administrative  record  that  suggests  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  and  State  programs  can't  work  in  harmony.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FERC  made  a  finding  that  they  can  work  in  harmony. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  with  respect  ­­ just  one  point  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrary  and  capricious,  and  I'd  like  to  sum  up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  if  you're  going  to  look  at  one  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  terms  of  the  concern  you've  raised,  Justice  Kennedy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  would  look  at  page  223  of  the  Appendix  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition  ­­ of  our  petition,  and  what  you  will  see  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  FERC  directly  identifying  the  problem  that  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend  spent  the  last  few  minutes  of  his  argument  on, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  going  on  to  say  ­­ and  then  going  on  to  explain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  great  detail  for  several  pages  why  that  critique  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong,  and  citing  in  particular  the  paragraph  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dr.  Khan's  declaration  where  Dr.  Khan  is  responding  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  specific  critiques  that  my  friend  made. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it  ­­ it  certainly  meets  the  threshold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  of  ­­ of  ­­ of  an  adequate  explanation  for  a

decision. 

            

Now,  if  I  could  sum  up,  I  think  this  is  what 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  comes  down  to. 

 

 

 

 

            

On  one  side  of  the  scale,  you've  got  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  that  saves  billion  ­­ that  has  saved  billions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  dollars  in  wholesale  costs  and  will  save  billions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars,  and  it's  an  effective  tool  against  blackouts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  brownouts,  and  that  nobody  has  shown  in  the  real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world  does  any  harm. 

 

 

 

            

You  have  a  statutory  provision  that  gives 

   

 

 

 

 

FERC  specific  authority  to  regulate  this  practice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  have  no  statutory  provision  precluding 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

You  have  Chevron  in  case  there's  any  doubt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  you  ­­ and  you  have,  really,  a  strong 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cooperative  Federalism  program  here  in  which  States  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ States  are  masters  of  their  own  fate.  Whether  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  customers  in  a  State  participate  or  not  is  up  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State.  If  the  State  thinks  this  is  not  a  good 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy,  the  State  can  say  it  doesn't  operate  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State. 

            

On  the  other  side  of  the  scale,  what  you've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  is  an  argument  that  all  those  benefits  have  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extinguished,  and  ­­ and  no  argument  in  the  record  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  any  harm  from  this  program.  You  have  no  clear

statutory  text  for  bidding  FERC  from  engaging  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulatory  practice. 

 

            

And  my  friend  used  the  phrase  "one  size  fits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all."  Well,  I  ­­ I  suggest  that  really  what  we've  got 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

here  on  the  other  side  is  a  faux  Federalism  argument. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Their  argument  is  the  one  size  fits  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  are  lots  of  States  out  there  that  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  consumers,  want  their  citizens  to  participate  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  because  they  think  it's  good  policy  and  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  harmonious  with  their  regulation.  But  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

my  friend's  argument  does  is  wipe  that  out  and  say,  no, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  one  size  fits  all,  and  then  what's  ­­ and  that  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

size  that  fits  all  is  that  nobody  can  participate,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  the  24  States  that  want  to  do  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you.
