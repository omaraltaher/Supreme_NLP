            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 10-63, Maples v. Thomas.

            Mr. Garre.

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

            MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

            Two factors distinguish this case from those

in which the Court has found cause lacking to excuse a

default:  First, the State itself had a direct hand in

the extraordinary events leading up to the default in

this case; and, second, the actions of Maples's

attorneys, which rise to the level of abandonment, are

not attributable to Maples under agency law or other

principles that this Court has invoked in determining

when attorney conduct may be imputed to a client.

            For either or both of those reasons, the

default at issue in this case is not fairly attributable

to Cory Maples, and the contrary decision of the

Eleventh Circuit should be reversed.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You talk about the

State's role.  I assume that you're talking about there

is the failure to take action after the return of the

notices.

Official

            MR. GARRE:  I think that's -- that's right,

Mr. Chief Justice.  I would couple that, though, with

the fact that the State initially set up a system for

the representation of indigent capital defendants that

relies extremely heavily on the good graces of

out-of-State counsel to represent indigent capital

defendants in Alabama.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, put -- putting

that -- that to one side, what if only one of the three

notices had been returned?

            MR. GARRE:  I think -- if only one from the

out-of-State pro bono counsel?

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.

            MR. GARRE:  I think that would be a

different case.  I think what's remarkable about this

case is you have both out-of-State attorneys, the

notices come back marked "Return to Sender -- Left Firm"

in an envelope, and the clerk does nothing.  And what's

extraordinary about that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the

system in this case relies on the out-of-State attorneys

to provide --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who says so?  Who says so?

Who says that they rely on -- you have a local attorney,

and you have to have a local attorney for the case,

don't you?  And -- and you want us to believe that the

local attorney is -- has no responsibility for the case

at all?  Is this really what the -- what the law

requires?  I -- I think there is a serious ethical

obligation when he has the -- when he gets the notice.

He is one of the attorneys for your client.  And he got

the notice, right?  That one was not returned.

            MR. GARRE:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  He failed to check with --

with the New York lawyers who were working with him.

Why is it -- why is the State responsible for that?

            MR. GARRE:  We have three points on the

local counsel, Your Honor.  First, the record shows that

the notice is not attributable to Mr. Maples because Mr.

Butler had disclaimed any relationship apart from

facilitating the admission of his out-of-State

attorneys.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Disclaimed to who?  To --

I mean, how could a clerk be expected to know that the

local counsel really isn't taking any part?  I mean --

so was the disclaimer to the clerk?

            MR. GARRE:  I think a -- a couple things on

the clerk's perspective.  First, we do think that it was

well known in Alabama that, under this unique system,

out-of-State attorneys were doing all the work in these

cases, and local counsel were simply facilitating their

admission.  Second, one of the --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, who says that, Mr.

Garre?  I mean, is there anything in the record on that

point, on the Alabama system generally?

            MR. GARRE:  A couple of the things, Your

Honor.  First, we do have the amicus briefs, which

discuss that anecdotally.  I would say that the State of

Alabama in its brief in opposition to this Court a few

years back in the Barbour case specifically touted the

role of out-of-State attorneys under its system and, as

far as I could tell, didn't mention local counsel once.

So, I think it was fair to say that it's known that the

out-of-State attorneys here were doing all the work.

But even if the clerk --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're begging the

question, which is how is the clerk supposed to know

this?  This is a functionary in the clerk's office who

sends out notices, receives back mail that's not

returned.  There has to be some local counsel that does

work.

            MR. GARRE:  Well --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is he supposed to

know the difference between those that do and those that

don't?

            MR. GARRE:  What -- what -- I think the

clerk would be imputed with knowledge, general knowledge

of the system.  But beyond that, what the clerk know --

knew was this:  He knew that two of the three notices

that went out were returned, both to the out-of-State

attorneys, which ought to be an extraordinary event in

the life of any clerk's office.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But, you know, even if

local counsel is as you -- as you describe it, and

nothing in the record establishes it, even if he is a

functionary, surely the function would include when he

gets a notice, that he makes sure that the -- the people

who do the real work know about the notice.

            MR. GARRE:  Of course.  But the point is --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  He didn't perform that

function.

            MR. GARRE:  In this case, the local counsel

didn't perform as a mail drop, and that was

intentionally so.  His own affidavit makes that clear.

And I think what's important is the State itself must

not have viewed him as a meaningful player.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But he didn't have a mail

drop?  I just didn't hear what you said.

            MR. GARRE:  My point was that ordinarily a

local counsel would serve as the mail drop; he would

forward notice.  In this case, Mr. Butler made quite

clear from the outset that he was not even performing

that role.  The role that he intentionally performed was

to admit out-of-State counsel and to let them do the

work.  But the State itself --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  To whom did he make that

clear?  You said he made it clear at the outset.  To

whom?  And where is that in the record?

            MR. GARRE:  It's in his affidavit, Your

Honor, the petition appendix page 256.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  His affidavit after --

after the fact, right?

            MR. GARRE:  That's right, Your Honor.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did -- did he tell the

clerk of the court that that was the case?

            MR. GARRE:  He did not.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, you know, I'm counsel

of record.  He's the counsel of record, right?  I'm

counsel of record, but I don't even do so much as to

forward notices to the guys that are doing the real

work?  Did he tell the clerk that?

            MR. GARRE:  He did not tell the clerk --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's extraordinary.

because when the default at issue in this case occurred,

the State sent a letter -- faxed it -- to Mr. Maples

directly on death row in Alabama, without --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said that even before

that.  In the rule -- you said the Rule 32 -- didn't you

say something about -- the -- the notice that went from

the prosecutor to Maples did not go to the local

counsel, right?

            MR. GARRE:  The clerk sent out notices to

all three attorneys of record, the two out-of-State

counsel and Mr. Butler.  Mr. Butler did receive the

notice.  He didn't do anything, both because he hadn't

assumed any role beyond facilitating admission --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did the -- did the

prosecutor -- I'm not talking about the clerk now.  The

prosecutor had a filing in connection with the Rule 32

motion.  Did the prosecutor send that to, well,

everybody?  Maples and everybody?

            MR. GARRE:  He did not.  The State -- and

this is at page 26 of the joint appendix.  The State

served it on his out-of-State counsel and not Mr.

Butler, his local counsel.  And when the default

occurred, the State contacted Mr. -- Mr. Maples directly

in prison, which would have been unethical if the State

had known or believed that he was represented by

counsel.

Official

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you seem not to rely

on what the State as prosecutor did.  It seemed to me

the State as prosecutor was recognizing that Maples had

no counsel; therefore, sent -- said you'd better file

your habeas; this is how much time you have -- sent it

just to him.

            MR. GARRE:  I absolutely agree with you,

Justice Ginsburg.  I think that that is further evidence

that everybody knew that Mr. Maples didn't have any

local counsel in any meaningful sense.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where does the Constitution

say, by the way, that you have to give notice, that

every judicial action has to be noticed --

            MR. GARRE:  Well --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to the parties to the

case?  The Federal rules don't -- don't require notice,

do they?

            MR. GARRE:  The Constitution doesn't say

that explicitly --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the Federal rules don't

say it.  You don't have to give notice in the Federal

rules, do you?

            MR. GARRE:  We think notice of a

postconviction order in a capital case would at least

implicate a due process interest in receiving notice,

that it's reasonable --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Capital cases are

different?  If you're going to go to jail for life you

-- you don't get notice, but if -- if it's a capital

case --

            MR. GARRE:  I think under the --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I mean, it's either a

rule for all criminal cases or it's not a rule.

            MR. GARRE:  Well --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if -- if it's a rule

for all criminal cases, the Federal rules are

unconstitutional, you're saying.

            MR. GARRE:  The Mullane case specifically

takes into account the interests of the individual

receiving notice.  There could be no greater interest of

an individual than receiving notice in a capital case

where the individual's life is at stake.  Ultimately we

don't think this Court has to find a constitutional

violation.  It has to find that the events --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Once you're in court and

you have a lawyer, it's up to your lawyer to follow what

goes on in the court.  That's the assumption of the

Federal rules.  And it seems to me a perfectly

reasonable assumption.  And I'm not about to hold that

-- that they are unconstitutional simply because an

extraordinary requirement of notice, which is not

required by the Constitution, has gone awry.

            MR. GARRE:  Here Mr. Maples did not have an

attorney that was serving in an agency role in any

meaningful sense.  That's laid out in Ms. DeMott's

amicus brief; it's laid out in our case.  What's more is

the State here didn't simply just, we think quite

unreasonably, rely on a role that local counsel was not

performing in Alabama --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- but --

your case it seems to me turns critically on Butler's

role.  How much, in addition to what he did or didn't

do, would he have to do to put him in a position where

he was in fact representing Maples in your view?

            MR. GARRE:  I think that the ordinary role

of local counsel, which would have been to, at a

minimum, forward notice in a proceeding, would be a

meaningful relationship.  The relationship that -- that

Professor DeMott describes here is one of sub-agency.

And, in fact, if you look at the Alabama rules, they put

the onus on the out-of-State counsel to associate the

local counsel.  That's at page 365 of the joint

appendix.  The out-of-State counsel did that.  Mr. --

Mr. Maples wasn't involved in that transaction.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Where do we look -- where do

we look to see that it's standard practice for local

counsel throughout the country to contact out-of-State

counsel when something like this is received?  I

remember a case from the Federal system in which local

counsel appeared and did exactly what was done here,

moved the admission of an out-of-State criminal defense

attorney, who then tried the case for a year, got sick,

and the judge said to the local -- local counsel:  Come

on in; you're going to take over this trial and try it

for the next 6 months.  And the local counsel said:

Whoa, I only signed up to move the admission of this

fellow.  The judge said:  That's too bad; you're counsel

of record, and you have to take over the case.

            I don't understand that what is alleged to

have occurred here is that far out of the ordinary.

            MR. GARRE:  I think Mr. Butler -- just

simply saying, I'm going to allow -- I'm going to

facilitate your out-of-State attorneys to represent you,

but that's my role.  He had, quote, unquote, "no role"

after that.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  He can't define his role as

a lawyer.  Once he appears before a court and says, I am

counsel of record, he has certain responsibilities.

It's not up to him to say what his responsibilities are.

            MR. GARRE:  Well, clearly that's right.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if they don't extend

even to forwarding notice, even to making sure that the

people who were doing the legwork in the case know that

-- that the clock is running, my goodness, I can't

imagine what his responsibility is.  It's not up to him

to define it.

            MR. GARRE:  That's exactly our point,

Justice Scalia, which is that he forswore any

responsibility.  The lawyer in the Holland case just had

those responsibilities, too.  He abandoned his client.

This -- what Mr. Butler here did here was inexcusable.

            But there's another factor at play here, and

that's the confusion that the court itself affirmatively

created when it sent an order that, by its term,

directed that all counsel of record receive it.  And

that's what the order said; it's on page 225 of the

joint appendix.  And --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Before you get to the

court, could I ask you about what the State attorney,

the prosecuting attorney, knew?  Did the prosecuting

attorney know that these two individuals from New York

were representing this person?

            MR. GARRE:  Certainly, it knew that they

were counsel of record in the proceeding.  I'll let my

-- my friend answer that question.  What we know,

though, is when the default occurred, it took the

extraordinary step of faxing a letter directly to Mr.

Maples in prison, which would have been unethical if it

believed he was represented by counsel.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So you think

you have -- in your view, the counsel of record knew

that these two people in New York were part of the

representation.  Did the counsel -- I mean, not the

counsel of record; the counsel for the State.

            Did the counsel know that they hadn't gotten

the notice?

            MR. GARRE:  Well, I don't want to speak for

my friend.  I don't -- there's certainly nothing in the

record to -- to establish that they knew that these

out-of-State attorneys didn't get notice.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any reason to

think that the State attorney or whoever was prosecuting

thought that the local counsel was likely not to do

much?

            MR. GARRE:  Yes.

possible -- we'll find out later -- that the State --

the prosecuting attorney who works for the State knew

all those things:  One, he's represented by counsel in

New York; two, they didn't get the notice; three, the

local attorney isn't going to do anything; and

conclusion:  They likely knew he didn't get the notice,

but they are asserting that this is an adequate State

ground to bar him coming into habeas; is that the

correct posture of the case?

            MR. GARRE:  That's true, Justice Breyer.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So, all we have to decide

is whether under these circumstances the State

attorney's knowledge of all those facts mean that the

State cannot assert this is an adequate State ground.

            MR. GARRE:  Right.  And I think the State's

actions --

of those facts?

            MR. GARRE:  No, Justice Scalia --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, we don't know

that.

            MR. GARRE:  But we know -- we know what

action it took, and that action was an action that

assumed that he didn't have meaningful counsel, or else

it would have been unethical.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me ask you this, if I

may.  I don't know if -- I don't think the briefs

covered it.  It may be in there.  Do you know, in

Alabama and/or nationwide, in how many capital cases

there is no appeal?

            MR. GARRE:  I don't know that, Justice

Kennedy.  I think the Alabama system here created a

system in which it would allow for appeals, not only in

direct appeals, but postconviction proceedings.  The

extraordinary -- there are several extraordinary

features of the Alabama system, and we think that

ultimately they helped to facilitate the extraordinary

and shocking events in this case.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- the New

York lawyers did not abandon Mr. Maples prior to the

time that they left their law firm in New York, right?

            MR. GARRE:  That's right.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, their conduct

prior to that time would be attributed to him, right?

            MR. GARRE:  I think that's right.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Part of

their conduct was setting up their arrangement with Mr.

Butler where he would show up as counsel of record but

not really do anything.  So, why aren't the consequences

of that arrangement attributed to Maples as well?

            MR. GARRE:  Well, I don't think they would

be attributed.  I think what you're looking for is

whether the default itself is attributable to Maples.

The New York -- what -- what the out-of-State attorneys

did is they left the representation without fulfilling

their duty to notify the court or Mr. Maples.  Mr.

Maples was in -- was sitting in a prison cell in Alabama

under the reasonable belief that he was represented by

counsel who would appeal if an adverse decision was

issued.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Garre, can I go back to

Justice Kennedy's question?  This was not an appeal.

The question was how many capital cases is there no

appeal.  He had been convicted and had appealed, right?

The -- this is --

            MR. GARRE:  The direct proceedings had

concluded.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The direct proceedings were

over.  He had appealed up to -- up to the State supreme

court.  Did he seek cert here, too?

            MR. GARRE:  He did, Justice Scalia.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  He did.  And this was a

postconviction --

            MR. GARRE:  It was, but when the State sets

up that system and allows for appeals, it can't

arbitrarily deprive it of an appeal based on the sort of

circumstances here.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That may be, but I don't

think it's extraordinary that there be no appeal, I

mean, postconviction.

            MR. GARRE:  I'm not aware of any State that

does not allow appeal in postconviction proceedings.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can be allowed, but it

would not seem to me extraordinary that it not be

sought.

            MR. GARRE:  But I think --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in -- in this -- in

this case, there was a direct appeal, and then there was

this proceeding that we're talking about here.  The

trial judge waited for 18 months.  So, you would think

there's some merit to the underlying claim.  Any

statistics on whether or not -- on how often an appeal

is abandoned or not pursued in this kind of case?  No

statistics?

            MR. GARRE:  No.  I mean, the statistics that

I'm aware of are that habeas claims are in a material

sense often successful in capital cases.  We've cited

those in our reply brief.  Here we think the underlying

claims are quite serious.  The question in the case is

really not who shot the victims.  The question is, was

whether Mr. Maples was going to be convicted for capital

murder or murder that would result in life imprisonment.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm -- I'm aware of the

allegations.

            MR. GARRE:  And I think, going back to the

court's and the clerk's actions here, one of the things

that exacerbated the chain of events here was that you

had an order which directed that all parties would be

served.  Mr. Butler did say that he saw that that order

directed that the out-of-State counsel would be served,

which created an added risk of the likelihood --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Garre, I have two

questions for you.  Is that -- is this State the only

one that doesn't appoint counsel in a postconviction

capital case?

            MR. GARRE:  Well, I believe that Alabama may

appoint them.  They don't provide for appointment in all

cases.  I believe Georgia is another State.  But in that

respect, I think these States are alone.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the vast majority

do?

            MR. GARRE:  Absolutely.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Number two,

I thought there were two questions in this -- in this

part of your case.  The first is, don't we have to

decide that abandonment, which you have termed, is

cause --

            MR. GARRE:  Yes.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in a -- to excuse a

procedural bar in a State court.

            MR. GARRE:  Right.  And that is --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we have to decide

first whether we extend Holland to this setting.

            MR. GARRE:  Well, I think they're

independent grounds.  If the Court concludes that the

State's own actions --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the due process.

I'm talking about -- yes, both we would have to decide.

Assuming -- we have to decide the first question.  Is --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Will we extend Holland

to this type of situation?

            MR. GARRE:  I don't -- I don't -- I just

want to be clear on this.  They are independent grounds.

If the Court concludes that the State's actions --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Could we find --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what is the line,

Mr. Garre, between abandonment and just plain old

negligence?

            MR. GARRE:  It would be the line established

by agency law going back to Justice Story's time.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, if this local counsel

simply goofed in not -- not advising the people that

were doing the legwork in the case, why -- why is that

abandonment?

            MR. GARRE:  I think it's actually more of a

situation where he disclaimed any meaningful role at the

outset.  I think, you know, the real abandonment going

on here was the attorneys in New York who left without

notifying the court or their client.  But that --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Putting aside the question

of local counsel, could we find that there was an

abandonment if the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell

continued to represent Mr. Maples after the two young

attorneys left the firm?

            MR. GARRE:  The Court could.

that they -- they did not represent Mr. Maples, that

this was done purely by the two attorneys?  Is there a

finding by a court on that?

            MR. GARRE:  There is not a finding.  We

think that's the better reading of the record, and I'm

happy to explain why.  But most importantly, we think

it's irrelevant whether he was represented by the law

firm in the fictional sense.  He was represented by

individual lawyers in that proceeding.  They were the

ones who Mr. Maples agreed to have represent him in that

proceeding.  The Alabama courts made specific findings

that Mr. Maples's lawyers were Ms. Ingen-Housz and

Mr. Munanka.  It said that after the default.  At that

time --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in the -- in the

practice of a law firm, these were very junior people.

Wouldn't the law firm have to have some involvement in

giving them permission to provide this representation?

I mean, usually there's something like a pro bono

committee and a higher level.  Can -- can such junior

associates just go ahead and say, we want to spend a lot

of our time defending a man on death row?  Wouldn't they

have to get some kind of permission?

            MR. GARRE:  I think one would ordinarily

expect that.  And we're not condoning the actions here.

I would say that, at the outset of this litigation,

there were individuals from the Legal Aid Society who

were well familiar with capital cases involved.  They

apparently dropped out of the case.  But we know --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what do we know about

Mr. De Leeuw's role, Mr. Garre?

            MR. GARRE:  What we know is what Mr. De

Leeuw has said, which is that he was involved in the

case at some point.  It's not clear what his involvement

was.  At the oral argument in the Eleventh Circuit, he

said, on page 302 of the joint appendix, that he was --

they were awaiting further action from the court.  So,

we don't know what his involvement was.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Garre, we don't

know, we don't know.  Isn't that just proof that if we

were to find that Holland applied, a Holland exception

applied, that we would have to remand this case?

            MR. GARRE:  I think that would be

appropriate, Your Honor.  Of course, we think the Court

should find that the Holland -- the Holland exception,

or more particularly --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In that regard, there is

one part of Holland that you don't really address, which

is that Holland contrasted a statute of limitations

issue with respect to access to a Federal court with a

procedural bar and said that the State's procedural bar

had interest of federalism, that we had to be cautious

of ignoring a State procedural bar because of

federalism.  If we were to extend Holland in the way you

want, how do we justify ignoring federalism in that

situation?

            MR. GARRE:  That's right.  There are those

distinctions.

            Our point is that Holland recognizes that

attorney conduct that amounts to abandonment is external

to the client under agency and other principles.

Coleman itself recognizes that external conduct is not

attributable to the client and can't be a basis for

cause.

            So, the Federal -- federalism interests are

simply not implicated in a case where you find that the

attorney's actions are external.  And we think if you

look at the principles you looked at in Holland, agency

law going back to Justice Story's time, the principles

of professional standards of care, you would find that

an abandonment -- of course, that must be external to

the client.  Justice Alito said in his concurring

opinion that where someone is not acting as an agent in

any meaningful sense, it would be grossly inequitable

and unfair to attribute the agent's conduct to the

client.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Garre --

            MR. GARRE:  That's the principle we're

asking.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could we go back to the

state of the record?  You've said a few times, and your

brief does, that the record is skimpy on various

important matters.  Would you go further and say that

the record is irretrievably corrupted, tainted by

conflicts of interest?

            MR. GARRE:  I think there are conflicts of

interest here.  They're laid out in the legal ethics

briefs.  The Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys were

representing Mr. Maples up through the argument and

decision in the Eleventh Circuit.  But I think -- for

purposes of what this Court would do, I think a remand

would be appropriate, because if you conclude, as we

think you should, that abandonment of counsel would be

an external factor, then it would be appropriate to

remand for further proceedings.  We don't know what

these other attorneys were doing.  The record doesn't

show that.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We do know, though, that

they were not counsel of record.

            MR. GARRE:  We absolutely know that they

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, we know that the two

who were listed as counsel of record --

            MR. GARRE:  They were not.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- were not representing

him, and they hadn't told the court.

            MR. GARRE:  They were not counsel of record.

Mr. Maples never agreed to have anyone else represent

him in a way that could bind him.  The Alabama court

specifically found not only that they weren't counsel of

record, but they were not authorized to practice in

Alabama.  This is on page 223 of the petition appendix.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it seems to me it's up

to you to produce the facts that would justify our

reversing the case that you're asking us to do.

            MR. GARRE:  We asked --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you say, well, we don't

have these facts; well, send -- send it back so I can --

no, you should have gotten the facts in the first place.

If the record doesn't show the things that you need to

show to get this case reversed, the case should not be

reversed, it seems to me.

            MR. GARRE:  But the petition did include a

request for an evidentiary hearing.  And I think the

problem is that both the district court and the court of

appeals short-circuited the inquiry into counsel's

actions because it believed that Coleman v. Thompson

applied in the abandonment situation.  And where a court

made that kind of legal error, it would be appropriate

for the Court to send it back and say, no, Coleman v.

Thompson does not apply in the extraordinary case of

abandonment, or an attorney's actions cannot be

attributable to a client under agency law.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  When did you first make the

abandonment claim?

            MR. GARRE:  Well, I think we've argued --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  When was it?  Wasn't it

first made in the -- in the request for rehearing?

            MR. GARRE:  I think explicitly.  Now, we

think that -- two points on this.  We think --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's rather late.

            MR. GARRE:  We think that all along they

argued that the attorneys' actions established cause.

That's why both the district court and the court of

appeals addressed that and rejected it erroneously under

Coleman.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That isn't abandonment.

That isn't abandonment.  The attorneys' actions

established cause; that does not mean abandonment to me.

within the rule of Yee v. Escondido, where -- where the

party makes the claim below -- which they made the claim

here that the attorneys' actions established cause --

you can make new arguments, different arguments.

            And I think, particularly given that

Sullivan & Cromwell had been involved early in this case

and the possibility of conflicts of interest would make

it appropriate for this Court to consider our

abandonment issue, which was raised in the petition for

rehearing, explicitly raised in the petition for

certiorari -- explicitly -- we think it's properly

before this Court.

time, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

process required not just actual notice to his attorney

of record, John Butler, but in fact something more than

that.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say the three

notices are sent out; all three of them come back, okay?

Let's even go further and say the prosecutor knows that

nobody representing Mr. Maples received notice.  What

happens then?

            MR. NEIMAN:  In that case, Your Honor, there

would be a much more substantial argument --

would be more substantial.  That's why --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  My question is what

happens?  Are you prepared to acknowledge that in that

case, Mr. Maples had been abandoned by all of his

lawyers, it was known to the prosecution, and,

therefore, the failure to file the notice should not

constitute an adequate and independent State ground

barring collateral relief?

            MR. NEIMAN:  I don't think that the return

of all three notices would justify necessarily a finding

of abandonment in toto by all the lawyers.  It could

signify a number of things.  I do think that it would

raise questions about whether the clerk had a due

when you get -- get a notice returned?  It just said no

longer at Sullivan & Cromwell, is what the two of them

said, right?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does that necessarily mean

that they've abandoned the case?  It just means you got

the wrong address, doesn't it?

            MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that the only thing

it means for sure, these lawyers are no longer here at

Sullivan & Cromwell?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

be an indication of abandonment.  Can't you switch a law

firm and keep the client?

although the presumption generally is that the client

stays with the firm.  But that's correct.  The client

certainly can move firms when the -- when the lawyer

moves firms.

blurring two issues.  We're not talking about

            I mean, they were preparing for a hearing

before this judge.  So they weren't anticipating that he

was going to rule without anything further.

            MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

They certainly were preparing for an evidentiary

hearing, and, in fact, contrary to my friend's

statements about what we know about Mr. De Leeuw's

involvement in this case, on page 228 of the J.A.,

Maples expressly alleged that De Leeuw and others at

Sullivan & Cromwell were preparing for the evidentiary

hearing.  But --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But as far as -- as far

the record shows, De Leeuw is not on the record at all.

There were three counsel of record.  Two of them --

well, let's go back to this -- this -- the first issue.

The State by its own conduct showed it didn't regard

Butler as any kind of representative, because it didn't

even send its Rule 32 response to Butler; isn't that so?

            MR. NEIMAN:  No, Your Honor, I respectfully

disagree with that assessment of how we can read the

service of the Rule 32 answer.  Under Alabama law, a --

a pleading or an order may be served on only one counsel

of record when a party has multiple counsel of record.

So, for example, that answer was served upon Mr. Munanka

at Sullivan & Cromwell, but it was not served, expressly

at least, on --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about --

            MR. NEIMAN:  -- Ms. Ingen-Housz.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the notice

that he's -- he had lost in the Alabama court and he'd

better, if he wants to go to the Federal court, do

something about it?  That notice went only to Maples,

right?

            MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

The -- the State's attorney in that -- in that instance

decided to send a letter only to Mr. Maples.  Of

course --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And Mr. Garre made the

point that if Maples were represented, that that would

be improper, to -- to send a notice to Maples alone.

So, the -- so, the State's attorney must have thought

that Maples had been abandoned by his lawyers because he

didn't notify any of them.

            MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, the record does not

reveal why Mr. Hayden decided to send the letter to Mr.

Maples alone.  One --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, he didn't have

to send the letter.  That letter had no legal effect,

the way, your time has expired.  I mean, this is not --

what could the lawyer do about it?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Well, and it --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It wasn't a required notice

that he had to give to the lawyer or to anybody else.

            MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So he just made this

extraneous, volunteered statement to Maples instead of

to his lawyer.  I don't -- I don't know what that

proves.

            MR. NEIMAN:  At that point in time, the

State case was over.  So, it was hardly clear if Mr.

Hayden was going to do something that he didn't have to

do under the rules.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why did he do it?

Why did he do it, then?  Just gloating that -- that the

fellow had lost?

of it?  He must have thought there was a problem, right?

notice of appeal.  But -- and his letter reveals that he

is very aware --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that surprising?  I

think Justice Kennedy asked your adversary:  How often

do appeals lie from the denial of State postconviction

remedies?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I agree with my

friend that we don't have statistics on that front.  I

think it's fair to assume that, for the most part, when

a Rule 32 petitioner loses at the trial stage, they're

going to appeal.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In a capital case.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Particularly in a -- in a

capital case.

            MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor,

although there are some instances in which a capital

petitioner or someone on death row decides that they no

longer want to invoke the process of the courts, and

they're ready for their sentence to be carried out.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just have two questions

going back to the very beginning, when we were talking

about the misaddressed or the unreceived mail.  When the

notices come back "no longer at Sullivan & Cromwell,"

that's just as if it said, functionally, don't you

think, "wrong address"?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Not quite, Your Honor.  I think

that -- that the notice saying that the person's no

longer at Sullivan & Cromwell indicates that the person

is no longer at the firm.  I guess the notice could come

back --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, it's pretty clear

that they didn't get their -- get the mail, get the

letter, because it's sent back.

            MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One other thing while I'm

talking with you, and it's a tangential point, perhaps.

Could the State of Alabama under your laws waive what

you allege to be the procedural default?  If you thought

there was substantial merit to the underlying claims,

even though you take the position that they ultimately

should be rejected, could you have simply waived the

procedural default and allowed the appeal to proceed?

            MR. NEIMAN:  I don't think the law makes

that crystal clear, Your Honor.  But I certainly know of

no law that suggests that the Attorney General of

Alabama necessarily has to assert every single potential

defense within his or her arsenal.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Has Alabama ever waived

lack of timely appeal in a capital case?

            MR. NEIMAN:  I'm not aware, Your Honor.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, could we go

back to the Chief Justice's initial question?  Let's

assume the two letters went to Sullivan & Cromwell and

came back "left firm," as they did, and that the letter

to Butler came back "deceased."  Would there be cause in

that situation to excuse the State's procedural ground?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Perhaps, Your Honor.  It -- it

would depend on why the letters came back from Sullivan

& Cromwell, I suppose.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we -- we know that

they -- that both lawyers in this case didn't move to

another firm.  Both of them took jobs that precluded

them from representing this defendant.  So, I don't know

how I define abandonment other than I take a job where I

can't work for you anymore.

            MR. NEIMAN:  The -- the cause argument in

that case, Your Honor, would be substantially stronger,

as I've said before, in part because death, of course,

is an external factor.  So --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, you accept -- I

don't mean to interfere with the question, but -- so,

you accept the idea that there is a distinction between

malfeasance and abandonment.

            MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I think we would be

prepared to recognize that, in certain cases, an

abandonment of a client by an attorney would terminate

the agency relationship with -- between the attorney and

client.  And --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So, then the

only thing -- the only thing we're talking about is

whether, on these particular facts, there has been

abandonment or not.  Right?

            MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  From your

perspective.

            MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  But one thing

I do want to stress is that my friend has suggested that

an evidentiary hearing or further evidentiary

proceedings are necessary on this particular question

because we don't know what role the other attorneys at

Sullivan & Cromwell played in the matter.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we do know they

weren't counsel of record.  We do know that the only two

counsel of record were no longer representing him, and

he had no reason to know that they weren't, but they

were not -- they couldn't represent him.

            The two -- the only two out-of-town counsel

were the two who disabled themselves from representing

him by taking other jobs.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, there was no one from

Sullivan & Cromwell other than those two on the record.

So, on the record, they had abandoned him, and there was

no substitute.

            MR. NEIMAN:  I disagree with that

assessment, Your Honor.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the argument is that

on the record or not is determinative for the out-of-

town counsel, but it is not determinative for the

in-town counsel.  The fact that he is counsel of record

doesn't count, but the fact that those two are does

count.  And only when you combine those two does the man

have no counsel.  Right?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  There is that

inconsistency in Maples's argument.  On the one hand,

Maples says that Butler -- or that the other lawyers at

Sullivan & Cromwell weren't his attorneys because they

weren't counsel of record.  But Butler was counsel of

record, but he wasn't his attorney.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  The notice inquiry is

supposed to be a pragmatic one.  As far back as Mullane,

we've said that the question that we're supposed to ask

ourselves is:  Is this what somebody would do if they

actually wanted to accomplish notice, if they actually

wanted the person to get that letter?  So, I'm just

going to ask you, General, if you were a lawyer in an

important litigation and you send off an important

letter to two lawyers, your principal adversaries, as

well as to a local counsel who you think may not be

involved in the substance of the litigation, you don't

know for a fact, but you think that there is some

substantial likelihood that he's not particularly

involved, as local counsel often aren't -- so, you send

off this letter and you get it back from the principal

attorneys, and you ask yourself:  Huh, should I do

anything now?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I suspect that, in

those circumstances, I might well personally do

something else.  But, of course, my prerogatives as

Solicitor General of Alabama are quite different from

the prerogatives of a clerk in Morgan County, Alabama.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, as then the clerk has

to believe that it's an important letter.  Right?  It's

not important enough to be required by the Federal

rules.  How important is it?

in a capital case issued after 18 months when nobody

knew that that letter was coming, that that's an

important letter for a death row person to get.  So,

Justice Scalia is right to that effect.

            So, you get this, and you say, well, you

would have.  But that's the question that we have to ask

about the clerk as well.  The clerk -- the question for

the clerk is, if he had really wanted the person to get

notice, what would he have done?

            MR. NEIMAN:  No, Your Honor, I disagree.

The -- as far back as Mullane, this Court has said that

at the end of the day, actual notice to a party,

particularly within the jurisdiction, is the finish line

for due process purposes.  Mullane expressly --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  You can see from these

questions that the arguments that you're making in this

capital case, which is sui generis, are pushing the

Court to consider rules that would have far-reaching

effect, such as a rule that places upon a clerk of the

court a constitutional obligation to serve counsel with

important documents in the case similar to the

constitutional obligation to serve initial process in

the case.  And the question that I would like to ask is

whether this -- the -- whether you as the Solicitor

General or the Attorney General of Alabama have an

obligation to push this matter in this way.  This is a

case where -- as I said, it's a capital case, as we all

recognize.  Mr. Maples has lost his right to appeal

through no fault of his own, through a series of very

unusual and unfortunate circumstances.

            Now, when his attorneys moved to file an

out-of-time appeal, why wouldn't you just consent to

that?  If he did not receive an effective assistance of

counsel at trial, why not get a decision on the merits

on that?  Why push this -- this technical argument?

            MR. NEIMAN:  There are several responses,

Your Honor.  First, at least at the Rule 32 stage, the

-- the notice of appeal deadline was a jurisdictional

one.  And you're right, the State did oppose the motion

for an out-of-time appeal, but there wasn't much the

State could have done even if it had consented --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  There's no --

            MR. NEIMAN:  -- on that front.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  There's no possibility under

Alabama rules for an out-of-time appeal in this

circumstance?  No extension?

            MR. NEIMAN:  The holding of the Alabama

courts here, as recognized by the Eleventh Circuit, was

that this would not be an appropriate circumstance for

an out-of-time appeal.  Now, as to the question about --

matter or is that a flat rule, once you've passed a

certain time deadline, you're out of -- you're out of

luck; there's no opportunity where there's good cause

for an extension?

            MR. NEIMAN:  There is opportunity where

there's good cause for an extension.  But the -- what

the court held here, what the Alabama court held here,

was that this circumstance in which the person had

counsel of record, and counsel of record hadn't notified

the court of their address -- of their changes of

address, and, more importantly, Mr. Butler, who was, in

fact, serving as Mr. Maples's agent in this case and

received --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, this goes to my

earlier question, and continuing Justice Alito's line of

questioning.  If the State of Alabama had told the State

court, in all of the circumstances, we think there

should be an out-of-time appeal granted -- you're -- are

you indicating that the State court said, well, that's a

good idea, but we can't do it because it's not

appropriate in these circumstances?

            MR. NEIMAN:  That seems to be the holding of

the Court of Criminal Appeals in this case, Your Honor.

it?  Did the State oppose the out-of-time appeal?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor, the State did

oppose the out-of-time appeal, and the State pressed the

procedural bar in Federal court in this case.  But the

State had every prerogative to do so, in part because

this Court recognized in Coleman, a case where the

petitioner undoubtedly could have said that he lost his

right to his appeal through no fault of his own, that

the State had the power to do that.  There are good

reasons for the State --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could the State in --

excuse me.  Could the State in the -- in the Federal

litigation have waived the procedural default?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I think the law  is

not exactly clear on that, but I know of no law that

would say that the Alabama Attorney General has to press

every single non-jurisdictional defense at his or her

disposal.  But he did not do so here and had good reason

not to.  That's in part because Coleman says that this

is how procedural defaults work.  There are good reasons

for procedural defaults.  They are grounded in the same

equitable principles that led --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you agreed with

me earlier that abandonment is an exception to the

adequate and independent State grounds.  So, under your

view of the case, Coleman was not necessarily

controlling.

            MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, if I have suggested

that abandonment itself is an exception to the AISG

doctrine, let me correct my earlier answer.

            My suggestion is that abandonment can

sometimes allow a court to determine that a particular

lawyer has become external to a client, that the agency

relationship has been terminated.  Of course, merely

becoming external to the client doesn't mean that the

abandonment itself will constitute cause.  The

abandonment also -- or the lawyer's ending of the

relationship would also have to impede the ability of

the remaining members of the defense team or the

defendant himself to comply with State rules.

            And here, even if there is some argument

that Ingen-Housz and Munanka abandoned their client,

which I don't think there is on this record in light of

the way they left the case with Butler, Mr. De Leeuw,

and others at Sullivan & Cromwell, even if there were

some argument on that front, Butler -- it's not clear

that the actions of Ingen-Housz and Munanka actually

impeded the ability of the remaining members of the team

to --

representing a client, as the two did, isn't there some

obligation of them to tell the client and the court,

we're no longer representing you, and arrange for

substitutions?  There were never any substitutions on

the record of the other counsel.  The record said these

two people are representing Maples, and those two

weren't.  They never told the court, and they never told

Maples.  Isn't there some obligation on -- on their part

to the court when they stop representing a client to

advise the court?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor, I think there

is.  But I don't think that means that what happened

here constitutes cause.  The record is clear.  Mr.

Maples himself has alleged, that Ingen-Housz and Munanka

arranged for this case to be handled by Mr. De Leeuw,

and the record makes clear that Mr. De Leeuw was

involved in this case in representing Maples even before

the default occurred and even before Ingen-Housz and

Munanka were -- well, even at the same -- even before

Ingen-Housz and Munanka left, I should say.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it -- is it -- I'm still

unclear on one factual thing.  Did the State's attorneys

know that the letters had come back?

come back.  I --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Do they check the -- do

they check the docket every so often to see what's

happened?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Most -- most attorneys have an

obligation at some point to check the docket, and that's

-- that's one problem with the position that Mr. Maples

has taken regarding Mr. Butler here and the ability of

these parties to obtain information from the court.

            But in this case, it's my understanding --

and this is not on the record.  But it's on the record

obviously before this Court now.  But it's my -- it's my

understanding that the State had no idea that Mr.

Maples's attorneys had not -- Mr. Maples's two attorneys

in New York had left their firm or had --

counsel.  Where did they -- what made them send it --

send that notice directly to Maples and not to either of

the Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Again, this is -- this is

information that's not in the record, Your Honor.  But

it's my understanding that counsel looked at -- looked

at -- figured out what had happened, figured out the

appeal had been missed, had calculated how much time Mr.

Maples had to file his 2254 petition and, based on his

20 years of experience, said that in light of the fact

that the State court proceedings were over, the most

prudent thing for him to do would be to send the letter

to Maples himself.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, he had figured out

that something had terminated the relationship between

Mr. Maples and his lawyers?

            MR. NEIMAN:  No, Your Honor, I don't think

that's -- I don't think that's an accurate

characterization of --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, even --

            MR. NEIMAN:  -- of what exactly happened in

this case, but in the very least, his lawyers had missed

-- had missed the deadline.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even if you assume that he

had figured it out, that -- you would have to impute his

knowledge to the clerk of court to -- to find the -- the

fault on the part of the State that's alleged here.

            MR. NEIMAN:  Well, more so than that, Your

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did he tell the clerk of

court that he was only going to send it to Maples?

            MR. NEIMAN:  As far as I know, no, Your

Honor.  But, of course, the clerk -- the notices came

back to the clerk long before the State's attorney sent

the letter in this case.

            But that's an important point, I think, both

with respect to the clerk issue and also the abandonment

issue.  The relevant question here is not what the

Assistant Attorney General of Alabama thought had

happened in this case.  The relevant question on the

clerk issue is what the clerk knew, and that of course

is governed by Rule 7 of the rules governing admission

to the Alabama bar.

            The relevant question on abandonment is, had

Maples in fact been abandoned?  Had -- had these

attorneys left him completely without counsel?  And the

record definitively establishes that that had not

happened, both because Mr. Butler remained counsel here

and in a much more meaningful way, I think, than my

friend suggests.  And --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, could you tell

me -- I'm assuming you've practiced in your State for a

while.

            MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How frequent is it in

the Alabama capital system that local counsel takes the

laboring oar, or even an active participation, in the

defense or actions of a capital defendant?

            Your -- the amici here says generally they

did what Mr. Butler did; they just facilitated the --

the admission of the volunteer attorneys.  Was that your

experience?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, of course, that

information's not in the record.  We respectfully

disagree, as a factual matter, with the factual

assertions made by the amici on that front.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If we have to

send it back, I guess we'd have to say what the rule is.

So, what -- what is the rule?  What about a rule that

says, where in fact attorneys do abandon the client and

the local attorney does as a matter of practice in the

State do virtually nothing except to facilitate foreign

representation, and where the State had cause to

believe -- cause to believe -- that all that was true,

then the State cannot assert this as an adequate ground.

That's all.

            MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, a remand would not

be appropriate in this case on those -- on those grounds

for a number of reasons.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?

            MR. NEIMAN:  One is that Rule 7 of the rules

governing admission to the Alabama bar made emphatically

clear that the role of local counsel was not simply --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Irrespective of what the

rules were, you'd have to show -- he would have to show

that, in fact, in the State it is a practice such that

the local counsel doesn't do much of anything except

facilitate, because this is a state of mind as to

whether the State -- and the State knows that.

            If he shows both of those things and shows

that the letter came back and shows this was abandonment

or close thereto, then the State ought to know that this

individual has no idea about filing a piece of paper and

thinks somebody else is doing it.  And that's enough to

say this is not adequate State ground that would block

Federal habeas.  Now, your argument against that is

what?

            MR. NEIMAN:  At least twofold, Your Honor.

One, as a simple matter, those factual assertions were

not made below.  So, in order for the Court to remand on

that particular issue, it wouldn't be a remand for an

evidentiary hearing, on whether those allegations --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  It seems in the briefs --

there's certainly a lot in the briefs that seemed to say

that.

            MR. NEIMAN:  There's certainly a lot in the

briefs that says that.  But one problem Mr. Maples faces

here is that he had the burden as the petitioner in this

habeas proceeding to make the requisite factual

allegations that he believed would establish cause.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Neiman, am I correct

that under the Alabama rules when an attorney is

represented by more than one attorney, the notice does

not have to go to all of them?

            MR. NEIMAN:  That is correct, Your Honor.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can only go to one,

right?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, as far as local counsel

knew, he was the only one to receive notice of this

thing, right?

            MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it correct or

does the notice -- most of the notices I see list the

people who have been served.  Were the New York people

listed on the notice that went to Butler?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  The notice --

he wasn't the only one getting notice.

            MR. NEIMAN:  Right.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or he knew that he

was the only one who was supposed to get notice.

            MR. NEIMAN:  Well, the -- the cc line in

this case cannot establish cause and cannot be deemed

State interference for any number of reasons.  The first

is that -- I suppose it could only be held to establish

cause if it would have been reasonable for Mr. Butler to

assume that the cc line communicated a message that it

was perfectly okay for him to do nothing and to not take

further action, based on what is in the cc line.  And

there are at least three reasons why that would not be a

reasonable reading of the cc line.

            The first is that the cc line doesn't

communicate that Ingen-Housz and Munanka, who were the

people listed on the cc line, will in fact receive the

order.  All it says is that the order will be sent to

Ingen-Housz and Munanka.

            The second is that the -- even if it would

have been reasonable for him, for Mr. Butler, to assume

that Ingen-Housz and Munanka would receive the -- the

order in this case, it would not have been reasonable

for him to have done nothing, given that Rule 7 of the

Alabama rules made him jointly and severally responsible

for -- to the client and to the court in this case.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I guess the problem is,

accept the rule; it exists.  But if a lawyer says, I

don't care, I'm not going to do whatever the rules

required me to do, what more do you need for

abandonment?

            If a lawyer comes in and says, I understand

this is a rule of the court; I understand that I'm

supposed to do x, y, and z; I don't care; I'm just

not -- that's the question.

            MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, well --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the difference

between "I don't care" and abandonment?

            MR. NEIMAN:  I -- Your Honor, I guess I

should just make -- just make a couple points in

response to that.  The first is that, as I understood

the question posed about the cc line, that is all about

not abandonment, but whether the clerk -- the clerk's

actions can be blamed for -- or the default can be

blamed on the clerk.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We're not talking about

the notice issue; we are talking about the abandonment

question.

            MR. NEIMAN:  On the abandonment question, if

it really were -- if it really is true that Butler had

decided he was going to do nothing in this case and not

represent his client and not be an attorney for the

client, then there might be a viable argument that

Butler was not -- was not -- had abandoned the client in

some way, but that is not the -- a reasonable reading of

the record in this case.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  If we find --

            MR. NEIMAN:  Butler --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  If we find that these

lawyers did abandon their client, will there be some

sanction imposed upon them by the bar?  I often wonder,

just as when we find that there's been inadequate

assistance of counsel in a capital case, does -- does

anything happen to the counsel who have been inadequate

in a capital case?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I suppose it would

depend on exactly what the allegations are --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Have you ever heard of

anything happening to them?  Other than they're getting

another capital case?

            (Laughter.)

            MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I have not.

Certainly the rules would provide that a breach of the

rules of professional responsibility would be

sanctionable by the State bar, both against the Alabama

moments ago that Butler did more than your friend

suggested.  What more did he do?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Well, of course, we discussed

in the briefs the very -- the undisputable fact that

Butler filed numerous things, and after the default

occurred in this case.  But even --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, after the

default, sure.  But what did he do before?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Butler's affidavit certainly --

that was filed in the State court proceedings certainly

doesn't say:  I'm -- I was in this only to swear these

people in or move for their admission and nothing else.

            What Butler says --

than that?

            MR. NEIMAN:  Butler said -- says, on page

255a of the petition appendix, that he agreed to serve

as local counsel.  "Local counsel" has a specified

meaning under Alabama law.

something that's -- that's clear on the record.

did not simply agree just to move these people -- move

these people's admission.  Butler said he would be local

counsel.  And local -- the role of local counsel is

defined by Rule 7.  It includes an obligation to attend

hearings, conferences, and the like.  It also --

            We agree that this is a sui generis case.

The facts are extraordinary, the facts are shocking, and

our position is simply that under this Court's

precedents and the extraordinary facts here, Mr. Maples

has established cause to excuse the default.

the fact that the State communicated directly with Mr.

Maples, an extraordinary step after the default, maybe

the other telling thing is that in 2006, Alabama itself

eliminated the local counsel requirement for pro bono

proceedings, recognizing that it could only create

problems; it didn't add anything.

            With respect to abandonment, I understood at

times my counsel -- my friend, to acknowledge that

abandonment may establish an external event with respect

to the client.  If that's so, then I think it's clear

that we're at a minimum entitled to a remand.  There

were statements about what was clear from the record.  I

think, at a minimum, the record is not clear on a number

of things that this Court would have to get into if it

were going to consider adopting the State's position

that Mr. Maples was not abandoned.  Mr. Maples was in a

prison cell.  His attorneys of record did not tell him

that they had left the firm.  They were required not

only to tell the court --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't have to adopt the

State's position that he was not abandoned.  We have to

adopt your position that he was abandoned.

            MR. GARRE:  And you have a record of the

attorneys leaving with not only not notifying Mr.

Maples, not notifying the court, and not obtaining the

court's approval, which is required by Rule 6.2 of the

Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  What is troubling to me

about the abandonment argument is that -- is the fear

that if the Court says that abandonment is cause, there

will be many, many cases in which the allegation is:  My

attorney wasn't just ineffective and negligent; the

attorney was so bad that the attorney in effect

abandoned me.

            And that will substantially change existing

law.  Now, how can that be prevented?

            MR. GARRE:  Working through agency

principles that go back to Justice Story's time, working

through the principles established in this Court's

decision in Holland and that will be applied in Holland.

The lower court in Holland issued its decision on remand

and found that Mr. Collins had abandoned Mr. Holland,

using this Court's precedent as a guide.

            So, I think Holland already recognizes that

attorney abandonment can be external.  We're just asking

the Court to apply the same principles and recognize

that what's external in one context cannot be not

external in the other context.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, do you know how

often Holland relief has been granted -- since it's very

recent, but how -- how frequently Holland relief has

been granted by the courts below?

Official

            MR. GARRE:  I don't know the answer to that

question.  I'm not aware of any flood of relief in such

cases.  I expect that this would be very extreme.  I

think the facts here are about as extreme as you can

get.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Garre, how do we

distinguish between abandonment and simply a botched, a

very botched, transfer of responsibility within a law

firm?

            MR. GARRE:  Well, where you have counsels of

record leaving without obtaining the approval that

they're required or telling the Court, I think that is

abandonment pure and simple.  Beyond that, you would

look to agency principles, whether there's a breach of

loyalty.  This is going to be a fact -- you would want

to get into the facts, although I think it is a very

high bar.  I think the Holland decision makes clear it's

a high bar.  I think this case clearly passes that bar,

but it's something that the courts will work out

applying agency principles, applying the Court's

decision in Holland.

            Recognizing what Holland said in this case

isn't going to create any new rule; it's simply going to

extend logically the recognition that attorney

abandonment is external to the client as it always has

been under agency principles.

            With respect to notice, this Court doesn't

have to find a constitutional violation on the State's

part.  It's enough for cause that the Court finds that

the State's actions are external.  And I think the key

inquiry is what Justice Kagan recognized, which is you

look to what a person who is actually desirous of

providing notice would do.  In this situation, the clerk

got two notices back, "Left Firm."  It opened it up; it

would have seen this is an order in a capital case, and

it did nothing.  I don't think anyone who actually

desired to provide notice of an inmate with his life on

the line would do nothing, reasonably, in that

situation.

            Mr. Maples is not asking to be released from

prison.  He's asking for an opportunity to present

serious constitutional claims of ineffective assistance

of counsel to a Federal habeas court on the merits.

            If the claims are as meritless as the State

suggests, that clearly will have little burden on it.

But simply allowing those claims to be adjudicated on

the merits in Federal court will go a long way to

preserving the legitimacy of the system of criminal

justice in a case in which a man's life is at stake.
