CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this morning first in Case 16-529, Kokesh v. The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Unikowsky. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM UNIKOWSKY 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

            

The government contends it can bring 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign enforcement actions seeking backwards-looking 

 

 

 

 

monetary liability based on conduct dating back forever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with no statute of limitations at all.  That position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both contradicts the text of Section 2462 and is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

antithetical to legal traditions dating back to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

early Republic. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess your 

    

 

 

 

phraseology is technically correct, but the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says there's a multifactor analysis that a court would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

go through to determine that maybe the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought its action too late. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Your Honor, I -- actually, 

   

  

 

 

 

the government doesn't really take that position because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it contends that laches does not apply to the government

at all.  So the government's supposed equitable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

restriction -- or at least the government has taken that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position in every court, and certainly does not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contradict that position in its brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the government's view is that there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some kind of equitable limitation that only applies at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the remedial stage after the trial and the remedial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage is already over.  So the person's already stood 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial after, you know, 10, 20, 30 years after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incident.  And even then, it's a pretty weak equitable 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

restriction. 

              

I think the recent Wiley case kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illustrates this restriction in action where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government sought 22 years of prejudgment interest at a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very high interest rate.  And the government -- and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excuse me -- the district court said that because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SEC was partially responsible for the delay, it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to apply a somewhat lower prejudgment interest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

rate that lowered the amount of prejudgment interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from 200 to $100 million, and that is not really an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate substitute for a statute of limitations in our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

view. 

            

So we think that a statute of limitations is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary for actions to be dismissed pretrial.  And we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that also our position falls within the heartland

of the word "forfeiture."  We ask the Court to apply the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

ordinary definition of forfeiture, which has not changed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the 19th century and today.  It's an order 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring turnover of money or property to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government as a result of wrongdoing. 

   

 

 

 

            

Edwards --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, before the 

  

 

 

 

1970s -- and you haven't shown me anything to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary -- forfeiture was an in rem proceeding where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the property was attached; the money, the bank account, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a piece of property, a home, whatever, but it was not a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal action against an individual.  So how do we get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from that traditional understanding which governed this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute to your meaning today?  Because there is a vast 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference between in rem and in personam actions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I'd give two responses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to that.  First of all, I would -- I would dispute a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise that there was no concept of in personam 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeitures before 1970.  I think that there was.  For 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

instance, as the government itself says in its brief, an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in personam money judgment in the form of a fine was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered a forfeiture. 

   

            

where --

 

            

And so the government has this odd position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  A fine has -- I mean,

forfeit -- disgorgement is an equitable remedy on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting back money that doesn't belong to you.  A fine 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

is a payment in addition to the conduct that you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed.  So there is a difference there. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Right.  I --

    

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That begs the question. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I agree with you, 

   

  

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor.  The position I'm trying to say is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the government says that the word "forfeiture" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encompasses these in personam money fines, and also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encompasses these in rem turnovers of tainted property, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and disgorgement is kind of right in between those two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeitures the government recognizes. 

 

 

 

            

So like a fine, it's an in personam payment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of money, and like an in rem forfeiture, it's a turnover 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order of tainted property to the government.  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's somewhat gerrymandered, in our view, that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one and three would be forfeiture, but not two. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the other thing is I would -- you know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically, I actually think that there were in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

personam forfeitures of the value of money.  So we give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the example of this old customs fine -- forfeitures, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excuse me -- which are actually quite similar to today's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement.  If you violated the customs laws, you had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to pay, not necessarily just the property that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

illegally imported, but the value of it.  And those were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically called forfeitures as well. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Unikowsky, whatever 

  

 

 

 

7 

the history, certainly disgorgement was not in the days 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the common law what it is today.  Yet the SEC has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been asking for this kind of relief now for, what, over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 years? 

 

            

Has there been any effort, any activity in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress to make this clear, one way or another, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement fits with forfeiture? 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  No, there hasn't, because 

  

 

 

 

 

really, the SEC's efforts to seek these -- what we view 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as stale disgorgements are quite new. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, for instance, the government says that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1990, Congress implicitly ratified its position about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute of limitations.  We boiled the oceans and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could not find a single case, ever, before 1990, in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the government had sought these forfeitures from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond 5 years.  None. 

   

  

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it clear that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

district court has statutory authority to do this?  I --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I understand that in cases where the aggrieved party is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the court, there can be equitable remedies under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State law and so forth to afford restitution, at least. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is -- is there specific statutory authority

that makes it clear that the district court can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

entertain this remedy? 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  There's no specific 

  

 

 

 

statutory authority.  So we've never challenged the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

capacity of the district court to seek disgorgement; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've just said that there's a time limitation.  When 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement began in the 1970s, the SEC was seeking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that as an implied remedy.  There's no statute that says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the SEC can seek disgorgement.  There may be -- sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have any idea 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what percentage of time -- how often a district court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does direct that the disgorgement go to a victim as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed to the government? 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  There -- one of the amicus 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs, the American Investment Council, quotes 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers -- and I haven't personally checked their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

accuracy -- of something like $800 million out of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 billion.  The 6 billion includes penalties, although 

   

  

 

 

 

 

by statute, penalties also have to go to victims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Again, I haven't personally verified the accuracy of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

those numbers. 

 

            

But I think it's quite pertinent, actually, 

   

 

 

 

 

that the biggest money disgorgements tend to be in these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases where the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets often multi-hundred millions of dollars'

disgorgement on the gains derived from having bribed

foreign officials.  And those aren't compensatory at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

all.  Those -- those moneys are just deposited in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treasury. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can we go back to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority?  78u, which is the only authority I can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

imagine, says, "A court may grant any equitable relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investors."  If they are not doing -- if they're not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing restitution, how could that be the basis of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement? 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So that statute was enacted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

30 years after the SEC already started seeking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement.  So the SEC, I don't think, views that as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the fountain of its judicial authority to do it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given that it had been doing it for so long before that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think some of the --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I'll let your 

  

 

 

 

 

adversary tell me what the source of their power is, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I -- it is unusual. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I -- we do argue at some 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

length in our brief that it doesn't genuinely count as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an equitable form of relief.  And it's notable that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government really doesn't --

you think this is punitive? 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What are your best 

  

 

 

 

 

arguments?  I've read your brief, but the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

responded to some of them in -- in, well, somewhat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persuasive ways.  So what do you think remains as your

components of both a penal and remedial remedy, it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered penal.  So the question is whether it has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some penal component.  I think that the answer is yes, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because when one defines the purpose of the disgorgement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy, it's to -- it's to create -- it's to ensure that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone doesn't benefit from wrongdoing.  But when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that, you are talking about wrongdoing; in other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, the -- the purpose of the remedy is to impose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unpleasant legal consequences of wrongdoing. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's every --

  

 

 

 

 

restitution is that way, and you don't think of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution as punitive. 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I agree, Your Honor.  But I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

think in restitution, you can define a purpose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

independent of the person's wrongdoing, which is to say

that there's a victim and we want to compensate that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

victim.  So you can define a purpose of that remedy 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's independent of redressing the wrongdoing of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's a question I'm 

   

  

 

 

going to ask your adversary, but what do you see as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference between -- besides the statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations, what's the difference between restitution 

 

 

 

 

 

and disgorgement? 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, I think that 

   

  

 

 

restitution historically was a judgment requiring money 

   

 

 

 

 

to go to the victim.  So, for instance, there's this old 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case called Porter, which we talk about, in which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court actually orders a landlord who charged 

   

 

 

 

 

 

illegally high rents to pay money to the tenants.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the judgment.  It wasn't like disgorgement, which is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this noncompensatory remedy that goes straight to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government, and the government has the discretion to put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it in the treasury or not, wherever -- however it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chooses.  Restitution was a remedy in which the victim 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

gives -- excuse me -- the wrongdoer gives money to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim.  So --

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if we had that, if we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had this working only when the money goes to the victim, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government doesn't get it, would your -- then your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

statute of limitations argument fail if this is just a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

remedy for victims? 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I would probably be making a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

different argument in that case.  I'd be arguing that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the private statute of limitations applies.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

some old cases from the 19th century that hold that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government is just bringing an action standing in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the shoes of a private plaintiff, then private statutes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of limitations are applicable.  And, actually, in the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What is the private statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of limitations? 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I -- I think it would be the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

two years and then five-year statute of repose, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm -- I'm not certain of that, but I think that that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably what it would be.  But it's interesting to note 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that several years ago in the '90s, a litigant made that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  And it's a case called Rind from the Ninth 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit.  And the SEC successfully persuaded the Ninth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit that really didn't -- disgorgement was not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory remedy.  It wasn't about compensation. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

case? 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the name of that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Rind.  It's from the Ninth 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Circuit.  We cite it in the reply brief. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so the government is trying to sort of

have it both ways.  When people are arguing that it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory, the Commission says it isn't.  When people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

are arguing that it isn't, which we argue here, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent with many briefs the SEC has cited from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- has filed in lower courts, the SEC is saying that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is.  It's sort of defining disgorgement in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

twilight zone of sometimes compensatory, sometimes not, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and trying to avoid statutes of limitations applicable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to both types of remedies. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this case puts us in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather strange position, because we have to decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether this is a penalty or a forfeiture.  But in order 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to decide whether this thing is a penalty or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture, we need to understand what this thing is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And in order to understand what it is, it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly be helpful and maybe essential to know what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the authority for it is. 

 

 

 

 

            

So how do we get out of that -- out of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation?  How do we decide whether it is a penalty or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a forfeiture without fully understanding what this form 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this remedy or this, whatever it is, where it comes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from and -- and its exact nature? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I think that -- I agree the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Court has to decide that question.  I mean, what we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocate is just look at disgorgement as it's actually

being applied in the real world in the lower courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so, for instance, we give a bunch of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

examples where the Commission is seeking disgorgements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going beyond restoring the person to the status quo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ante.  So the SEC's position is that you've got to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorge money that went to everyone, not just you.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in tipper or tippee situations, in insider trading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, the tipper has to disgorge all the money that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went to the tippee.  And so I -- I mean, I don't think 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Court --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I don't know why 

   

  

 

 

 

that proves anything.  If I commit a crime and take my 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds and give half of it to Justice Breyer --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know what I was 

    

   

 

 

 

buying, but I bought something.  I got the benefit just 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

because I was able to direct it.  So I don't know that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that moves me. 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, but that -- what --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the example I gave is beyond cases where you just direct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money.  It's just a tipper who gives information to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a tippee and never has control over any of the money at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all, and the tippee trades on it and gets some money, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the tipper has to disgorge money, which he never even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlled. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

And so I -- and to answer Justice Alito's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

question, I think that it's true that there's some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute about what disgorgement is, where it comes from. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We argue it's not genuinely equitable, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government doesn't really defend its equitable nature. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think the Court should take disgorgement as it finds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it right now in the lower courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why don't we take it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as we find it in this particular case?  So is there any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficulty in identifying the victims in this particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case and ensuring that the money that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misappropriated from them by your client goes to them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not into the government's coffers? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So I believe on the -- on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the facts of this case, the disgorgement is a penalty as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well as a forfeiture.  And the reason why is that it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true that -- I -- I actually don't know if the victims 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are readily identifiable.  But whether they are or not, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we don't think it really matters ultimately, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this remedy is a remedy that ultimately goes to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government in the first instance, which it can direct it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however it wants to.  It's not a judgment in favor of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the victims at all.  And so --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But, again, we don't know. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

How do we know that the government has the authority to

direct it wherever it wants? 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That's the authority the 

  

 

 

 

 

government's been asserting for several decades that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower courts have been asserting.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought -- I thought 

    

   

 

 

the government's position was that they must give it to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the victim, if feasible. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It may or may not be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible to find the victims.  They may be dead.  But I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought the government's position was no, this is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just simply our discretion on whom we will shed our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grace; but if it's feasible, it goes to the victim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  That is absolutely not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

government's position.  The government's position, 

  

 

 

 

consistently in numerous lower court briefs, is that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has the discretion to decide or the district court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the discretion to decide.  There's no legal requirement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this money be distributed.  The government has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken the position, for instance, that because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement is not compensatory, victims don't even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have standing to challenge how the disgorgement is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distributed.  And it's also taken the position that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is no legal requirement at all, as opposed to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary rule, to distribute the money.  And --

yes. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, we'll ask the 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

government what their position is, whether it's totally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in their discretion whether they want to give this to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victims or keep it all. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I -- I should add, there's 

    

   

 

 

 

the -- there are certain Fair Fund rules that require, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not in -- it's not applicable to -- necessarily to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  But there are certain rules that direct that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money be put in funds that ultimately can go to victims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But we think this is all immaterial because, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first of all, the money in the first instance goes to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government, just like civil penalties also in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first instance go to the government and there's still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalties. 

            

And second of all, I just urge the Court to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read the government's many, many lower court briefs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where it takes the position over and over again for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation benefit that disgorgement is not a primarily 

   

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory remedy. 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The case is presented to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

us as if disgorgement is this category we must adopt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And correct me if it's mistaken, but it seems to me that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the parties seem to order -- argue a categorical rule. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's always a penalty or it's always not a penalty.  It 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

seems to me that maybe we can give guidance as to when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is a penalty and -- and if -- am I correct that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

that's the way the case is presented to us, it's all or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing? 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yeah.  So I think that as a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

matter of both doctrine and practicality, it should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all or nothing.  First of all, doctrinally, I think that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court should look at the definition of disgorgement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than how it applies in a particular case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

term. 

            

And there are also practical problems. 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it's not a statutory 

   

  

 

 

 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Well, that is true, but I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I think that there are problems within a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, looking how monies are directed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I just want to step back and say that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our position is, even just looking at the facts of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, this disgorgement is both a forfeiture and a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty. 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because? 

  

 

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  It's a forfeiture because 

   

  

 

 

it's an order requiring Petitioner to turn over his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money as a result of wrongdoing.  I think it's very 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

natural to say, Petitioner was required to forfeit $34.9 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

million to the government because he did something

In fact, forfeiture of proceeds of illegal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity are -- those statutes, such as 29 U.S.C. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

853(a)(1) are essentially identical to disgorgement. 

 

 

 

 

 

The government's brief identifies no differences, no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material differences between those forfeiture of 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds statutes and disgorgement.  And when Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

enacted those statutes, it called them forfeiture. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, it's true those statutes are pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new, but the reason Congress uses the word "forfeiture" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that it falls within the definition of a forfeiture. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I give an example of an injunction.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

school desegregation or prison de-crowding orders, those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are injunctions.  They're new injunctions, they didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exist in 1830, but they're still injunctions.  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same way, these forfeitures of proceeds, which are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical in every way to disgorgement, as far as we can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell, were called forfeitures. 

 

 

 

            

So even just focusing on the facts of my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client's case, ignoring all those other cases from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second Circuit, the remedy against the Petitioner was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially identical to the forfeiture of proceeds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes that have been enacted, and so it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture as well.  And it's also quite similar to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

old statutes involving forfeitures of the proceeds of

customs offenses. 

 

20 

            

So I'm very happy on the facts of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular case to defend our position that this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture and as well as a penalty, I would say. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

In response to Justice Sotomayor's question, 

 

 

 

 

 

I have to say that the penal versus remedial dispute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a certain "angels on the head of a pin" quality 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of whether something is really penal or not.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the best way to answer this question is to look at, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically, what was the reason and the purpose of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that taxonomy. 

 

            

And it's actually quite clear historically, 

 

 

 

 

 

and the government doesn't even agree -- disagree with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, that historically, there were basically two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories of money payments to the government.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory payments and there's punitive payments. 

 

 

 

 

 

And, in fact, there's this case called Brady v. Daly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, in fact, this Court held applied to Section 2462, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a subsequent case called Chattanooga, where the Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

says that a payment to a victim is remedial, and the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

same payment to the government, in the context of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qui tam action, is punitive.  And those are the two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories. 

            

And so we think that that is what Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had in mind when it enacted 2462.  It knew of two

categories, compensatory and penal.  Compensatory 

  

 

 

 

remedies go to victims -- or -- or intended to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensate the government for its own harm, and penal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

remedies are not intended to compensate --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that -- but that might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggest something along the lines of what Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg suggested, that if the government, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

puts this money into the hands of victims, then it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory; whereas if the government keeps it, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.  And that the rule should follow, depending on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is true. 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So I think that the 

   

  

 

 

 

government takes this money in the first instance, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think that the way the government happens to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribute the money should affect the statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations.  And, again, I -- I point the Court to the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

many briefs that the government has cite -- filed for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the last 20 years, emphasizing that this isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It gets more complicated 

  

 

 

 

 

than that, because the money goes to the court --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- according to the 

  

 

 

 

 

government, and it's the court that decides how the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money will be paid out, correct?

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  So this -- it depends. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

There's -- there's one statute on Fair Funds, and in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some cases, you have disgorgements that go into there, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there's a Sarbanes-Oxley statute that directs the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

SEC to distribute that. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And then the question 

  

 

 

 

 

becomes what you answered earlier, which is, if it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being paid to the victim, is it really restitution as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed to disgorgement.  And if it's restitution, is it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory damages subject to the existing statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations. 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Right.  So if this was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

genuine restitution, in other words, if the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court entered a judgment and the judgment was the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government is standing in the shoes of a private 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff, and there was a judgment in favor of some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class of victims, then it's possible that a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

set of statute of limitations would come into play.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the statute of limitations for private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs. 

            

We cite an old case called Beebe in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reply brief, in which the Court holds that, in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, those statutes of limitations are imported as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against the government.  But because the government has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been arguing for decades that that's the wrong rule,

both in the context of the statute of limitations and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many other contexts. 

 

 

23 

            

Like, for instance, you know, the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of whether disgorgement is equitable, we quote a brief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Commission filed in Eighth Circuit, where it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, the reason that disgorgement is equitable is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not restitution.  It's not compensatory.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

government says that criminal restitution judgments are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely irrelevant to the calculation of disgorgement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it's not compensatory.  As I mentioned, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

government's position is that victims don't even have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing to challenge the way these funds are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distributed because disgorgement is not compensatory. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think that the SEC should be taken at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its word and taking the positions they've been taking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for decades.  And because the SEC has taken that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position that this is not restitution, the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes the SEC can distribute the money to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victims shouldn't affect the nature of the remedy as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SEC has been arguing for a long time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, the same thing is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

true in the criminal context, right?  I mean, we have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal forfeitures where the money goes to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government and sometimes it's distributed to victims, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but we don't doubt that those are penal in nature.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I -- I agree, Justice 

    

   

 

 

24 

Gorsuch.  And, in fact, in -- in the case the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recently heard on Section 853(a)(1), the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphasized in its brief that in many cases forfeitures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can go to victims of crime.  But still, that is still a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional punishment. 

 

            

And, in fact, penalties -- Sarbanes-Oxley 

 

 

 

 

 

has a statute that says -- excuse me, Sarbanes-Oxley has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a provision that says that even civil penalties in many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, must go to victims.  But not that doesn't mean 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not a penalty, because it's not a restitutionary 

   

   

 

 

 

 

judgment for the victim.  It's money that goes to a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government official who can distribute it to victims, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it's still ultimately a payment to the government. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So does everything turn on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether the government labels a -- a particular 

   

   

 

 

 

disgorgement civil versus criminal? 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  No, Your Honor.  We think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that -- well, we agree that both -- you know, clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2462 applies to -- in fact, it only applies to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil remedies.  The word "civil" is right there in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  So that is a statute of limitations applicable 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to civil remedies.  And we think that this is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil forfeiture or penalty because it's ultimately in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first instance a payment to the government.

And because the government has successfully 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

opposed the argument that disgorgement is a form of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution, I think it should be taken at its word. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And this is a payment to the government and so the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions against payments to the government apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could Congress pass a 

  

 

 

 

 

statute giving the SEC the authority to bring these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions for however long a period Congress chooses? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Yes.  So Section 2462 has 

  

  

 

 

 

 

language that says something to the effect of, unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise specified by Congress. 

 

 

 

            

And we don't -- we're not making a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional argument.  Congress can enact unlimited 

  

 

 

 

 

statutes of limitations, we just don't think it did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And we also think that, just looking at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historical perspective as well as related statutes, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court -- and it would be very surprising if this didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a statute of limitations. 

   

 

 

            

What's so odd about the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

position is that, really, everything else in this area 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a statute of limitations.  So just to give a few 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

examples.  853(a)(1), which is forfeiture of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds of crime, very similar to this, has a statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of limitations, as does the civil actions for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeitures of proceeds. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

Compensatory actions by the government also 

 

 

 

 

 

have statutes of limitations.  So if the government sues 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone for conversion to get money back, there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

statute of limitations for that. 

 

 

 

 

            

Private causes of action, under the 

 

 

 

 

 

securities laws, also have statutes of limitations.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of those actions in some way could be characterized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as trying to get money back that was taken away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, essentially, what the government is 

 

 

 

 

 

saying is there's this implied remedy that's kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right in between everything.  And, therefore, there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations at all, because it kind of fits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhere and it's slightly different from everything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's just not a particularly plausible position in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

our view. 

 

              

I mean, there's been a lot of questions from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the bench today about whether this is like restitution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We've said it isn't, but I think a more salient point is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that restitution is also subject to statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations.  So the government's position that by sort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of wedging disgorgement in between all these other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things, it could bring actions unlimited in time we view 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as quite an implausible position. 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd just like to say one more word about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some of the government's inconsistencies in its

positions, because the government really has taken the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

position in its brief that disgorgement is a penalty for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some reasons and not others. 

 

 

 

 

            

So, for instance, take taxes.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

government's position is that if Petitioner wants to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deduct this award from his taxes, he can't do that.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reason why, per the government, is that disgorgement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a penalty.  That's what they say.  And the -- the IRS 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has taken this position, and I thought the government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

might just say in its brief, or the SG's office, we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not going to agree with the IRS.  We can state the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position of the government. 

 

 

 

            

And they could have done that, but they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually don't do that.  The IRS stands -- or, excuse 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, the government stands by that position, that it is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty for purposes of this statute, but it is not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty on his taxes.  And the government says -- why? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The government says that there's this unspecified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

textual and purposive differences, which it does not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elaborate upon. 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the government 

    

 

 

 

took the position that you could deduct expenses, if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure of what is turned over is the ill-gotten gains, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then money made to reduce those costs incurred in -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making those gains, should be deducted.  I didn't think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

the government was saying -- I think the -- the court of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals said that, but that seemed to me quite wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  I think the government's 

    

 

 

 

position -- and they can clarify if this is incorrect --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that disgorgement, such as this disgorgement, is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty for his taxes but is not a penalty for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2462 purposes, simultaneously. 

 

 

 

            

And it's also true for bankruptcy law.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is -- the words "fine," "penalty," and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"forfeiture" are in the Federal bankruptcy statute, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government's position really is that disgorgement is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not dischargeable because it is a fine, penalty, or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture, but it is not a fine, penalty, or forfeiture 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for purposes of the limitation period. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And it's true that there's a separate 

   

 

 

 

 

provision for securities disgorgements in the bankruptcy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws, but that doesn't apply to the disgorgements under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other statutes, such as the statute in which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government previously took the position in this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that disgorgement was a fine, penalty, or forfeiture. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think that citizens are entitled to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

basic consistency from the regulators, which doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to have happened in the context of disgorgement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And I'd like to reserve my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Goldenberg. 

  

 

 

 

          

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

            

For almost 50 years, courts have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordering disgorgement in SEC enforcement actions to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy unjust enrichment and put a defendant in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

position he would have been in if he hadn't violated the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  Courts sometimes send that money to the Treasury, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but when feasible, at the direction of the court, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distributed to the injured victims, either by the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself, by a trustee, by a receiver. 

   

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Goldenberg, in those 50 

  

 

 

 

 

 

years, has -- has the SEC or has the Justice Department 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever set down in writing what the guidelines are for how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the SEC is going to use disgorgement and what's going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen to the monies collected? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I'm not aware that it has. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's -- the SEC's policy -- it's been stated in various 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court decisions -- to ask the court to distribute the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money wherever that is feasible.  And in some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances -- we've given an example of this in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief -- the SEC has said, well, we don't think it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

feasible and the court said, well, we think it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

feasible; this money is going to be distributed.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's ultimately in the control of the court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I must say I find it unusual 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that the SEC has not given some guidance to its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement department or -- or that the Department of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice hasn't become involved in some way; that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything is just sort of up to the particular person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the SEC who decides to bring such a case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, as I say, I think 

   

   

  

 

 

it's not up to the particular person at the SEC.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SEC may seek disgorgement and may make a recommendation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the court about what should happen to the amounts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I think it's ultimately up to the court.  The court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is exercising equitable discretion and deciding whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement should be ordered in the first place, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if so, how much, and if disgorgement is ordered, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should happen to that money and where it should go.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can -- can you give us any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indication -- can you give us any indication as in what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage of the cases the funds go to the victims? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I can, Your Honor.  This 

    

  

 

 

 

information isn't in the record and it also is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely derivable from SEC public reports, but I can

tell you that the SEC has calculated, looking back at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the years 2013 to 2016, that money collected on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments entered during those years was disbursed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Treasury 43 percent of the time.  From 2013 to 2015, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was 33 percent of the time.  So it is very often 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be the case that this money is going to get out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to victims. 

 

            

My friend referred to an amicus brief that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks about an SEC public report, that talks about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection amounts and disbursement amounts, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

report just is comparing apples and oranges because it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about amounts that are collected as to judgments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in certain years and then amounts that are disbursed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a particular year.  So that report is not a good source 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of information about this. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One reason we have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this problem is that the SEC devised this remedy or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied on this remedy without any support from Congress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If Congress had provided, here's a disgorgement remedy, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you would expect them, as they typically do, to say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's a statute of limitations that goes with it.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

including, as your friend says, usually a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations and an accompanying statute of repose. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, it was a concern -- you know, Chief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Marshall said it was utterly repugnant to the

genius of our laws to have a penalty remedy without 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

limit.  Those were the days when you could write 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that and it's about a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations.  It's utterly repugnant. 

  

 

 

            

And it -- the concern, it sees seems to me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is multiplied when it's not only no limitation, but it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that the government kind of devised on its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own.  I mean, I think -- doesn't that cause concern? 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  No.  I think I disagree 

    

   

  

 

with some of the premises of that.  That principle that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor articulated is a principle that relates to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalties, which are punishments, and for the reasons --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's a little 

   

  

 

 

 

circular, yeah. 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, the reasons we do a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement isn't a penalty.  It remedies unjust 

   

  

 

 

 

enrichment and just takes the person back to where they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have been. 

 

 

            

And I also, I guess, would disagree with the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

premise that Congress hasn't thought about this issue or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't addressed it.  It's true that the securities 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes don't have a specific authorization that says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

courts may order disgorgement.  They give injunctive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

power and they give power for equitable relief, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the power the courts have relied on consistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

with this Court's decisions, like Porter and Mitchell, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

in ordering disgorgement. 

 

 

            

But, subsequent to the enactment of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions, Congress has enacted many provisions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk about disgorgement, that express approval of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement, that showed that Congress understands 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they're sort 

  

 

 

 

 

of backing --

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- is something that courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

order, and that Congress approves of that.  Sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They're -- they're 

  

 

 

 

 

sort of backing and filling.  I mean, this remedy is out 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, and yes, they're saying this.  But it does seem 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me that we kind of have a special obligation to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about how far back the government can go when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's something that Congress did not address because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not specify the remedy. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, again, I think the 

   

  

 

 

 

remedy is the equitable remedy that Congress did specify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it gave that authorization to courts.  But here is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where I think the narrow construction principle comes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

into play.  It's not the case that, as my friend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests, that you should sort of take a gestalt look at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the world and say, well, it seems like Congress

meant to have covered a bunch of things with different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes of limitations, and so we should assume that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress meant to cover this also. 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

            

Under the narrow construction principle, you 

 

 

 

 

 

need to look at each category that Congress has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted --

 

            

category. 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's look at each 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  My question, what's 

  

 

 

 

worrying me -- I'd like to know your answer to which you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have -- look, a city, to use a slightly farfetched 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

example, imposes a tax on houses and boats.  Someone 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

comes along and says, I have a houseboat.  It's not a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

house.  Houses don't go on water.  Not a boat.  Look at 

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the French windows, look at the venetian blinds.  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tax. 

            

Now, I think that would last about five 

   

 

 

 

 

 

minutes, that argument.  All right?  So I would like to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

know from you a list of the categories, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics -- characteristics, significant 

 

 

 

characteristics, of disgorgement which are shared 

 

 

 

 

 

neither by fines nor by forfeitures. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

of those? 

 

In what respect is disgorgement like neither

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Both fines -- excuse me --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

and forfeitures, in our view, are -- as used in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, so looking at what Congress would have intended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it enacted it in 1839 -- are punishments.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement is not a punishment because it doesn't take 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

away anything that anyone was rightfully entitled to in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first place.  It just remedies unjust enrichment, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it takes the defendant back into the position the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant would have been in if the defendant hadn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged in a securities law violation in the first 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance. 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Those are the two. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  And -- well, those are the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

things I think that distinguish it, and --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, those are the things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that distinguish it. 

 

 

            

            

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, let's look at those. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Punishment.  It doesn't take -- it takes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

away from somebody something he normally -- he would not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be rightfully entitled to. 

 

 

 

            

So a person who is walking along the street 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and commits a crime and is thrown into jail is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprived of his liberty.  Hmm?  I mean, I would think 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

his liberty is something he is normally rightfully

put the person in jail.  So I suspect that that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristic is not much of a distinguishing 

   

 

 

 

 

characteristic --

 

            

            

punishment.

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I think that -- I mean, I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

think that's certainly true of depriving someone --

MS. GOLDENBERG:  But disgorgement -- thank 

  

 

 

 

 

you -- disgorgement doesn't do that.  It doesn't take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away money that belonged to you, something you had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property right in.  In this case, it's taking back --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  I agree --

    

  

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- money that the defendant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

stole. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- disgorgement might not. 

  

 

 

 

 

A punishment, you say, does take something away from you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you're rightfully entitled to.

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Often does, yes. 

  

 

 

 

37 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, often does.  Sometimes 

  

  

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  It can.  And I think that's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

one of the reasons why one would be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And here -- here you take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

away things only that the person was not rightfully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to. 

 

            

            

            

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's a difference. 

   

  

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I got that one.  Is 

    

  

  

 

 

 

there another way?  Is there another one? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think they're all 

   

  

 

 

 

along the same lines, which is that this is analogous to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restitution.  It's analogous to the divestiture remedy, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which is in antitrust cases --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  A thing -- neither a fine, 

    

   

 

 

 

nor a punishment -- I'm not being facetious, I'm -- I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to get it in my mind. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Neither a fine, nor a punishment takes from 

   

   

 

 

 

someone a thing that he was not rightfully entitled to. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But disgorgement takes from 

  

 

 

 

 

the person a thing that he -- no.  Sorry.  The other way 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

around. 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes.  And maybe another way 

  

  

 

 

 

 

38 

to look at it --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It takes away from a person 

   

  

 

 

 

 

something that otherwise he would be rightfully entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, and disgorgement takes away from a thing he would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be rightfully entitled to. 

 

 

 

 

            

another --

 

            

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  And I think maybe 

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Have I got it now? 

   

  

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, you do.  And I think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

another way to look at it that might be helpful is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that --

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- fines, penalties, 

  

 

 

 

forfeitures, even damages, can put the defendant in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worse position than the defendant would have been in --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is it --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- if he had never --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- kind of an unreality 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to that argument because here there was a fine.  It was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a relatively modest amount compared to the huge amount 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awarded for this disgorgement.  So to say, oh, the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the penalty, that's something added on, that's something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he -- is he being punished by, say, 2 million.

case? 

            

            

But how much was the disgorgement in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  $35 million. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  $35 million.  So it's 

  

  

 

 

 

much larger than the penalty. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  It is, and that's because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the penalty was time limited under this Court's decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Gabelli.  So the penalty only covered the five years 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of conduct before the filing of the SEC's action, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whereas the disgorgement covered all of the bad conduct, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which went back further than five years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.  So --

  

  

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  And I think that's 

   

  

 

 

something that's really critical.  To point --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what is the 

  

 

 

 

 

difference from restitution? 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think --

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't this 

  

 

 

 

restitution? 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I think there's an analogy 

    

 

 

 

 

to restitution.  It is not dissimilar to restitution in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that both disgorgement and restitution are trying to put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the world back in joint when the world has been put out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of joint by something that the defendant has done.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if this is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

houseboat, why don't we call this restitution? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, it's not restitution 

  

 

 

 

 

in full, because restitution goes back to the harmed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties.  And disgorgement sometimes goes back to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmed parties; sometimes doesn't.  And we don't think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's necessary that it does go back to the harmed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties for it to escape from the reach of the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of limitations. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, in forfeiture, 

  

 

 

 

you're tracing in some metaphysical way a pot that has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been wrongfully taken. 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you are in 

  

 

 

 

 

traditional forfeiture saying, give back that pot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In this situation, we're not asking for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pot.  We don't care where the money comes from.  We're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying you're liable for a fixed money judgment that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're going to give up.  So how is that not the same as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a penalty?  Because a penalty is saying to someone, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you've committed a wrong.  We don't care what you did 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that pot that you got.  We're not asking you in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional forfeiture sense to turn that pot over. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're asking you to give money from whatever sources you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may have, other sources, and pay for the wrong that you

did. 

            

So isn't it analytically more like a penalty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

41 

than it is like making someone whole? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think making someone 

    

 

 

 

whole is a forfeiture.  Give up the illegal gains you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

got. 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, that kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

forfeiture, the proceeds forfeiture, didn't come into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law until much, much later. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

question --

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Doesn't matter.  The 

  

  

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  But --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- is --

  

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Understood. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- if it looks like a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture, why don't we treat it like a forfeiture? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, as I say, I would 

   

   

  

 

 

like to talk about your -- your tracing point.  But just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make the point just to be clear, that proceeds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture didn't come into our law until 1978.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what says you got these proceeds from your crime; now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to give them up, you have to give them back. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we don't think that forfeiture would have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood that way when this statute was enacted in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Was there --

  

 

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  With respect to your 

  

 

 

 

 

42 

tracing question, though --

 

 

 

            

sorry. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Okay.  It's true that there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

isn't a tracing requirement for disgorgement.  That's 

   

  

 

 

 

true as among private parties as well.  And, actually, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the restatement on unjust enrichment spells this out, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, you know, very, very well.  It's that you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to get the money back.  Money is fungible.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so there's not a tracing requirement the way that there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is in forfeiture, I think, basically for historical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reasons because of the history of in rem forfeiture. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But nevertheless, as between private parties, 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement or restitution is not considered a penalty, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

despite the absence of this tracing. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it's -- it's not clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me that you have limits.  Suppose there are two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coconspirators and they misappropriate -- A 

 

 

 

 

 

misappropriates $100,000.  He gives 90 to B, keeps 10 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for himself.  Doesn't the government take the position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it can get a hundred back from A and 90 from B? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Isn't that your position consistently?

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think our position 

   

  

 

 

 

43 

is that it depends.  That --

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Pardon me? 

  

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  It depends.  Sometimes 

  

  

 

 

joint and several liability would be appropriate, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's, I think, what Your Honor is asking, in that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that situation where you could make a defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially responsible for money that was taken by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone else who was closely associated with them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you call that 

  

 

 

 

 

disgorgement? 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  It can be called 

  

 

 

 

 

disgorgement, but disgorgement doesn't inevitably extend 

 

 

 

 

 

to that.  In courts, in the exercise of their equitable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion, have rejected that in some cases.  And so --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in -- in my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical, would you take the position that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations does apply?  100 from one, 90 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the other.  That's a total of 190. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I -- I don't -- I'm not 

    

   

 

 

 

 

sure that disgorgement would ever work that way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually, because there are deductions when money has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been recovered.  For instance, if there's a private 

   

  

 

 

 

 

damages action and money has been recovered, that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deducted from disgorgement.  So I must --

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My --

  

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I think I might have 

    

   

 

 

44 

misunderstood the question. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My understanding is that A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is liable for the full 100 -- $100,000. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Right.  Well, that would be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

joint and several liability.  That's not necessarily the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

same thing as then recovering on top of that from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone else. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I agree. 

    

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Our position is that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court should decide whether the disgorgement in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case falls within the scope of Section 2462 and leave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for another day the question of whether disgorgement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extends to situations like that.  It would seem wrong to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us for the Court to assume that disgorgement is as broad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as courts have ever made it and to rule on that basis, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when perhaps the issue could come before this Court --

MS. GOLDENBERG:  No --

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not entitled to

MS. GOLDENBERG:  The brief --

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- the briefs that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were cited in your friend's reply --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Are you talking about the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah. 

  

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- situations? 

  

 

 

            

Those involve different statutes.  We have 

  

 

 

 

 

not taken inconsistent --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  I know.  That's

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- positions on 2462. 

  

 

 

 

 

46 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you haven't 

  

 

 

 

 

taken the same -- different positions under the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, but we're talking about disgorgement in each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  I gather your position would be if disgorgement 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

was required under the securities law, that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedial -- right? -- and -- and therefore is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to the statute of limitations.  But if that same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant tried to deduct that remedial relief, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would say you can't do that because it's punitive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the same payment is characterized by your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client as remedial in one context and punitive in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another. 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  No, Your Honor.  With 

  

  

 

 

 

respect to taxes, we haven't taken a position.  We've 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

noted, as my friend has noted, that there is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unpublished, non-presidential memorandum from the IRS 

 

 

 

 

 

that says that disgorgement in the SEC context sometimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be considered a fine or similar penalty --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In the SEC context? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I'm sorry.  In the --

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  IRS. 

  

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- in the IRS context.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

apologize, Your Honor. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes. 

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Sometimes can be considered 

  

 

 

 

 

47 

a fine under tax law, and sometimes isn't considered a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine under tax law in situations, for instance, in which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money goes back to the injured investors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And so we think that it's perfectly --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So not only is it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one thing in one context, but something else in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other context.  Sometimes it's remedial and sometimes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's punitive in each context. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, we think it's 

  

 

 

 

 

legitimate to have different interpretations of 

 

 

 

 

 

different statutes that have different language, 

 

 

 

 

 

different purposes, different tools of statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, so different legislative history, 

 

 

 

 

different provisions that surround them. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

be --

 

The way this Court --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you --

  

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- decides the case may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you -- you have argued 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a categorical rule.  Your -- your brief says 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement in SEC actions is not a penalty. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Disgorgement is not a forfeiture.  You're arguing a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

categorical position. 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  We are arguing with respect

to this statute --

 

 

 

48 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your answers to the 

  

 

 

 

 

questions, you're saying, well, it depends. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  No, no, Your Honor.  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

sorry.  I don't mean to be unclear about that. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Our argument is that under 2462, as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms "penalty" and "forfeiture" should be understood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under this Court's decision in Meeker, they both refer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to doing something punitive, that disgorgement is not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty or a forfeiture under this provision.  All I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying now is that it's possible that there may be other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments to be made under other statutes.  Even though 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they contain the word "penalty," the way this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides the case may affect that, and the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- because the --

  

 

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- government may adjust 

  

 

 

 

 

its positions accordingly. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is your answer to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- to the deduction there?  Your friend said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government takes the position that you have to turn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over everything that you got and you can't have any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deduction for what it cost to -- to produce that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

deducted? 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  For whether expenses can be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Again, I think this is an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

49 

issue of the scope of disgorgement that's not before the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court now.  But the -- the analysis I think is best set 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out in a Ninth Circuit decision called Wallenbrock, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

which points out that sometimes expenses can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deducted.  For instance, if you have a legitimate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

business that you're running and you just are skimming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some money out of your clients' accounts, but you really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do have legitimate business expenses, in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance, courts have allowed deduction of expenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so as to make sure that you're just getting the unjust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enrichment. 

            

If you're running a Ponzi scheme or 

   

 

 

 

 

something of that nature and your whole business is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud, in that circumstance, courts have not allowed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deduction of expenses because those expenses are really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just money that was stolen from the investors.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so --

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Ms. Goldenberg, when we 

  

 

 

 

 

get to the criminal context, this very same remedy of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement of everything is often called a forfeiture, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and it is a penalty; right?  So why does it make a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference that we just happen to be in the civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context? 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, there are forfeitures

and there is restitution in the criminal context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

That's certainly true. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  The very same remedy. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  In circumstances -- well, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't think it's exactly the same.  In circumstances in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, for instance, the government forfeits things in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the criminal context and it eventually sends money back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the victims, that's in the government's discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather in the control of the Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. 

  

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  But what I think makes a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

difference --

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So why does the form, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether this is civil versus criminal, make all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference? 

            

decision --

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, this Court's 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And how do we ever know? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, goodness gracious, the difference between civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and criminal has vexed this Court for many years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  This Court's decision in 

  

 

 

 

 

Kelly, I think, points out that the criminal context 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

really is somewhat different, and that this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision in Pasquantino, I think, suggests that the same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing is true.  In the Federal context, the decision in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Kelly --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, let's be more 

  

 

 

 

 

51 

specific about the question that Justice Gorsuch is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking.  You said the difference was that we are taking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with disgorgement, property, money, or the equivalent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he, the defendant, did not rightly have.  Perhaps 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he stole it.  Okay? 

  

 

 

            

Now we have a criminal case.  Judge, you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

stole the Hope Diamond.  I cannot take that value, which 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've gotten rid of the diamond, but you have several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

million, I can't take that and give it to the victims. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't even know who they are.  So I'm going to impose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a penalty, a fine, and the fine will equal the value of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Hope Diamond.  Is that a fine? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

            

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I think that --

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You said it was a fine. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, that would be --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That would be a fine. 

   

  

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  You could do something --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And I think that's the 

   

  

 

 

 

question that's being asked.  If it is a fine, when the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge sentences, your distinction, the main one between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement and fine or forfeiture, what happens to it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, just to be clear, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think what you're talking about now is proceeds

forfeiture.  That would be the equivalent of what Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor described in the criminal law.  And I think in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal context, it really is different.  And this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's decision in Kelly explains that.  The whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of a criminal proceeding is to punish. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Forfeiture is imposed as part of the criminal sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a criminal proceeding as part of the punishment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And sometimes the money 

  

 

 

 

 

goes to the victim and sometimes it doesn't.  Just like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, as I say, that's in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the government's discretion, and that is not like here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here, it's --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, here we don't know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because there's no statute governing it.  We're just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

making it up. 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, I wouldn't say that, 

   

  

 

 

 

Your Honor.  There are almost 50 years of precedents on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how this should work, and I think the way it worked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is --

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Not in this Court. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- is clear. 

  

 

 

 

            

It's true that this Court doesn't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent about disgorgement in the SEC context, but as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I pointed out earlier, the Court does have precedent in

other contexts --

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Are there any time -- are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there any time limits, and if so, where do they come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from? 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  The courts that have ruled 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that there's no statute of limitations for disgorgement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have said that the district court can take into account, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as part of this exercise of equitable discretion that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm describing, the passage of time, and how much time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has passed and -- in deciding whether to order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement.  And in deciding whether or not to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- the courts say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that, but where -- what is the basis for it?  Is this by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogy to some traditional equitable remedy?  Where --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where does that come from?  Is it like laches?  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laches, you say, doesn't apply to the government? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  That's true, laches doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

apply to the government.  I think it is just the fact 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in exercising this kind of equitable discretion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the authority given in the statute, the court can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider all kinds of facts and circumstances.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court is assessing things like is causation adequately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established?  Is the amount adequately established? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The cases say over and over again, that what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court is trying to do is to get at unjust enrichment

and not to go beyond that because that would be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty.  So if the Court decides --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's only with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

respect to -- that's only with respect to the amount of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the remedy, not with respect to liability.  So 20 years 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the time that the fraud or whatever is committed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government can bring an action for disgorgement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against -- against the wrongdoer, and that action would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed, despite this equitable limitation you're 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about. 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Yes, that's true.  But the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

government has many incentives to move more quickly than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  You don't see cases like that.  And, in addition, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that it's clear that all along the way, since 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement has been --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if we -- if we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that's inappropriate and bad, we're not going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come out the other way because we trust the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to bring an action like that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I'm not suggesting that 

  

 

 

 

 

Your Honor should trust the government.  What I'm saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that we're defending the status quo.  This is the way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's worked for almost a half a century, and I think if 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

there had been some --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, this has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

changed a lot after the Gabelli decision.  That was your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

answer to Justice Ginsburg, that why did you get this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

huge amount from disgorgement and only a small amount 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the other thing.  And you said, well, that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because Gabelli said we have to be bound by a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction of the statute of limitations.  And if that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cut us off, now we're going to rely on disgorgement to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get all the money we -- that the Court said under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gabelli, that you couldn't get. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I understand, Your Honor, 

    

 

 

 

but Gabelli is actually an incentive for the SEC to move 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faster, so that it gets the civil penalties.  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually, it is not true -- I think it's empirically not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true that the SEC's practices have changed since 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gabelli, that the SEC is somehow filing different kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of claims, or seeking disgorgement more often. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We can statistically show, if you compare 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the amount in disgorgement vis-à-vis penalties in 2009 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

versus 2016, there's actually way more disgorgement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compared to penalties; over $2 billion compared to only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$300-some million in penalties in 2009, long before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gabelli.  So to the extent that Gabelli has shifted the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's incentives, it's to move faster, so that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalties are still on the table. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And something -- I really want to point out

something that's really important, I think, that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

56 

facts of this case illustrate, which is that even if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court were to rule that Section 2462 covered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement, the government could still bring actions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than five years after bad conduct, seeking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunctions.  It could still bring actions like this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

action, more than five years after the earliest of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad conduct, seeking disgorgement and penalties. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so it's not as if the defendant would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected from having to defend himself against claims, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from having to bring witnesses, from having to come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward with evidence.  This is not that kind of statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of limitations.  This is a statue of limitations about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

remedies, not about actions. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If -- if the -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's beyond the statutory limitation, I suspect that an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunction would be kind of irrelevant unless the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct has continued that long. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, it's true that in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that such circumstance, you would show that there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some danger of bad conduct in the future, but you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use the existence of the bad conduct in the past as part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that evidence. 

 

 

            

So I think that there is not a danger 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that -- that things are going to go awry here.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

has been aware this whole time,that disgorgement is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

operating this way, including in pre-1990 cases that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were brought more than five years after the earliest of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bad conduct. 

 

 

              

I would like to emphasize one more time, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I could, the narrow construction canon here, because I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think if the Court has any doubt about the meaning of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty and forfeiture, at the very least, those terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are ambiguous.  We've come forward with all kinds of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemporaneous sources --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  We don't apply the canon 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in criminal cases, so why should we apply it in a case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the penalty is identical to what might be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal penalty? 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, it's true that it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not applied in criminal cases, where there are other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

canons that are at play, like the canon --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Like lenity. 

  

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well, right.  And like the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

canon against penalties that the Chief Justice was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referring to earlier.  But that can't decide whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something is a penalty or not in the first instance. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That would be a completely circular enterprise. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you agree or disagree --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm a little -- left a little bit unclear.

Mr. Unikowsky's standard is that if something is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

solely remedial, then it's a penalty.  Do you agree with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I don't disagree that if 

    

 

 

 

 

something has a punitive aspect, then it can be a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you disagree with any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

punitive aspect. 

 

            

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if something is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

solely remedial, it is a penalty. 

   

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I disagree with the 

    

 

 

 

principle that just because something has some deterrent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect or deterrent purpose, that that makes it a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment, and that's a proposition that this Court has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected a number of times, in its decision in Hudson, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in its decision in Smith v. Doe, which is an ex post 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facto case, and it has overruled a decision on that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some of the decisions that Petitioner cites' relied on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the mere fact that something is deterrent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't enough to make it punitive.  Damages are a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterrent, injunctions are a deterrent.  Lots and lots 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of things are a deterrent. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because I look at this 

   

  

 

 

 

and -- and it seems to be a commonsensical kind of way

Alderson Reporting Company

59 

of looking at the way this remedy works, the way the SEC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has used it, is that it's trying to do a lot of things. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's trying to compensate.  It's trying to deter.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying, to some extent, to punish misconduct that it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it sees, you know, and that it's a little bit artificial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to try to tear them apart.  And then if you accept Mr. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Unikowsky's standard, that suggests that he has the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better of the arguments. 

 

 

 

            

            

So why is that wrong? 

 

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Well -- excuse me -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree that disgorgement is in any way intended to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punish, for the reasons that I was explaining to Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, but I guess -- I guess 

   

   

  

 

 

 

when I said "punish," I don't mean to make that sound as 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a conclusion.  I mean just to say, it's tied to -- to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular misconduct.  So -- so it's -- it's very much 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relating to a -- an offense. 

   

 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  It is, but that's because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's the conduct that gave rise to the unjust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enrichment that needs to be remedied.  And it is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedial thing to do to say to the defendant, you got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this money that you were never supposed to have.  Let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take it back and try to put the world back the way that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was before.  And, in many cases, we're going to go on

and then give it to the injured parties, and we're going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to put the world completely back to the way that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 

should have been, if you hadn't acted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The mere fact that somebody has engaged in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrongdoing is not enough to make any consequence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flows from that a punishment, or injunctions would be a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment, declaratory judgments would be punishments, 

 

 

 

 

 

all kinds of things would be punishments that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't consider to be a punishment. 

   

 

 

 

            

And -- and so I think, again, there's at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

least some ambiguity here about what Congress meant in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1839 about what penalty and forfeiture meant.  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that situation, the narrow construction canon comes into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

play in favor of the government, and resolves this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in favor of the government. 

 

 

 

 

            

Petitioner has suggested that the narrow 

 

 

 

 

 

construction canon has no application here, because this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not a situation in which the government is trying to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get back its own money or its own property.  That is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just not correct, as a statement of how the narrow 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction canon works. 

 

 

            

The very cases that Petitioner cites talk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the rationale for the narrow construction canon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being the protection of public interest or public rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and property.  And one of the very cases the Petitioner

cites, the Badaracco case, was a case where the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government was acting in an enforcement capacity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting tax penalties from -- under a statute that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described as a penalty statute. 

   

 

 

            

            

So, again, I think it can't be --

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Narrow -- narrow 

  

 

 

 

construction of what? 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Narrow construction of 

  

 

 

 

Section 2462, to say that the words "penalty" and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"forfeiture" should be understood narrowly, rather than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as Petitioner would have it, extremely broadly to cover, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically, any payment that ever goes to the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in any way.  And once you construe them narrowly to mean 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment, then disgorgement doesn't fall within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope of that. 

 

 

            

And, again, I think it can't be that you can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of say, well, Congress would have meant to cover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, if it had thought about it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The canon, just as the canons that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to do with waivers of government sovereign immunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the like, says you have to look specifically at each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the categories that Congress set up and see whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the remedy that you're talking about falls within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope of that.  And here, that's certainly not the case.

this area; that Congress has passed a lot of statutes

apply to the SEC during the period in which disgorgement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been ordered, and that Congress has never taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action to cover disgorgement under a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

limitations, and Section 2462 --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just -- just out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

curiosity, when -- I'm sorry. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, please. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  When -- when the SEC uses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, is it usually going after continuing misconduct, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or does it sometimes really reach back into the past for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completed conduct? 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  It's usually relating to 

  

 

 

 

 

continuing misconduct.  There aren't very many cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

where the SEC has ever reached back more than five years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the filing of the complaint.  But in the ones 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that exist -- again, not a huge number -- they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are generally cases that are brought within five years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of some of the misconduct, as was true in this case.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice.  I'd just like to make a couple of quick 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

63 

points. 

            

First of all, the government's counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

characterized our position as saying that we're relying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on some general gestalt about the implicit intent of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress.  And I want to be emphatic, that is not the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position we're raising.  We are relying on the text of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute.  We think this is a forfeiture and is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty under the dictionary definitions of those terms. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So first, the word forfeiture would just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite the dictionary and say that it's an order to turn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over money or property to the government as a result of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrongdoing, which this is.  And we also point to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real-world usage of forfeitures that are almost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical to this. 

 

 

            

And by the way, I point out that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government says this is not forfeiture because it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment, but we cite lots of old sources dating back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the 19th century in which courts were emphatic that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain types of forfeitures, like these customs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeitures, which are very similar to disgorgement, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were remedial; they weren't even punitive.  So we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relying on the literal text of the word forfeiture and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the history the way this Court has interpreted that

word.  And we think that disgorgement falls within that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64 

            

And it's true that disgorgement is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical to forfeitures in 1830, but it's the same way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that school desegregation injunctions are not identical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to injunctions from 19 -- 1830 either.  But they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still injunctions because they fall under the meaning of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that word.  And in the same way, disgorgement is a type 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of forfeiture. 

 

            

Similarly, we rely on what the word penalty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means, accompanied by this Court's decision saying that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partially penal remedies are, in fact, considered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalties for various legal purposes. 

 

 

 

 

            

The word "penalty" means a negative --

   

 

 

 

 

negative consequence of wrongdoing because of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrongdoing.  In other words, you did something bad, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've got to pay money to the government because you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did something bad, as opposed to because you want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensate the victim, and that characterizes 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement. 

            

There's a jury finding that Petitioner 

   

 

 

 

committed securities fraud.  As a result, he has to give 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

money to the government.  And it's true that the measure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that money is the amount of money he gained, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concept of tainted assets, but there's just no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historical record that that's somehow not a penalty.

As we mentioned, for instance, forfeiture of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65 

the proceeds of crime is punitive.  The government has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always said it's punitive.  It's part of a criminal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sentence, and yet, it's essentially the same thing as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement.  So we're happy to rely on the text in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case. 

 

              

I also want to talk about the dangers of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this implied remedy, because as there's some questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the bench that disgorgement seems to be an implied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy, there's no clear statutory authority.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

danger of that is that disgorgement seems to keep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

morphing in the government's briefs and positions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, for instance, the government always 

 

 

 

 

 

claims, as I mentioned, in lower courts, that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation is just an ancillary aspect of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement, its primary function is not compensatory, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and did that to beat down a whole bunch of legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments such as the argument that private compensatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes of limitations apply. 

 

 

 

            

And now in this Court, when we point out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those positions, the SEC says, well, it's sometimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory, sometimes isn't, but the fact that merely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes we're compensating people, that's enough to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make it compensatory enough to fall outside of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2462. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

And by the way, the government counsel today 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66 

made very clear the SEC's position that it wants a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical rule under Section 2462.  They don't want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that rule under bankruptcy law or tax law, because that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might decrease the amount of money that goes to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Treasury.  But under Section 2462, the government was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphatic that it wants categorical rule:  Disgorgement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is always, 100 percent of the time, not a penalty or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture under the statute. 

 

 

 

            

So even in -- in these Foreign Corrupt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Practices Act cases where billions of dollars go into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States Treasury, and there's no prospect of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation to victims, the government says that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disgorgement, and so that is not a penalty or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture.  And that will be the government's position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it prevails in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so I just don't think that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government can define the remedy as sometimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensatory, sometimes not compensatory, and avoid 

 

 

 

 

 

everything.  And that's the danger of allowing the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government to bring implied remedies further back in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time precisely because they are implied, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially the government's position.  Because it's an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

implied remedy, Congress never enacted expressly, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no statute of limitations; therefore, it has

more power to bring this remedy forever, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterizing it in different ways depending on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation needs of the government. 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd like to make one final comment about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

canon of construction, the narrow construction canon, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because, again, for 200 years, we haven't found any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases in which the government had applied it in a case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like this one:  A noncompensatory, backwards-looking 

    

 

 

 

remedy to the government as sovereign.  It just hasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied it.  And there's lots of -- that way.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's lots of cases in which the reverse canon of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction has been used. 

 

 

 

            

So we cite, for instance, the old Maillard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case and the old Adams case from the early Republic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the Court is clearly saying that there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction in favor of the statute of limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because, as Chief Justice Marshall said, it would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utterly repugnant not to apply it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We look at the Maillard case involving a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value customs forfeiture quite similar to this case in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, again, the judge at the time -- it was a district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court -- refused to apply that canon because of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court's view that it shouldn't apply in these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backwards-looking remedies. 

 

            

And in fact, the Gabelli case itself I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

believe is quite strong for us on this, because in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68 

case, if there was some pro-government canon, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't treat -- the court wouldn't treat the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government worse off than private plaintiffs. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank you. 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m., the case in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
