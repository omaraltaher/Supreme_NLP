11  person's silence during a noncustodial police interview 
12  against him at trial, and nothing about the specific

14  applying that rule here. 
15
16  argument in this case urging the jury to find 
17  Mr. Salinas guilty because, quote, "an innocent person 
18  would have denied law enforcement's accusations," 
19  strikes at the core of everything the Griffin rule and, 
20
21
22  justice.  It effectively shifts the burden of proof onto 
23  the defendant, and it demeans individual dignity by 
24  conscripting the defendant as a product of his own 
25

indeed, the Fifth Amendment is designed to prohibit. 

 It evokes an inquisitorial system of

 But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals 


simply misunderstood the nature of a Griffin claim and 

the nature of the compulsion.  The compulsion that 

Mr. Salinas faced was when the police asked him the 

 Now, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals 

resisted this logic and held the Fifth Amendment didn't 
apply because there was supposedly no compulsion in this 
case in the sense that there was no physical or 
psychological coercion of the kind that's inherent in

 If he answered the question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why isn't it -- why isn't

16  it like the -- is it Berghuis case?  There was a case of 
17  someone who was given Miranda warnings, and, even so, 
18  the Court said he was silent.  He didn't invoke the 
19  Fifth Amendment; therefore, his silence can be commented 
20
 MR. FISHER:  No, that's not the holding of 
21
22  the Berghuis case, with all due respect.  The Berghuis 
23  case was about whether his subsequent statements could 
24  be used against him.  This Court didn't hold that his 
silence that preceded those statements could be used

Miranda itself in footnote 37, where the Court said, if 
somebody stands mute in a custodial setting in the face 
of law enforcement accusations, they may not be --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Then what's the law?  What 
is -- I mean, Joe Smith leaves a -- a blank in part of 
his tax return.  The IRS gets it.  Later, it turns out 
to be relevant, and the prosecutor wants to say, hey, he 
left this blank.  Okay?

13  not going to say that any -- any time you refuse to tell 
14  the government anything and, later on, it turns out to 
be relevant to a criminal prosecution, that that's taken 
15

 And then we have the clear line, which, in 


custody, and, now, you want to extend that line.  And so 
what I want to know if we -- if I follow you and extend 
it, what line do I draw? 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, it's sufficient to decide 

this case to say that a noncustodial police interview 
during the investigation of a crime, where they're 

the policeman says, hey, I haven't seen you around 

before, and he doesn't answer.  Okay?  Now, that's 

probably not an invocation.

 So, against that background, suppose, in 
this case, the facts were just about the same, and he

 MR. FISHER:  Perhaps.  But the State -- what 
13
14  the State would not be able to do would be to argue that 
15
16  demonstrated his guilt. 
17
18  say, Well, he said, well, and started to cry, and he 
19  never told us anything else.  That -- that final 
20
21
22  line.  You have the exact issue that arises already in 
23  custodial settings, where, under Doyle and footnote 37 
24  of Miranda, you've held that silence can't be used 
25

sentence that I used is impermissible? 

 MR. FISHER:  I think that may well cross the 

his silence and refusal to answer the question 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or the prosecution could 

against a criminal defendant. 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 The law is already sorted out on this in the 

questions will arise in two ways:  One is whether words 
that the defendant uses are tantamount to refusing to 
answer the question, and then there is a second question 
about physical demeanor evidence.

lower courts, and I think it's a very workable test. 
7 
The Solicitor General agrees with what it is, and the 
8 
reason why this Court hasn't seen a case or -- itself, 
9 
seen a case like that is because, once the rule is 
10
11  established that the prosecution can't use silence 
12  against the defendant, the temptation drops away to try 
13  to introduce that evidence for some, supposedly, 
14  different purpose. 
15
16  do -- do I understand correctly that you're saying 
17  demeanor is different, so, although it was impermissible 
18  to comment on silence, it was okay to say he looked 
19  down, he seemed to be sweating, he was very nervous, he 
20
 MR. FISHER:  Insofar as demeanor evidence 
21
22  that the State offers has communicative value and the 
23  State argues that it has communicative value, 
24  independent of, simply, what the defendant looked like 
when he remains silent, then it -- then it may well be

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, but then --

 So, Justice Kennedy, you're right, that 

was shuffling his feet.

 And, indeed, I think it would be appropriate 
in a case, if the prosecution said, look, the fact that 
the defendant started crying, we think, is relevant for 

 Now, as I said, as I was just finishing up 

telling Justice Kennedy, you're not going to have hard 

cases in this respect because, once the temptation --

once it's clear that silence can't be used, then the 
prosecution, I think, has little motivation to try to 
walk that line.

11  some reason independent of what he -- of failing to 
12  answer the question.  The jury could be instructed, as 
13  they are in Griffin -- Griffin settings already, that 
14  you aren't to consider the defendant's refusal to answer 
15
16
17  a number of problems.  The first is your rule would be 
18  seen to be giving noncustodial defendants more rights 
19  than those defendants in custody because you're arguing 
that -- I think -- that a greater degree of expression, 
20
21  other than silence, would be needed to show the 
22  invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination. 
23

25

the question against him, but --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fisher, may -- I have 

able to introduce that evidence. 


Official 

 MR. FISHER:  No. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or are you trying to 

equate the rights that a defendant has to custodial and 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

noncustodial, with respect to invocation? 

 MR. FISHER:  No.  And I -- and this is where 

Justice Ginsburg's question came from, so I think it's 
very important for me to be clear on this. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem -- I have an 

A person in a noncustodial setting still has 
fewer rights than a person in a custodial setting.  What 
the Court held in Berghuis is that, if the defendant 
wants to exercise his prophylactic right under Miranda 
to cut off police questioning -- those are the words 
this Court used -- that has to be expressly invoked in 

1

10
11  some manner during the interrogation. 
12
13  easier problem understanding this argument with 
14  respect -- and I'm going to ask your adversaries -- with 
respect to the situation in which someone is approached 
15
16  by the police and said, come in and talk to us.  I have 
17  a hard time understanding how the refusal to come talk 
18  to them could be held against them.  There, I understand 
19  it. 
20
21  talked.  So, once he chose to do that, why does he get 
22  more rights than Berghuis did, who remained silent for 
23  2-and-a-half hours?  The Court wasn't willing to find 
24  that that was an invocation of the privilege against 
self-incrimination.  Why would it find the refusal to 
25

But, here, your defendant went in and 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

ask one -- answer one question indicative of the 

privilege against silence -- or the privilege for 

silence? 


 MR. FISHER:  Let me -- if I may, let me 


focus on the Berghuis question. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know --
 MR. FISHER:  And then turn to the selective 

silence point.  The reason why he doesn't have --
Mr. Salinas doesn't have the right that Mr. Berghuis had 
to cut off questioning.  That's the right that has to be 

1 
2 
3 
4
5
6
7
8 
9 
10
11  expressly invoked, and it, indeed, can only be 
12  effectuated in this setting. 
13
14  think, that his silence could be used against him.  The 
State never argued in the Berghuis case that, because he 
15
16  failed to answer for 2 hours, that shows he's guilty. 
17  What the State argued in Berghuis was the fact that he 
18  later confessed is what shows that he is guilty. 
19
20
21  you cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment? 
 MR. FISHER:  No.  You can. 
22
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean -- that's --
23
24  that's how I understood that. 
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is -- I don't want -- are 
you saying that, before the Miranda warning is required, 

 There was no issue in Berghuis, I don't 

MR. FISHER:  You can.  There's two 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

different rights --

Official 

that, but that's why I'm --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I know you're not arguing 

 MR. FISHER:  Let me separate two rights. 
One is the prophylactic right under Miranda to have 
police cease asking you questions.  That's one right, 
and that right has to be expressly invoked in some 
manner during the interrogation, after you've been 
warned, in order to effectuate it. 

1 
2
3 
4
5
6 
7 
8 
9 
There is a separate right, which is the 
10
11  genuine Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.  And 
12  this Court said, in Miranda itself and it's never 
13  questioned since, that that right doesn't have to be 
14  expressly invoked. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but it can be 
15
16  invoked, and that might make a big difference.  In 
17  your -- in your brief, you acknowledge that most 
18  citizens know they have a Fifth Amendment right. 
19
20
21
22  questions are somehow troublesome, you say, I'm invoking 
23  my Fifth Amendment right; go away, even if you're not in 
24  custody, even if Miranda doesn't apply. 
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so if there's -- if 

 MR. FISHER:  Right.  So, I think, Justice 

Kennedy --

MR. FISHER:  Right. 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And your client didn't do 

that here. 

 MR. FISHER:  He didn't.  And so the 

1
2 
3
question -- I think, unless the Court's prepared to hold 
4 
that even an expressed invocation could be used against 
5
him, then it reduces to the question you framed, Justice 
6 
Kennedy.  And so ask yourself whether there's any good 
7 
reason to require an express invocation in that setting. 
8 
 Mr. Salinas, remember, did expressly invoke 
9
his right to -- Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, 
10
11  at trial, in a timely manner, asking for the evidence to 
12  be excluded.  So the question is whether there's a 
13  reason to ask him to do it sooner.  And our argument is 
14  it's unnecessary, unfair, and a rule like that would be 
15
16  can. 
17
18  Solicitor General cites for an express invocation 
19  principle involve a scenario where the government has no 
20
21  information. 
 And, Justice Breyer, this is the limiting 
22
23  principle that you were searching for in the tax cases 
24  and the like.  If the government doesn't know or have 
25

good reason to know that the defendant who is silent is 

unadministrable.  So let me walk through those, if I

 It's unnecessary because all the cases the

 But, here, the government would do 

absolutely nothing different.  Police would have done 
absolutely nothing different.  Indeed, look at the 
record in this case.  What the Solicitor General says is 
that Mr. Salinas should have said, "I refuse to answer 

likely to be exercising his right, then the government 
needs to be put on notice because the government may --
may well challenge that, may well go seek a court order. 
It may well decide to grant immunity.  It may do a number 
of things.

11  that question," and, if he had said that, everything 
12  would be different. 
 But look at what the State argued at trial 
13
14  and what the officer testified.  The officer testified, 
15
16  The prosecution argued to the jury, he refused to answer 
17  that question.  So there is no ambiguity in the setting, 
18  whether he was remaining silent. 
19
20
21  trying to raise his Fifth Amendment right. 
22
23  situation, where either the individual expressly raises 
24  his right or, at the least, it's a fair implication from 
the circumstance that he was trying to assert his right, 
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, yes, there's no doubt 
he was remaining silent, but the issue is whether he was 

when we asked him that question, he wouldn't answer. 

 Now, suppose your rule were, whatever the 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It depends on the 

circumstance. 

 And, if so, how would your case stack up? 
 MR. FISHER:  Yeah.  I think, as long as the 

latter part of that test, Justice Breyer -- can be 
satisfied by exercising the right, that is remaining 
silent --

1 
2
3
4 
5
6 
7
8 
 MR. FISHER:  -- in a setting in which -- in 
9
a setting in which the government has every good reason 
10
11  to know that the person is most likely to be relying on 
12  the Fifth Amendment.  And, here, where they are 
13  investigating a murder and bringing in somebody as a 
14  suspect and asking him, basically, did you commit the 
crime, I think it's a fair assumption -- at least absent 
15
16  any clarification by the police -- remember, when he was 
17  silent, the police would have had every right to say, 
18  Mr. Salinas, why aren't you answering the question? 
 And so the police could clarify.  But, 
19
20
21  suspect, the more likely than not scenario -- and that's 
22  the test the Solicitor General agrees should be used --
23  the more likely than not conclusion there is that he is 
24  exercising the right.  Now --
25

absent any clarification from either the police or the 

would that be a sensible rule? 

Official 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How would you deal with 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Would that be silence, to you?  Would that 

be an invocation of his right not to incriminate 
himself?  Or would you -- would the prosecutor be barred 
from arguing to the jury, as often is done, he chose to 
say this, but not that, so this is a made-up story. 

entirely different.  But even --

another common situation where a defendant meets up with 
the police, gives a story, and then, later, changes the 
story.  And the question is asked at trial, you never 
volunteered that story to the -- to the police when they 
questioned you.

9 
10
 MR. FISHER:  No, Justice Sotomayor, for two 
11
12  reasons:  One is, if I understood your hypothetical, it 
13  sounded like the defendant may have been on the stand, 
14  and that would be an impeachment scenario that's 
15
16
17  come back and later do a different confession. 
 MR. FISHER:  Right.  So but -- but even if 
18
19  that were the case, then that would be basically using 
his statement against him.  And so a material omission 
20
21  from a statement is not the same as silence.  Here, 
22  Mr. Salinas was silent. 
 Now, it's also not just that there's no good 
23
24  reason to require some sort of magic words to be spoken 
by the suspect, but it's unfair.  Remember, the States 
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, sometimes, they 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 They're also going to have every good reason 

tell you, in their amicus brief, that, if you affirm in 
this case and adopt the rule they're asking you for, 
police officers are going to tell people in its custody, 
which would be nothing more than an accurate statement 
of the law, sir, if you are silent in response to any of 
our questions, the prosecution is going to argue that 
that -- that shows that you're guilty.

to bring people in.  I think this goes a little bit to 
9 
Justice Kennedy's question and -- and perhaps just yours 
10
11  as well, the fact that Mr. Salinas did agree to commence 
12  this interview.  Remember, he agreed --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, he's not in 
13
14  custody.  So let's say he's answering the questions. 
15
16  says, you know, it's getting late, I think I'm done, and 
17  going to go home.  Is that an invocation of the Fifth 
18  Amendment right? 
19
20
21  requiring an invocation.  And that is part of the 
22  administrability problem that the rule raises.  I have 
23  no idea of all the permutations, one of which you've 
24  raised --

All of a sudden, he gets a particular question, and he

So he was effectively told to come in, so 


that we can clear you as a suspect, asked perfectly 

innocuous questions at the beginning of the interview, 

and then everything shifted on a dime to this one 

"gotcha" question. 


And I think it's perfectly reasonable and 

just that -- yes, Mr. Salinas did come to the police 
station, but remember why he came to the police station, 
because they said, we want to bring you in to clear you 
as a suspect, to get elimination prints.

relevant distinction there, Justice Alito, as long as an

investigatory interview -- and this Court has said, time 
9 
and again, whether it's Berkemer in a traffic stop or 
10
11  plenty or Royer, that the police can try to initiate 
12  consensual encounters.  And the Court has said, time and 
13  again, that people don't have to participate in them, and 
14  they can cut them off at any time. 
And it would be odd --
15
 JUSTICE ALITO:  And what if -- what if the 
16
17  person -- what if the person was totally unknown to the 
18  police, but called up the police and said they want --
19  wants to talk to them for some purpose.  You

 JUSTICE ALITO:  He wants to talk to them, 
and then, in the course of this conversation, the same 
thing happens that happened here. 

MR. FISHER:  I think that might, depending 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're -- you're giving us 

on the precision of the hypothetical, be a little bit of 
a difficult -- different case.  But, if the person said, 
I want to talk to you about criminal activity, started 
giving statements about a -- about a past crime, so it 
was an investigatory interview, I think it may well

12
13  Miranda, not Miranda, custody, not custody, gray area. 
14  That -- that's what you're arguing.  You want a gray 
15
16
17  opinion.  Remember, Justice Kennedy, at least the 
18  Solicitor General -- and I'll let the State speak for 
19  itself -- but the Solicitor General agrees that Griffin 
20
 I -- I totally understand there's a bright 
21
22  line between custody and noncustody, and so a custodial 
23  suspect is in a different situation than a noncustodial 
24  suspect. 
25

But all I'm saying is, again, in agreement 

area opinion to be written? 

 MR. FISHER:  No, I don't want a gray area

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm assuming, now 
that I'm thinking about your argument, you would argue 
that, even in a custodial setting, a prosecutor couldn't 
say, I asked him, did he shoot his wife, and the 

with the Solicitor General, whereas all we disagree on 
is whether the magic words need to be spoken, that a 
person who is at least in a police investigatory 
setting, and so the police would reasonably expect that 
a failure to seek or answer your question was relying 
on a Fifth Amendment --

14  said already in Footnote 37 in Miranda, what the lower 
15
16  don't think my opponents are even arguing to the 
17  contrary. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, in fact, at most 
18
19  trials, district court judges tell juries the evidence 
is not the unanswered question.  It's the question plus 
20
21  the answer. 
 MR. FISHER:  Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  I 
22
23  think that's perfectly well-established law.  And so the 
24  reason is, is there any reason to distinguish for 
25

 MR. FISHER:  That's precisely what the Court 

courts have depended on for a generation now, and I 

purposes of the Griffin rule -- I understand there's 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company

reasons to distinguish in the -- in the settings that 
Berghuis raises, but, for purposes of the Griffin rule, 
is there any reason to distinguish between a custodial 
and a noncustodial setting? 

1 
2 
3 
4 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Yes.  The answer 
5
is going to be yes because we're going to hear it in 
6 
one minute because, as you say, it follows a fortiori 
7 
for Berghuis, you know, it's -- if you're going to have 
8 
to make an explicit statement to invoke your Fifth 
9 
Amendment right, when you're not in an inherently 
10
11  coercive setting, I mean, that's going to be the 
12  argument. 
13
14
coercive setting, as you are in the Miranda situation, 
15
16  you're not at trial, and, outside those two situations, 
17  you have to say explicitly, I'm invoking the Fifth 
18  Amendment --

because, there, we have a line.  It's called the 

in-custody line.  Once you get outside of custody --

MR. FISHER:  But it's not because of the 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 
 MR. FISHER:  If Mr. Salinas had been in a --

if everything about the case was identical, but he'd 
been in custody, there would be no argument that his 

silence could be used against him.

11  physical or inherent pressures of custody because what 
12  the Court has said, time and again, is that, after 
13  somebody receives their Miranda warnings, they have a 
14  free and deliberate choice whether to talk.  And so --
15
16  the government's argument for them.  They'll make it 
17  very well. 
18
19  want to make sure that the Court understands the 
20
21  requirement that this Court established in Berghuis and 
22  what I'm asking for today. 
 And the express invocation requirement in 
23
24  Berghuis is the -- is -- is to administer the Miranda 
prophylactic rule, that the police have to stop asking

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I don't want to make 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, no, but I do want -- I do 

critical difference between the express invocation

somebody questions when they invoke their rights, the 

rights they've just been advised of, remember. 


 It didn't hold in Berghuis and it -- and 


it's never held that, if somebody is Mirandized -- and 

let's say Mr. Berghuis was Mirandized and just remained 
silent for two hours, and then the police said to 
themselves, oh, this guy is never going to talk, we end 
the interview, there would have been no argument the 
State could have made in that case, that his silence 
could be used against him.

12  know, I'm -- that custody is different, but, in terms of 
13  the express invocation requirement, there's no express 
14  invocation requirement in custody, and there's no reason 
15
16
17  will be, I think -- it is, at least in my mind, that if, 
18  after sitting there for 45 minutes -- or maybe it was an 
19  hour and 45 minutes -- without saying anything, I'm --
20
21  he answers -- doesn't answer over that long period of 
22  time, but doesn't say, I want to remain silent, if that 
23  long period of behavior is insufficient without the 
24  express statement to show that he wanted to remain 
silent, so, outside custodial setting, should it be

I'm maybe taking a dissenting position, but, if -- when

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Isn't the -- isn't the 


point, Mr. Fisher --


insufficient to simply remain silent to show that -- you 
see, it's argument by analogy, I think --

 MR. FISHER:  I understand, but his silence 

wasn't able to be used against him in Berghuis; his 
state -- his later statements were.  And so, yes, you 

could have a scenario --

 MR. FISHER:  Pardon?

11  insufficient for?  In Berghuis, it was insufficient for 
12  the purpose of cutting off police questions. 
13
14
15
16  insufficient for the purpose of allowing his -- his 
17  silence to be used against him at trial. 
18

23  knows -- if there's one thing the layperson knows and 
24  most every American knows, is that they have a right to

 MR. FISHER:  Precisely. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's an entirely different 

 MR. FISHER:  Exactly. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's not the case here. 

The question here is whether it's sufficient or 

question, isn't it? 

 MR. FISHER:  That's exactly my point.  And 

remain silent.  So somebody nervous in this setting, 

26

Official 

without a lawyer, the one sanctuary they have is simply 
not to talk. 

 If you issue an opinion that says, as the 

Solicitor General would like, you have to pronounce some 
sort of magic words, it's terribly unfair and terribly 

misleading and, again, for no good reason.  And it 

raises all kinds of administrability problems.  The 

Court is going to have an absolute, I think, flood of 

cases of all the permutations of somebody under 

different kind of police warnings or the other that may 

1

11  be given ahead of time and different kind of verbal 
12  formulations. 
13
14  something else.  Maybe he says, as the Chief Justice 
explained, I'm going to leave now.  Maybe he actually 
15
16  just doesn't show up for the interview.  There is 
17  innumerable permutations.  The easy rule --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Unless you're going to argue 
18
19  that -- that silence cannot be -- can never be commented 
on in any noncustodial situation -- and I didn't think 
20
21  you were willing to go that far when I was questioning 
22  you previously -- you're going to have the same kind of 
23  line-drawing questions, aren't you? 
24
25

 MR. FISHER:  No. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Where was it held?  What was 

 Maybe he says, I'd like to talk about

 All the other settings, whether they be tax 

the nature?  Who initiated it?  Was the person really 
under suspicion?  What was the purpose of the -- of the 
questioning? 

 MR. FISHER:  So as to where -- as to where 
you draw the line, if I understand your question, as to 
where an express invocation before trial would be 
required, you are going to have to draw a line.  I think 
it's very easy to draw the line and just say a police 
investigatory interview because that's the setting where 
the police have every reason to believe that silence is 

1

11  an exercise of the right. 
12
13  settings, whether they be immigration cases, all the 
14  totally disparate settings the Solicitor General cites 
15
16  advance invocation there. 
 But, remember, the Court said in Chavez that 
17
18  the Fifth Amendment is a trial right, and so invoking it 
19  at trial is perfectly timely in the ordinary setting. 
The only question is whether you should have some sort 
20
21  of special requirement for special reason.  We think 
22  there is no good reason, and it would be very unfair.

guilt in that situation would be lessened than it is in 
this case because there is no -- there is nothing to 
suggest that that defendant was guilty, necessarily, 
because he decided not to show up to the police. 

But, here, in this situation, the 

defendant's failure to answer the question, accompanied 
by the other things that he did, did reveal a guilty 
conscience on his part.  And it was nothing to reflect 
that he was trying --

13  her, we are investigating this crime, help us.  They 
14  start asking questions, and it's clear from the first 
question -- there is a waiver of Miranda, and, from the

16  first question, the first question is, did you kill this

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But isn't the most 

logical inference from the silence not that he isn't 
quick enough to come up with an exculpatory answer, but 
that it would incriminate him if he answered? 

 MR. CURRY:  Yes, Your Honor.  That may be --

that may be a permissible inference, but I do not 
believe that that necessarily means that he was invoking 
his -- his Fifth Amendment right because he did continue 
to talk.  He already knew what the police were

15
16  being interrogated, who is savvy, will say, "I plead the 
17  Fifth."  And somebody who is not that smart is just 
18  silent.  To make a difference between those two people 
19  on whether comment can be made on the failure to respond 
20
 MR. CURRY:  Your Honor, I think that would 
21
22  be consistent with this Court's jurisprudence to -- to 
23  allow the use of evidence, if there was no invocation 
24  involved.  In Jenkins v. Anderson, Justice Stevens

recognized the importance of an invocation, even in --

Official 

 This Court -- it's not just Berghuis v. 


 And I know that we don't have a case that is 

Thompkins that we're relying upon, where the Court has 

recognized the necessity of an invocation.  Garner v. 

United States says the same thing, that -- that an 
invocation is necessary for Fifth Amendment rights. 

1 
2

4

6 
7
squarely on -- on four with this one.  But all the 
8 
defendant would have to say is, I don't want to talk 
9 
anymore, or I don't want to answer that question, and 
10
11  then we would be in a completely different posture at 
12  this point. 
 But, here, the -- the defendant failed to 
13
14  answer a question and did other things that revealed a 
guilty conscience on his part.  And that is precisely 
15
16  the type of evidence that we believe that we can 
17  introduce. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Curry, in a case 
18
19  like Berghuis, which is in a custodial setting, if the 
20
21  through the entire interview and, really, never said a 
22  word, so that the police kept asking him questions, but 
23  he never said anything, the prosecutors could then not 
24  go in and say, look, for 3 hours, we asked him 
25

defendant there had not ever said anything, had gone 

questions, and he didn't talk. 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 That would be off limits.  And the question 

 MR. CURRY:  Well, number one, because the 

hypotheticals are different.  In -- in our particular 

situation, the defendant did answer questions and only 

did -- you know, fail to answer one particular question. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  I -- I understand 

is, if that's off limits, why shouldn't this be off 
limits as well?  If there's no invocation necessary 
there, for some of the reasons that Justice Ginsburg was 
saying, why should there be an invocation requirement 

here?

14  let's take that out of the picture, all right?  And just 
15
16  questions, all right?  So then the question is, why 
17  would that case be any different from the case that I 
18  posited? 
19
Thompkins, this Court looked at the ambiguous nature of 
20
21  whether or not the invocation had occurred.  If, in your 
22  hypothetical, the defendant failed to answer any 
23  questions whatsoever --
24
25

say -- you know, he just didn't want to answer 

 MR. CURRY:  Okay.  In -- in Berghuis v.

just didn't answer.

your argument really, on the fact that he did a lot of 

answering.

 MR. CURRY:  That's one of the reasons, Your 

 MR. CURRY:  But it could be a suggestion 

where he was attempting to exercise the -- the right 

because he never answered anything.  But, in our 

situation, the defendant can't be said to have been 

doing that.  He can't be said to have been exercising 

the right because he failed to answer a question, but 

answered several other questions.

18  necessarily asserting his Fifth Amendment right, whether 
19  to cut off questioning or stop talking altogether,

21
22  that your argument is, look, you can't just like keep 
23  talking and talking and talking and -- and, at that 
24  point, you have to invoke?  If -- if you've been doing a 
lot of talking and then decide you want to stay silent,

 MR. CURRY:  No.  I think you need to invoke 
in every -- every noncustodial encounter if -- if you do 
not want the things that you say to be utilized against 
you.  If you -- if you want to -- you know, if you want 
to be prevented from that evidence being utilized, you

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Curry, Berghuis is 

different for a different reason.  Berghuis is different 
because the question in Berghuis is what do you have to 
do to make the police go away.  Here, the police were 
not going away.  There was no -- there's no question of

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS, 
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

These people knew that they were looking for a shotgun. 
They now have a shotgun that they got from the 
defendant.  So this defendant was not -- you know, all 
of a sudden, sprung on him the idea that they 
were -- you know, looking for him as a possible suspect

13  please the Court: 
 In Minnesota v. Murphy, this Court applied 
14
the general rule that the Fifth Amendment privilege is 
15
16  not self-executing and that a suspect must invoke it in 
17  order to claim its protection to a noncustodial 
18  interview in which the -- the probation officer doing 
19  the questioning was aware that the questions that she 
20
21
22  suspect had not invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, his 
23  statements could be used against him as evidence at 
24  trial.  A suspect's silence should similarly be 
25

asked could be incriminating. 

 The Court there held that because the 

admissible against him when he fails to expressly invoke 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

the privilege.  Requiring invocation --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That is such a radical 

 But this is radically different.  We are --
we are -- you're trying to say acts of commission and 

position, that silence is an admission of guilt.  That's 
really what the argument is.  I certainly understand 
that speaking can implicate you, and, if you choose to 
speak, clearly, whatever you say can be used against 
you, unless you're in custody and unless you've invoked 
the right before.

14  saying you're adopting their statement as true. 
15
16  repeatedly recognized that, when a citizen is 
17  voluntarily interacting with the police and there --
18  there is no coercion because it's not a custodial 
19  situation, we expect that person to be treated as fully 
capable of deciding whether or not to assert his rights. 
20
 This is what the Court said in United States 
21
22  v. Drayton in an analogous context, which is whether 
23  someone has voluntarily consented to a search.  The 
24  person, even if he is not told that -- that he can 
25

refuse to -- to consent, we still assume that he knew 

MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think the Court has 

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

that he could refuse to consent, and, therefore, it was 
a voluntary choice. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Anders --
 MS. ANDERS:  And so when the person does not 

 And I think you can draw the same inference 
here, that, when someone -- we -- I think we all agree 
that most people know -- people know what their Fifth 
Amendment rights are, and, therefore, they can assert 
them when they don't face any coercive pressure.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  We don't require 
11
12  invocation at trial, and we don't require invocation in 
13  a custodial setting.  And you might think, well, 
14  custodial, that's very different because, after all, 
15
16  point of Miranda warnings, is that, once we give Miranda 
17  warnings, that coercion is dispelled and the custodial 
18  setting, essentially, becomes like a noncustodial 
19  setting. 
20
21  after Miranda warnings are given in a custodial setting, 
22  why should we require invocation here? 
 MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think the reason that 
23
24  we don't require invocation in the Miranda setting, I 
think, highlights the fundamental difference between

custodial is inherently coercive, but that's the whole

warnings, and then that's gone. 


 MS. ANDERS:  Exactly.  That's why we give 


the warnings.  And, in the warnings, we promise the 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but then --

 MS. ANDERS:  -- and, therefore --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- you're given the 


custodial interrogation and noncustodial interrogation. 
So, in the custodial setting, the Court has said 
that -- that the suspect faces inherent coercive 
pressures to confess --

1

3 
4

7
8

10
11  suspect that his silence will not be used against him. 
12  And so this is what the Court said in Doyle v. Ohio, 
13  that, because of that promise, the suspect does not have 
14  to expressly invoked, and his silence can't be used 
15
16
17  that the suspect knows his rights, and, because he is 
18  not facing any pressure, he can simply say, I don't want 
19  to answer that question.  And so when he doesn't say 
20
21
22  your brief that there might be a whole other -- many 
23  other reasons for remaining silent, and I -- I suggested 
24  that the -- in -- in this kind of scenario, the most 
25

likely reason that the suspect will clam up is that he 

against him. 

 But, in the voluntary situation, we presume 

that --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You've -- you've said in 

51
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 But I think, when you're looking at a -- a 

 MS. ANDERS:  That's right.  The -- the 

Griffin rule says -- or it's premised on the idea that, 
when you fail to testify at trial, you're inherently 

unrelated to the Fifth Amendment, why a defendant might 
remain silent?  I mean, the Griffin rule is he doesn't 
have to say, I plead the Fifth, because we assume that, 
when he doesn't take the stand, he is doing so because 
he doesn't want to incriminate himself.

13  noncustodial interrogation, the question whether the 
14  person is trying to exercise his Fifth Amendment right, 
I think the operative question is not whether he wants 
15
16  to avoid inculpating himself, it's whether he wants to 
17  refuse to answer as a matter of right. 
18
19  look at the interview as a whole, presumably, his 
20
21  That's why his statement -- his statements can be used 
22  against him at trial because those statements we --
23  we've -- the Court held in Minnesota v. Murphy, those 
24  statements are inconsistent with a desire to refuse to 
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Does it?  What do you

conceding the -- the point that they make?  I -- that --
that even if in the custodial setting he waives his 
Miranda right, he answers 500 questions, but doesn't 
answer one of the 500, that the prosecutor cannot

14  split shows that it raises a different analytical 
15
16  The circuit split is that some courts say, as I 
17  understand it, that, even after the person waives his 
18  Miranda rights, Doyle still applies, and so you can't 
19  use his silence against him.

21  he has waived his Miranda rights, he is essentially in

 MS. ANDERS:  I -- I think we think that the 
better view is that Doyle probably does not apply, but I 
think there is a serious question there.  And I think 
the Court doesn't have to resolve it here because, 
again, that highlights a distinction between custodial 
and noncustodial interrogation, that, once the suspect 
has been promised, that --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  What -- what does that mean? 

Does he just -- how about if he just says, you know, I 

 Well, I think the standard is whether the --

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, I -- I think the

there's no Miranda warning and no custody. 

 MS. ANDERS:  Right.  So like this case,

don't really want to answer that question? 

Official 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Okay.  But -- but I don't 

 MS. ANDERS:  I think, if he expresses the 
desire not to answer the question, that is sufficient 
because he is saying, I'm not going to answer that, and, 
implicitly, he has a right not to do that.  I think the 
20 questions hypothetical that Justice Kennedy proposed, 
probably that would not be sufficient by -- by analogy 
to Thompkins, where the suspect sat silent for two 
hours.

11  think you -- you were going to tell me this great deal 
12  of conduct, what silence could mean other than, I fear

14
15
16  states that silence can reflect that are both probative 
17  of guilt and not consistent with the desire to refuse to 
18  answer the question as a matter of right.  So, for 
19  instance, the suspect could want to answer the question, 
20
21
22  just going to sit silent for a bit, to see what else the 
23  prosecution -- or, I'm sorry -- the police say, in order 
24  to spin it out, see what they know.  He could be 
25

dismayed or shocked, momentarily, because the question 

but have trouble coming up with an exculpatory answer. 

 He could strategically decide that he is 

 MS. ANDERS:  Absolutely.  I think -- I think 

there are several types -- there are several mental

reveals that the police have more evidence than he 
thought they did. 

 So I think, in all of those situations, 

those -- those mental states are not consistent with the 
desire to invoke the privilege, and that's why 

Petitioner's rule is, essentially, a prophylactic rule 

that would protect a great deal of conduct that has 

nothing to do with the desire to exercise the Fifth 

Amendment right.

11  example of that, where you have a -- a suspect who 
12  speaks for -- you know, several minutes -- you know, 
13  half an hour, whatever, and he's answering questions in 
14  an exculpatory manner.  He's suddenly silent in response 
to one question, and so I think the inference that could 
15
16  be drawn there is that he was surprised by the question 
17  and didn't know how to answer it in the most exculpatory 
18  manner. 
19
20
21  one thing, and then it turns out that the interview was 
22  something else.  He realizes, it dawns on him, that the 
23  police really do see him as a suspect.  And he says to 
24  himself, I better stop answering, right? 
25

you know, he thinks that the interview is going to be

I think -- you know, this case is a good

questions already, but -- but, now, he's -- you know, I 
don't want to answer any more questions.  Is that an 
invocation? 

 MS. ANDERS:  I think that would be 

sufficient, yes, to say, I don't want to answer any more 
questions.  And I think --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Or, if he says, I don't want 
to answer questions about a particular topic; is that an 
invocation?

10
11  sufficient to invoke with respect to questions on that

13  important to have a clear rule here because invocation 
14  does affect --
15
16  clear rule.  I mean -- you know, as -- as between -- you 
17  know, I don't want to answer those questions on a 
18  particular topic, I don't want to answer that question, 
19  or just like could we go on to a different question 
20
 MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think it's -- it's an 
21
22  objective standard, and it's the same formulation that 
23  the Court has already adopted in Berghuis and in 
24  Thompkins and in Davis.  So, in the Miranda context, the 
25

Court has already faced this problem, how do we know 

MS. ANDERS:  I think that would be 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That doesn't sound like a

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, I -- I think there are a 

when the defendant has invoked his rights and what 
should the standard be? 

 And it has said that it is an objective 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's not administrable 
about telling the police you just can't argue to a jury 
that merely not asking a question is guilt?  What --

standard, it's what's reasonably perceived as an 
invocation, and so -- you know, the lower courts are 
very used to applying that.  I think it's very 
administrable because --

11  what lacks administrable?

whether you want a broad, prophylactic rule that will 
15
16  protect a great deal of conduct that -- that has nothing 
17  to do with the exercise of the right.

 First, Justice Breyer, your question about 
the state of the law, with respect to question number 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. FISHER:  Thank you.  I'd like to make 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 The Solicitor General, when they speak about 
a circuit split with relation to Doyle, they're talking 
about impeachment cases.  Remember, Doyle and Jenkins, 
which are the cases the State cited to you in response 
to your question are impeachment cases that are entirely 

432, In our reply brief, at page 4, we cite cases that 

are all Fifth Amendment cases, and Canterbury, also, 

which is a Tenth Circuit case cited elsewhere in our 

brief, uniformly holding that the Fifth Amendment 

applies.

13  transcript this afternoon, but I believe both the State 
14  and the Solicitor General said to you, today, if 
15
16  question, then he would win, then Griffin would apply. 
17  But, because it was somehow ambiguous, that it 
18  shouldn't, that is ridiculous.  If you look at the 
19  transcript in this case, what did the officer testify 
when he said -- he asked him the question, he said he 
20
21  did not answer. 
22
23  closing?  Verbatim of what the State is telling you 
24  today is all Mr. Salinas had to say.  At closing, the

 What did the prosecutor argue to the jury in 

 Second, if I -- we can look at the

State said, the police officer testified that he

Alderson Reporting Company

wouldn't answer that question.  He didn't want to answer 
that. 

 So the whole principle behind express 

invocation jurisprudence is to put the State and the 
police on fair notice that somebody is exercising the 
right to remain silent.  There was zero ambiguity in 
this case that was going on.

 So it explains why the rule that the State 
8
and the Solicitor General have fallen back on in court 
9 
today is formalism of the absolute worst kind, and the 
10
11  only thing that this formal requirement of saying some 
12  sort of magic words -- and I agree with Justice Kagan, I 
13  don't know what they are -- but whatever they are, 
14  what -- exactly what the State argued to the jury 
apparently would have been enough, is just nothing more 
15
16  than a trap for the unwary, who is told, through culture 
17  and learning, that he has a right to remain silent. 
18
19  with his right, which is exercising it, and, somehow, 
the State is telling you that it can walk into court and 
20
21  say, because he remains silent, he's guilty of a crime; 
22  jury, you should conclude he's guilty of a crime. 
23
24  State, well, what about an officer that tells the 
25

defendant, as he will have every incentive to do, in 

 And he does the one thing that is consistent 

 And, Justice Sotomayor, when you asked the

 So wouldn't the defendant know the law? 

Don't we assume that the suspect knows the law?  And the 

 So, really, what we're asking today is 

South Carolina v. Neville, in a roughly comparable 
situation, that law enforcement actually admitted they 
were already doing it, but the States tell you they'll 
do it here, when the officer says, if you don't answer, 
we're going to use that against you, the State said that 
would be coercion.  But the officer would be doing 
nothing more than stating the rule the Court is asking 
you to announce today.

11  State's telling you, well, if the officer tells the

13
14  nothing radical.  It's nothing of a departure of our 
deepest traditions, which require the government to 
15
16  shoulder the load itself, to prove the case itself, and 
17  not to enlist the defendant as an instrument in his own 
18  demise. 
19
20
21  created for out-of-court questioning by law enforcement 
22  authorities, that people who remain silent could not 
23  have that used against them at trial. 
24
25

 And, finally, I hope the -- the confusion 
with respect to the Berghuis, as related to this case, 

 People's silence -- it is the time-honored 

concept of the Fifth Amendment, which, remember, was 

61
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Somebody not in custody doesn't have a right 

to have questioning cut off, so the police could have 
kept asking him questions.  That's the only right that a 
custodial suspect has and needs to expressly invoke. 
The right to remain silent is not something that's ever 

has been dispelled.  I think Justice Kagan got it 

exactly right.  But, remember, another way to make it 

clear is that, if Mr. Salinas had said, in response to 

the question, I'd like for you to stop asking me 

questions, the police wouldn't have had to honor that.

silence demonstrated his guilt.
