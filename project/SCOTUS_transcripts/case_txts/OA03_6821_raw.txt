 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. STEVENSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


9  please the Court:


10

 6 days before petitioner's scheduled execution


11  in this case, an execution that he had sought and


12  informally requested be -- be carried out as soon as


13  possible, prison officials went to him and for the first


14  time told him that to deal with a medical problem that


15  both parties acknowledged exists, he would be subjected to


16  a procedure that would be conducted by State officials,


17  not necessarily medically trained, not necessarily


18  licensed, where they were going to make a 2-inch incision


19  in his arm, cut through fat and tissue and muscle, until


20  they had a vein that they could access for the purposes of


21  inserting a catheter. 


22

 QUESTION:  Well, presumably at a much earlier


23  date, the prisoner did know that he -- he was -- he would


24  be scheduled to be executed by lethal injection.


25

 MR. STEVENSON:  Absolutely, Your -- Your Honor. 


3


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  And he did know his veins were


2  compromised.


3

4

 MR. STEVENSON:  Absolutely, and as soon as he -­


 QUESTION:  So -- so presumably in -- well in


5  advance he could anticipate a problem. 


6

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, Your Honor, and he did.  He


7  immediately began contacting the warden at Holman Prison. 


8  He was housed in another facility some 200 miles away.  He


9  immediately began contacting the warden at Holman Prison,


10  who had just been installed, who did not know him, and


11  informed him he had this condition, that they would need


12  to create protocols necessary to deal with it. 


13

 The State admitted that they had never dealt


14  with someone in this condition before and began offering


15  all kinds of things that would accomplish this execution. 


16  Let him bring in a physician that can insert a catheter. 


17  Let's get some protocols established so that we don't have


18  any problems.  And for 6 weeks essentially this effort was


19  being made. 


20

 He had been previously told that they were going


21  to do this 24 hours in advance, that they weren't going to


22  make this kind of 2-inch incision, and even though he


23  hadn't been assured there would be medical people, he was


24  relatively comfortable with that.  He did not file suit. 


25  It's only 6 days before for the first time that the State


4


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  announced they would have this kind of invasive procedure


2  carried out by someone who was not necessarily medically


3  trained. 


4

 He filed a 1983 action.  I think it's important


5  for this Court's judgment here today.  The district court


6  found that that 1983 action, if it went in Mr. Nelson's


7  favor, would not invalidate his judgment or conviction. 


8  Notwithstanding that conclusion, the district court felt


9  compelled to apply a rule in force in the Eleventh Circuit


10  that effectively shields death row prisoners facing an


11  execution from doing anything that can challenge


12  unconstitutional conditions of -- of confinement.


13

 The Eleventh Circuit rule is essentially once


14  you are scheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter that


15  the prison begins to do something and amount to something


16  that -- that is unconstitutional. 


17

 QUESTION:  Well, they're -- they're not saying


18  that.  They can bring actions that -- that challenge


19  unconstitutional conditions of confinement.  He's being


20  kept in a dank and dark cell that's -- that's cruel and


21  painful.  The only thing they're saying he can't bring is


22  -- is an action that, in effect, says I can't be executed


23  the way the State intends to execute me, that that has to


24  have been brought up earlier.


25

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, and -- and I -- I guess


5


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that's our -­

2

 QUESTION:  It has -- has to be under habeas 

3  rather than under 1983. 

4

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  And Your Honor, I -- I 

5  guess our position is -- is that this action is like the 

6  action that you describe.  He is challenging medical 

7  treatment, medical procedures.  He doesn't say he doesn't 

8  want to be executed.  He's not trying to block his 

9  execution. 

10

 QUESTION:  Well, but it's unlike these other 

11  actions in this one crucial respect:  its effect is to 

12  prevent the execution. 

13

 MR. STEVENSON:  No.  I think the effect here was 

14  to facilitate the execution.  Mr. Nelson went into court 

15  saying, let's just get an order so that my doctor can come 

16  in and carry this out.  Let's just get a temporary 

17  restraining order on this 2-inch incision which makes no 

18  sense.  The -- the court -- the district court judge says, 

19  can't you lawyers work this out?  Mr. Nelson's counsel was 

20  ready then and there to effectuate a procedure that would 

21  carry out this execution. 

22

 And the Eleventh Circuit judgment, Justice 

23  Scalia, is actually one that says once the petitioner is 

24  scheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter whether it's 

25  a conditions of confinement suit as you described, that 

6


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the Federal courts somehow have no authority to grant 

2  relief or conduct review because the execution -- the 

3  scheduling of the execution somehow divests those courts 

4  of jurisdiction.  That's the Eleventh Circuit rule. 

5

 They didn't argue here that because his 

6  litigation, because his lawsuit is, in effect, an attempt 

7  to bar the execution, he loses.  That's the distinction. 

8

 What they said here is that because he is 

9  already scheduled for execution, it doesn't matter what 

10  the conditions of the confinement are, whether it 

11  invalidates the conviction and sentence.  Federal courts 

12  have no authority to grant relief.  And that's the rule we 

13  urge this Court to overturn. 

14

15

16

 QUESTION:  May -- may I get clear on one thing? 

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, sir. 

 QUESTION:  Did he -- did his counsel say to the 

17  court, the district court, we want under 1983 an order 

18  that says admit this man's doctor to the place of 

19  execution at the time the State chooses so he can find a 

20  way then and there to allow the State to carry out the 

21  execution when it wants to do it?  Did he ask for that? 

22

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, what he asked for -- what 

23  -- what he -- what he put in his complaint was that he had 

24  made that offer to the State, and that was in his 

25  complaint, that -- that the defendant's counsel had 

7


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  authorized or requested the opportunity to bring in a 

2  physician to facilitate a review -­

3

 QUESTION:  Is that what he was asking for when 

4  he went into court? 

5

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, what he was asking for is 

6  an injunction barring them from doing this kind of 2-inch 

7  incision, but yes, he made it very clear in the 

8  complaint -­

9

 QUESTION:  Was it made clear to the district 

10  court that he would be satisfied with the order I have 

11  just described? 

12

 MR. STEVENSON:  Only to the extent -- yes, I 

13  believe so, Your Honor, because when the district court 

14  said, can't you work this out, Mr. Nelson's counsel said, 

15  yes, I think we can. 

16

 QUESTION:  Did -- did he ask for a postponement 

17  of the execution? 

18

 MR. STEVENSON:  He did, Your Honor.  He did, and 

19  that was in part because the State was, at least at the 

20  point at which this lawsuit was filed in, saying that this 

21  is what they were going to do in -- in the absence of some 

22  kind of Federal intervention. 

23

 QUESTION:  What would have been the terms of the 

24  postponement that you were asking for? 

25

 MR. STEVENSON:  I -- I think the district court 

8


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  could have basically issued a cease and desist order.  You


2  are enjoined from doing this kind of conduct because it


3  violates contemporary standards of medical decency.


4

 QUESTION:  Would it have been sufficient to say,


5  don't -- postpone it until you admit the doctor to be


6  present and get the catheter in?


7

 MR. STEVENSON:  I -- I think it could have been


8  sufficient to say I'm going to order that his physician be


9  admitted into the facility.  I'm going to order that you


10  accomplish this through the method proposed by


11  petitioner's counsel.  I think all of those things could


12  have been done, but the district court here felt like he


13  did not have the authority to actually deal with this in


14  the 1983 context.


15

 QUESTION:  Was it that -- before, Mr. Stevenson,


16  you said that nothing that the prisoner requests, once the


17  date of execution is set, is actionable in 1983.  But I


18  thought that the Eleventh Circuit made a distinction


19  between a proceeding that would require a stay of the


20  execution.  If he says that prior to the execution I'm in


21  -- in a dark, dank cell, that would be actionable so long


22  as he's not seeking to postpone the date of the execution,


23  as I understand it.


24

 MR. STEVENSON:  And I guess here, Your Honor,


25  what we think is that when the prison waits until 6 days


9


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  before the scheduled execution -- a complaint can only be 

2  filed 3 days before the scheduled execution -- a 

3  determination of whether what the prison is proposing is 

4  unconstitutional or not cannot ordinarily -­

5

 QUESTION:  He -- he didn't -- he didn't know 

6  before that that -- that this was -­

7

8

9  use? 

 MR. STEVENSON:  No, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  -- the procedure they were going to 

10

 MR. STEVENSON:  No, Your -- he had been told 

11  before that they were going to do something 24 hours in 

12  advance.  It was only on the Friday before the Thursday -­

13

 QUESTION:  When they're going to do it is not 

14  the issue.  It's what they're going to do. 

15

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, yes, that's -- he was told 

16  for the first time on that Friday, 2-inch incision in the 

17  arm, not necessarily done by someone medically trained. 

18  That presented a very different kind of -­

19

 QUESTION:  But he -- he knew that -- that 

20  something special had to be done with respect to him 

21  because he had these compromised veins.  Didn't he? 

22

 MR. STEVENSON:  Absolutely.  And -- and the 

23  record reflects that there were repeated efforts on the 

24  part of Mr. Nelson's counsel to get the State to -- to 

25  deal with it. 

10


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  How -- how long ago was the 

2  conviction for which he was condemned to -- to death? 

3

 MR. STEVENSON:  The conviction was 1978.  The 

4  death sentence is 1994.  He spent a lot of years on death 

5  row under an illegal death sentence that the Eleventh 

6  Circuit overturned in 1993. 

7

8

 QUESTION:  The crime was committed when? 

 MR. STEVENSON:  In 1978.  The death sentenced 

9  imposed here was committed in 1994, and it's worth noting 

10  that even then Mr. Nelson was very, very sort of unsure 

11  about fighting a death sentence.  He told the judge he 

12  wanted a death sentence.  No appeal briefs were filed into 

13  the Alabama appellate courts.  The -­

14

 QUESTION:  Did -- did you at any point shape 

15  your claim for relief in the alternative, saying we want 

16  either habeas corpus or 1983?  Or do we take this case on 

17  the assumption that almost everybody agrees it has to be 

18  1983? 

19

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, no, it was not styled as a 

20  habeas action, in part because the Eleventh Circuit rules 

21  would have prevented us from ever getting review in this 

22  Court or any other court if it had been framed in that 

23  way. 

24

 QUESTION:  Is that -- is that correct?  If -- if 

25  we had to do this in a circuit with no precedents, could 

11


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  you argue that this would be -- could be habeas?  It's not 

2  successive because it's -- the issue hasn't come up 

3  before? 

4

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, yes.  There -- there 

5  certainly -- it's certainly true that other circuits, 

6  Justice Kennedy, apply this Court's doctrine in Stewart v. 

7  Martinez where a claim, an execution claim, not previously 

8  ripe, can be subject to habeas review.  The Eleventh 

9  Circuit doesn't.  Their position expressed in In re Medina 

10  is that if it wasn't in your first habeas, it can't be 

11  presented. 

12

 QUESTION:  Well, what does the statute say?  It 

13  says it has to be not only not previously ripe -- you 

14  didn't have the information -- but also the statute says 

15  it has to show that he was innocent. 

16

17

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  And that's why we -- we -­

 QUESTION:  So why isn't that conclusive here?  I 

18  mean, it -- it doesn't meet the second condition. 

19

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, absolutely.  It's -- it's 

20  certainly conclusive, Justice Scalia.  It could not be -­

21

 QUESTION:  Well, of course, that's assuming it's 

22  successive. 

23

 MR. STEVENSON:  That's right.  That's right.  It 

24  certainly would not be a successive petition.  What we 

25  would be arguing is what this Court has already held, that 

12


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  an unripe execution claim of this sort, of a competency to


2  be executed claim, which this Court held in Stewart was


3  cognizable would be proper.  In the Eleventh Circuit


4  that's not possible. 


5

 QUESTION:  But you don't have to go that far, do


6  you? 


7

8

 MR. STEVENSON:  We do not.  We do not. 


 QUESTION:  Because ripeness could be a merely


9  evidentiary matter, whereas in this case, you did not have


10  a claim that you could bring -­

11

12

 MR. STEVENSON:  Absolutely. 

 QUESTION:  -- at the time.  So this is more than 

13  just ripeness. 

14

 MR. STEVENSON:  Absolutely.  And -- and, Justice 

15  Souter, I think you're absolutely right.  Here, where


16  you're not trying to do something that invalidates a


17  conviction and sentence, it's not arguably appropriate to


18  be thinking about this in the habeas context.


19

 2241(c) says that to grant habeas relief, the


20  petitioner has to allege that the conviction and sentence


21  is illegal, is in violation of the Constitution.  That's


22  not Mr. Nelson's contention here. 


23

 QUESTION:  Would you say -- would you be making


24  the same argument if his complaint was not this inch cut


25  but the combination of chemicals?


13


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. STEVENSON:  No, Your Honor.  I think that's 

2  a much -- a much harder question because that does, it 

3  seems to me, get closer to the execution.  What's 

4  analogous to our claim is a claim where the prison says a 

5  week before the execution that we're going to and 

6  effectively shackle you to a hitching post and not give 

7  you any food for 72 hours.  We contend that that kind of 

8  treatment would be in violation of the Constitution.  What 

9  we'd be trying to block is that treatment, not the 

10  execution.  The reality is in this case -­

11

 QUESTION:  Well, I mean, you know, as you know, 

12  we've -- we've turned down certiorari in -- in these cases 

13  challenging the type of drug used.  What -- what is the 

14  difference between, you know, your using a drug that's -­

15  that's going to hurt me and your using a catheter 

16  procedure that's going to hurt me?  I don't -­

17

 MR. STEVENSON:  I think the primary difference, 

18  Justice Scalia, is that those are a method of execution 

19  cases.  They are challenging the method of execution. 

20  Here we have a procedure that is not even unique to 

21  executions. 

22

23

24

 QUESTION:  Well, but -­

 MR. STEVENSON:  Venous access can -­

 QUESTION:  -- they're -- they're not challenging 

25  the method of execution.  If you want to execute me by 

14


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  drugs, they're saying, that's perfectly fine, just don't


2  use a drug that hurts me.


3

4

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, it's -- it's -­


 QUESTION:  And just as here, you're saying if


5  you want to execute me by lethal injection, that's fine,


6  just don't use a manner of lethal injection that hurts me. 


7  I find it very difficult to separate the two -­


8

9

10

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, I guess -­


 QUESTION:  -- categories of case.


 MR. STEVENSON:  It's not clear, Your Honor, that


11  in all of those cases that they are saying if you want to


12  use a different drug, that's okay.  I think that that's


13  one distinction. 


14

 I think the second distinction is that an order


15  -- particularly in States that have statutes dictating


16  which chemicals can be used, in those cases it may be


17  easier for a court to find that an order in that case does


18  invalidate the sentence. 


19

 Here we have a completely severable procedure. 


20  We have something that is not in any way required by the


21  execution.  And -- and the State is saying we want to do


22  it this way, and there are 100 other ways that it can be


23  done.  And in fact, it's just the discretionary conduct of


24  the State prison officials that puts us in this situation.


25

 QUESTION:  Well, was it -- was it any more than


15


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the presence of his own doctor to make the cut that he -­


2  he was asking for?


3

 MR. STEVENSON:  No, Your Honor, and it wasn't


4  even -- he wasn't even insisting on that.  He was prepared


5  to have their doctor come in.  He was promised a doctor


6  when he got to the prison.  He never saw one.  There was


7  never a physical -- never a doctor to examine him.


8

 QUESTION:  Well, but this isn't a contract


9  action.


10

 MR. STEVENSON:  No, no, Your Honor.  I'm just


11  suggesting that there was -- he wasn't insisting on this


12  being carried out in one way.  There were dozens of -- of


13  offers of -- of carrying this out, including being


14  executed by electrocution, something else that the State


15  rejected as -- as an option for him. 


16

 QUESTION:  But he did -- he did want more than a


17  doctor.  He didn't want this procedure to be used when


18  there was an alternate procedure that would be safer, less


19  painful?


20

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  It's our position that


21  this procedure is unconstitutional.  It does not comport


22  with contemporary standards of medical decency.  It's a


23  procedure that is rarely done.  When it's done in the


24  hospital, it's under deep sedation.  That there are all of


25  these alternative procedures that could be done very


16


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  easily.  A percutaneous insertion would be very easy to


2  accomplish.  There are a lot -­


3

4

 QUESTION:  Doesn't that require a cut as well?


 MR. STEVENSON:  No, ma'am.  It -- it would just


5  require a -- a needle, a hollow needle, with a wire


6  inside.  And -- and they would then access the vein that


7  way.  It wouldn't require the kind of incision and all of


8  the kind of auxiliary support systems. 


9

 QUESTION:  But that sounds to me more like the


10  mode of execution with the -- with the drugs that you said


11  was distinguishable.


12

 MR. STEVENSON:  No.  They wouldn't effectuate


13  the injection that way.  They would just actually get


14  access to the vein that way.  And -- and this could be


15  done, Your Honor, 24 hours in advance.  It could be done


16  some time in advance.  There was no objection expressed by


17  Mr. Nelson in any of the lower courts to that procedure.


18

 But again, all of these issues we never got to


19  in the district court.  There was never any opportunity to


20  develop facts, to have discussion, to have argument to


21  resolve a basic problem. 


22

 QUESTION:  If a challenge is brought to the use


23  of lethal injection as a method of execution, how must


24  that be brought?  In habeas?


25

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  My position, Justice

1  O'Connor, would be if I'm representing someone, I would


2  put that in a habeas mostly because that's -- there is


3  some historical precedent for those kinds of challenges


4  coming in habeas.  I think you are, in effect, saying that


5  the sentence is invalid.  It -- it should not be carried


6  out.


7

 QUESTION:  This comes close because you say it's


8  unconstitutional to proceed with lethal injection under


9  these circumstances. 


10

 MR. STEVENSON:  No.  We tried really hard to not


11  say that.  What we say, it is unconstitutional to proceed


12  with venous access in this manner, to conduct medical care


13  in this manner.  It violates recognized standards of


14  medical care.  And that's what we're saying you cannot do. 


15  We have no objection.  Mr. Nelson doesn't object to lethal


16  injection.  He doesn't even object to venous access.  What


17  he objects to is some kind of inhumane cutting by people


18  who are not qualified or competent to do that. 


19

 And like any other condition of confinement, the


20  fact that he is near an execution, the fact that he has


21  been scheduled for an execution shouldn't exempt him from


22  protection if the State at the last minute announces that


23  this is what they intend to do.  This has not historically


24  been a big problem.  There have been over 700 executions


25  in this country involving lethal injections.

 QUESTION:  What is -- as a lawyer who works in


2  this area, what do you think is the correct procedure that


3  should be followed in respect to Ford mental incompetence


4  claims or general challenges to a whole big method of


5  execution not just this individual one which arise for the


6  first time after termination of a first habeas?


7

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, Justice Breyer, I -- I


8  think you're right.  There is a problem.  We do have a gap


9  in the law in that the Congress did not contemplate the


10  possibility of execution claims that arise just as you


11  describe. 


12

 In the competency context, this Court created a


13  rule, which I think is a very functional rule.  I think it


14  is a very appropriate rule.  If the facts supporting that


15  claim were not ripe previously, I think that -- and it's a


16  legitimate execution-related claim, I think the petitioner


17  should be able to get access in front of the district


18  court judge that reviewed his initial habeas petition.  I


19  think that's the way we should deal -­


20

 QUESTION:  Yes, that may be.  So what's the


21  procedural route?  That's why I'm curious.


22

23

24

25

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes. 


 QUESTION:  This fits into a bigger picture.


 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, yes.


 QUESTION:  And I'd like to be clear about the


19


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  bigger picture -­


2

3

4

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  The big -­


 QUESTION:  -- in your opinion. 


 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  The bigger picture in my


5  judgment, Your Honor, would be it would be filed as a


6  habeas petition in front of that district court judge


7  relying on this Court's -­


8

 QUESTION:  And -- and you say that it would be


9  -- count as a first habeas.


10

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, it would be part of the


11  first habeas.  It would -­


12

 QUESTION:  Well, what the -- what the response


13  to that is it's very hard to reconcile that with the


14  language of the statute.


15

16

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, what the -­


 QUESTION:  And -- and also they add that the


17  right route is to file an initial habeas here or,


18  alternatively, to go to the State court, at least if


19  that's still open.


20

21

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes.  And -­


 QUESTION:  In which case it raises no


22  constitutional question about blocking habeas because we


23  could review the State court.  I'd just like briefly your


24  views on that kind of an argument. 


25

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, sir.  Well, in Stewart,


20


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  what this Court did was resolve it by saying, no, Congress


2  did not intend to preclude petitioners with legitimate


3  execution claims from getting that.  This Court has


4  created those protections.  I think -­


5

 QUESTION:  Was there -- was there anything open


6  to this petitioner in the State for an application for


7  relief here?


8

 MR. STEVENSON:  No, Justice O'Connor,


9  unfortunately not.  In Alabama you cannot present a second


10  post-conviction petition even on claims that -- that turn


11  on new evidence.  On execution claims, on new evidence


12  claims, you have no remedy.  And consequently, we would


13  need access to the Federal courts to protect Mr. Nelson


14  from the kind of claim that we're presenting here or even


15  in the kind of claims that Justice Breyer is suggesting.


16

 And that's why we do think there is a problem. 


17  It's not presented precisely in this case.  There is a


18  problem with the way in which there are these execution


19  claims.  If some State says tomorrow, we're going to


20  change our method and from here on out, we're going to


21  stone people to death or beat them to death with baseball


22  bats, and this Court believes that that is


23  unconstitutional, in a place like Alabama, to the extent


24  that -- that the Court construes that as an execution


25  claim -- and that's the only way they could carry out the


21


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  execution, so it might be said that that would invalidate 

2  the conviction and sentence -- we would need a rule.  We 

3  would need to find some way to get access to courts, and 

4  we currently don't have it. 

5

6

 Here --

 QUESTION:  Your -- your claim here is an Eighth 

7  Amendment claim, cruel and unusual punishment. 

8

9

10

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, sir. 

 QUESTION:  Right? 

 But -- but you say it just doesn't comport with 

11  what?  The -- the most advanced medical procedures? 

12

13

 MR. STEVENSON:  No, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION:  Anything that does not comport with 

14  the most advanced medical procedures is cruel and unusual 

15  punishment? 

16

17

18

19

 MR. STEVENSON:  That --

 QUESTION:  I mean, you know -­

 MR. STEVENSON:  No, I hear you.  I hear you. 

 QUESTION:  -- this man is -- is looking death in 

20  the face. 

21

22

 MR. STEVENSON:  Sure. 

 QUESTION:  And -- and the crime was committed 

23  over a quarter of a century ago for which he was -- he was 

24  condemned.  And -- and what he's really concerned about is 

25  -- is an incision?  I find it difficult to contemplate 

22


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that this constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.


2

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, Your Honor, it's not our


3  position that he is seeking and -- and demanding the most


4  advanced procedures.  What I think he is objecting to is


5  something that we regard as fairly barbaric, to have a


6  correctional staff member come back with a scalpel, make a


7  2-inch cut in his arm, cut through fat and tissue to get


8  to a vein with no assurances that that person knows what


9  they're doing, violates the basic standards of medical


10  decency. 


11

 And it's not just a cruel and unusual


12  punishment.  This Court has created a line of cases under


13  Estelle v. Gamble that talk about deliberate indifference


14  to serious medical needs.  This is a medical care case. 


15  Yes, he's in prison.  Yes, he's on death row.  Yes, he's


16  forfeited some of his basic expectations, but he hasn't


17  given them all away.  He's still entitled to be treated


18  with some regard. 


19

 QUESTION:  You're saying it's -- it's not the


20  Eighth Amendment.  You're saying it's a medical care case.


21

 MR. STEVENSON:  No.  It's -- it's both.  We -­


22  the complaint raises both the cruel and unusual theory and


23  a deliberate indifference theory.  Both are alleged in the


24  complaint. 


25

 QUESTION:  It just doesn't fit under deliberate


23


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  indifference somehow.  It's a little bit like the case


2  that the court of appeals decided that you couldn't use a


3  lethal injection because it hadn't been approved by the


4  FDA. 


5

 MR. STEVENSON:  I -- I agree, Mr. Chief Justice. 


6  I think it -- it fits more in the cruel and unusual


7  category because it seems so pointless to be doing it in


8  this way.  However, for all of this time, there -- there


9  was no protocol.  There was no response.  There was no, in


10  effect, effort by the State to deal with this problem and


11  that's why we -- we made that allegation of deliberate


12  indifference as well.  And the district court could make a


13  determination that says, no, following this case -- this


14  line of cases, we -- we can't make that determination.


15

 But here, we never got to any of this.  We


16  didn't basically have an opportunity -­


17

 QUESTION:  But your deliberate indifference


18  claim is also an Eighth Amendment claim, isn't it?


19

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, sir.  Yes, yes, yes. 


20  That's correct.  And so we're still dealing with this -­


21  the Eighth Amendment universe. 


22

 But again, the district court was precluded from


23  getting to any of this.  If the State wants to come in and


24  say, we think this is silly, we think it is not


25  appropriate for the Constitution to create these kinds of


24


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  protections for these kinds of prisoners, the district


2  court can make a finding that says, I agree.  What


3  happened here, however, was the district court was


4  precluded from ever even engaging in discussion about this


5  issue because of this rule that, in effect, blocks people


6  on death row facing execution and enforcing basic


7  constitutional protections.  And that's what we think is


8  objectionable. 


9

 There are several hundred executions that have


10  taken place, 733, lethal injections that have taken place,


11  where this has not been a problem.  This is an -- an


12  unusual medical problem.  It's not a medical problem that


13  usually presents itself, but it presented itself for the


14  first time in Alabama.  It's only come up a few times. 


15  But we do think there ought to be some constitutional


16  protection.


17

 QUESTION:  When -- when did Alabama switch from


18  electrocution to lethal injections?


19

 MR. STEVENSON:  That happened in July of 2002,


20  after Mr. Nelson had already completed his Federal habeas


21  procedure. 


22

 QUESTION:  And before that, electrocution was


23  the only option?


24

25

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, sir. 


 Unless there are further questions from the


25


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Stevenson.


 Mr. Newsom, we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


 MR. NEWSOM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


7  please the Court:


8

9

 I'd like to make three points this morning.


 I'd like to first discuss and to convince the


10  Court that a challenge to a State's means of gaining


11  venous access for purposes of accomplishing a lethal


12  injection, a challenge that runs to the very core of the


13  execution process, is indeed tantamount to a challenge of


14  the imposition of the sentence itself and subject to


15  habeas corpus restrictions.


16

 I hope also to -- to be able to address the


17  remedies issue, which we were discussing with Mr.


18  Stevenson at the end of -- of his argument. 


19

 And third, I'd like to discuss the practical


20  consequences of a decision in Nelson's favor in this case,


21  which I think will be not only to unleash in Federal


22  courts a torrent of -- of new challenges to all manner of


23  State execution procedures, but also in the process,


24  fundamentally to undermine Congress' intent to stem the


25  tide of what President Clinton in his signing statement


26


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  called endless death row appeals. 

2

 QUESTION:  On the -- on your first point, are 

3  you going to address directly whether this is second or 

4  successive? 

5

 MR. NEWSOM:  I can certainly address that, Your 

6  Honor, and I can address it now, if you'd like. 

7

8

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. NEWSOM:  We simply cannot agree with -- with 

9  -- with Mr. Stevenson's contention here that this is 

10  second or successive, and I would like to point out to the 

11  Court that I -- that I think -­

12

13

 QUESTION:  He says it's not. 

 MR. NEWSOM:  I'm sorry.  That -- that is not 

14  second or successive.  I'd like to point out to the Court 

15  that I think in fact there is a concession on the record 

16  in this case that it, in fact, is second or successive. 

17  Mr. Stevenson, of course, has -- has given the Court 

18  essentially a two-page footnote in his brief trying to 

19  walk away from -­

20

21

 QUESTION:  You mean if it's treated as habeas. 

 MR. NEWSOM:  Correct.  Our -- correct.  Our 

22  position, of course, is that this -- that this sort of 

23  challenge is fundamentally a habeas challenge, and in 

24  answer to Justice Souter's question, I think that there is 

25  a concession on the record.  Of course, this -- this 

27


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  issue, the second or successive issue, was not raised in


2  the lower courts.  It was raised for the first time in -­


3

 QUESTION:  Well, it wasn't raised because he


4  brought 1983.  But, I mean, as I understand the -- the


5  application of the Alabama rule, 1983 was ruled out


6  because this either should have been brought in habeas or


7  if it had been brought in habeas, it would have been


8  barred under AEDPA, and it would have been barred under


9  AEDPA, because it was second or successive.  So I think


10  regardless of -- of how we analyze it, we've got to get to


11  that point.


12

 MR. NEWSOM:  And our position certainly is, Your


13  Honor, that this would have been barred as second or


14  successive.  I think Justice Scalia really hit the nail on


15  the head.  It is -- Mr. Stevenson, in his argument, just


16  has not done business, I think, with the textual and


17  structural gymnastics required to -- to make this petition


18  anything other than second or successive.  His position,


19  in essence, is that any claim that is new, in the sense


20  that it could not have been brought before, is by


21  definition not second or successive.


22

 QUESTION:  Well, isn't that a possibility?  In


23  other words, one of the things we've got to do is -- is


24  give effect to the -- to the AEDPA text.  We can give


25  effect to the -- I'm not saying that we should read it


28


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  this way, but we could give effect to the AEDPA text if we


2  say that regardless of whether a claim was ripe or not as


3  a factual matter, so long as there is new evidence,


4  whatever new means, the evidence is -- is not going to


5  entitle him to relief unless it satisfies the -- the


6  innocence prong at the end of the test.  We could say that


7  and at the same time say, all right, that's how we give


8  effect to AEDPA. 


9

 But if there is something more than ripeness,


10  which makes the difference between bringing the claim and


11  not bringing the claim, then that goes to whether we


12  should regard it as second or successive.  There is


13  something more here because this is a claim which simply


14  did not arise.  He could not have pleaded this claim at


15  any point prior to the conclusion of -- of his habeas, and


16  for that reason, we should interpret second or successive


17  as not barring this because otherwise we would have a


18  universe of claims, assuming they are proper habeas


19  claims, that could never be brought even though they state


20  a constitutional claim.


21

 MR. NEWSOM:  My own sense, Justice Souter, is


22  that that might just be slicing the bologna a little thin. 


23  Congress -- the -- the point of section 2244 in my view is


24  certainly to get at claims that, for whatever reason,


25  could not have been brought earlier, and I think the -­


29


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  But that's -- that's fine, but I


2  mean, that's a conclusory statement:  for whatever reason. 


3  What I'm suggesting to you is that this is a good reason


4  to say that the term, second or successive, does have some


5  limiting effect. 


6

 MR. NEWSOM:  Perhaps, but I think that we are


7  coming awfully close simply to -- to reading the


8  limitations that Congress imposed on these sorts of


9  petitions out of the statute. 


10

 QUESTION:  If Congress felt that way, they


11  simply wouldn't have added the second condition.


12

 MR. NEWSOM:  That's certainly the position


13  that -­


14

 QUESTION:  They would have just said the facts


15  -- the factual predicate for the claim could not have been


16  discovered previously through the exercise of due


17  diligence.  That describes a situation in which there's no


18  way that the person could have brought the constitutional


19  claim. 


20

21

 MR. NEWSOM:  That's precisely -­


 QUESTION:  But Congress didn't leave it there. 


22  It went on to add (ii), the facts underlying the claim


23  would -- would show that the applicant is not guilty of


24  the underlying offense. 


25

 MR. NEWSOM:  Which is exactly the point that I'm


30


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  trying to make about stripping out the limitations.  In


2  section 2244 -­


3

 QUESTION:  Except that to -- in order to make


4  that point, you have to assume that Congress was adverting


5  to this problem, and you have to assume that the words,


6  second and successive, could -- could simply have been -­


7  or the word subsequent could have been inserted in place


8  of second or successive, which in fact is -- is a set of


9  phrases that -- that are terms of art.


10

11

 MR. NEWSOM:  Well -­


 QUESTION:  So I think -- I think the argument is


12  a stretch.


13

 MR. NEWSOM:  It -- it -- I -- I think it is not


14  the case, Your Honor, that -- that second or successive is


15  a term of art in the sense that -- that AEDPA in section


16  2244 merely incorporates the old abuse of the writ


17  doctrine as -- as this Court made -­


18

 QUESTION:  It doesn't necessarily incorporate


19  the old abuse of the writ doctrine, but it seems to me


20  that it does allude to a body of law by which we made -­


21  because there was no other law involved, we had to draw


22  conclusions as to whether it was appropriate or not


23  appropriate to bar this claim.  That's the kind of art


24  that those words plug into.  If they did want to plug into


25  that, all they had to use was a neutral word like


31

 MR. NEWSOM:  Again, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I 

3  feel like clearly I'm not convincing you, but I think that

5  awfully -­

 QUESTION:  Convince the others. 

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. NEWSOM:  -- that the Court -- the Court is

 MR. NEWSOM:  I -- I -­


 QUESTION:  And Congress rejects that by adding


4  to it a new -- a new number (ii).

 MR. NEWSOM:  Precisely.


 QUESTION:  So it's impossible to say that it was

 MR. NEWSOM:  Which is precisely the point we

10

 QUESTION:  Well, so can it be brought as a 1983


11  action?


12

 MR. NEWSOM:  I don't think it can, Your Honor,


13  and -- and I --


14

15

 QUESTION:  And why not?


 MR. NEWSOM:  -- I hope I can convince why it


16  can't.  I'd like to start by addressing that position with


17  Mr. Stevenson's concession here this morning that he has


18  reiterated, that the chemical composition claim indeed is


19  subject to habeas corpus restrictions.  Of course, he


20  seeks to distinguish his own claim from the chemical


21  composition claim on the basis, he says, that his claim


22  does not challenge the sentence itself, but merely a


23  separate and unnecessary procedure.  But the procedure he


24  challenges is a procedure for gaining venous access.  It


25  goes without -­


33


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  Well, there are other ways to do


2  it -­


3

4

 MR. NEWSOM:  Well -­


 QUESTION:  -- is his point.  And it is a little


5  curious that the State isn't willing to talk to the


6  prisoner's counsel about considering one of the other ways


7  of doing it.  Why is that?


8

 MR. NEWSOM:  Well, let me just -- if I could


9  answer in two parts.


10

 First, I think frankly that -- that on the


11  record in this case, he's just not right about that.  The


12  record at pages 91 and 93 of the joint appendix makes


13  clear that the specific procedure that he has challenged


14  here, this cut-down procedure, will be used only as a last


15  resort in the event that other means of gaining venous


16  access -­


17

 QUESTION:  Well, does that mean that -- what is


18  the description of the other?  The -­


19

 MR. NEWSOM:  The percutaneous central line


20  placement. 


21

 QUESTION:  Percutaneous.  Is that something the


22  State is prepared to use first?


23

 MR. NEWSOM:  By all means.  And that's part of


24  the irony of this case.

 QUESTION:  And you make that assurance to us

1  today.


2

 MR. NEWSOM:  Oh, absolutely.  And -- and in


3  fact, the -- the affidavits that we filed make that


4  assurance. 


5

6

 QUESTION:  That will be attempted. 


 MR. NEWSOM:  Yes.  And -- and let me just be


7  clear that -- that the State, of course, has outlined a


8  three-step process in this case.  Steps one and two are a


9  central line placement in the femoral vein and a central


10  line placement in the jugular vein in the neck.  Both of


11  those, in essence, are percutaneous central line


12  placements.  So the parties are in agreement here that the


13  first two procedures attempted should, in fact, be


14  percutaneous central line placement. 


15

 This cut-down procedure comes into play only in


16  the event that those two procedures fail and as a last


17  resort must be used to accomplish the sentence.


18

19

 QUESTION:  Are you sure, Mr. Newsom -­


 QUESTION:  Mr. Newsom, can I ask you a -- a


20  hypothetical question?  Because -- assume there's merit on


21  the -- to the -- assume -- assume you have a case in which


22  a week before the election -- the execution the State


23  tells the inmate that they're going to hang him up by his


24  thumbs and beat him with whips until he dies.  And he


25  never expected that.  What is his remedy in the -- in your


35


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  circuit and in Alabama for trying to stop that? 


2

 MR. NEWSOM:  Well, the important point here -­


3  and I -­


4

5

 QUESTION:  If -- if any.  Is there a remedy?


 MR. NEWSOM:  Sure, absolutely.  And I can't


6  agree, of course, with Mr. Stevenson's description of


7  Alabama law.  I think that there very clearly are remedies


8  in the State courts, and his argument essentially asks the


9  -- this Court to ignore those -- the entire State system. 


10

11

 With respect to two of the remedies -­


 QUESTION:  What would the remedy be in Alabama? 


12  It would be a habeas corpus proceeding? 


13

 MR. NEWSOM:  Well, he is, of course -- I -- I


14  should just be careful about how I answer this question. 


15  There is an Alabama procedure called a rule 32 petition


16  which is -- is, in effect, a -- a State habeas petition to


17  challenge things like this.  And his -- his position in


18  his reply brief is that -- that a rule 32 petition would


19  have been time barred.  That may be true now, but it was


20  not true as of the time that he filed this petition.


21

 QUESTION:  Well, let's assume he -- assume he's


22  denied relief in the Alabama courts.  What can he do?  Can


23  he get into Federal court?


24

25

 MR. NEWSOM:  May I just -­


 QUESTION:  And if so, how?

1

 MR. NEWSOM:  May -- may I continue with the 

2  Alabama courts just on a minute because that's not -­

3  that's not -- I'm not done with the Alabama courts, in 

4  essence.  I mean, there -- there are other remedies that 

5  we've outlined in --

6

 QUESTION:  But you -- you said if this happened 

7  today, that rule 32 procedure would not be available. 

8

 MR. NEWSOM:  I think very arguably.  It comes 

9  down frankly to how you -- at -- at what point that the 

10  statute of limitations begins to run.  Our position, of 

11  course -­

12

 QUESTION:  The law wasn't changed.  You just say 

13  more time has gone by, that -- that he could have brought 

14  a rule 32 at the time, but he can't now because more time 

15  has gone by.  Is that your point? 

16

 MR. NEWSOM:  Rule 32 statute of limitations is a 

17  -- is a 6-month statute of limitations that begins running 

18  at the time new -- a new factual predicate is discovered. 

19

20

 QUESTION:  I see. 

 MR. NEWSOM:  That -- that -- if -- if the 

21  statute began to ran -- began -- began to run, as -- as we 

22  would say, on August 19th of 2003, when the record at 

23  pages 25 and 26 of the joint appendix makes plain that he 

24  knew that a cut-down was a possibility as a means of 

25  gaining access to his veins, then yes, that statute has 

37


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  expired. 


2

 If, as Mr. Stevenson has pointed out to the


3  Court today, that statute began to ran not -- began to run


4  -- why do I keep saying that -- began to run on October


5  3rd of 2003, then the truth is he has 4 or 5 more days to


6  file that rule 32 petition. 


7

 But I want to get to the other remedies, if I


8  can.


9

10

 QUESTION:  Can he -- can he get a stay?


 QUESTION:  Well, I'm not really so much


11  interested in the State remedy.  I assume that an Alabama


12  judge says it was a terrible crime, he deserves that


13  punishment.  And now what does he -- can he get into


14  Federal court?


15

16

17

 MR. NEWSOM:  He can get into -­


 QUESTION:  And if so, how?


 MR. NEWSOM:  He can -- of course, by all means. 


18  This Court retains the discretion, as it always does, to


19  grant in an extraordinary circumstance an original writ of


20  habeas corpus.  And I -­


21

 QUESTION:  You mean he should apply for an


22  original writ in this Court?  That's his remedy?


23

24

 MR. NEWSOM:  Well, not -­


 QUESTION:  If -- if that's not the remedy, is


25  there a remedy in the district court in Alabama?


38


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. NEWSOM:  There is not I think a remedy in


2  lower Federal courts.  But I should just emphasize that


3  this Court has -- has discussed a case very similar to


4  this and dealt with a case very similar to this in Allen


5  v. McCurry where the Court refused to indulge -­


6

 QUESTION:  Well now, if there is no remedy in


7  the Federal district court, why should there not be a 1983


8  remedy?


9

 MR. NEWSOM:  Well, because our -- our position,


10  Your Honor, is that 1983 is not intended to be used to


11  fill the gaps in the remedial scheme that Congress has


12  specifically set up in the habeas statutes, that instead


13  section 1983 deals with different kinds of claims.


14

15

 QUESTION:  Do you think AEDPA amended 1983?


 MR. NEWSOM:  No.  But the point is, of course,


16  AEDPA does not have, in effect, an integration clause in


17  it that -- that precludes review of all -- under all other


18  statutory sources of review.  But this Court's decision -­


19

 QUESTION:  If AEDPA had never been passed, would


20  there be a remedy under 1983?


21

 MR. NEWSOM:  No.  I think then it -- then it


22  clearly -- it's a -- it's a habeas petition however you -­


23  however you view it, and -- and our -­


24

 QUESTION:  If the only thing -- say it's a


25  person who's not on death row who's going to be subjected


39


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  to this kind of treatment for 6 days.  Would he have a


2  remedy under 1983? 


3

 MR. NEWSOM:  To be sure.  And that I think is a


4  -- is a categorical distinction.  I don't disagree with


5  Mr. Stevenson that -- that a -- that a cut-down occurring


6  for purposes of venous access, wholly divorced from an


7  execution, is indeed a valid conditions of confinement


8  claim. 


9

 But this simply is not a conditions of


10  confinement case.  This is, to be sure, a procedure of -­


11  the means of gaining venous access for the purposes of -­


12  of carrying out a lethal injection.  Venous access, of


13  course, is a necessary predicate, as Nelson has


14  acknowledged in his briefing in this case, to -- to the -­


15

 QUESTION:  You were going to -- you were going


16  to tell us that, you know, the sky is going to fall if we


17  find that this is 1983. 


18

 MR. NEWSOM:  I think it will fall pretty hard,


19  Justice Kennedy.  I think that if -- if this Court


20  concludes that -- that Nelson in this case can -- can


21  challenge this -- this cut-down as a means of gaining


22  venous access, then the -- the lower courts will be


23  inundated with -- with challenges to all manner of State


24  execution procedures just as this Court was inundated with


25  challenges following -­

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  Well, there are a lot of ways to deal


2  with that.  One, you could say on the merits, if they're


3  not valid, they're not valid.


4

5

 MR. NEWSOM:  That's -­


 QUESTION:  If they are valid, why shouldn't they


6  be able to make it?


7

 MR. NEWSOM:  Well, that certainly is one way of


8  -- of dealing with the problem, Your Honor, but -­


9

10

11

12

 QUESTION:  Or there's the equitable problem -­


 QUESTION:  How long do the appeals take?


 MR. NEWSOM:  I'm sorry. 


 QUESTION:  The district court says it's not


13  valid.  Get out of here.  Then there's appeal to the court


14  of appeals and then certiorari here.  How long does it


15  take?


16

 QUESTION:  And suppose in a case where there is


17  whips and so forth, he happens, by the way, actually to


18  have a valid claim because they're going to be tortured. 


19  All right.  Now, you're saying there's no remedy for such


20  a person. 


21

22

 MR. NEWSOM:  In answer -­


 QUESTION:  And indeed, the reason there's no


23  remedy is because the courts are unable to use their


24  normal rules to prevent abuse of process.


25

 MR. NEWSOM:  Let me try to answer these various


41


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  questions in order, if I can keep up. 


2

 With respect to your first question, I think


3  that to be sure, there is -- the -- the district court can


4  always reject the claim, but the problem is that when


5  these claims come in at the last minute and the complaint


6  is chock full of -- of inflammatory language, then the


7  district courts I think in -- in many cases will feel


8  virtually coerced into granting the stay.  And the stay


9  itself is -- is an imposition or an impediment to the


10  State's imposition of the sentence. 


11

 QUESTION:  But there's nothing in the language. 


12  I mean, as I read the language of 1983, it says there will


13  be an action, if I'm subject to the deprivation of a right


14  secured by the Constitution, which is what his claim is. 


15  So it fits within the language. 


16

17

 MR. NEWSOM:  To be sure.


 QUESTION:  And there's nothing in the habeas


18  statute that suggests it fits because habeas is when


19  you're challenging a custody in violation of the


20  Constitution.  So the habeas language doesn't apply and


21  1983 does apply. 


22

 And there's nothing in Preiser that suggests it


23  fits because that's where in fact we're talking about a


24  challenge to fact or duration, and he's not challenging


25  the fact and he's not challenging the duration.


42


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 And there's nothing in Heck v. Humphrey because


2  it talks about necessarily implying the invalidity of the


3  conviction or sentence, and he's not talking about the


4  conviction and he's not talking about the sentence that


5  was given in the judgment anyway. 


6

 All right.  So how is it we get this claim which


7  risks people who might have a valid claim not getting into


8  court -­


9

10

 MR. NEWSOM:  Okay.  Now -­


 QUESTION:  -- into the language of any prior


11  case or the statute itself?


12

 MR. NEWSOM:  Bear with me.  Section 1983, to be


13  sure, does not exclude this claim as a matter of its text,


14  but this Court in Preiser did make clear that -- that


15  where a -- where an action falls within the traditional


16  scope of habeas corpus, that section 1983 must give way. 


17  When there is that intersection, section 1983 must give


18  way. 


19

 Now, in answer to part two of the question, to


20  be sure, the habeas corpus -- the -- the specific language


21  of the habeas corpus statute talks in terms of custody,


22  but for more than 100 years, this Court has dealt with


23  challenges to death sentences in habeas corpus petitions. 


24  And indeed, in Your Honor's opinion for the Court in


25  Lonchar, this Court said that -- that -­


43


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

2

 QUESTION:  You're right about that.


 MR. NEWSOM:  Bear with me.  Citing Gomez and -­


3  and reiterated that habeas restrictions apply to suits


4  challenging the method of execution regardless of the


5  technical form of action.


6

 QUESTION:  Gomez was 10 years and a claim that


7  could have been brought much earlier.  As was just


8  explained to us, this claim could not have been brought


9  until 6 days before the scheduled date of execution


10  because it was only at that point that he -- that he knew


11  about this.  So I don't think that Gomez -­


12

 But I did want to ask you something you said


13  that seemed to me inconsistent with what -- what Mr.


14  Stevenson told us.  You said that it was only the -- they


15  -- they agreed on what would be the first steps and that


16  incorporated the percutaneous.  I thought we were told by


17  Mr. Stevenson that, no, everybody agreed on what the first


18  procedure would be, but you then went immediately to the


19  cut-down and they didn't.  There was an intermediate step


20  that you don't have in your protocol that they said would


21  have been more respectful of this man's right to have a


22  painless death.


23

 MR. NEWSOM:  I think that's just not quite


24  right.  Percutaneous central line placement simply means


25  central line placement through the skin.


44


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 QUESTION:  But was there -- whatever labels you


2  use, was there something else that they asked for that you


3  were not willing to give?


4

 MR. NEWSOM:  They -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I


5  didn't mean to -­


6

 QUESTION:  Yes.  I thought I understood from the


7  briefs that there was the first step.  Everybody agreed if


8  could do it that way, it would be okay.  And then there


9  was something else that the defendant said should have


10  been done before you would ever get to the cut-down, and


11  if you got to the cut-down, certainly you'd want to have


12  proper medical personnel there to administer it.


13

 MR. NEWSOM:  The point that I'm trying to make


14  is that -- that in fact those first two -- what the -­


15  what the plaintiffs asked for in this case was indeed


16  percutaneous central line placement.  That's the label not


17  that I'm giving it but that they gave it.  That's the


18  procedure that they wanted, and now I'm trying to tell the


19  Court that -- that percutaneous central line placement is


20  a central line placement through the skin which options


21  one and two, central line placement in the thigh, central


22  line placement in the neck, are indeed both percutaneous


23  central line placement.  So, no, there is -- I think there


24  is no disagreement here that percutaneous central line


25  placement is the preferred method and will, in fact, be


45


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  used, a cut-down to be used only if actually necessary.


2

 QUESTION:  I'll ask Mr. Stevenson to clarify


3  that.


4

5

 MR. NEWSOM:  Fair enough. 


 And if I can, just in answer to the -- to the


6  first question that you were asking me, my -- the point


7  that I was making about Gomez at this point in the


8  argument is not necessarily, although I'd like to make


9  this point as well, if I have time, an abuse point so


10  much.  We certainly recognize that the abuse at issue in


11  Gomez is in some sense more -- more egregious than the


12  abuse here.  The point I was simply trying to make in


13  answer -- in answer to Justice Breyer's question was that


14  this Court in Lonchar pointed to Gomez for the proposition


15  that habeas rules apply to method of execution claims


16  without respect to what label is placed at the top of the


17  pleading.


18

 QUESTION:  It wasn't an issue in that case, was


19  it?  I was simply describing what happened.  I mean, it


20  was true -­


21

22

 MR. NEWSOM:  Accurately describes.


 QUESTION:  -- in that case it was -- yes,


23  accurately described it.  Nobody challenged it.  So I


24  wouldn't think that's terrifically strong precedent for


25  the proposition that that is what should have happened.


46

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. NEWSOM:  Well, I think -- I think it is


2  fairly clear, Your Honor, from Gomez and Lonchar, read


3  together, that method of execution -­


4

 QUESTION:  But is there anything other than -­


5  other than -- Lonchar, which is describing the posture of


6  the case as it appeared here on a different issue?


7

 QUESTION:  I thought we had a lot of cases that


8  -- that say you can bring habeas to challenge not only -­


9

 QUESTION:  That's what I want to know.  I want


10  to know which are the ones -­


11

12

 QUESTION:  Let's go one at a time.  Go ahead. 


 QUESTION:  I thought that it -- it was our law


13  that -- that you can bring a habeas action to show that


14  you are not guilty of the sentence, which always seemed to


15  me a very strange formulation, but it's -- it's been done


16  in a lot of cases. 


17

 MR. NEWSOM:  I think it is unquestionably


18  correct, Justice Scalia, that this Court has held that


19  habeas is an appropriate vehicle for a method of execution


20  claim or otherwise.  And my point in answer to Justice


21  Breyer is I think that this Court's decisions in Gomez and


22  Lonchar, read together, make -- come pretty close to


23  saying that it is the appropriate -- the appropriate


24  vehicle for challenging a method -­


25

 QUESTION:  So those are the two cases which you


47


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  feel are the strongest support for you.


2

 MR. NEWSOM:  The strongest support I think, yes,


3  for the -- for the fact that a -- that a habeas -- that


4  habeas is -- is the appropriate vehicle for a method of


5  execution claim. 


6

 And I should just be clear -- and we're getting


7  back here to Justice Kennedy's question -- that if -- if


8  we're rolling back habeas all the way to simply the fact


9  of the sentence and you can challenge nothing other than


10  to say I should not have been sentenced to the death


11  penalty, then we have a -- an even bigger floodgates issue


12  than I had -- had at first imagined.  District courts


13  tomorrow will be dealing with everything short of I should


14  not have been sentenced to the death penalty under section


15  1983 without the protections that Congress built in -­


16  built into AEDPA to protect against that very floodgates


17  problem. 


18

 QUESTION:  But this is -- you made the point


19  earlier that if this man were just in his cell and under a


20  term of years, that this would be an entirely proper 1983


21  case.  That's not the same for somebody who's says I'm


22  innocent of the death penalty.  That -- that one -- you


23  can say, oh, yes, that's habeas and nothing else.  Here,


24  you've already said exactly what they're doing to him, if


25  they had done it in order to get access to his vein for


48


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  some other procedure while he's incarcerated, it would be


2  a good, plain 1983 claim.  But somehow when it gets to be


3  connected with how he's going to die, it's no longer a


4  1983.


5

 MR. NEWSOM:  To be sure.  There -- there is


6  clearly some common sense line between a pure conditions


7  of confinement claim, the fellow in his cell that has to


8  have the cut-down for some other purpose, and the -- the


9  fellow on death row who has to have the cut-down as a


10  means of gaining access to his veins for purposes of


11  accomplishing a lethal injection.  Without the venous


12  access, there is no lethal injection. 


13

 I think there is a very real difference between


14  those two situations, and I can't, as I'm standing here,


15  promise you that I know precisely where that line is


16  between the outer bounds of an execution procedures claim


17  and the outer bounds of a conditions of confinement claim,


18  but what I can tell you is that this claim runs to the


19  very core of the State's execution process.


20

 QUESTION:  Well, but -- but is it?  I mean, you


21  -- you said without venous access, there -- there is no -­


22  there's no execution by lethal injection.  But there is


23  execution by lethal injection without cut-down.  And -­


24  and the question in each case is is the cut-down


25  gratuitous.  Calling the cut-down gratuitous for purposes


49


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  of injection does not challenge the legality of injection.


2

 MR. NEWSOM:  It just strikes me, Justice Souter,


3  that that with respect -- well, let me answer in two ways.


4

 First, as I said earlier, I think the record in


5  this case is clear that the cut-down becomes a live issue


6  only in -- in the event that it is necessary. 


7

 Point two, and I think the more important point,


8  is that it just strikes me as a bad way to administer the


9  rule on a going-forward basis for a district court to have


10  to sift through on a procedure-by-procedure basis to


11  determine is this procedure in fact medically,


12  scientifically necessary to accomplish the sentence, in


13  which case Mr. Stevenson I think concedes that it's a


14  habeas petition, but it's not.


15

 QUESTION:  What you're doing is asking all the


16  courts, including this one, to ignore the very issue and


17  simply say, in effect, under AEDPA we don't care.  I mean,


18  we're somewhere between the devil and the deep blue sea


19  here, and -- and I would suppose there -- there ought to


20  be a middle ground. 


21

 MR. NEWSOM:  I certainly am not suggesting in


22  any -- to any extent that -- and I don't think it's true


23  -- that -- that to extent that, say, a -- a technically


24  unnecessary but nonetheless chosen procedure for gaining


25  venous access is unreviewable.  That's the point -- that's


50


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the discussion that I was having with Justice -­


2

 QUESTION:  That's I thought is what he wanted


3  reviewed.  He wants to be able to litigate the necessity


4  of this.  He claims that it is gratuitous.  That's his


5  point.


6

 MR. NEWSOM:  Right.  And -- and our point is -­


7  is that that is fine if he wants to litigate and we will


8  litigate and fight him tooth and nail in the appropriate


9  forum.  The appropriate forum in this case -­


10

 QUESTION:  There is no appropriate forum because


11  the appropriate forum was closed to him before you


12  announced, A, that you were going to execute him by


13  injection and, B, that you were going to use this


14  procedure as a last resort.


15

 MR. NEWSOM:  With respect, Justice Souter, the


16  appropriate forum in this case exists.  It exists in the


17  State court system.  It is -- it simply is not the case


18  that Mr. -- that Mr. Nelson is out of luck entirely


19  without a 1983 -­


20

 QUESTION:  Well, let's try this again.  What


21  procedure is open to him in the State of Alabama?  We were


22  told that no procedure was.


23

 MR. NEWSOM:  Your Honor, I think that there


24  certainly are procedures.  We outlined procedures in our


25  brief, namely, the two that we have not discussed to this


51


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  point were that Mr. Nelson could have filed a response to


2  the State's motion to set the execution date, and two, he


3  could have filed a motion to stay the execution in State


4  court.  Now -­


5

 QUESTION:  Well, we're talking about now.  What


6  is open to the prisoner today -­


7

8

9

 MR. NEWSOM:  Those -­


 QUESTION:  -- in Alabama?


 MR. NEWSOM:  Those procedures, Your Honor, are


10  in fact open to -- to the prisoner today because when this


11  Court stayed the execution, the death warrant expired.  We


12  will now need to go back to the Alabama Supreme Court,


13  even -- even in the event that we prevail here and ask for


14  a new death warrant, at which point Mr. Nelson can -- can


15  participate in the State process -­


16

 QUESTION:  And do you represent he can get a


17  hearing on the merits of his arguments in one of those


18  procedures? 


19

 MR. NEWSOM:  What I -- what I can represent to


20  the Court is that I am certainly not aware of any


21  procedural bars that exist to him participating in either


22  one of those processes, and that certainly with respect to


23  Mr. Nelson, we would -- we would be glad to waive any


24  procedural bar that did exist.  We would certainly expect


25  the -­

1

 QUESTION:  So that there could be a factual 

2  hearing on -- on the necessity of the -- and the -- and 

3  the medical propriety of these procedures? 

4

 MR. NEWSOM:  Sure.  If he -- if he chooses, as 

5  -- as we hope he will -- as we hope he would have and now 

6  hope he will, to participate in the State process, he will 

7  get a hearing on the merits of his Eighth Amendment claim. 

8  And again, I'm not suggesting -­

9

 QUESTION:  But -- but if he does and loses, his 

10  only access to the Federal courts is by a petition for an 

11  original writ here. 

12

 MR. NEWSOM:  That's right and that's -- that's 

13  very close, Your Honor, to the -- to the very situation 

14  that this Court dealt with in Allen v. McCurry. 

15

 QUESTION:  He would also have the opportunity to 

16  seek a stay, would he not, from this Court from the 

17  decision of the Alabama court saying that his Eighth 

18  Amendment claim was -­

19

 MR. NEWSOM:  To -- to be sure.  This Court 

20  always retains cert jurisdiction over merits 

21  determinations of State courts. 

22

 QUESTION:  Would we have to go into the question 

23  of whether that's a suspension of the writ of habeas 

24  corpus in a case, say, much worse than this one?  It's 

25  horrendous.  He couldn't raise it before.  No access to a 

53


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Federal district court. 

2

 MR. NEWSOM:  I don't think, Justice Breyer, that 

3  this case even presents a suspension -­

4

 QUESTION:  No, no, no.  But just imagine this 

5  case with much horrible circumstance because your rule of 

6  law is the same, irrespective of the horror of the 

7  circumstance.  So there would be no claim but a State 

8  court for a person who could never had brought a Federal 

9  habeas because the issue didn't arise.  Is that a 

10  suspension of the writ of habeas corpus not in time of 

11  war? 

12

13

 MR. NEWSOM:  I think it's not in this Court -­

 QUESTION:  And you'd refer me, because there's 

14  only a minute, to read on that so I'd become convinced 

15  what? 

16

 MR. NEWSOM:  Please read Felker.  This Court's 

17  decision in Felker is quite clear that pointing 

18  specifically to section 2244, this Court said Congress, by 

19  and large, gets to make judgments about the scope of the 

20  writ.  Section 2244 is not a suspension.  We're not even 

21  in the ball park of an across-the-board bar on -- on 

22  jurisdiction. 

23

 QUESTION:  But if we -- we're doing 1983, then 

24  there's no -- there's no exhaustion requirement. 

25  There's -­

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

 MR. NEWSOM:  That's -- that's certainly true,


2  but I guess it assumes that -- that I'm wrong about -­


3  about the nature of this claim.  Our position, of course,


4  as I've tried to convince the Court -­


5

 QUESTION:  But you've said it is a good 1983


6  claim except if it -- if it is in relation to the


7  administration of the death sentence.


8

 MR. NEWSOM:  Your -- that's right, Your Honor,


9  and this will give me I think a -- as good an opportunity


10  as I can to try to sum up our position in this case.


11

 We have certainly made the argument that a


12  challenge to a State's means of gaining venous access, a


13  challenge to -- to a procedure for carrying out an


14  execution is in and of itself -- should be understood to


15  be a challenge to the sentence itself and subject to


16  habeas corpus restrictions.


17

 The State amici, the 30 States who have


18  participated in this case on our behalf, have made very


19  strongly the argument that a -- that a stay of execution


20  in and of itself should be understood as a challenge to


21  the sentence.


22

 The Court need not go so far in either respect


23  with us today.  All we ask the Court to hold today is that


24  where -- where an inmate both challenges a procedure for


25  carrying out his execution and, in essence, tries to tell


55


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the State, dictate to the State how to go about conducting


2  that execution, and seeks a stay of that execution to give


3  himself time to engage in that reordering of the process,


4  that that should be understood as a challenge to the


5  sentence.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. STEVENSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


 I -- I'd like to start first by -- by trying


13  desperately to -- to inform this Court that there is no


14  remedy available to Mr. Nelson in State court.  I


15  appreciate Mr. Newsom's argument on this point, but rule


16  32 is not an available option.  I -­


17

 QUESTION:  Before you go into that, would you


18  clarify one thing for me I want?  Did they object in the


19  district court to -- on the ground there was a failure to


20  exhaust State remedies?


21

 MR. STEVENSON:  No, they did not.  No, Justice


22  Stevens.  There's never been any -­


23

 QUESTION:  And the district court did not rule


24  on the claim that there was --


25

 MR. STEVENSON:  Absolutely, and the problem here


56


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  is, again, none of these issues were -- were permitted to


2  -- to develop. 


3

 Let me just start with the State court question. 


4  Rule 32 has the same kind of factual innocence


5  requirement.  For the 6-month time line that Mr. Newsom


6  was talking about, yes, you can file a new successive


7  State court petition under rule 32, but just as you have


8  to in the Federal context, the State court petition has to


9  allege factual innocence. 


10

 In footnote 19 of our reply brief, I cite a


11  case, Tarver v. State.  It's a case where immediately


12  before an execution, the prosecutor admitted that he had


13  excluded African Americans from jury service in a


14  discriminatory manner.  He said here's our new evidence. 


15  The execution be -- should be stopped.  The Court of


16  Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court held no. 


17  New evidence claims must go to factual innocence.  That's


18  32.1(e).  There is no remedy available. 


19

 Mr. Newsom talks about filing something in the


20  State supreme court.  The State supreme court of Alabama


21  has no jurisdiction -­


22

 QUESTION:  But that's a little different from a


23  case that alleges a current impending constitutional


24  violation. 


25

 MR. STEVENSON:  Yes, Your Honor.  And I could


57


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  speak to that because in the other case we cite in 

2  footnote 19, we did that too.  In the first Tarver case, 

3  this Court had granted cert on the constitutionality of 

4  execution by electrocution.  The case was pending at this 

5  Court.  We went to the State courts of Alabama saying, 

6  look, the State supreme -- the United States Supreme Court 

7  is about to review this.  We've got new evidence that 

8  electrocutions in Alabama are being conducted in an 

9  unconstitutional manner.  Let us in.  No.  Your method of 

10  execution claim is not cognizable because the 2-year 

11  statute of limitations at that time is an absolute bar. 

12  The courts have no jurisdiction to adjudicate any 

13  constitutional claim unless it is a new evidence innocence 

14  claim.  The Alabama Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to 

15  give us a merits review on this issue. 

16

 QUESTION:  We were told there were a couple of 

17  other methods besides rule 32. 

18

 MR. STEVENSON:  There are none, Justice 

19  O'Connor.  The only thing we could do is file a motion for 

20  a stay.  At the point at which the stay motion was 

21  requested here, April of 2000, Mr. Nelson didn't want a 

22  stay.  He doesn't want a stay of execution.  He actually 

23  wants his execution to be carried out. 

24

 QUESTION:  Well, he did ask for a stay you said, 

25  in order that this could be resolved. 

58


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1

2

 MR. STEVENSON:  Absolutely.


 QUESTION:  So, as I understand it, he does want


3  a stay in order that this can be heard.


4

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, he wants a stay to -- he


5  wants to enjoin the kind of conduct that we're talking


6  about here, but filing a stay motion in the Alabama


7  Supreme Court would not get him merits review where we


8  could present the kind of facts that we're now presenting.


9

 And I have to say that access to the Federal


10  courts in this case has really changed the State's


11  position.  Nothing that we've been talking about here this


12  afternoon about what they intend to do was ever presented


13  to Mr. Nelson until he got in front of the Federal judge. 


14  In front of the Federal judge, they said for the first


15  time, we will try to do a peripheral stick, not


16  percutaneous invasion.  It's a different procedure.  And


17  at page 109 of our joint appendix, the district court


18  finds -- and I'm reading here -- the defendants have


19  offered no explanation as to why they intend to use a cut­


20  down procedure instead of a percutaneous central line


21  placement.


22

 They have never made that offer.  They're making


23  it here today.  It's because we're in court, and of


24  course, we can't get to court unless this Court recognizes


25  our authority to bring a legitimate challenge that does


59


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  not attempt to invalidate his conviction or sentence. 


2

3

 There is a gap.


 QUESTION:  Well, what we heard today, does that


4  satisfy the prisoner's request that these -- all of these


5  other things be used first?


6

 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, if -- if the State had


7  then and would now concede that percutaneous line


8  placement would be an acceptable method, then yes.  That's


9  all we were seeking.  But of course, without a remedy -­


10

11

 QUESTION:  Is that not what was said today?


 MR. STEVENSON:  Well, it's not said in a way


12  that we can enforce, Your Honor.  Until we can go to the


13  district court, go to a court, and enforce any of these


14  representations, we are at risk.  And that's all we're


15  asking.  That's all Mr. Nelson asked in the first


16  instance.


17

 And the irony, of course, is if it had been


18  permitted to proceed, I think we would have resolved this. 


19  He'd already be executed.  And I think their conduct today


20  strengthens that position.  And that's why we would


21  urgently ask this Court to reverse the rule that the


22  Eleventh Circuit is now applying which bars prisoners like


23  Mr. Nelson from getting Federal review.  It's not asking a


24  lot. 


25

 And I understand the fears, but I don't agree


60


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  with Mr. Newsom that this is opening up anything.  People


2  can file complaints now.  They could have done it for the


3  last 20 years.  But district courts are not obligated to


4  review those complaints.  The PLRA puts restrictions on


5  1983 actions.  The habeas corpus right permits -- creates


6  restrictions. 


7

 What this Court shouldn't do out of fear is to


8  block prisoners like Mr. Nelson who have legitimate


9  constitutional complaints from getting remedies that are


10  precisely the kinds of claims that could and should be


11  resolved in the manner that they've been discussed about


12  -- discussed today easily.  We tried to exhaust the


13  administrative remedies, but until we got in front a


14  Federal judge, no one would allow us to be heard.  And


15  that's simply the problem that we face in this case and


16  why relief is required.  And I think that's why there


17  ought to be the kind of Federal -- Federal remedy that


18  Justice Breyer has indicated because without it, our


19  prisoners are at risk. 


20

 Unless there are further questions, I'll -- I'll


21  rest -­

23  Stevenson.
