CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in Case No. 15-1498, Lynch v. Dimaya. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Kneedler. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The court of appeals held that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of crime of violence in 18 U.S.C 16(b) is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutionally vague on its face, relying on this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's decision in Johnson, holding the residual clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Armed Career Criminal Act unconstitutionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vague. 

            

That was wrong for two reasons.  First, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard of vagueness applicable in an immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding is not the same as in a criminal proceeding, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the Constitution does not require prior notice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that conduct will give rise to removal and also because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the immigration laws have long been administered by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executive and administrative proceedings because --

 

 

 

 

 

under broad delegations of authority because of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close relation of immigration to foreign relations and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national security.

Second, though, in any event, under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal vagueness standard applied in Johnson 16(b) is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not unconstitutional as exemplified by this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unanimous decision in Leocal and the more than -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the more than 30 years that 16(b) has been on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

books --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Mr. Kneedler, didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

the government argue in -- when Johnson was before us, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if the ACCA residual clause was invalid, then 16(b) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be vulnerable because it was subject to the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

central objection.  Wasn't that the government's 

  

 

 

 

 

argument? 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the -- the United 

  

 

 

 

 

 

States was responding to the argument that -- that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made in Johnson, which was broader than the Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate rationale.  The -- to the extent substantial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk alone was thought to be a problem, the Court made 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear in Johnson that cases involving references to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial risk are not inherently problematic and, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, there are -- there are many such -- such ones. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Court focused its analysis on two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different aspects, but they -- but they have features 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 16(b) does not have and make 16(b) very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctive.  And, in fact, that's the reason why 16(b) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has not given rise to the interpretive confusion that

finally led this Court in Johnson to hold the ACCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision unconstitutional. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought the Johnson, 

    

 

 

 

5 

two features at issue were the fact that we were asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts to imagine what the ordinary crime was, and there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was no way to even think about what that was. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Your adversary points out, with burglary, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ordinary crime is during the day, there's one level 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of risk.  If it's at night, there's a different level of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk.  The nature of the entry is at question, whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's forcible or merely walking through an open door 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uninvited.  It may be easier with burglary for lots of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons, but there -- the level of what -- or what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes an ordinary crime was somewhat at the center 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Johnson.  Why isn't it at the center here? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Because I -- I -- there are 

   

   

  

 

 

 

several very important distinctions between this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Johnson with -- with respect to that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the ACCA residual clause spoke in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms of a serious potential risk that serious injury to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another person might -- might result.  And as the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed out, that created uncertainty about things that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could happen even after the offense was committed and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury to people, bystanders or anyone else it could be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Section 16(b) is very different in that

respect.  It asks whether the offense by its nature 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presents a substantial risk that physical force will be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

used against the person or property of another, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's very different in several respects. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It confines the analysis in both a temporal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and functional sense to the elements of the offense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You don't look at what conduct might -- might have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened afterward.  It focuses narrowly on the elements 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the offense because the -- the question is whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the use of physical force might be used in the course of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committing that offense. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, may I ask, 

   

  

 

 

Mr. Kneedler, because this aspect of your brief was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing to me because sometimes you're talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

temporal, and sometimes you're talking about functional. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I want to know what you think the real limitation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is.  So take the example that you use, which is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possession of a shotgun example; right? 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you say that that would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fall outside of Section 16. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And the question is why? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Temporally, you know, you're possessing a shotgun when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you shoot somebody.  You can't do it any other way.  So

the temporal analysis doesn't work.  So what is it about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

that example that makes it fall outside of Section 16, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whereas you argued it would have fallen inside of ACCA? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the -- well, first of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all, in ACCA that was part of the confusion.  That was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the confusion in Johnson itself. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, exactly. 

  

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  But -- but --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So why are you so sure that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there would not be the confusion under Section 16? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think, again, because 

   

  

 

 

 

of Leocal.  And the courts after Leocal have had no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem concluding that it was not covered.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason is that Leocal -- excuse me -- 16(b) requires a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk of the use of physical force, the -- an act of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violent crime, as the Court described it in Leocal, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the possession of a -- of a sawed-off shotgun at any 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular moment in time.  It doesn't have to culminate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in its use at all for -- for --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's absolutely 

  

 

 

 

true.  And that's what gave us trouble in ACCA because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it could culminate in its use, but it didn't have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culminate in its use. 

 

 

 

            

But then you take a case like burglary, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you could say the exact same thing about burglary.

Somebody could walk in on a burglary and all of a sudden 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there would be a use of force.  But a burglary could 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

happen in such a way that nobody walked in and there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't be a use of force. 

   

 

 

 

            

So, again, it just seems as though we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

replicating the same kind of confusions, and there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing that separates the two. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

find out --

 

 

            

            

the two. 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I --

    

   

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Or at least I'm trying to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  I --

    

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- what you think separates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  I don't -- I -- I don't 

    

   

   

  

 

 

think so, because another important aspect or textual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point in 16(b) is whether the offense by its nature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presents a substantial risk.  "By its nature" means in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

its natural, ordinary sense.  And, for example, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Leocal, said in no -- the Court said in no ordinary or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural sense could the -- could DUI be regarded as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative use of physical force.  It's not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

violent --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know --

  

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- crime. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- I -- I was very struck by

that language, too.  And I think it's that language, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

more than some of the other language you pointed to in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its brief, that might suggest that there's some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between 16(b) and -- and the ACCA residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause. 

            

But on the other hand, "by its nature" seems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to suggest an elements focus, a real elements focus. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Look at the elements and ask, given those elements, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given the nature of the offense, what's going to happen? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But, you know, the elements section of Section 16 is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 16(a).  So it can't be all about all elements. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So what is that "by its nature" doing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it's by its nature of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the offense, which would incorporate its elements.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think elements are central to both (a) and (b).  (a) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involves the actual -- actual use of force or threat in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use of force or attempted use of force.  The element is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the actual or threatened use of force.  Whereas under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16(b), the question is whether the elements add up to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense in which there is a risk of force being used, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if it doesn't have to. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And burglary -- I think burglary is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

classic example -- is a classic example of that.  And I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think --

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, let me explain, if I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Burglary is -- is descended from the common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

law, and its rationale is precisely because of the risk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- that the burglar will encounter someone in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the course of committing the burglary.  And -- and it --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is logical, built into, inherent in the crime of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary that there may be a response to an uninvited 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entry into a home or -- or other structure.  By its 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature, that transaction, that -- those elements of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary create the risk that force will have to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used.  The same is true of kidnapping. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and give me a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrast.  And by contrast, what that fell under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ACCA residual clause would not fall under 16(b) because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same thing could not be said. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I mean, one that did 

   

  

 

 

 

 

not fall under the -- the ACCA --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  Give me one that would 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

fall under the ACCA residual clause, but -- but -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where there was confusion as to whether it fell under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the residual clause. 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Begay -- Begay is a good 

   

  

 

 

 

 

example there.  It was precisely the -- the crime 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

involved in Leocal where the Court had no trouble in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-page decision saying that DUI is not covered because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

of this textual difference, because there has to be risk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the use of force, which is not the accidental or sort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of negligent conduct. 

 

 

            

Whereas in Begay, the Court struggled with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how to -- how to deal with that under the residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause.  It -- it created an extra-textual limitation, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the purposeful, violent, aggressive test in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weed out negligent or accidental offenses.  Whereas the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicit text of -- of 16(b) itself takes care of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  So that is an important difference. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Another important difference, though, that I 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't mentioned yet is that the residual clause tied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the level of risk to four enumerated offenses, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were not consistent with each other. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think that you're quite 

    

 

 

 

 

right that that was one of the arguments in Johnson that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they said make the statute confusing.  It -- it does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem odd before we look at Johnson that giving examples 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes the statute more vague.  It's a -- it's a little 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

counterintuitive. 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you're -- you're 

  

 

 

 

 

correct.  I think that's the way the Johnson court saw

it.


            

MR. KNEEDLER:  And I -- and I think the -- I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

think the problem was not examples per se, but -- but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that they were conflicting examples that I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the court came to conclude embedded an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrariness into the ACCA residual clause in all its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applications.  And that -- and that's effectively 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what -- there was, like, an ingredient in that statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that made it incapable of consistent application. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's not true here. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Kneedler, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

absolutely right that the court in Johnson said that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those examples compounded the problem.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

essential problem that the court thought existed was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use of the ordinary case analysis.  So I'm just going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask you the question that the court asked in Johnson, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I'd -- I -- how do we answer this question?  This is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the court said in Johnson: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

"How does one go about deciding what kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct the ordinary case of a crime involves?  A 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

statistical analysis of the State reporter?  A survey? 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Expert evidence?  Google?  Gut instinct?  So that's a 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

multiple-choice test.  What do we do? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  The --

same under this statute. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think it's not the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

same.  Again, unlike -- unlike in the ACCA residual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

clause, you start out by looking at the elements of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense.  What -- and are the elements of the offense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such that, by their nature, they give rise to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial risk of injury? 

 

 

 

            

Now, for some offenses, I think that you can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at the long history of the offense.  And burglary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is an example.  Indeed, in Leocal, this Court said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary is a classic example of a crime of violence. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

And, in fact, the Senate Report on this provision says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that burglary is the classic example.  And if one looks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at LeFave or other historical materials, it is because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the risk of force that might be used.  Of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- this statute also concerned risk to property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So certain offenses, I think the --

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So can I give you another 

   

  

 

 

 

 

example just to test how this test works?  You say you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look to the elements of the -- the offense to see if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they give rise to a risk of injury.  Do I have that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  How do we do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

vehicular flight under that example?  I'm just trying to

sort of ground this.  And you might be right.  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

not -- you know, I'm just trying to figure out what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference is if we look at it that way, because that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't sound so different from what we were trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do in ACCA.  In fact, it sounds kind of the same as, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

honestly. 

            

So give me vehicular flight.  How does it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

work? 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Vehicular flight from a 

  

 

 

 

 

police officer after being ordered to stop is, again, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you think by its nature, what -- what was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature envisioning when it enacted that?  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, again, it's parallel to burglary.  The conduct is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such that in the -- in the course of committing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense, in the course of the flight, not something that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be collateral or down the road, is the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that would fall on -- on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the included side?  Because I -- I had thought that your 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

brief said something different, but maybe I misread it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it may depend on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements of the particular State statute.  One can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

give an across-the-board answer to -- to any one label 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for -- for a type of offense without looking at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements.  But, for example, in -- in vehicular flight 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or any statute, the State law might, for example, have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

gradations, which would show that the more aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

version is one that the legislature had singled out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

because of the particular risk.  So it's -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important to look at the State statute and what was it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driving at?  What are the -- what are the elements? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What -- what harms was it -- was it intending? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And go back to possession of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a shotgun, because I'm running over in my mind my memory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Johnson oral argument where basically the SG's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office made exactly this argument about possession of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shotgun, how the elements of that offense are understood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to give rise to a significant level of risk. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think the concern, 

   

  

 

 

 

one of the concerns mentioned in -- in Johnson was what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the shotgun might be used way down the road remotely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from that -- from any -- remote in time from any moment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in time when the -- when the person was arrested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possessing the shotgun. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Presumably, the person is 

  

 

 

 

 

possessing the shotgun when the person kills somebody, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so it's -- temporally, I don't think that that argument 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

works. 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  The -- the offense 

  

  

 

 

 

 

continues for the entire duration of possession, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not saying that that's enough.  There has to be a

substantial risk in the -- in the course of committing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

the offense.  And as one of the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I remember the 

    

 

 

government arguing in Johnson that most people who are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found with sawed-off shotguns are committing crimes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why isn't that a substantial risk of force being used? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If statistically -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

statistically -- and I don't remember the statistics 

   

 

 

 

 

 

now, but they were very clear then that a huge amount --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number of the crimes of possession of a shotgun were --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

led to criminal activity. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think it is the -- is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the use of force necessary for the crime of possession 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the shotgun.  And -- and possession itself --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the use of force 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is not necessary for the use of -- for burglary if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

walk in and there's nobody there.  You take what you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find. 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  But the -- but the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

historical understanding of burglary is precisely that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it will, that it will --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we're now going back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to gut instinct. 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  It's not gut instinct.

I think anything but.  I -- I think a court looks at 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

17 

the, again, the elements of the offense judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, so the statute analysis of what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State legislature was driving at, State judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions that might themselves describe what the risk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is or the risk that was being addressed by the -- by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense.  It's a legal -- it's a legal question.  A 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

judge's experience, however, for something like burglary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be quite informative. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Before your white light 

  

 

 

 

 

goes on, could you address your first argument that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vagueness standard is different here than in -- than in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson? 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I might say, Jordan v. 

    

 

 

 

 

deGeorge, a case from some years ago, is a little more 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

persuasive than I had thought for the Respondent -- for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Respondent here.  You could say it's dictum because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they didn't really need to reach the issue based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their holding. 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think there are a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

number of things to be said about deGeorge.  You're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  The issue is not addressed.  The court applied 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what seemed to be the same standard, but it -- but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't briefed.

MR. KNEEDLER:  And so the question of -- of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how it would apply in that setting wasn't addressed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Also --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Something has to be 

  

 

 

 

 

briefed before we say it's the law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the Court often -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court has what might be referred to as a drive-by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling, I wouldn't say it was drive-by.  It was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

considered, but -- but usually you want adversarial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presentation by the parties. 

 

 

 

            

For example, one important -- several 

 

 

 

 

 

important aspects of deGeorge, it did not discuss this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's earlier decision in the Mahler case in which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court indicated that there could be a looser standard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- or would be a looser standard of vagueness in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration cases specifically point out -- pointing out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a critical difference.  And that is that the ex post 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facto clause does not apply to immigration; therefore, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person can be removed for conduct that was not a basis 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for removal before you engaged in that conduct, criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not.  And, therefore, the notice piece of -- of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vagueness standard really didn't fit well in the -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the immigration context. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That observation was at 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

a time before the draconian effects of removal and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

deportation came into effect.  We now have lifetime 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bars, which were rarely or on very limited circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed previously.  We have many more criminal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sanctions with harsher sentences now.  I think more than 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything we have often said that vagueness depends on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the gravity of what is at stake.  Today what's at stake 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a lot more than what was at stake decades ago. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  But what -- what's at stake 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't be viewed just from that perspective.  What's at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stake is the fact that the immigration laws are vital to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the nation's national security and foreign relations and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the safety and welfare of the country.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And there is always the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

fail safe that the Attorney General in his or her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion can deny -- can deny anyone the right to stay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  But if we're going to ask immigration judges to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose the consequences that they do today, don't we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need something that's not arbitrary? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, if I can address 

   

  

 

 

 

several pieces of that.  While there are more criminal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses now that give rise to removal, the same basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point obtains, which is that a person can be removed on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a ground that was not a criminal offense, or it was not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a basis for removal at the time he engaged in that

conduct.  Again, whether it's a crime or not a crime. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

20 

That means that the alien has no constitutionally-based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to notice.  And, therefore, the notice piece of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Vagueness Doctrine has far less force in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  If the Court -- if the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were to hold that 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal cases, what would the impact -- in criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases involving the application of the categorical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach, what would the -- what would the implications 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that be? 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, as we cite in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, there are a number of places in Title 18 where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the definition of crime of violence is used, either by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express reference to 16(b) or by use of the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formulation like in 924C where the same formulation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is used. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What would be some of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

most important examples? 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, that would be -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be one.  16(b) is incorporated into offenses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing with money laundering, hijack robbery, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe.  A number of other -- it's also used to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined whether a juvenile will be prosecuted.

doesn't that suggest that the argument that the civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards apply rather than the criminal one loses some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

of its force for precisely that reason? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I don't think so.  For 

    

  

  

 

 

 

one thing, I think it's -- it's important to recall that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16(b) is just a definition.  It is not a statement of a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime on its own.  It is a -- it is a definition or 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identifying a category of offenses that are then plugged 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

into some other statute, either a criminal offense or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the immigration laws.  In the immigration laws, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, it's identifying a category of crimes that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

are -- that constitute a ground for removal just like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of the other aggravated felony provisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I thought the point 

   

  

 

 

 

the Chief Justice is underscoring is that if we go -- if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we base the decision on the fact that -- that this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil, then you have to come back here for other cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under --

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  That is -- that is true. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and for that reason, the Court may well want to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in our view, sustain 16(b) by applying the criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, because if it -- if it is sustained under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal standard, as we think it clearly should be, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then -- then a for certiori it would be -- it would be

JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you think of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea suggested in Justice Alito's opinion that the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

"offense" like the word "crime" both those words are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous.  They can refer either to a category of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

behaviors that many people can engage in or they can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refer to this behavior that this defendant engaged in on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this particular instance. 

 

 

            

So he said, as I read it, let's back up. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Can't be done.  Congress thought both in this statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and in the other statute, it wouldn't be that tough to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorize all the State criminal laws by their degree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of risk of violence.  Can't be done.  Too many State 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal laws used in too many different ways, too many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different words, no statistics are kept, the Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department can't get them, so we're left guessing.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's back up and look at what this person did on this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasion.  What is your reaction to that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, we -- we have not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued that because this Court --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I think you argued it.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

just wanted to know what your reaction is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  But this Court's decision in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Leocal said the categorical approach applies.  If -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court were to conclude that this could not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sustained under -- under the criminal standard, that may

be one option.  It may be a particular option. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You'd have to have it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argued.  But I think if you really did that, I just 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't know if you thought it through at the SG's office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the pros and cons.  And in case -- you needn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have done -- but in case you have done, I'd -- I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appreciate your telling us what you all think even if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're not stuck with it.  I know that's unusual for you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be stuck with it.  I'm just curious. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  There obviously would be 

  

 

 

 

 

advantages in the sense that the statute would be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be preserved.  There could be questions, though, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about how it would be administered to determine what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually happened on the prior occasion.  But one -- one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place where, you know, the Court might want to consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserving, if that were -- if that were an issue, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be 924C where the -- where the crime of violence is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemporaneous with the possession of the -- of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

firearm.  And so you're not looking at a past offense, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're looking at the overall offense in which the -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the -- the weapon was possessed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could -- could I ask, just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in thinking through your argument, it would help me to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get a few examples. 

   

 

            

So could you give me three examples, let's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

24 

say, if there are in -- if there are those -- that many, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where we struggled under ACCA, but where the answer is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear under 16(b), so that I understand what it -- what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of distinction you're drawing. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  I think DUI is 

    

  

 

 

 

sort -- is the prime example.  Leocal itself concluded 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that DUI was not covered.  In -- in a unanimous opinion, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's only -- the Court's only occasion to have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address this in 30 years because of the text of 16(b), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the act -- it requires the act of use of force.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the sawed-off shotgun, which this Court in Torres said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not covered by 16(b), and -- and we believe that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's correct, again, because of the -- the -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have to use force in order to possess the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shotgun, even though injury could result under the ACCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause, perhaps, and that's what -- that's what was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing under the -- under the ACCA clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I -- I think those are two prime 

   

   

 

 

 

 

examples.  But I -- 16(b) --

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Anything else?  Because this 

  

  

 

 

 

is really important for me. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yeah.  Well -- well --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm trying to figure out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what our differences are.

Begay, where the Court formulated the extra-textual test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the act -- I forget the precise words, but violent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggressive conduct, it pointed out that some such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

limitation was also necessary because of -- otherwise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like pollution offenses or -- or consumer product 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses might be covered. 

 

 

 

            

So the Court -- the Court again was -- was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juggling with the way the ACCA residual clause operates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in order to figure out how to exclude that one.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no question that those crimes are clearly excluded under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ACCA clause. 

 

 

            

On the other hand, some other crimes besides 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary, like kidnapping or escape, I think if -- if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one pictures those offenses, they clearly present a risk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that physical force will be used and give this statute a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

core of -- of valid applications that it can't be held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional on its face. 

 

 

 

            

            

If I may --

   

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The immigration judge 

  

 

 

 

also found that the -- these burglaries qualified as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes of moral turpitude.  Another ground for removal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Does -- does burglary qualify as -- as a crime of moral 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turpitude? 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  I think in some circumstances

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As Justice Sotomayor points out, there were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two critical factors that this Court pointed to in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson that, quote, "conspired to make the ACCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause unconstitutional."  Everyone agrees that 

  

 

 

 

 

they are both present here.  It's hypothesizing the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary instance, the ordinary case of a set of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements, and second, then from that hypothesis, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estimating the degree of risk of some sort.  And as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg points out, the government correctly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back in Johnson, said that those two factors are in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existence here in Section 16(b), and that the residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause here was, quote, "equally susceptible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge." 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  There was something that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

that isn't here, Mr. Rosenkranz, and that is a long

interpretation.  And I'm wondering why you think we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have that same history.  Because I don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that there's any question that we would not have said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we said in Johnson had Johnson been the first case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Johnson was the umpteenth case, and we had

that.  It seems as though -- and not only with respect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to this Court, but with respect to lower courts -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems that everybody is getting along just fine.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much as I can't quite understand what the difference is, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there just does seem to be a difference in practice. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Justice Kagan, let 

  

 

 

 

 

me -- let me give two answers.  The first is that this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole notion that the government is discussing about a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different experience with ACCA than with Section 16(b) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is revisionist history. 

 

 

            

Every single ACCA case that this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided was presented to this Court in simultaneous cert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitions in the 16(b) context, and this Court would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then JVR the 16(b) cases, and the lower courts and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court would then cross-reference ACCA case -- ACCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause cases into Section 16(b), treating them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equivalently.

28 

            

So this Court's experience with the ACCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause is its experience with Section 16(b). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the whole series of questions you asked, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan, about well, what about Sykes, how would this turn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out here?  What about Chambers?  What about Johnson 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

itself?  Every single one of those cases is coming back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  We know that they're coming.  Sykes is already --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- that is, the Sykes issue -- is already presented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a circuit conflict right now in the lower courts.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is roiling the lower courts.  There's a Fifth Circuit 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

case where the majority and the dissent of Sykes are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being played out in the Fifth Circuit right now.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same will be true of all of those. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then, secondly, it is simply not true to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that -- I'd like to say that everyone is getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along just fine in the lower courts.  Between our brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the National Immigration Project, we've identified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 circuit splits, some of them on exactly identical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements.  And what is the problem with those cases? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The courts on either side -- it's not just that they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged in different elemental analysis.  The courts on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

each side are fundamentally disagreeing about what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary case of a particular crime is. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what of the argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that 16(b) is more precise?  For one thing, it is

limited to in the course of commission of the offense, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that the offender must be the one who uses the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

force.  And in addition, it covers use of force against 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the victim's property.  So it -- it has a specificity 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the ACCA residual clause lacked. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, let me start 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with the -- with in-the-course-of, which took a -- a lot 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Mr. Kneedler's argument time. 

 

 

 

 

            

Two things -- well, three things to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it.  First, courts have uniformly held that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in-the-course-of does not entail a temporal limitation, 

   

 

 

 

 

that it doesn't --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think it -- wasn't the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

word during the "commission" of?  Is it -- in the course 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of or during the commission of? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  In -- in --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In 16(b). 

  

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  In 16(b), the phrase that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the government is speaking of is "in the course of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committing the offense." 

 

 

            

And so, just to -- to continue that first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer, courts have held that inchoate offenses of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort that -- that Justice Kagan was asking about, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possession offenses, do create the risk, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriately so, because -- or let's take another

example that -- that consumed a lot of time today: 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

Burglary. 

            

Justice Kagan's question about burglary. 

 

 

 

 

Notably, that is why in Leocal this Court held that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary did -- was sort of the classic example of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16(b) violent crime.  Burglary, as this Court said in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Johnson, it's complete at the moment you cross the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold.  If all we are looking at is the temporal, so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when are the elements completed, entering with the bad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent is what completes the elephant -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements.  So if someone enters, they have completed the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements.  They can then ransack the apartment for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

next five hours.  That is still in the course of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committing the offense. 

 

 

            

Second answer, the government's new 

 

 

 

 

interpretation does not change the fundamentally 

 

 

 

 

 

imaginary nature of the inquiry, no matter what.  Courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will still be imagining the ordinary case.  Only now you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to further imagine, okay, in that ordinary case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when are the elements typically satisfied? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, finally, that textual difference is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually a textual difference.  ACCA says -- the ACCA 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause says the same thing in different words. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course -- of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

course, courts and legislatures always have to imagine

consequences when they are classifying crimes.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

31 

have to define what burglary is, because they know that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a significant number of cases certain consequences 

   

 

 

 

 

 

will happen.  That -- that's the way the law works. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, of course, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And if this were just to the question that Justice Alito 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked Mr. Kneedler about ramifications, if this is -- if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this were just about importing 16(b) into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitions of various crimes, there's no vagueness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem, because as this Court said in Johnson -- and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed exactly that question in Johnson, it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

totally different inquiry when -- when you are applying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the stated elements to an actual concrete example that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is there before the Court. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Rosenkranz, could I ask 

   

  

 

 

 

you this:  Suppose Congress enacted a statute that said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

any person who commits a crime of moral turpitude in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District of Columbia or with -- within the special or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States shall be imprisoned for not more than 20 years, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would that be unconstitutionally vague? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, it would 

  

 

 

 

 

certainly be problematic.  And the reason it would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problematic is because you don't have an administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency that then gives content to the moral turpitude

language the way you do, for example, in the immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

context.  And by the way, an agency to -- to which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference is owed.  But this is a statute, 16(b), that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a criminal statute --

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But that seems to me -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, I'm surprised by -- somewhat surprised by your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer.  That seems to me to be at least as vague as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16(b).  And yet the holding in the Jordan case on which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you rely was that that -- that a -- a deportation 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that permitted deportation for a person 

   

 

 

 

 

convicted of a crime of moral turpitude satisfied the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable vagueness standard there.  So --

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, yes, Justice Alito. 

  

 

 

 

 

And -- and that's -- so that is the distinction.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today, moral turpitude -- "moral turpitude" is a phrase 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- the executive agency has defined.  People 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know what it means.  They know what's in, and they know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's out. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But, I mean, unless you're 

   

  

 

 

 

willing to say that the criminal statute that I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothesized would satisfy vagueness standards, I -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

don't see how you can say that the same vagueness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard applies in criminal cases and deportation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, the same 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

vagueness standard does apply in -- in the two contexts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So why does crime -- then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute making a crime of saying anyone who commits 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

a crime of moral turpitude sentenced to 20 -- up to 20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, that would be -- that would satisfy vagueness for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a criminal statute? 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  In a criminal statute, it 

   

  

 

 

 

would not, because there is no history of agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretations to which courts must defer. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But let me just back up for a moment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What -- is DUI a crime of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

moral turpitude? 

 

            

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I -- I have no idea. 

    

   

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  How about failure to file an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

income tax return? 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I mean, I don't know what 

    

   

 

 

 

the agency interpretations of moral turpitude --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  How about unlawful entry 

  

 

 

 

 

into the United States? 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I think not.  But let me 

    

  

 

 

 

 

just back up, because Your Honor has moved into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second issue. 

 

              

I just want to be clear that, in our view 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and in the view of all of the lower courts, Jordan

settles the question on whether it's the same standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

for criminal deportation.  But this Court does not have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to embrace Jordan or even address the question whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's the same standard.  16(b) is a criminal statute 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress chose to import wholesale into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration laws and that -- that has criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applications even under the INA. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Johnson talked a lot 

   

  

 

 

 

about the confusion caused by the predicate offenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that were -- were listed; in fact, in colorful terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained why those compounded the vagueness in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause.  And, of course, you don't have those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  So -- so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

I would start with where -- with where Justice Kennedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

started, which is, as a general matter, one does not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinarily think that giving examples makes something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more vague than it would otherwise be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I know this Court spent a lot of time 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

trying to draw lessons from those examples with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

varying -- with -- actually with no success under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

varying methodologies to try to narrow the -- what is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise a vague statute.  And the government's 

   

  

 

 

 

argument in Johnson was that -- that Congress succeeded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in narrowing with those enumerated elements, those

enumerated crimes, and this Court concluded that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't. 

            

But a statute that has examples, even if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

they are confusing examples, has to be better than a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

statute that is --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the 

  

 

 

 

 

statute as a whole might be because you can look at it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and say, well, there's one of the examples.  But it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me that argument doesn't respond to the point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it makes the residual clause much more confusing if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the examples seem to be pointing in different directions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and involve different -- totally different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences. 

            

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Basically, what the 

  

 

 

 

 

Court held in Johnson. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the fact that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

yes, it's clear when you get to the specific thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's named, but that, as the Court explained, it makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it much more confusing -- confusing when you get to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual clause. 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So -- so I think the -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

easiest way to look at this, I would say, is if that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if that had been the pivotal factor in Johnson -- so

Johnson says there are two factors that conspired.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

it had been indeed that other factor, what this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should have done in Johnson is to say, we will now, as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of statutory construction, stop trying to draw 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lessons from those examples and interpret the residual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause in its own right without trying to figure out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the examples teach something about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationships. 

            

This Court had an obligation to save the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute if that's what was causing the problem.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't.  And I think it was -- this Court was very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conscious of what it was doing when it said that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were two critical things that conspired -- two critical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements that conspired to make the statute vague. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then in Welch, when this Court repeated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what its holding was and its rationale was in Johnson, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it repeated those same two critical elements, not this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third one about the enumerated clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I see that.  The thing 

    

   

  

 

 

 

underlying this is -- which is a difficult case -- if we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say you're right, what then do we say about moral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turpitude, unfair competition, just and reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

rates, public convenience and necessity, and there are a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundred others and they're all civil. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, what you've suggested is -- well, what

you say is this.  You say that the Constitution requires 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the creation of an administrative agency which will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

develop a tradition over time that will clarify, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

will otherwise -- that kind of reasoning was present in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the nondelegation doctrine.  So what you want to say is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that which would -- that which would have saved a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute under the nondelegation doctrine, which is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair competition, it's delegation of unriot, but which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- gives meaning is also necessary to save a civil 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute from vagueness. 

 

 

            

Hmm.  That's a very interesting holding. 

   

  

 

 

I'd rather read it in a law review article than I would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

write those words which will suddenly become real. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I'm not -- I'm not -- do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you see where I'm floating on this?  I -- I see your 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, it's quite similar, but I quite worry about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implications. 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, so 

  

 

 

 

 

let's -- so let's talk about the immigration that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- excuse me -- the implications that is in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration context to begin with. 

 

 

 

 

            

In the immigration context, to the extent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Your Honor -- that you are quoting, Justice Breyer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from --

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I was quoting Cordoza.  I'm 

    

  

 

 

 

38 

happy to be confused with him. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

with him. 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I confuse you all the time 

    

 

 

 

 

 

So to the extent that we're focusing on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language that appears in the immigration statutes, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language has been interpreted.  And that is a key 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

distinction between this case and Mahler, for example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with -- with -- which Mr. Kneedler invoked. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mahler was a situation in which Congress had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defined the crimes that would make you deportable.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the problem was that the Attorney General could then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise discretion as to whether he would deport you or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.  And it was couched in terms of delegation because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was pre-Chevron and pre-Schechter Poultry.  But this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court said, no, the fact that there is discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't bother us. 

 

 

            

Now, the second answer is in the immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, as distinguished from perhaps any other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, as Justice Sotomayor was saying, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration context in particular is a context that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

implicates liberty with the severest sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences.  So at a minimum in the immigration 

   

  

 

 

 

 

context, completely apart from the public good sorts of

questions and applications of civil --

 

 

 

 

 

39 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Rosenkranz, I guess I 

   

  

 

 

 

would have thought that your answer would have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  I guess I would have thought that your 

    

   

 

 

 

 

answer would have been whatever implications Johnson had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for Vagueness Doctrine, it has already had, and that all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are asking us to do is just essentially to say that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this statute is no different from the statute that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked at in Johnson and to write an opinion that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically just repeats Johnson.  And whatever 

  

 

 

 

 

implications it's had or it will have, it will have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regardless, and this opinion would do nothing more. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Yes. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  What she said. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, if that's your 

    

 

 

 

 

answer, it totally ignores that this is not a criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  And it certainly is true that deportation has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more severe consequences than the typical civil case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But there are many other civil cases that can have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

devastating impact on someone, such as child custody, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loss of a professional license, complete destruction of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

a business, loss of the home.  Now, assuming that there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is some sort of vagueness standard that applies in civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

40 

cases, I would have thought your answer would be that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a sliding scale and that the -- the standard for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil cases is not the same as the standard for criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  But how much specificity is required in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil context depends on the severity of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences of the case. 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, so, Justice Alito, 

  

 

 

 

 

this Court in Hoffman said that it's a sliding scale. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But in Jordan, when it came to deportation, which this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has described as the gravest sort of consequence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which directly implicates liberty interests, this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said it's at the same level as --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  That's not exactly the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

way the Court -- what the Court said, or at least it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not necessary to read Jordan that way.  I think Jordan 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be read to say, look, the dissent has raised this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new argument, it wasn't briefed, it wasn't argued.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissent says this is unconstitutionally vague; we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to apply the criminal standard here and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfies the criminal standard.  It -- it didn't say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume for the sake of argument, but I think it can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly be read that way.  And if you don't read it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that way, you are stuck with a conclusion that a statute 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

making a crime of moral turpitude punishable by a felony 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

term of imprisonment would satisfy the vagueness

standard for a criminal statute, which I think is very 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

difficult to defend. 

 

 

41 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say, again, two things.  The first thing, this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have to decide whether Jordan equated criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases and civil cases with the most severe consequences, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because this is a criminal statute that this Court is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting and it has criminal consequences even as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imported through the INA.  And I just --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, would you say the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing if it didn't -- if this statute did not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporate a definition that is also used in criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes and simply had the same standard in a purely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration statute?  So no reference to a -- a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

definition that also applies in criminal cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I would have a different 

    

   

 

 

argument.  But let me just maybe clear, this Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said -- and it said in A.B. Small.  It took a statute 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was held unconstitutional -- and this was back in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1924, '25 -- found -- the statute that this Court found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional in the criminal context.  It was then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied -- it was a silly breach of contract case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied as a defense.  And this Court said, no.  When we 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

struck it over there, we're going to strike the civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ramifications here as well.  And this Court could adopt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

a very narrow holding, saying that what Congress has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done is to make the decision to import a criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

statute into a civil context.  It brings the soil with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the roots.  And there's no such thing.  It's actually 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

incoherent. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't think that makes the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

slightest bit of sense.  Suppose there were a criminal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute that says that it is a crime -- it is a felony 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to charge an unjust rate.  And then the -- there was a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil statute that incorporated that, and we would say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, because you can't make it a felony to charge an --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an unjust rate or price.  You can't have that in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil statute.  You can't incorporate it into the civil 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, you just 

  

 

 

 

 

recited the facts of A.B. Small.  That was exactly the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute there.  It was struck in the criminal context. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was then imported as a defense in the civil context, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and this Court said in A.B. Small, we don't care whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's civil or criminal.  If it was struck there, we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to strike it here. 

 

 

 

 

            

And there's an important kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

separation-of-powers reason to do this.  Congress made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the decision to equate the two.  Congress didn't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress could have used different words and revised the

statute.  But think of it in the RICO context.  Let's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take a classic case that this Court has decided.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

definition of "gangster" this Court held in Renzetta is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutionally vague.  A court couldn't then, in a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

civil RICO case, adopt that same standard, say that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the predicate crime and impose treble damages.  It would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be incoherent to tell the lower courts that what you do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is take a statute that would be unconstitutional there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and import it into the civil context and uphold it as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional here. 

 

            

Let me give you a very practical reason on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the facts of this case.  So in this case, Mr. Dimaya 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets deported on the ground that the statute is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently clear and he is an aggravated felon.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then comes back to the United States the next day and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be -- and will be prosecuted as an aggravated felon. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But as an aggravated felon, there will be a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard and he can't be prosecuted.  It would make no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense to have a scheme where the same words that use the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same statutory definition mean something in one context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as this Court would hold hypothetically in this case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but in the 16(b) context when it -- or in the context of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the definition of a crime means something else. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do with

that burglary is the classic crime.  It fits within 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16(b). 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, two things to say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about that statement in Leocal, which was obviously -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

mean this Court -- Leocal burglary was not before this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court.  The first is this is a California burglary, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

which looks very different, as this Court held in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Descamps, from a normal burglary.  California burglary 

   

  

 

 

 

can be committed by being invited into someone's home 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the intention of selling them fraudulent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securities.  That is an actual case that applied it in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that way. 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's why this case 

  

 

 

 

 

didn't work under 16(a) and the elements, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

And then you bring me to another point that's really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important.  Mr. Kneedler never answered Justice Kagan's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question about under the government's current view of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what 16(b) means where the space is between the elements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause and the residual clause. 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm actually having trouble coming up with

JUSTICE KAGAN:  He says burglary is that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Burglary can't be that.  A 

  

  

 

 

 

 

burglary is committed the moment after you cross the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold.  And by the way, in California, it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to be an unlicensed crossing of the threshold.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a burglary is -- is committed when you cross the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threshold, even if you're crossing the threshold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawfully. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I understood what he was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

saying, and I won't try to put words in his mouth, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was something along the lines that, yes, it's true 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the elements of burglary do not have the use of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force.  But if we look back to the historic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding of burglary, what we find is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longstanding concern with exactly that subject.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other words, that burglary wouldn't have been defined as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was, wouldn't have been prosecuted as it was, except 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for this fear of the use of force.  I don't know.  And 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the best I can do with it and he will tell me if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he can do better. 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So, Your Honor, I can't do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

any better.  That sounds like the ordinary case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach, which creates the mischief when you layer on

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the principle of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

law that led to A.B. Small?  No one thinks statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words in the civil context, "unjust or unreasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rates," whether enforced by courts against railroads, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether enforced by an agency, is unconstitutional.  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one thinks that.  A.B. Small holds that, but it holds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in the context of there having been an earlier case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that struck those words down in criminal context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

stands for? 

 

            

So what is the principle of law that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, the principle 

  

 

 

 

 

of law that A.B. Small stands for that I was arguing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically, is the principle of law that when a court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strikes a statute that Congress has made the decision to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose civil and criminal consequences to, that statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is gone and you don't start preserving the civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences to it, because Congress made the decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we just follow Congress's direction. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I do want to close with one last point, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is about the practical consequences of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling.  First, I already said, in the criminal context, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the practical consequences are very limited, because as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court observed in Johnson, practically all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applications of 16(b) are applied to a concrete set of

facts.  Then the question becomes what, in light -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the notion that this Court has not decided a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

16(b) cases, should this Court try to engage in the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise in the 16(b) context that was a failure in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ACCA -- in the ACCA context. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But in deciding whether to take that route, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has to decide what is to be gained by that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprise.  The enterprise of setting the lower courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

adrift in -- of considering the risks of the use of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force from statutes that do not have use of force as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an -- as an element. 

 

 

 

 

            

At some point this Court is going to have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide whether it's had enough.  And it's not like we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know where this case is headed, where the -- where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this inquiry is headed. 

 

 

 

            

Justice Kagan unveiled all of the next sets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of questions.  They are all coming here.  We've seen 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this show before.  We know how it ends, so the Court may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well save itself and the lower courts the grief of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what's coming here? 

  

 

 

 

 

The -- you said that the lower courts are all confused, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there are splits developing.  What? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Sykes redux is headed to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this Court.  After Sykes will be a James redux, a

48 

            

If you look at our brief with the list of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples of circuit conflicts, they are all coming here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Or the National Immigration Project's brief cites 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another five circuit conflicts.  They are all coming to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court, and the -- this Court will be overwhelmed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the exercise of trying to figure out what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary case of each of those thousands of statutes is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just as it was overwhelmed and finally gave up the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise in -- in Johnson. 

 

 

 

 

            

So we know that it's coming.  We know where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's going to end.  So this Court should just end it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here and it should end it now.

Respondent's brief and the amici brief, and it does seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like we are going to have a redux Sykes and a redux 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

James and a redux many of the issues. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  As -- as we -- as we explain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

in our brief, the -- the conflicts that -- that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address there can be explained by the differences in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state statutes.  And that's what you have, you have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply the -- the statutory standard of creating a risk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to particular state statutes, and as we explain, the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conflicts that they assert are largely that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But if -- if I could then go on.  Leocal is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only case this Court considered and the court there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered it clear that it was able to say that DUI was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in and -- burglary was in, DUI was out, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of the -- of the sort of textual differences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between this statute and that one.  It requires not some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury down the road, but physical force actually being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used -- a risk of physical force actually being used by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There were some --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  -- in the offense. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There were some who 

  

 

 

 

 

argued in the drunken driving test that the minute you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get behind the car, you -- drunk, you're using a lethal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapon, a car, to inflict injury on others. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  But the -- the Court --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Didn't win here, but 

  

 

 

 

 

that argument was still being made in the courts below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

and some courts below bought it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right, but -- but the -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the important point is this Court clarified it in -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Leocal to say that you -- it's an act -- it's a category 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of active violent crimes.  Risk of -- of -- of physical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force or actual physical force under 16(a). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And again, burglary, this Court said -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglary is a continuing offense.  While you might be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

able to prosecute somebody for burglary the moment they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enter, burglary -- this -- generic burglary, as this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court said in Taylor, includes remaining in the house, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and this Court said it's -- it's not made up, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this Court said burglary is included because by its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature it involves a substantial risk that the burglar 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

will use force against a victim in completing a crime. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

The same thing is true of kidnapping.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can kidnap somebody by inveigling, but the -- the risk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of force is that it'll try to escape and you'll have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use physical force. 

 

 

            

So the -- I don't think the Court is at sea. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It can -- it can look at what the -- the state statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is driving at and -- and apply the standard.

Many -- also many statutes have civil and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal applications, but that doesn't mean private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigants can invoke the criminal law standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

            

A. B. Small, when the Court got to the civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, it said there was no intelligible standard, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which -- which -- which was a much more relaxed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard. 

            

Finally on the immigration, immigration is 

 

 

 

 

 

vested in an administrative agency, so there is always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the intervening action by the executive, and even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the situation where the agency may not get deference, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is still a centralized control over the bringing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the cases.  And the Board of Immigration Appeals can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, this is out, this is in.  The courts will only see 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cases where the BIA actually sustains the removal, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that has a way of limiting giving -- and giving 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice to people. 

 

 

            

            

            

            

With respect to -- I'm sorry.
