 Myriad unlocked the secrets of two human

is this different from -- those start with natural --

natural products. 


MR. HANSEN:  Well, in -- in essence, Your 

Honor, everything starts with a natural product.  And 

this Court has said repeatedly that just extracting a 

natural product is insufficient.  For example, this 

Court has used the example of gold.  You can't patent 

gold because it's a natural product.

18  you can patent, however, a process for extracting 
19  naturally-occurring things? 
20
21  totally acceptable.  And what's interesting in this case 
22  is, the process that Myriad uses to extract the genes is 
23  not at issue in this case.  It's a process that's used 
24  by geneticists every day all over this country.  It is

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So isn't that -- why 

isn't that a way to, in effect, have patent protection 
for the product?  Does somebody who wants to use the 
product, the DNA -- extracted DNA in this case, have to 
find a new process from -- to extract it if they want to 
have it available?

12  anybody who wants to use the product either have to get 
13  a license for the process or find a different way of 
14  extracting it? 
MR. HANSEN:  I think they have to find a 
15
16  different way of extracting it, in the same way that 
17  finding a method of extracting gold does entitle you to 
18  a patent on the method of extracting gold, it may also 
19  entitle you to a patent on the use of gold.  For 
example, if you find a new way of using gold to make 
20
21  earrings, or if you find a new way of using DNA to do 
22  something, you may be entitled to a patent on that 
23  because --

extraction wasn't, and why.  Why would the tests --
would the tests be subject to a patent? 

 MR. HANSEN:  The tests are also routine and 
conventional science, but in this particular case, there 
were some method claims that we challenged.  The method 
claims in this case involved taking the genes that you 
extracted from the woman and the gene that you -- the 
way you think it should be, and simply looking back and 
forth to see if they're the same or different.  And the 
Federal Circuit that -- found that that was an abstract

12
13
14  the methodology of extracting the gene has not been 
15
16  wasn't that patented? 
 MR. HANSEN:  The original -- the original 
17
18  methodology was patented, and is -- is patentable.  In 
19  fact, if they came up with a new process, it would be 
20
21  freely licensed.  In fact, the patent may now have 
22  expired.  And so it's used all over the country every 
23  day.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I take you back to -- to 

Justice Ginsburg's question because I'm -- I don't --

 And, in fact, that's --

 A new discovery, a new way -- a way is 

Official 

I'm not sure you got at what troubles me about that. 

 Suppose there is a substance, a -- a 

found, previously unknown, to extract that.  You make a 
drug out of that.  Your answer is that cannot be 
patent -- patented, it's not eligible for patenting 

chemical, a molecule in the -- the leaf -- the leaves of 
a plant that grows in the Amazon, and it's discovered 
that this has tremendous medicinal purposes.  Let's say 
it -- it treats breast cancer. 

1

10
11  because the chemical composition of the -- of the drug 
12  is the same as the chemical that exists in the leaves of 
13  the plant. 
14
15
16  and it has some additional value, then I think it is not 
17  patentable.  You might be able to get a method patent on 
18  it, you might be able to get a use patent on it, but you 
19  can't get a composition patent. 
20
21
22  keep making the hypotheticals easier than they're 
23  intended to be.  It's not just the case of taking the 
24  leaf off the tree and chewing it.  Let's say if you do 
25

 MR. HANSEN:  If there is no alteration, if 
we simply pick the leaf off of the tree and swallow it 

But as --

value of this.  But it's extracted and -- and reduced to 
a concentrated form.  That's not patent -- that's not 
eligible? 

 MR. HANSEN:  No, that may well be eligible 

because you have now taken what was in nature and you've 
transformed it in two ways.  First of all, you've made 
it substantially more concentrated than it was in 
nature; and second, you've given it a function.  If it 
doesn't work in the diluted form but does work in a 
concentrated form, you've given it a new function.  And

11  the -- by both changing its nature and by giving it a 
12  new function, you may well have patent --
13
14  then I'm not sure how you distinguish the isolated DNA 
15
16  dispute that?  Isolated DNA has a very different 
17  function from the DNA as it exists in nature.  And 
18  although the chemical composition may not be different, 
19  it -- it certainly is in a different form.  So what is 
20
21
22  new function, Your Honor, with respect.  I believe that 
23  what -- Myriad has proffered essentially three functions 
24  for the DNA outside the body as opposed to inside the 
25

body.  The first is we can look at it.  And that's true, 

the distinction? 

 MR. HANSEN:  Well, I don't think it has a 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, when you concede that, 

here because it has a different function.  Will you 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company

but that's not really a new function.  That's simply the 
nature of when you extract something you can look at it 
better. 

 The second two rationales that Myriad has 

proffered are that it can be used as probes and primers. 
Three of the -- three of lower court judges found that 
full-length DNA, which all of these patent claims 
include, cannot be used as probes and primers.  But more 
important, finding a new use for a product of nature, if 
you don't change the product of nature, is not 

1 
2 
3

6 
7

11  patentable.  If I find a new way of taking gold and 
12  making earrings out of it, that doesn't entitle me to a 
13  patent on gold.  If I find a new way of using lead, it 
14  doesn't entitle me to a new -- to a patent on lead. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  From what you know and 
15
16  from what the record shows, would the process of tagging 
17  the isolated DNA be patentable?  The process of tagging, 
18  we just don't know about that or is there a patent on 
19  that? 
MR. HANSEN:  The very patents in this case 
20
21  include claims on -- on DNA that is tagged so that it 
22  can be used as a probe.  We have not challenged that. 
23  We are not asking the Court to strike down that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under our -- our law, is a 
patent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but

part? 

 MR. HANSEN:  No, it is not permissible under 

patent law to do essentially a narrowing -- narrowing 
construction of the -- of the claim. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if you haven't 

challenged this, then -- then where are we with respect 
to the tagging?  I don't quite understand.  Because 
the -- the entire patent, which includes tagging, would 
fail under your argument.

if those uses are new, what does Myriad get out of this

genes and they had announced that they would not patent 
them if they were the first to find it.  We also know 
that prior to the patent actually being issued, there

that testing down.  So we know in this particular case

recombinant DNA is frustrated. 

 People can't use pieces of the BRCA gene to 

worried a lot about whether a decision for the 

Petitioners in this case would invalidate recombinant 

DNA.  Recombinant DNA is in fact what all the major 

innovations in industry are doing these days.  It's

nature deciding the sequence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's lovely.

to prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature

different. 

 MR. HANSEN:  And it is certainly true, as 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the whole point, 

Your Honor suggests, that one of the incentives here is 
a process patent or a development patent.  If you -- if

you could get a patent on the new use for the patent.

a mutation in it.  And when you find a mutation in the

22  the sample and you say to her because the isolated gene 
23  is the same as the gene in your body, I can tell you

9 
It's not taking a gene and snipping something that's in 
10
11  nature.  And yet you claim that can't be patented.  The 
12  introns are taken out, the exons are left in, and 
13  they're sequenced together.  Give me your argument on 
14  that.  I read your brief, but it is not a product of 
15
16
17  between cDNA and DNA.  The first is exactly the one Your 
18  Honor just discussed, which is that the introns, the 
19  noncoding regions, have been removed.  That is done in 
the body, by the body.  That's done in the process of 
20
21  DNA going to mRNA. 
22
23  cDNA is they take the mRNA out of the body and then they 
24  simply have the natural nature-driven nucleotide binding 
processes complement the mRNA.  So that if the mRNA has

 MR. HANSEN:  Yes. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  So when you actually look, 

answer because I gather, if I -- if I've read it 
correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA 
does not have the same base pairs.  There's a U or 
something instead of an A or whatever it is.

11  if you could get a super-microscope and look at what 
12  they have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would 
13  discover something with an A, not a U.  Is it AU?  Is 
14  that the one? 
MR. HANSEN:  Yes. 
15
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Okay.  So -- so you 
16
17  would discover something with an A there, you see, and 
18  you wouldn't discover something with a U there.  And 
19  there is no such thing in nature as the no-introns AGG, 
whatever, okay?  It's not there.  That's not truly 
20
21  isolated DNA.  But you can go look up the Amazon, 
22  wherever you want.  Hence the question.  Now, on that 
23  one, how?  How is that found in nature?  The answer is 
24  it isn't. 
25

MR. HANSEN:  Well, but I would suggest, Your

Honor, that the question is not whether it is identical 
to something in nature.  The question is whether there 
was a human invention involved, whether it is markedly 
different from what is found in nature. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that goes to 

obviousness.  That does not in my mind go to the issue 
of whether it's patent eligible.  You may have a very 
strong argument on obviousness, but why does it not --
it's creating something that's not found in nature at 
all.

20
21  not the small snippet that they want to capture the 
22  whole gene with, that's -- that whole gene without the 
23  introns is just not found in nature.

when the body removes the introns, has the body made 
something markedly different than what is in nature, and 
it is our view --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When I first looked at 

this case, I -- I thought that maybe the cDNA was kind 
of an economy class gene, was -- it wasn't.  But my 
understanding is that it may have a functionality that 
the -- the DNA isolate does not, easier to tag, et 
cetera.  That may be incorrect for the record, but that

11  was my present understanding. 
 MR. HANSEN:  It is somewhat easier to work 
12
13  with cDNA to make recombinant DNA, and it's recombinant 
14  DNA that is the place where all of the innovation and 
all the efforts are taking place.  And if we lock up --
15
16
17  recombinant DNA? 
18
19  useful things that we are inventing is done -- is done 
through the process of recombinant DNA.  And if we lock 
20
21  up the cDNA, it makes it harder to do the recombinant 
22  DNA.  So that if someone owns all the cDNA, I can't do 
23  recombinant DNA using what the company owns.

starts with a national -- natural product, but these 
others, the examples that I gave, you said they involve 
manipulation.  The -- the cDNA can't be characterized as 
involving manipulation? 

MR. HANSEN:  It certainly -- there's --
there is some manipulation, although it's -- it's 
letting nature manipulate, not doing -- not the 
scientist manipulating.  But it -- what the other factor 
that distinguishes aspirin and the other examples you 
use from cDNA is that they have -- the alteration of the

22  answer the question directly, Your Honor.  I'd like to

 The claim that isolated DNA is a human

longer connected at the molecular level to what 

surrounded it in the body.  But allowing a patent on 

that basis would effectively preempt anyone else from 

using the gene itself for any medical or scientific 

purpose.  That is not true about a patent on cDNA.  A 

patent on cDNA leaves the isolated DNA available for 

other scientists and other -- and others in the medical 

profession to try to generate new uses. 


 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hansen -- Mr. Hansen 


just said that to do recombinant technology, you have to 
use the cDNA rather than the native D -- the isolated 
DNA.  Do you disagree with that? 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's not my 

understanding, Justice Kagan.  My understanding is that 
you -- that the native DNA can be used for recombinant 
DNA without the step of cDNA.  We do think cDNA is 
important and the position of the United States is that 
cDNA is patent eligible.  We disagree --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose his 

understanding is correct.  Suppose your 
misunderstanding -- suppose your understanding is not 
correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But Mister -- General 

Verrilli, I got the distinct impression from your brief 
that your view was that, although the cDNA may be 
patentable, it might very well be rejected as obvious. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's true now, Justice 
Ginsburg, but obviousness is determined at the time that 
the patent is issued, so what may be true now might not 
have been true at the time the patents were initially

to that, I guess, Your Honor, would -- would point first

to Mayo, in which the Court recognized that the

8 
does do work that the obviousness test and a novelty 
9 
test and a specification test do not do, and the work 
10
11  that it does here, I would respectfully submit, is to 
12  ensure that the natural substance, the product of nature 
13  itself, is not subjected effectively to a monopoly 
14  because if it can be deemed to be a human invention

protection.  My question goes to whether we ought to 
focus on those reasons at the eligibility stage or at 
the obviousness stage. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, the Court 


identified in Chakrabarty and then reiterated in Mayo 

that -- that it is -- that the right answer to that 

question, Your Honor, is to focus on them at the

in and -- and decide the broadest possible question? 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I would -- again, I 

would point the Court to what the Court said last term 
in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent 
eligibility really is a double-edged sword. 

 And it may be that in a -- in a particular

view on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the

different from nation to nation. 

 I'll give one example I think helps 

 If you -- just as with the question that

example, you can get a patent on isolated genomic DNA, 
but only for a particular use.  So you would get what is 
the equivalent of a use patent, which is a patent that 
we would think under our patent laws is acceptable, too.

22  looking at the way the claim is phrased, however, and it

 When you look at those particular sequences, 

there was invention in the decision of where to begin 

Justice Alito.  It -- it's got 5,914 nucleotides.  The 
genome itself has over 3 billion.  It's arranged in the 
way set forth -- as set forth in the SEQ IDs number 1

number 1 is the, as Justice Breyer understood, the cDNA

14  this is something I was going to ask you.  I -- I assume 
15
16  whatever you want to call them, do exist in the body. 
17  That they do exist.  You -- you haven't created a type 
18  of gene that does -- does not exist in the body 
19  naturally. 
MR. CASTANIAS:  But we've -- I'll -- I'll 
20
21  use my own simplistic analogy which we offered in our 
22  brief and which we offered to the lower court.  A 
23  baseball bat doesn't exist until it's isolated from a 
24  tree.  But that's still the product of human invention 
to decide where to begin the bat and where to end the

die, there is isolated DNA.  And that means that the DNA 
strand, the chromosome strand is cut when a cell dies, 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's true, but then 
you were saying something that I just didn't understand 
because I thought the -- the scientists who had filed 
briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the 
chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and 
it's attached to two ends.

neither of us are scientists, I would like you to tell

don't have to invent the particular segment of the -- of 
20

 MR. CASTANIAS:  Well, I -- I guess I'll even 
22

24  SEQ ID number 2, the genomic DNA segment came about is

you've got it.

exactly the opposite of that.  If you look, for example,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  You've got 

at page 488 of the Joint Appendix, that's the 
declaration of one of the inventors, Donna Shattuck, at 
paragraph 27, what -- what she explains is that the 
Myriad inventors first created the cDNA, which we agree 
at least on that score with the Solicitor General, is 
indeed eligible for patenting.  But then -- and by the 
way, that cDNA was created from hundreds of different 
patient samples to create what was called a consensus 
sequence.

17  the inventive process was additive. 
 Now, ultimately, again, going back to the 
18

not be negative -- or negated by the manner in which an 
20
21  invention was made, maybe that shouldn't matter.  But it 
22  is a --

was in -- what is in the body.  The most important 
reason it's different in kind is that it cannot be used 
in the body to detect the risk of breast and ovarian 
cancers.

7 
has a use when it's taken out -- you know, when it's

9 
the same thing.  And I guess what you haven't gotten me 
10
11  to understand is how this is different than that.  It's 
12  still the same thing, but now that you've isolated it, 
13  it in fact has lots of great uses.

18  nature doctrine, which I think has some very dangerous 
19  consequences if it's not cabined and understood

22  the same plant and it says in the 1930 legislative 
23  history of the Plant Patent Act that plants that are 
24  unmanipulated by the hand of man are not eligible for

ways -- two ways to look at that. 

 First of all, if you want to look at it from 

patents, and that's fine, in terms of their breeding and

 But the product of nature doctrine is 
troublesome for this reason, modern medicine -- go 
beyond just the isolated DNA patents here.  Modern 
medicine, particularly the area of personalized 
medicine, is trying to get to a point where what we are 
administering to individual patients is giving them the 
opportunity to mimic the actions of the body.  And -- so 
actually, the goal of medicine is to get closer to 
nature, rather than farther away.  And anything that

8 
someplace a branch has fallen off a tree and it's fallen

that's really -- the search for this sort of thing that 
20

built historically into this area is, of course, if you 
get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the

when you use the word "dangerous."  I had thought -- and 
you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that the 
patent law is filled with uneasy compromises because on 
the one hand, we do want people to invent.  On the other 
hand, we're very worried about them tying up some kind 
of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself 
could be used for further advance.

 Now, in any individual case that might be

17  unfortunate or fortunate.  But consider it in the mine

19  nature free of the restrictions that patents there are, 
so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers 
20
21  50 new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers 
22  them, although that expedition was expensive, although 
23  nobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the

25

use of the thing, but not the thing itself.

14  of an invention in a particular claim.  What you do have 
to do is have utility for the invention itself described

Register they had notice and comment and 23 specific

Federal Circuit, continues to follow.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Would -- would -- okay. 
 MR. CASTANIAS:  And then there's the

 MR. CASTANIAS:  I -- I think -- I think,

to as the so-called Product of Nature Doctrine because I 
don't believe that as a separate doctrine it really 
exists.  It's just the flip side of the coin of 
something that shows a lack of invention. 

And, of course, that's where Section 103 
comes into full force as the Chief Justice mentioned 
earlier in the argument.  Section 103 allows you to make 
comparisons to what was old and what was new.  I don't 
think the organ, the liver, gets past 103 in that 
circumstance even if you say, well --

was the one brought up in the federal circuit opinion,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're not 


suggesting if you cut off a piece of the liver or a 

piece of the kidney that that somehow makes that piece 

patentable. 


 MR. CASTANIAS:  No.  Absolutely not.  It's 


but liver, kidney, you know, gallbladder, pick your 

organ.  But it's the same thing.  It is the same thing 

when it's inside the body and it's out.  That's where 

our --

15
16
17  say that under -- under your existing decisions in 
18  Chakrabarty, J.E.M., that set forth a broad 
19  understanding of Section 101 and an understanding of 
what is within the limited exception, then what -- I --
20
21  I would -- I mean, honestly, I think that Section 103 
22  does this work better than Section 101, but to the point 
23  of Section 101, there's -- there is nothing different 
24  about that piece in the body. 
25

that is?  What's the difference between the two --

 MR. CASTANIAS:  I would say that -- I would 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah.  Then -- then watch 

56
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

what you're doing.  That's very, very interesting. 
Because, really, we are reducing, then, 101 to anything 
under the sun, and -- and that, it seems to me, we've 
rejected more often than we've followed it. 

nature doctrine because, of course, it doesn't just --
human kidneys and so forth.  Everything is inside 
something else.  Plants, rocks, whatever you want.  And 
so everything will involve your vast taking something 
out of some other thing where it is, if only the

12  some other test than just that it was found within some 
13  other thing.

16  about the different functions, the different values.  If 
17  you think about patents as economic instruments, the 
18  different economic values that come out of this, the 
19  different things that patients now have as a result of 
20
21  isolated gene before the Myriad invention.

 Let me ask you this, and it's consistent 

with my -- my preface.  If we were to accept the 
government's position that the DNA is not patentable but 
the cDNA is, would that give the industry sufficient 
protection for innovation and research?  And if not, why 

 MR. CASTANIAS:  Right, but in --

12
13  that decision now is that so much has happened since 
14  these gene patents issued and since the Utility 
15
16  will hurt the industry as a general matter to not have 
17  isolated gene but only have cDNA patents. 
18
19  think it ultimately will hurt the doctrine that this 
Court comes out of this case with.  Because what you 
20
21  will then be asking litigants to do and courts to do is 
22  to draw fine distinctions under Section 101 between,

 There is no risk of a natural law or a 

important to understand here is that these patent claims 
aren't for methods.  They don't prevent -- present that 
problem that the Court identified in that argument and 
in the argument in Bilski.  These are for specific 
molecules that exist in the physical world.  That --
that concern that is present with method claims is not 
here, these patents cover -- these patent claims cover 
only what is claimed and no more.

11  of which falls within the statutory categories.  There 
12  is no risk of anything being preempted other than what 
13  the claims properly claim, which are human-made 
14  inventions of isolated molecules. 
15
16  It's important to note that molecules have been patented 
17  for a very long time.  That's what drugs are.  And drugs 
18  are often made by taking one molecule and another 
19  molecule, both of which are known, reacting them in a 
test tube, which is a very common thing, its reactions 
20
21  have been around 100 years just like snipping has been, 
22  but they make something new and useful and life saving 
23  from that.

snipping.  If I can just conclude with one more

 MR. HANSEN:  Of -- of course there would be 

value in that in the sense that -- that, A, it 
reinforces the Product of Nature Doctrine, but more 
importantly, the effect of the patents in this case 
allows Myriad to stop all research on a part of the 
human body.  If you uphold the patents in this case, 
Myriad can -- has the authority given it by the 
government to stop anyone from doing research on a piece 
of the human body.  That would be a significant advance,

looking at it. 

 And I would like to make one other point 

The genes in this case, the patents on the 
genes in this case cover the genes of every man, woman, 
and child in the United States.  And as I just said, it 
gives the -- the government has given Myriad the 
authority to stop research on every one of our genes.
