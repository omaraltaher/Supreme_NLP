CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST: 

We'll hear  argument


next in No. 00-1937, Jo Anne Barnhart v. Cleveland Walton.


Mr. Lamken.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR.  LAMKEN: 

Mr. Chief  Justice,  and  may it


please the Court:


Congress 

--   

Congress 

designed  the 

Social


Security disability program to provide benefits to workers


who suffered from long-term  disabilities, individuals who


were, in  effect, forced  into premature  retirement by  a


severe  impairment. 

Consistent 

with  the 

program's


origin --


QUESTION:  Just a moment, Mr. Lamken. 


Spectators are admonished. 

Do  not talk  until


you  get  out of  the  courtroom. 

The  Court remains  in


session.


Go ahead. 


MR.  LAMKEN: 

Consistent  with  the  program's


origin, purpose,  and text,  the Commissioner  has for  45


years from  the program's inception, in  adjudicating tens


of millions of claims, and throughout repeated amendments,


adhered 

to 

a 

single 

and 

consistent, 

reasonable

construction  of  the  definition of  disability. 

To be


disabled,  a  claimant must  have  an impairment  that has


lasted or can  be expected to  last at 12  -- at least  12


months  at a  disabling level  of  severity; that  is, the


impairment must preclude substantial gainful activity  for


the 12 months during which it must last. 


QUESTION: 

Well, now,  presumably though, as  I


understand it, the Commissioner could evaluate a claim and


start benefits in less than 12 months.


MR. LAMKEN: 

Correct,  Your Honor. 

That's 


--

that's because  the  statute allows  the  Commissioner  to


award benefits if the  -- if the disabling  impairment can


be expected to last 12 months.  So, for purposes --


QUESTION:  And can disregard possibly periods of


work during  that period  if the  commission is  satisfied


that this is going to be a permanent impairment.


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes.  If the work does not evidence


an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.  For


example, the Commissioner has what are called unsuccessful


work attempt  regulations. 

If they  do  not evidence  an


ability to  engage in  substantial gainful activity,  they


may  be disregarded  and treated  as  not evidence  of the


individual's ability  to  engage  in  substantial  gainful


activity.


Under the court of appeals' view, however --

 QUESTION:  That seems  sort of inconsistent with


your view on the  second question that trial work  periods


shouldn't begin until the end of the 12 months.


MR. LAMKEN: 

Your Honor, no. 

Our view  is not


that the trial work period does not begin until the end of


12 months.  Our  view is that  the trial work period  only


begins if the -- if the claimant actually becomes entitled


to benefits  at some point,  and that's  true because  the


trial  work  period  begins 

when  the  claimant  becomes


entitled  to  benefits. 

If  the  claimant  never becomes


entitled  to  benefits,  he never  receives  a  trial work


period.


QUESTION: 

What 

--  

what  provision  in  the


language of  the statute says that you can't start a trial


work period until the end of 12 months? 


MR. LAMKEN: 

Again, it's not our  position that


you can't start a work period -- a trial work period until


the end of 12 months. 


QUESTION: 

Well,  you  say unless  the benefits


have started. 


MR. LAMKEN:  Right, unless  they are entitled to


benefits. 

And we  would be relying  on 422(c)(3),  which


appears on  page 63a of the  appendix to the  petition for


writ of  certiorari.  And it  says that a period  of trial


work for any individual shall begin --

 QUESTION:  Just  a moment, Mr. Lamken. 

Exactly


where on 63a are you reading? 


MR.  LAMKEN: 

I'm  sorry. 

It's at  the bottom


where it's numbered 3. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. LAMKEN:  And it says, a period of trial work


for any  individual shall begin with the month in which he


becomes entitled to disability insurance benefits.  If the


individual never becomes entitled  to insurance disability


benefits,  the  individual  also cannot,  as  a  matter of


logic, become entitled to a trial work period. 


And that  is also  consistent with  the --

with


what the  trial work period does. 

The trial  work period


precludes  the  Commissioner  from  considering 

--   

from


treating work as evidence that  the disability has ceased.


The statute in  the preceding paragraph number  2 uses the


word  ceased. 

That  means that  if the  individual isn't


actually already  entitled to  benefits, there  can be  no


trial  -- there is  no purpose  in the trial  work period.


It's  only  there  for  determining  whether  or  not  the


disability has ceased.


QUESTION: 

Of  course,  the  difference is  the


other side  says that he becomes  entitled not when  he is


adjudicated to be entitled, but  he becomes entitled when,


in fact, all of the conditions exist for which the  -- the

benefits are payable.


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Why aren't they right about that?


MR.  LAMKEN:  Because  the statute provides that


the  individual  is  entitled  to benefits  if  he  has  a


disability which  can be expected to last 12 months or has


lasted 12 months.  That's most naturally read as referring


to  the time of  the adjudication. 

In other  words, when


statutes say if  the following conditions are  met, you're


entitled to something and they  use the present tense,  as


this  statute 

does,  they're 

normally  understood 

as


requiring those  conditions to be met  at the time  of the


adjudication.


QUESTION: 

Yes,  but  the  -- the  trial  work


statute  itself  says  that any  services  rendered  by an


individual during a  period of trial work  shall be deemed


not  to  have  been rendered  in  determining  whether his


disability has ceased.


MR. LAMKEN: 

Right, in  determining whether his


disability has  ceased.  That means  that for a  person to


have a -- to  be entitled to a trial work  period, he must


have what  is called a disability,  and whether or  not an


individual  has  a  disability 

is  determined  from  the


perspective  of  the  adjudicator  at 

the  time  of  the


adjudication.

 QUESTION:  But  I thought you took  the position


in --

I thought  you did  not take  the position  in your


brief  that  as  a  matter  of  law  there  had  to be  an


adjudication.  I  thought you said that  ordinarily that's


the way it  -- it  works in  practice, but  that the  real


point you were making was that if the individual went back


to work  prior to  the adjudication  and therefore  showed


that in  fact the disability  or the incapacity  and hence


the  -- the  disability, as  you see it,  is not  going to


last, that that's  the end of the matter. 

That would cut


it off.  I didn't think you took as a theoretical matter a


position that there had to be an adjudication, merely that


there ordinarily would be one. 


MR.  LAMKEN: 

I --

I  think  you've precisely


described our  position, Justice  Souter. 

The answer  is


that  if  the  individual produces  evidence,  such  as by


returning to work successfully for the period of  2 years,


for example, in this case, and shows that he, in fact, was


not incapacitated, he  was able  to work, the  adjudicator


can take  that into account and decide that no, you're not


entitled to  disability benefits,  and if  you were  never


entitled to  disability benefits,  you also do  not get  a


trial work period.


QUESTION:  But -- but you would not allow him to


come in and say long before I came in for an adjudication,

I was  in fact  disabled and  entitled to  benefits. 

You


wouldn't allow him to say that. 


MR. LAMKEN:  No.  We would not allow him to come


back and say -- and say, in effect, that I was  thought to


be  disabled for  a  period of  12  months reasonably  but


mistakenly because the  statute requires  that you can  be


expected -- present tense. 


Now, that is consistent with the way courts --


QUESTION:  You're  hanging an awful lot  on that


-- on that can be expected I -- I must say. 


MR. LAMKEN: 

Yes, Your Honor.  But actually the


contrary view  would make  -- creates  a rather  difficult


type of adjudication --


QUESTION:  A difficult --


MR. LAMKEN:  -- to make and one that's  entirely


foreign to the law. 


QUESTION: 

You got to  look back  6 months  and


figure out whether 6 months ago he -- he could be expected


to --


MR. LAMKEN:  Not merely that.  You would have to


look back for the entire period covered by the application


and decide  if any moment during that period it could have


been possible, reasonably but mistakenly thought, that his


disability 

would 

last  6 

months. 

That 

type  of


determination is entirely foreign to the law.

 And it's  also inconsistent with the  purpose of


the can  be expected to last prong.  That exists precisely


because, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, the Commissioner


needs to  be able  to adjudicate claims  before 12  months


goes by.  And therefore  when the adjudicator -- when  the


Commissioner decides claims before 12 months have gone by,


you look at the can be expected to last prong. 


QUESTION: 

So,  the  real  significance of  the


present tense  is that it kind of gives an opportunity for


the application of a kind of best evidence rule.


MR.  LAMKEN: 

Yes, yes,  exactly.  And  that is


consistent with  the -- the --

excuse me --

the statute,


which says  that when  you're deciding  these claims,  you


look at all  of the evidence in  the file and you  try and


come  up with all  of the  available evidence. 

You don't


disregard  evidence  that 

is  recently  arriving  merely


because  at  some  earlier  time  you  would  have made  a


mistake.  And that is also -- I'm sorry. 


Turning back to the question of disability,  the


Commissioner's  construction of the term disability in our


view  is supported  by  the  text of  the  act. 

The  act


imposes --


QUESTION: 

What kind  of deference  do we  give


here? 

At  the  time  this  claim  was  evaluated, 

the


regulations hadn't been adopted.

 MR. LAMKEN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION: 

So, we're into Skidmore  rather than


Chevron? 


MR. LAMKEN:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  No? 


MR. LAMKEN:  We believe that the Commissioner is


entitled to Chevron deference regardless of when the claim


was adjudicated. 

The purpose  -- the  reason this  Court


gives Chevron deference  is when the  -- the decision  has


the formality and uses the  procedures that Congress meant


the administrator  to use  when filling  in  gaps or  when


explaining the meaning of the statute.  It does not matter


that, in fact, that the administrator, or in this case the


Commissioner, used  those procedures  after the claim  was


adjudicated because  we know  that after  the thoroughness


consideration and using the notice and comment procedures,


the Commissioner came to the same conclusion, that in fact


the  best  reading of  the  statute is  the  one that  the


Commissioner  has  adhered  to for  45  years  and through


repeated amendments to the statute. 


QUESTION:  The -- the court of appeals here said


that that simply wasn't consistent with the statute and it


struck me  that they had a very good argument just looking


at the  statute that you  are kind  of -- reduced  to some


fairly 

odd  statutory 

construction  to 

justify  your

position.


MR.  LAMKEN: 

No,  Your  Honor. 

Actually  we


believe that we have the far more reasonable understanding


of  the  statute 

and  certainly  the  one 

that's  more


consistent with Congress' intent.  The statute --


QUESTION:  Well,  supposing we just say  that we


look to the statute itself for what Congress' intent was?


MR. LAMKEN: 

Focusing  on the  language of  the


statute.


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. 

LAMKEN: 

The 

statute 

imposes 

two


requirements.  First, there must be an impairment.


QUESTION:  Where do we find the statute in -- in


the --


MR.  LAMKEN: 

It's  423(d)(2)(A)  and (d)(1)(A)


which  appear on pages  69 --

just the heading  of (d)(1)


appears on 69a -- and 70a of the appendix to the  petition


for a writ of certiorari. 


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MR. LAMKEN:  Turning at  page 70, it establishes


two requirements that are interrelated.  The first is that


there must  be an impairment, which  has lasted or  can be


expected to  last 12 months or  result in death. 

Second,


the  impairment  must be  one  that  precludes substantial


gainful activity, that is, it  must be so severe that  the

individual  cannot  engage  in any  work  in  the national


economy.  Given  Congress' repeated intent not  to provide


benefits for short-term  disabilities, it is most  natural


to  read  those  two  requirements  together so  that  the


impairment,  which  must  last  12 

months,  is  also  an


impairment  which 

must 

preclude  substantial 

gainful


activity --


QUESTION: 

Well, maybe. 

You know,  once you


posit  that 

--  

that  Congress  didn't  want  to  provide


compensation for short-term disability.  But if  -- if you


had to  determine what  Congress' intent  was purely  from


that  language,  I 

just  don't  think  you 

get  there.


Disability means  an inability to gain -- to engage in any


substantial -- substantial gainful  activity.  It  doesn't


say how long  that disability has to  -- it could  be, you


know, a  week-long inability. 

And  then it  goes on,  by


reason of any mentally --

medically determinable physical


or mental impairment  which can be  expected to result  in


death or which has lasted  or can be expected to last  for


12  months.  All it  requires is that  the impairment be a


long-term impairment  and if  that produces  even a  week-


long  inability  to  work, you're 

--  

you're  technically


within the language of that -- of that provision.


MR. LAMKEN: 

Justice Scalia, that might  be one


way of reading the statute, but it's not --

 QUESTION:  I think it's the only way to read the


statute.  I don't see how else you can read it. 


MR.  LAMKEN: 

We  disagree,  Your Honor. 

We


believe  that  you  read  the  two  requirements  together


sensibly so that they overlap.  And in fact --


QUESTION: 

It  is  my  understanding  of  your


position  is you're  saying  that  impairment,  given  the


context of  the statute, means a  constantly, continuously


disabling impairment, and disabling means that you are not


equipped to engage  in substantial -- whatever  SGA stands


--  

substantial  gainful  activity. 

So  that  the  word


impairment means a disabling impairment. 


MR. LAMKEN:  In effect, we're arguing, yes, that


the type of  impairment that Congress was  referring to is


an impairment that  prevents substantial gainful  activity


because that's the  type of impairment that  is referenced


in the statute. 


QUESTION: 

And  if it  isn't --

if  it doesn't


prevent  substantial gainful  activity,  then it  isn't an


impairment within the meaning of the section. 


MR. LAMKEN: 

It is not  the type of  impairment


that you  must have for 12  months.  That's  correct, Your


Honor.  That is a  correct characterization of our --

our


position.  I think if --


QUESTION: 

So,  if you  look just  at the  word

impairment  and  what  it  means,  you  get  back  to  the


inability to  do substantial  gainful employment  for that


interval of time.


MR.  LAMKEN:  Your  Honor, one way  you could --


you could put your emphasis  on the word impairment. 

The


Commissioner  has traditionally placed the emphasis on the


word  severe  in 423(d)(2)(A)  or  inability to  engage in


substantial gainful activity in  (d)(1)(A), but that would


be  one  way 

of  achieving  the  same  result  that  the


Commissioner has.  And that  is actually supported by  the


text of  the definition of impairment which makes it clear


that --


QUESTION:  I don't know  why you don't emphasize


the word which. 


MR. LAMKEN:  Pardon? 


QUESTION:  I  don't know why you  don't focus on


the word  which.  Does which  refer to both  inability and


impairment or just one of them? 


MR. LAMKEN: 

I think  as a grammatical  matter,


Justice Stevens,  we have to  confess that the  word which


refers to the impairment because  one would not ordinarily


expect the substantial gainful activity to result in death


or the inability -- better  still, the inability to engage


in substantial  gainful activity to result in  death.  But


focusing back --

for a continuous period of 12 months?  I don't know why.


MR. LAMKEN: 

Well, Justice  Stevens,  we'd  be


perfectly willing to  accept that if that  were your view,


but for  purposes  of this  case,  we --

we  have --

for


grammatical purposes,  we believe  that the phrase,  which


can  be  expected 

to  result  in  death, 

modifies  the


impairment  not the  inability  to  engage in  substantial


gainful activity. 


QUESTION: 

So, you don't think it means both of


which can be expected.  It just  means one of which can be


expected.  You're willing to accept that anyway. 


QUESTION: 

Where 

is 

the 

definition 

of


impairment?  I'm trying to find --


MR. LAMKEN: 

It's on page 71a,  Justice Scalia,


after the numeral 3 of the joint -- of the appendix to the


petition for writ of certiorari. 

It says:  for  purposes


of this subsection, a physical or mental  impairment is an


impairment -- it's  somewhat circular, we confess  -- that


results 

from 

an 

anatomical, 

physiological, 

or


psychological abnormality that is medically demonstrable.


That makes  it clear  that the  impairment isn't


necessarily just the underlying medical  condition, but it


says that  it's the -- an impairment that results from the

anatomical, physiological,  or psychological  abnormality.


So, in a sense the impairment  can be viewed not merely as


the medical  condition but  the result  of that  condition


such as in the case  of a mental impairment, inability  to


focus. 


QUESTION: 

I'm not  sure  that's necessarily  a


very precise reading of that section.  It says, impairment


results  from anatomical, physiological,  or psychological


abnormalities.  In  other words, the  results from is  the


abnormalities. 


MR. LAMKEN:  The impairment is what results from


the  abnormalities. 

The 

impairment  is 

what 

the


abnormalities produce. 


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. LAMKEN: 

So, if the  condition is, in  this


case schizophrenia, the impairment  would be the inability


to focus, the  inability to think clearly,  the impairment


of the cognitive functions is another way of putting it.


Your Honor, what  -- I believe that  the problem


with the  court of appeals'  approach of severing  the two


requirements  of  an  impairment 

--  

the  fact  that  the


impairment must  last 12  months and  that the  impairment


must be  one that is of  disabling severity --

is that it


does not -- it does not eliminate an ambiguity but creates


one.  Even if we were to severe those two entirely  and to

say  that the only  the --

that only the  impairment must


last 12  months, it's clear that the impairment must be of


disabling  severity  for some  period  of time  because it


would be absurd to suggest you're entitled to benefits for


a minute or a second or actually, Justice Scalia, with all


due respect, in my view for the week that you suggest. 


Given that there is an  implied duration of some


time for  the severity, that it  must be severe  enough to


preclude substantial  gainful activity for some  period of


time, it  is up to the  Commissioner to choose  the period


which makes  the most sense,  is most consistent  with the


statutory structure and Congress' intent. 


There are other  indicia of -- of  the structure


of the  statute that make it  clear that Congress  was not


contemplating short-term disabilities such as a week.  For


example, the statute  does not terminate benefits  just at


the moment when you are able to return to work.  Benefits,


instead, continue  for  an additional  2 months  following


that. 

If the statute is, as the Commissioner supposes, a


long-term  disability statute,  that  makes sense  because


those 2 months of additional  payments give you a time  to


transition back  to work, to  get ready to work  to find a


job. 


If  in  fact the  statute  is, as  the  court of


appeals has construed it, a short-term  disability statute

where benefits  are  payable when  you're out  only for  a


week, as Justice Scalia suggested, that would mean that an


individual who is  out of work  for a week,  because of  a


chronic  condition like  asthma,  anxiety, arthritis,  and


numerous ones  that last a year or more, would be entitled


to 2 months  of benefits plus the one  week for which they


are  briefly out.  It's hard to  believe that that was the


type of statute that Congress had envisioned. 


In addition, that  -- that view is  supported by


the repeated amendments  to the  statute that Congress 


--

repeated  amendments  to  the  definition  of 

disability


against the  backdrop of the  Commissioner's now  45-year-


old  settled construction. 

Years after  the Commissioner


first adopted her construction of  the statute in 1957, in


1965 Congress amended  the statute, and when  Congress did


so, it  did not merely  leave in place  the Commissioner's


by-then settled construction, instead Congress  reiterated


that  construction  in  the  committee  reports that  were


accompanying  it 

--  

accompanying  the 

amendments  and


described  the act  in precisely  the same terms  that the


Commissioner had through the regulations. 


Congress,  in  fact, 

rejected  a  proposal 


--

actually a bill -- from  the House of Representatives that


would have shortened  the duration requirement instead  of


to  12  months to  6  months, and  the  stated reason  for

rejecting that 6-month period was a disability -- it would


not be  sufficient to preclude the payment of benefits for


short-term  disabilities. 

Instead, 

as  the  committee


reports  stated,  it  was necessary  to  require  that the


individual be under a disability  for a period of more 


--

of  longer  than 6  months. 

Instead,  Congress  meant to


require  that  the  individual be  completely  and totally


disabled throughout a continuous period of 12 months.


Under the court of appeals --


QUESTION:  Well,  but actually  not because  you


can have these -- not the trial work, but the unsuccessful


work episodes.  So, you're able to --


MR. LAMKEN: 

That 

--  

that  is  part  of  the


definition of substantial  gainful activity.  It's  -- I'm


being somewhat imprecise when I say you're unable to work.


What you have  to be able to  do is engage in  substantial


gainful activity,  and if you return  to work for  a brief


period of time, for less than 6 months generally under the


Commissioner's regulations, and then your impairment comes


back  and prevents  you continuing that,  the Commissioner


will not treat that as  evidence to obtain -- evidence  of


your ability  to engage  in substantial  gainful activity.


In fact, it's  evidence of the opposite  because you tried


to go back  heroically, but your impairment  prevented you


from successfully doing that. 

So, it's clear that you're

not able to engage in substantial gainful activity. 


QUESTION:  So, the  term substantial modifies --


is directed  to the length of  the activity not  the daily


intensity of the activity. 


MR. LAMKEN:  It -- it -- the substantiality does


modify the  intensity of  the  activity, but  in terms  of


determining what kind  of evidence shows that  you're able


to  engage 

in  that 

activity,  the 

Commissioner  has


legislative authority to determine whether work -- whether


certain types of  work attempts  evidence your ability  to


engage in substantial  gainful activity.  And  using that,


the Commissioner said there were  just certain things that


should not count, such as unsuccessful work attempts, work


attempts generally that are terminated  within 6 months of


-- within 6 months' of when they begin. 


QUESTION:  Mr.  Lamken, this case is  unusual on


the facts  because he came very close to making the 1-year


limit, and there is the anomaly that they -- the person is


approved for receiving disability benefits  in month 8 and


then will be able to go on for 2 months  past the time the


disability ceases.  And yet, this person, through no fault


of his  own -- it's  kind of haphazard, by  chance the one


who  will 

make  it  and 

--  

because  it's  based  on  a


prediction, and  the one  who  maybe --

maybe the  Social


Security office is backlogged.  What is the reason for the

disparity in time of adjudication? 


MR. LAMKEN:  In fact, Your Honor, there were two


adjudications in  this case in a very short period of time


within  the filing  of benefits. 

The benefit  claim was


filed  in  March and  April  and in  the --

there  was an


initial adjudication on  May 18th, basically just  over 30


days  after the  April  application was  filed. 

In  that


adjudication, a licensed psychiatrist determined that  Mr.


Walton was, in fact, able to engage in substantial gainful


activity and that  his impairment  was not severe  enough.


He  sought  reconsiderations  in  June,  and  there 

--  

a


decision was issued in August. 


These are very  short time frames, and  they are


not  atypical. 

Typically  these  types  of  claims  are


processed  in 

less  than 

90  days 

for  the 

initial


adjudication. 


Now, regrettably there will be  occasions, as in


all  areas of law,  where the  outcome is affected  by the


timing  of  the  decision. 

And  that  is  true  because


sometimes evidence  develops in  the  interim which  would


allow one person to prevail where, if the adjudication had


happened earlier,  they would  not have  known about  that


evidence and the result would have been different.


But the  fact that  some individuals  may get  a


windfall  and  become  entitled to  benefits  based  on an

erroneous prediction of expectation does not mean that the


Commissioner is required to reach an erroneous result when


adjudicating a claim where he has actual evidence that the


individual  is  able  to  engage  in  substantial  gainful


activity, as occurred here. 


In  this  case 

there  is  evidence 

that  the


individual was able to engage  successfully in working for


2 solid  years, and the  Commissioner is  not required  to


ignore that probative, indeed  dispositive evidence simply


because the Commissioner might have made a mistake had the


claim been adjudicated earlier. 


QUESTION:  Mr.  Lamken, you said  -- one of  the


things you said  is if the Fourth Circuit  view prevailed,


there would  be a large increase  in the number  of people


who  qualified  for  disability  benefits. 

This  Fourth


Circuit decision  has been  in effect  now what? 

Over  a


year?


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Is there any  report of any swell  in


the approved applications in the Fourth Circuit?


MR. LAMKEN:  Your Honor,  I have -- do not  have


any information regarding that. 


But the -- one of  the major concerns about this


is it  substantially increases  the number  of people  who


have disabilities because no longer do you have to have an

impairment  which 

precludes  you  from  working 

for  a


substantial  period of  time, but  merely an --

a medical


condition that last  12 months. 

When  one considers  the


number of medical  conditions that  persist for 12  months


that are capable of disabling  somebody for a short period


of time, it clearly would have the effect of  establishing


a short-term benefits program that Congress did not intend


to create.


In fact,  we are  advised that  approximately 38


percent of all Americans have  an impairment -- a  medical


condition which  is chronic in the sense that it will last


12 months that is capable of  preventing them from working


for  short periods of  time. 

And -- when  construing the


definition of disability, it is  less plausible to believe


that Congress intended to pull in so many Americans and to


make all of their periods of absence of work on account of


conditions like asthma, angina, arthritis,  bad backs, and


the like which -- and turn them into disabilities.


QUESTION: 

If we  want to say --

and I take it


you want us  to say -- that  if the agency has  followed a


consistent and well-settled  interpretation policy over  a


long course of  time, it's entitled to  special deference,


is  that just Chevron,  or is  there some other  case that


tells  us this? 

What's the  best case authority  is what

 MR. LAMKEN:  Your Honor, we believe this is a --


a classic case of Chevron deference. 


QUESTION: 

Is there  another  case  other than


Chevron that -- that talks  about the length of time  that


the administration has --


MR. LAMKEN:  Oh, well, that would be classically


-- if you're  -- if  what you're referring  to is Mead  or


Skidmore deference, yes.  But even --


QUESTION: 

So,  it's Skidmore  or Chevron,  and


nothing --


MR. LAMKEN:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- nothing else.


MR.  LAMKEN: 

Those  are  the two  standards of


deference with which I'm familiar,  and in fact we believe


that we'd win under either one. 


QUESTION: 

Of  course, you  claim congressional


approval too. 


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  I  don't know whether that  falls in,


technically, a  deference category, but it gets you to the


same point. 


MR.  LAMKEN: 

Well, it 

--  

it  certainly adds


weight  to the  agency's view and  it may make  it so that


there is  only one  reasonable construction  of a  statute


that's ambiguous.

QUESTION:  Mr. -- Ms. Pryor. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHRYN L. PRYOR


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. PRYOR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


This case is  governed by the plain  language of


the statutes,  the language of the  disability definition,


which is the primary focus  of the first issue  presented,


and the  language of the trial work period and entitlement


statutes, which are the primary focus  of the second issue


presented. 


The plain language of the statutes and the early


legislative history demonstrate that from the inception of


the disability  program, Congress has balanced  its desire


to  restrict payment of benefits to  only those with long-


term  severe impairments with  its intention  to encourage


disabled  persons  to  try to  work. 

The Commissioner's


policy,  in  sharp contrast,  ignores  the work  incentive


prong of Congress' careful balancing act, focusing only on


the desire to  restrict payment of benefits even  to those


who  suffer with  clearly  disabling  impairments if  they


manage  to  attempt 

to  work  with  great 

courage  and


determination  and, despite continuing  severe impairment,

within 12 months of the onset of their disability. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Pryor, what -- what time limit do


you  pick?  I  mean, suppose  the person has  a disability


that indeed is expected to last more than 12 months but it


only has  caused  him to  black out  and  be incapable  of


working for 1 minute. 


MS. PRYOR:  Your Honor, I believe that --


QUESTION: 

Does that 1-minute  blackout entitle


him to come under the program? 


MS. PRYOR:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right.  What about a week? 


MS. PRYOR: 

The entitlement  statute I  believe


shows that  a person must be under a disability during the


5-month waiting  period.  So,  they must have  a condition


which  is severe  enough  to  prevent substantial  gainful


activity.


QUESTION: 

Excuse me.  I  just didn't hear you.


During the time of --


MS. PRYOR:  During the 5-month waiting period.


QUESTION:  During the 5-month.


QUESTION:  During the entire 5 months --


MS. PRYOR:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION: 

--  

the  disability  must 

--  

must


continue.


MS. PRYOR: 

Yes, Your Honor. 

And if -- and if

it continues beyond that, then they would then be entitled


to benefits.


QUESTION: 

What  establishes 

that? 

What


establishes the 5 months as -- as --


MS. PRYOR:  The entitlement statute, Your Honor,


which is set out at 423(a) --


QUESTION:  What -- what's the section?  423(a).


MS. PRYOR:  423(a), which is found at -- on page


64a  and  65a. 

And  that entitlement  statute  says that


you're entitled for  each month, beginning with  the first


month --


QUESTION:  Where are you reading from on 64a?


MS. PRYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I'm reading at page 65a


after it  says that  every individual  who is  insured and


meets these  criteria shall  be entitled  to a  disability


insurance benefit --


QUESTION: 

What part of the page?  What part of

MS. PRYOR:

after D.


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MS. PRYOR: 

Shall be  entitled to a  disability


insurance benefit for each month  beginning with the first


month after his waiting period.  So  -- and the -- and the


waiting period is defined on page 69a at 2 as  the waiting

period means the earliest period of 5 consecutive calendar


months throughout  which an  individual has  been under  a


disability. 


So, I believe that the entitlement  statute does


require that  the person be under a disability, be -- have


both  the impairment  and an impairment  at such  level of


severity throughout those 5 months. 

Beyond the 5 months,


they are  entitled to a  benefit for each  month beginning


with  the  first  month  they 

satisfy  all  criteria  of


entitlement. 


QUESTION: 

So, that  would be  the sixth  month


every time.  If that's --


MS. PRYOR:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And if you  started in -- in month  6


--  

let's 

take  this  case. 

The  man  did  engage  in


substantial gainful activity for 2 years.  Is that right?


MS. PRYOR:  Yes, ma'am. 


QUESTION: 

So, it starts  6 months after he has


been disabled and it continues until when?


MS. PRYOR: 

Your Honor, because the  trial work


period statute dictates  that a  person is  entitled to  a


trial  work  period  beginning  in  the first  month  he's


entitled to  benefits, he  would be  entitled to  benefits


beginning in April 1995, which is when he met all criteria


of entitlement, and he would  be entitled to a trial  work

period beginning that month.


QUESTION:  That's 9 months. 


MS. PRYOR: 

And -- yes,  Your Honor. 

It would


continue  for 9 months  once he started  working and would


continue --

then he would get the -- once they determined


at the  end of the trial work period, if they've concluded


that his work was continuing and showed he was now able to


engage in substantial  gainful activity,  he could be  cut


off after  those 2 -- 2 additional months. 

He would  be


subject to a  36-month re-entitlement period for  benefits


during any of those months. 


QUESTION: 

But in this -- in this case, when he


-- if he -- he starts at month 6, how many months actually


would he be getting disability benefits?


MS. PRYOR:  He returned  to substantial -- well,


he returned to  any work in May  of 1995, and he  would be


entitled  to  a 

9-month  trial  work  period 

plus  the


additional  3 months, and then  for any months during that

he could not work.

be when? 


MS.  PRYOR: 

It  would be 

--  

his actual  work


started end of May/June, then 9  months, plus additional 3


months, so approximately 14 months I believe. 


QUESTION: 

So, some considerable  time after he


has been restored to substantial gainful activity.


MS.  PRYOR: 

Yes,  Your  Honor. 

After  he 


--

because  that gainful activity is covered  by a trial work


period. 

There is  no  evidence in  this  case that  Mr.


Walton's  condition ever  medically improved. 

Therefore,


his  -- his return to work  is protected by the trial work


period  and  that  work  itself  cannot be  considered  as


evidence that his disability --


QUESTION:  But  once the period is  over, making


substantial gainful activity, even though, as you say, his


impairment continued, he would not be disabled.


MS. PRYOR:  That's correct.  Once his trial work


period had ended, he  would -- he could be cut off subject


to the re-entitlement period. 


QUESTION:  So -- so  the basic statutory problem


-- I think  -- I see where -- you're  debating whether you


become  entitled after  5 months  or  12 months,  and that


seems to  turn on the language in 70a.  And the Government


is reading  that -- basically there are many ways of doing


it, but  they're  reading it  to say  a  disability is  an

inability  by reason to  -- to  engage in  any substantial


gainful activity  by reason of an impairment, which can be


expected to result in death or has lasted, you know, for a


-- which can be expected to  result in death or which  has


lasted or can  be expected to  last. 

And at this  point,


they read into it the words:  at that level of severity.


MS. PRYOR:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And  my problem is, to  be absolutely


frank, I think you could read it at that level of severity


or you  don't have to read  it at that level  of severity.


And  the Government --

the Social Security Administration


has read  it the Government's way for 40 years, and nobody


has done  a  thing about  it. 

And  indeed, Congress  has


passed some laws that seem to think that's right.  And it


would  be a  major change  to  jump from  12  months to  5


months.  So, there we are. 


Now, what is your response to that? 


MS. PRYOR: 

Well,  Your Honor,  my response  is


that that requires this Court to read language into the --


into the definition.


QUESTION:  We do that all the time. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Language -- of course, you can't read


-- you can't --

if a statute refers to a  bear, you can't


call it a fish, but if a statute refers to an  animal, you

certainly can read in that it doesn't mean fleas.  I mean,


that's common. 

The statute -- it doesn't say which level


of severity.  It  doesn't say it, and so you  have to make


some assumption. 


MS. PRYOR: 

Your Honor,  I believe that  the --


reading  the  plain language  of  the statute 

--  

and the


Commissioner  has  conceded  this point  that  the phrase,


which  can be expected  to result  in death and  which has


lasted  or can be expected to last for at least 12 months,


refers to the impairment, not  to the inability to  engage


in substantial gainful activity. 

And I think that's  the


only logical reading  of that,  which is  what the  Fourth


Circuit found  because otherwise  you're  saying that  the


inability to engage in substantial gainful activity can --


can result  in death,  and  that really  doesn't make  any


sense. 


To read  -- read  it as  the Commissioner  would


have you do is -- it  seems to me is contrary to the  most


fundamental rule of  statutory construction, that Congress


must  be assumed to mean  what it says  in the statute and


that  when  the  language  of  the statute  is  clear  and


unambiguous, it should be enforced according to its terms.


QUESTION:  Ms.  Pryor, I think you  heard -- Ms.


Pryor? 


MS. PRYOR:  I'm sorry.

 QUESTION: 

The --

I asked  Mr. Lamken  are you


saying,  in  effect,  that  the  word impairment  means  a


disabling impairment.  Because I think you would agree too


that if you had a condition that severely disabled you for


1 week, excruciating back pain -- you couldn't do anything


-- but that  impairment continued at  a less severe  level


well  beyond  a 

year 

--  

it  didn't 

impede  you  from


substantial gainful activity -- you would not be disabled.


And yet, if you read the statute literally, you would be.


MS. 

PRYOR: 

Your 

Honor,  I 

believe  the


entitlement  provisions 

answer  that 

question. 

The


impairment  is  defined  at  page  71a as  only  being 


--

resulting from anatomical, physiological, or psychological


abnormalities. 

It  does  not 

contain  an  element  of


inability to engage in substantial  gainful activity.  The


severity requirement, on the other hand, does, and that --


but that has no durational requirement. 


QUESTION: 

The case  I  gave  you  it  says  a


condition that  can be  disabling. 

It was  severe for  a


short period of time. 


MS.  PRYOR: 

I  believe  that  the  entitlement


statute requires  that  it be  disabling  for at  least  5


months,  the -- the  waiting period. 

If it  is disabling


beyond the 5 months, then the person should be entitled to


benefits for those months while it remains severe.  At the

point that  it no longer remains severe, as defined by the


act, then that person could be  cut off, or if they return


to -- to work and  their condition has not improved,  they


would be entitled to a  trial work period and to  benefits


during that, at the end of which they could be cut off.


But I  believe the  entitlement statute  answers


that question by saying you must -- you must have a  -- an


impairment which  is at the  disabling level  for those  5


months.  If it continues at the disabling level beyond the


5 months, you're entitled to benefits for those months.


QUESTION: 

So, for  the 12  months, it  doesn't


matter  what  the level  of  severity is,  but  for the  5


months,  you  must  be  unable  to engage  in  substantial


gainful --


MS. PRYOR:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  That's --


MS. PRYOR:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  What  about --

what about (f)(3)

 QUESTION: 

It says  that a person  who has been


getting benefits may be  determined not to be entitled  to


benefits on  the basis of a  finding that the  physical or


mental impairment, on the basis of which such benefits are


provided, has ceased, does not  exist, or is not disabling


only  if such finding  is supported by. 

And then  you go


down to (3).  Substantial evidence which demonstrates that


as  determined on the basis of  new or improved diagnostic


techniques, the individual's impairment  or combination of


impairments is not as disabling as it was considered to be


at the  time of the  most recent prior decision  the he or


she  was  under  a  disability,  and  that  therefore  the


individual  is  able  to  engage  in  substantial  gainful


activity. 


That seems to imply that the disability consists


of a continuous inability to engage in substantial gainful


activity, not just a sporadic one. 


MS. PRYOR:  I believe what this was referring to


you, Your Honor, is that  the medical improvement must 


--

or in this case the new or improved diagnostic techniques,


must result in  that person's then  -- their condition  no


longer being of  such severity  as to prevent  substantial


gainful activity.


QUESTION:  Yes,  but all --

all it requires 


--

and that  therefore the  individual is  able to  engage in

substantial gainful activity. 

That implies that  so long


as he  can engage  in some  substantial gainful  activity,


it's 

--   

it  wouldn't  matter  if 

he  were 

disabled


sporadically  for a  day here  or  a day  there. 

So,  it


implies that it has to be a continuous inability to engage


in substantial gainful activity.


MS.  PRYOR: 

Your  Honor,  I believe  that this


whole  section 

refers  to 

termination  of 

disability


benefits --


QUESTION:  I understand. 


MS. PRYOR:  -- for somebody who's already --


QUESTION: 

I  understand. 

It  refers 

to


termination.  But  -- but what would apply  to termination


gives  you  some indication  of  -- of  what  -- what  the


initial condition is -- is expected to be.


MS. PRYOR:  Well, the impairment --


QUESTION: 

Namely,  a  condition of  continuous


inability to -- to work.


MS.  PRYOR: 

There  is a  severity  requirement


which is part of the -- the  definition, yes.  And I --

I


would not disagree with that. 


QUESTION:  But -- yes,  but -- but you say  that


that severity requirement has nothing to do with duration,


and this termination provision suggests  that it does have


something to do with duration --

 MS. PRYOR:  I don't --


QUESTION:  -- because  if you can engage in  any


substantial gainful activity, you're terminated,  assuming


that there's been the improvement in the condition.


MS. 

PRYOR: 

Your 

Honor,  once 

there  is


improvement and 

--  

and you  are now  able  to engage  in


substantial gainful activity, I would agree that you could


be terminated.  It's just that from the  outset you do not


have to have an impairment that --

that is known to be at


that level of severity for 12 months.  A person could have


an impairment  at that level of severity for 6 months, and


in the sixth month, after the  waiting period has expired,


they  become  entitled to  benefits. 

And  they --

they


continue to be entitled to  benefits as long as they  have


an impairment  which is at that  level of severity. 

Once


it's improved, they could be terminated. 


QUESTION: 

I think you're  right. 

I guess  it


doesn't get you --


QUESTION: 

What  if 1  week after  the 5  month


period a person goes  back to work?  Would  that mean they


just got benefits for a week? 


MS. PRYOR:  No, Your  Honor.  If they went  back


to work and unless their  condition had medically improved


-- if their condition had medically improved, then yes,  I


think they  could be terminated at  that point.

condition had not medically --


QUESTION: 

And the test of  medical improvement


would be  the ability to go back  to work which they could


not do before. 


MS. PRYOR:  Their ability to go back -- the fact


that they had gone back to work would then be protected by


a trial work  period, and -- and  would be -- that  -- the


fact  that  they were  working  would not  be  able to  be


considered as evidence that they  were no longer disabled.


However, if they  had, in  fact, medically improved,  they


could be terminated during that trial work period.


QUESTION:  May I also ask you?  I know you think


it not legally  significant, but do you disagree  with the


Government's 

position  that 

they 

have  consistently


interpreted the statute in this way for 40 years?


MS.  PRYOR: 

I  would  agree  that  they  have


consistently interpreted the statute in this way.


QUESTION:  And  -- and would you agree that they


correctly describe the legislative deliberations in 1956 I


think  it  was? 

But  you  just  say  they're 

totally


irrelevant. 


MS. PRYOR: 

Well, Your Honor, I would -- I have


referred to the legislative history in 1954, which is when


that definition of  disability was  first defined, and  in


that  instance,  the  1954  Senate  report delineated  two

aspects of disability evaluation, a medically determinable


impairment of serious proportions which  is expected to be


of long continued  and indefinite  duration and a  present


inability to  engage  in substantial  gainful activity  by


reason of that impairment. 


And they went on to  say that they wanted to  be


assured -- assured that only long-lasting impairments were


covered and that that provision  was not inconsistent with


efforts towards rehabilitation  because it, quote,  refers


only  to  the  duration  of the  impairment  and  does not


require prediction of  continued inability  to work. 

End


quote. 


Those  -- that's the first time Congress defined


what  disability is. 

And it  seems to  me from  the very


beginning, they make  clear that they wanted  to encourage


people to work, and -- and they did that by requiring that


the  impairment be  expected  to last  12 months,  but not


requiring that  the  inability to  engage  in  substantial


gainful activity lasts 12 months. 


I 

believe  Congress'  judgment 

is  expressed


unambiguously  in  the statutory  language  and is  -- and


that's confirmed by  the legislative  history and that  it


must not  be disturbed  simply because  the Commissioner's


longstanding  policy  is  at variance  with 

--  

with that


purpose.

 I would acknowledge that legislative history can


be  read  both  ways,  but 

it  seems  to  me  that 

the


contemporaneous  legislative history, when  Congress first


considered  the definition of  disability, should be given


more weight  and more weight even than that is the express


language of the statute. 


QUESTION:  One  other thing I just  wonder about


in a case like this.  Has this point been raised before by


litigants such as your client? 


MS. PRYOR:  Yes, Your  Honor.  Well, the --

the


issue  of  entitlement 

to  a 

trial  work  period 

and


entitlement to benefits has been decided by five courts of


appeals. 


QUESTION:  The  trial work period, but  -- but I


mean the 12 months versus 5 months as the --


MS. PRYOR:  The 12 --


QUESTION:  Has  anyone argued  this before  this


case?


MS. PRYOR:  Well, yes,  Your Honor.  The --

the


Massachusetts case  of  White  v.  Finch  considered  this


issue. 


The  Alexander  case,  I will  acknowledge,  the


Tenth Circuit case in 1971,  went the other direction, and


-- and they did find that -- that the 12 months applies to


the impairment at that level of severity.

 But that -- the Tenth Circuit case  of Walker v.


-- the Walker case in the Tenth Circuit has essentially --


it does not explicitly refer to  Alexander, but it clearly


finds that a person is entitled to -- to benefits and to a


trial  work  period 

even  though 

they  do  return 

to


substantial gainful activity  within -- after  the 5-month


waiting period but within 12 months of onset.  So --


QUESTION:  That refers to question 2.  Right? 


MS. PRYOR:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And  on question  2, if I  understand


you  correctly,  there  is  substantial  agreement in  the


courts of appeals that you're correct? 


MS. PRYOR:  Yes, Your Honor.  The five courts of


appeals have  -- or  four others,  other than  -- and  the


Walton case have -- have gone consistent --


QUESTION:  But that's not the case with question


1. 


MS.  PRYOR: 

Question  1  has  been  ruled  on


differently by different courts.


QUESTION:  Well,  question 2 hinges  on question


-- if  you lose  on question  1, you  lose on  question 2,


don't you? 


MS. PRYOR: 

No, Your Honor, I  don't believe we


do.  It's  a tougher call.  There's no  question, but even


if you  find that the  inability to engage  in substantial

gainful activity must last 12 months, the  language of the


entitlement statute  and the  -- the  prospective standard


required  by  the entitlement  statute, together  with the


expectancy  language  of 

the  disability  definition,  I


believe together require that benefits  be paid and that a


trial work period be available in this case.


QUESTION: 

Do you  agree with the  Government's


estimate that -- that if --

if you win in this case,  the


difference in -- in payouts under this program is going to


be something  like $8 billion a year? Is  it -- is it that


excessive? 


MS. PRYOR:  No,  Your Honor, I don't  agree with


that. 

I believe  those  are completely  unsubstantiated


figures  and  that, one,  this  isn't probably  the proper


forum  for  that. 

I  believe  that  should  properly be


addressed to Congress.  But secondly, I think that that --


those figures are based on a number of flawed assumptions.


Number one, Mr. Walton has never  suggested that


he is  entitled to  indefinite payment  of benefits  while


engaged in substantial  gainful activity.  Once  his trial


work period ends, that work can then be considered and his


benefits would  be cut  off.  In  addition, someone  whose


condition has medically improved, unlike Mr. Walton, could


be terminated from benefits prior to that, even before 


--

even during the trial work period.

 Secondly,  the Government  seems to  assume that


all  those  cases  which have  been  denied  on durational


grounds in the  past would  be approved  under the  Fourth


Circuit's ruling. 

That is far from  the case. 

A person


must still have an impairment which is expected to last 12


months and that  impairment must  still meet the  severity


requirement. 


Third, there  have been acquiescence  rulings in


effect for several  years, applying  the McDonald case  in


the  Seventh Circuit since  1988, the  Walker case  in the


Tenth Circuit  since 1992, the  Newton case in  the Eighth


Circuit since 1998, and the Salamalekis  case in the Sixth

QUESTION: 

Can I ask you  before -- can  I just


ask you quickly if you're -- simply repeating these, which


I -- is that  on question 2,  am I  right in  thinking we


don't reach question 2 if you lose on question 1?


QUESTION:  That's what I asked.


MS. PRYOR:  No, Your Honor, I don't believe that


is the case.


QUESTION: 

And that's what I didn't understand.


That's what I thought maybe  you answered.  But why  would


we reach  it because how --

if you're not  entitled -- if


you lose  question 1, the person never  became entitled to


Social Security,  and the statute  says a period  of trial

QUESTION:  But what's the response to that? 


MS. PRYOR:  No, sir.  I would -- I would  -- you


must  be entitled to  benefits to  be entitled to  a trial


work period.  However, I don't think that finding that the


12-month duration requirement applies to  the inability to


engage in -- in substantial gainful activity means that we


lose on entitlement.  The entitlement --


QUESTION: 

That's what 

--  

but what  I didn't


understand is  if you lose on  question 1 and  your client


therefore is not  entitled to Social Security,  isn't that


the end of the case?  We don't have to reach question 2.


MS. PRYOR:  That's what I disagree on. 


QUESTION:  Yes, because --


MS.  PRYOR: 

But  the definition  of disability


isn't  the final part of that because the person can -- if


the 

entitlement 

statute 

requires 

a 

prospective


consideration of the criteria of entitlement, every person


who's insured, has not attained  retirement age, has filed


an application, is under a disability shall be entitled to


disability  insurance benefits  for  each month  beginning

with the  first month after his  waiting period. 

At that


time if you look at the requirements of entitlement at the


time of his  application in  April 1995,  he was  entitled


beginning 

that 

month 

because 

he 

met  all 

other


requirements --


QUESTION:  That -- that's --


MS. PRYOR:  -- and  he had a disability even  if


you look at disability as an expectation --


QUESTION:  Well,  but if you lose on question 1,


he didn't have a disability.


MS.  PRYOR:  If he --

even if there was at that


time  an  expectation  that  his  inability to  engage  in


substantial gainful activity must last 12 months.


QUESTION:  I'm going have  to -- you're going to


have to write  -- somebody is going to have to write this.


So -- so suppose the first conclusion is your client never


became entitled  to Social Security. 

Never.  You  have a


lot of different reasons why he did, but suppose every one


of  them is rejected,  which maybe  they wouldn't  be, but


assume that.  Then do we reach question 2? 


MS. PRYOR:  If he's never entitled --


QUESTION:  Yes, never entitled.


MS. PRYOR:  -- then  I agree he is not  entitled


to a trial work period.


QUESTION: 

All right. 

So, we have  to decide,

for whatever  theories you may have,  whether he is  or is


not entitled.


MS. PRYOR:  My only  difference with what you're


saying, Your Honor, is that he can be entitled even if you


find the  duration applies to  the inability to  engage in


substantial gainful activity.


QUESTION:  That that is because? 


MS. PRYOR:  And that  is because the entitlement


statute  is  a  prospective  standard  from the  point  of


application, and the --


QUESTION: 

Oh, yes, of  course.  It  could turn


out that your client, even though  he hasn't been disabled


at  a level of  severity for  12 months, nonetheless  is a


person that when they decided it I guess, the person -- it


could have been after 8 months, and the decider could have


said, oh, but it can be -- it will  be expected to last at


this level of severity.


QUESTION:  Well,  I guess you take  the position


that it  doesn't  have to  be  decided, that  the  statute


itself says --


MS. PRYOR:  Thank you. 


QUESTION: 

-- the person is entitled at the end


of the 5 months.


MS. PRYOR:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  That's your position.

 MS. PRYOR:  That is my position. 


QUESTION:  It doesn't require a decision maker.


MS. PRYOR:  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  But if --

but if -- if we  determine


that  in  fact  the  disability 

level  must  be  as  the


Government  claims, 

then  in 

a  case 

in  which 

the


determination is made  before the  12-month period and  at


that  time the  person  is back  working at  a substantial


level so that  the determination is properly made that the


person never qualified, then there would be  no reason, in


a case  like that, ever to proceed to the second question.


Isn't that correct?


MS. PRYOR:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


QUESTION: 

May I ask this one question?  I just


want  to  be  sure  I  haven't  missed  something  in  the


argument. 

You  agree, as  I understand  it,  there is  a


severity  requirement in the impairment. 

And what is the


severity requirement? 


MS.  PRYOR: 

Your  Honor, that  is  set out  in


(d)(2) of 423,  which is -- it's  found at page 70a. 

And


that provides that an individual shall be determined to be


under  a  disability  only  if 

his  physical  or  mental


impairment or impairments  are of such severity  that he's


not only  able -- unable to do his  past work but can't do

other work. 


The equivalent of that or even a higher standard


of  that  is meeting  a listing  of impairments,  which my


client did, and he -- he met the listing --


QUESTION: 

If I understand  you, you're  saying


that the -- that the severity requirement is an  inability


to engage in substantial work.


MS.  PRYOR:  Well, but --

yes.  And considering


you can't do your past work or other work considering age,


education, and work experience. 


But another part  of that is meeting  a listing,


which is a higher level,  and the listings are defined  as


those  impairments  which are  presumed  to be  -- prevent


someone from being able to engage in any gainful activity,


not  just  substantial gainful  activity. 

My  client was


found twice  by the administrative  law judge as  being --


having a listing-level impairment.  So, by definition, he


met the severity requirement and  he met that at the  time


of both hearings, the second of which was  more than 2 and


a half years after its onset date. 


QUESTION: 

It seems  to me  that I --

I really


have 

trouble  understanding 

if 

there's  a 

severity


requirement measured by inability to  work for a period of


time, why that severity requirement  wouldn't continue for


the  entire  period  under  the  statutory  definition  of

impairment.  That's what I'm having trouble understanding.


MS. PRYOR: 

Well, first of all, Your Honor, the


severity requirement does not have a durational element to


it.  There's nothing in that --


QUESTION:  It doesn't say so, but the -- but the


disability has  a durational  requirement and  it's not  a


disability unless it's severe enough. 


MS.  PRYOR: 

Well, 

the  impairment 

has  a


durational --


QUESTION:  Impairment I should say. 


MS.  PRYOR: 

And  -- and  there  is a  separate


severity requirement, but I don't believe that the statute


says that --

that it must last at that  level of severity


for  12  months. 

Once  you  no  longer  have  a  severe


impairment, I would  agree that you  can -- your  benefits


can be terminated. 

But it does not require that  -- that


at the  outset there must be  an expectation that  it will


persist at  that  level  of severity  for  the  entire  12


months. 


And I believe that the legislative history gives


the  reason  for that. 

Congress wanted  to  balance its


desire  to restrict payment of benefits with its desire to


encourage  people  to  try  to  go  back  to  work. 

The


Commissioner's policy has  the opposite effect. 

It tells


people stay home for 12 months or at least until your case

is adjudicated,  before you try to work.  I believe that's


a clear  disincentive for people like my client who are --


who are attempting  to work  despite the  fact that  their


impairment remains severe.


QUESTION: 

Does  the  record  tell  us  what's


happened to the respondent in the interim? 


MS. PRYOR:  Your Honor, he -- this is not in the


record, but he subsequently reapplied and is on disability


benefits based on the subsequent application.


There is no question in this case that Cleveland


Walton would have  been paid disability benefits  long ago


had he  merely stayed home until after his hearing and not


tried  to work. 

Instead, he  has been penalized  for his


courage and his  motivation in trying to  work despite his


continuing listing-level impairment. 


The  Commissioner's policy violates  the express


language 

of  the  statute. 

It 

is  contrary  to  the


legislative  history  of  the  disability  program and  to


longstanding  agency 

regulations. 

And 

it  has  been


repeatedly  rejected  by courts  of  appeals and  district


courts throughout the Nation. 

The Commissioner's  policy


is also contrary to sound public policy concerns which are


are reflected both  in the legislative history  and in the


case law. 


Accordingly,  the  Commissioner's  unlawful  and

ill-advised policy should be rejected so that other highly


motivated disabled persons like  Cleveland Walton will not


be penalized in the future for their good faith efforts to


work. 


I'd be happy to address  any other questions you


might have. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Pryor. 


Mr. Lamken, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. LAMKEN:  I would like to begin by addressing


the 5-month trial work -- excuse me -- the 5-month waiting


period.  And it's important  to emphasize that for a  very


large  and important  component  of  the  Social  Security


program, the SSI program, the Supplemental Security Income


disability program,  there is  no 5-month  waiting period.


So, for anyone  who's applying for SSI  disability income,


they  -- that person, under  respondent's and the court of


appeals' interpretation, would be entitled to benefits for


a  very brief period of  inability to work  so long as the


underlying medical condition, such as asthma or arthritis,


can be expected to last or has lasted 12 months.  It is in


view  of  the 

structure  of 

the  act,  including 

the


continuation  of  the  payments  for  2 months  after  the


disability  ceases,  hard to  believe  that that  was what

Congress had in mind. 


Second, I  should  emphasize  that  the  5-month


waiting period isn't part of the definition of disability.


What it is  is it operates like a deductible.  It provides


a period  of time  during which  the individual  bears the


burden  of  their  disability  themselves  and  saves  the


Government the --

saves the  Government money that  would


have  to be paid  for that  individual. 

But it  does not


determine  what is a disability. 

It only determines what


period of disability will be  paid for and compensated  by


the Government. 


I'd like to  also turn to  mention for a  moment


the legislative  history. 

The  legislative history  upon


which respondent relies is for  a separate program enacted


2 years  before the disability program at issue here.  The


disability program issued in 1956.  When Congress enacted


it, it clearly understood that the inability to  engage in


substantial gainful activity,  the disability itself,  was


going to  have  to last  the  requisite duration  and  not


merely the medical  -- not  merely the medical  condition.


And  when  Congress  changed 

the  duration  from 

long,


continued, and indefinite, which was the original term, to


12 months,  it specifically  understood that  the 12-month


period applied  to the impairment at a  disabling level of


severity.

 And the -- the Senate report, which is quoted on


page 36  of our brief, makes  that lucid.  It  states that


the act, as amended, would provide for disability benefits


for an insured worker who has  been or can be expected  to


be totally disabled  throughout a continuous period  of 12


calendar 

months,  and  a  6-month  period  was  rejected


specifically because  it would provide benefits for short-


term disabilities. 


Finally, in terms  of incentives, the  incentive


to return  to work before there is an actual disability is


properly addressed by the Commissioner's unsuccessful work


attempt regulations. 


In addition, the  court of appeals' construction


is an overbroad response that actually deters returning to


work because it would provide benefits not merely to those


like  Mr.  Walton  who have  a  long-term  impairment that


briefly disables them and then  heroically return to work,


but  also  those  who  have  a long-term  impairment  that


briefly disables them and do not actually  return to work.


The vast majority of  applicants who seek benefits do  not


return to work, and  those -- and those  individuals would


receive  benefits despite an ability to return to work and


their failure to do so. 


If there are no further questions. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Lamken.
