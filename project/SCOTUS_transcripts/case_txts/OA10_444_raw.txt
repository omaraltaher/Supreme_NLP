12  prejudice.  But in Mr. Frye's case, that test was not 
13  met.  The truth is, despite counsel's error, Mr. Frye 
14  knowingly waived his right to trial and solemnly 
15
16  has failed to show prejudice, and therefore his guilty 
17  plea remains voluntary, intelligent, and final. 
 Mr. Frye may not assert ineffective

could have gotten a better deal on an earlier date.

 This is such an unusual case, because the

2  assume that the plea offer had been made and that he 
3  would have taken it before the January court date that 
4  was set?

6  but not impossible, I would say.  And it would depend on 
7  a myriad of circumstances, many of which are as -- as --
8  could be just dependent on the defense counsel's own 
9  personal schedule.
10
11  agreement has been made between a prosecutor and a 
12  defense counsel, the scheduling of a plea I think is 
13  largely a basis of convenience and does not 
14  necessarily -- is not necessarily based on the 
15
16
17  defendant might think, you know, there is really bad 
18  evidence out there that they don't have yet.  And if

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm really puzzled by what 
7  as a practical matter is at stake in this case.  Under 
8  the State court decision, the defendant has the option 
9  of either pleading guilty to the charge, in which case 
he will be right back where he is now, or he can insist 
10
11 
on a trial. 
12
13  prove that he was driving with a revoked license.  That 
14  seems to me -- if there ever was a slam-dunk trial, that 
seems to me that's the slam-dunk trial.  You introduce 
15
16  the records of -- showing that his license was revoked, 
17  and you have the officer testify on such and such a date 
18  he was driving.  So, I don't really see what is involved 
19  in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't see what is at stake 

 MR. KOSTER:  The last part of the question 

 Am I wrong?  Am I missing something?

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But we take the case on 

1
2  prosecutor myself, I would agree with this.  This
 
3  gentleman went into court.  He had two options before
 
4  him.  There was not a third option.  The -- the plea
 
that was -- that left reality on December 28th was not 
5
6  there on March 3rd.  He had a binary choice between two 
7  options on March 3rd.  He chose not trial.  By choosing 
8  not trial, it leaves us without a situation where either 
9  Hill or Premo prejudice can be shown.
10
11  the assumption that he hadn't heard of the earlier 
12  better offer.  Am I wrong about that? 
13
14  unaware of the earlier better offer.  That is correct. 
But in this case also, the defendant went out 2 days 
15
16  later and picked up a fifth charge.  So, one of the 
17  considerations that I think has to be left with the 
18  Court is that the possibility that this particular 
19  defendant was ever going to see this plea offer is 
20
21  revoked. 
22
23  this on -- isn't there an assumption that there's a 
24  finding, or some lower court judge made a finding that 
if he had known about the better deal that was offered, 
25

almost nil.  This was his fifth arrest for driving while

 MR. KOSTER:  But there is also an important 
7  element in the record, that when he went in front of the 
8  court on March 3rd and the felony offer was given to the 
9  judge, which was 3 years and defer on probation plus 10 
days' shock time, the judge in Columbia, Missouri, gave

the felony offer the back of his hand.

 MR. KOSTER:  -- through a -- a
 

standard and, more importantly, a misreading of where 
Hill and Premo takes us.  Cert was granted on this case 
just at the same time that Premo was very clearly 
re-articulating the Hill standard.

18  performance and prejudice test. 
 And that's what we are asking be reversed.
19
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose he had snapped up 
20
21  this deal as soon as it was offered.  By the time he 
22  appeared before the court to answer a formal plea of 
23  guilty, would the court have known that he had in the

2  your position, that this is not a Sixth Amendment

 MR. KOSTER:  I do not -- there is a factual 
question as to whether or not plea negotiations in this

10
11  mean, we don't take cases to figure out those -- those, 
12  you know, picky, picky factual questions.  The issue 
13  that I thought was important here is whether this is a 
14  critical stage when -- when the defendant is not -- does

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if it were a critical

only if he was a lousy lawyer and didn't know the law,

1  stage.  If it results in a guilty plea and the -- and 
2  the attorney has not done sufficient research to uncover 
3  a defense, it can be set aside then.  So, it's -- so, 
4  you're saying it's not a critical stage depending on

6
 I thought we were going to tell attorneys, 
7  you have an obligation during the plea bargain process 
8  to use professional competence.  And you say, well, you 
9  do or you don't.  That doesn't make much sense.
10
11  is that attorneys are guaranteed to the accused at 
12  critical stages, such as arraignments, plea hearings, 
13  trials, but then there is an implied guarantee that 
14  comes with that critical stage, and that implied 
15
16  will do research, analysis, and preparation that 
17  prepares him for the critical stage. 
18
19  Saturday night with a file open in his lap preparing for 
a case on Monday, that moment is not a critical stage of 
20
21  trial, on a Saturday night in his den, but it prepares 
22  for, it is precedent to, a critical stage.  And the 
23  failure to engage in that preparation analysis can lead 
24  to performance and prejudice at critical stages, but it

guarantee is that their -- that the attorney appointed 

itself is not.

 But when David Boyce is sitting home on a

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the -- the 

1
2  question -- I make a counter-assumption.  The problem 
3  that I -- I have the feeling that I'd like you and the 
4  others to comment on, is that you're worried deeply 
about a practical problem, and that the practical 
5
6  problem is that it would be too easy, as just was 
7  suggested by the question, to find that the lawyer, 
8  after the defendant is convicted, did a bad job during 
9  the plea negotiation, in which case everybody will get 
10

 That won't work here, I don't think.  So 
18
19  suppose what we did, instead of saying there was no 
right, you simply said you have to prove with some 
20
21  certainty, work out a standard, that there really was 
22  inadequate assistance during the plea bargaining, and 
23  you have to show something more than a reasonable 
24  probability that this would have led to the plea, et 
25

two or three bites at the apple.  And one of the reasons 
for that is every brief has been lifting the standards, 
particularly in respect to prejudice, from Hill, which 
was addressing a different question.  It was addressing 
the question of missed -- bad performance by the lawyer 
at trial.  And that's hard to track what the effects 
are, and it isn't that hard to say the trial was unfair, 
give him a new one.

that occur between -- at the -- at the plea bargaining

stage, but that prejudice does not occur until we return 
to a critical stage, which is -- is when that -- when 
12 
13 
that plea, when the product of that plea negotiation is 
returned to a critical stage, and then it has critical 
14 
stage protections over it, where the judge is there, and 
15
16 
there's an allocution and the rest of the protections --

18  open plea that was made -- that's a critical stage.  In 
19  fact, he took a plea.  But he, I think, has a plausible

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG 

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

 MR. YANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, 

 When a defendant pleads guilty --

 MR. YANG:  No, we're not --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not a critical --
 MR. YANG:  We are not taking the view.  In 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you taking the same 
1
2  position your -- I don't want to call him co-counsel --
3  Petitioner's counsel is taking, that you are not 
4  entitled to an attorney at plea bargaining, unless you 
waive your -- unless you waive your right to a trial? 
5

8
9  this case, the alleged deficiency is not really an 
interaction between the prosecution and the defense 
10
11 
counsel in plea bargaining.  The alleged deficiency is a 
failure to inform the defendant of things the defendant 
12 
13 
would want to know as going forward, and we're -- we are 
willing to assume the defendant has a right to be 
14 
properly informed by counsel.  But with any Strickland 
15
claim, the relevant inquiry is whether or not the 
16 
17 
defendant has shown cognizable prejudice as a result of 
a deficient performance by the counsel.

 MR. YANG:  A -- a guilty plea wipes free all 

counsel at all in the proceedings, that would be 

1  constitutional errors.  The one challenge that --
2
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, I think, Mr. Yang, what 
3  Justice Sotomayor was suggesting is that your position 
4  does in fact require you to say that if there were no 
5
6  perfectly -- you know, there would not be a 
7  constitutional problem with that.  Once he pleads 
8  guilty, it just wipes away the fact that no counsel has 
9  been appointed for him.
10
11  kinds of constitutional violations that went before. 
12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but the guilty -- I 
13  mean, no, the reason that is not true is that the guilty 
14  plea must be entered with advice of counsel.  You 
15
16
17
18  erase everything if it has been entered without advice 
19  of counsel.
20
21  guilty plea is entered, this Court has held that the one 
22  remaining challenge that would be allowed is the 
23  challenge to the knowing and intelligent waiver of the 
24  right to trial, which is what the guilty plea is.  Now, 
25

 MR. YANG:  Correct.  And the guilty plea --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, the guilty plea doesn't 

acknowledge that, don't you? 

 MR. YANG:  Correct.  When the counseled 

in order to show that you were prejudiced --

 MR. YANG:  We are not taking the position 

 MR. YANG:  We are not saying that -- that --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  All the negotiations could 

1
2  Yang, a State could set up a system where it says we're 
3  going to do all our negotiating with the defendant with 
4  no counsel present in the room, but we're going to keep 
a lawyer on board just in the courtroom to advise him 
5
6  whether he should plead -- you know, what -- you know, 
7  to advise him about the plea that he has struck, even 
8  though he struck this plea with no counsel in the room, 
9  and that would be perfectly okay?
10
11
12  be uncounseled. 
13
14  that States can deprive counsel or deprive counsel from 
participation in the guilty plea process.  But what we 
15
16  are saying --
17
18  you can say that.  It seems --
19
20

 MR. YANG:  Just as we're not saying that 
23
24  there can be coerced confessions, not just like we're 
25

 MR. YANG:  No --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You are saying that, because 
you're saying that in the end, the guilty plea wipes all 
constitutional error away. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I don't understand how 

saying that a statute can impermissibly burden the right 

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 What the Court recognized is when you plead 

1  to trial by putting a death sentence on -- that's 
2  available only when you go to trial.  We're not saying 
3  any of that is allowed.  But what we are saying is 
4  when a -- and that was the Brady trilogy, Brady and 
McMann and ultimately in Tollett, which led to Hill. 
5
6
7  guilty in open court, you are waiving your right to 
8  trial.  And the relevant inquiry, the only inquiry once 
9  the defendant has admitted guilt, is to determine 
whether or not the waiver of the trial rights were 
10
11 
knowing and voluntary.  And the reason that that is a 
relevant inquiry is because you have a constitutional 
12 
13 
right to trial, and due process requires that the waiver 
of those trial rights be knowing, intelligent, and 
14 
voluntary. 
15
16
17  question and said:  You need to show deficient advice in 
18  the context of pleading guilty; and in addition, you 
19  need to show that that prejudiced you because, absent --
20
21  actually not waived your right to trial; you would have 
22  asserted your right to trial and gone to trial.  That's 
23  the standard that applies. 
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If defense counsel gives 
wrong information to the defendant about witnesses that 

 And in Hill, the Court confronted the

relevant --

 MR. YANG:  It can, and because what's 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right, so -- and 

 MR. YANG:  Right, right.  The key is that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why -- why is there no 
problem when he doesn't adequately advise a client of 
earlier better offers? 

1  can testify on his behalf and so forth, very bad legal 
2  advice, that's -- that can be ground for setting aside 
3  the plea, correct? 
4
5
6
7  that's because counsel pre the entry of the plea did not 
8  adequately advise his client. 
9
10
11 
12 
13
14  -- when you plead guilty and your counsel has advised 
you wrongly in a way that would have changed your mind 
15
16  about the merits of going forward on trial, you can show 
17  that the waiver of the trial right is something that was 
18  prejudiced.  But because -- had you known, had you been 
19  properly advised, you would have exercised the whole 
20
21  goes to trial, not only a right to a trial by jury but 
22  all the trial rights that go with it. 
 But when you instead plead guilty in open 
23
24  court -- and the claim here is not that the defendant 
25

panoply of rights that the Constitution provides one who 

would have exercised his rights to trial.  The claim is 

 MR. YANG:  It's a different prejudice.  The 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

those 10 other guys come up with a favorable plea deal 

1  he would have waived his rights to trial either way. 
2  That is not prejudice to the -- that would overcome the 
3  guilty plea, which again rests on --
4
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Yang, there are 
different kinds of unfairness.  One kind of unfairness 
5
6  is when you're badly advised and you, therefore, waive 
7  your right to trial when you would have gone.  But 
8  there's another kind of prejudice, which is, you know, 
9  you and 10 other guys are all in the same situation, and 
10
11  because their lawyers are paying attention, and you come 
12  up with an unfavorable plea deal because your lawyer has 
13  fallen asleep.  And to the extent that we have an 
14  effective assistance right that means something, that 
15
16
17  whether or not there was a prior error, once you plead 
18  guilty, the question is not whether there were other 
19  deals on the table; the question is whether that waiver 
20
21
22  question.  Why isn't that the question? 
23
24  question, it would call into -- this Court, in -- in 
25

unfairness needs to be addressed by it, doesn't it? 
 MR. YANG:  Well, when -- again, once --

going back to Brady and then in Boykin, explained that 

of --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess that's the 

 MR. YANG:  Well, right, but if it were the 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 What we have here is not anything associated 

1  what's -- the relevant question when you enter a guilty 
2  plea is whether you have waived your rights to trial 
3  validly.  And, in fact, that has to be spread upon the 
4  record.  Rule 11(b) has now been modified by this Court 
to go through the things you have to check to make sure 
5
6  that that waiver of your trial rights are knowing and 
7  voluntary.

defendant is claiming is some entitlement be able to 
take another deal that would not have resulted in trial. 
But that is not relevant to the waiver of trial rights. 
That would be recognizing another type of right.  But 
this Court has repeatedly held that there is no right to 
a guilty plea, there is no right to plea bargaining; 
once you have a plea agreement, there is no right to 
enforcement.  The only rights that come into play is 
when that guilty plea is rendered into a judgment.  And 
when you don't get there, but instead you plead guilty 
and you have waived your rights to trial, you have 
consented to the entry of judgment, and even if you had 
received better advice you would have consented to 
the -- you would not have gone forward to trial, you 
have -- the basis on which the conviction rests remains 
valid.  And that's what --

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

guilty, is whether or not you would have, if properly 
advised, insisted on your trial rights and gone to 
trial.  That's the standard set forth in Hill.  And the 
reason --

1
2  got what you deserved, right? 
 MR. YANG:  Precisely.  And this Court in 
3
4  Premo addressed the exact same question.  In Premo, 
there was a contention that had counsel done better 
5
6  before by filing a motion to suppress, it would have 
7  been in a better position to secure a better plea 
8  agreement from the prosecution.  But the Court concluded 
9  that, no, the relevant inquiry, once you have pled 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  a plea opportunity that he lost due to counsel's 
17  conceded inadequacy?  And I think it is accepted that 
18  not telling him of the plea offer was ineffective 
19  representation.  Is there any case where the defendant 
20
21
22
23  a trial, right.

1  to go to trial and he's going to plead guilty, is there 
2  any circumstance where he could regain that lost 
3  opportunity? 
4
guilty and he validly waived his rights to trial because 
5
6  he would not have asserted them, then I think under Hill 
7  what you have is a defendant who admits guilt, there's 
8  no real risk of any kind of error in that determination, 
9  and the judgment which must be set aside -- remember, we 
10
11  the admission of guilt and the waiver of trial.  The 
12  judgment cannot be set aside at that point, because this 
13  Court has long recognized the -- the special force of 
14  finality with respect to guilty pleas.  That's because 
15
16
 First, guilty pleas are an important part of 
17  the system, and it would be -- both delay and impair the 
18  orderly administration of justice any time we open 
19  another avenue to challenge guilty pleas.  But, two, 
20
21  admitted guilt, there is almost no risk of error, and 
22  the defendant has gotten the proper sentence and the

 Galin Frye entered a plea of guilty to 
7  felony driving while revoked and was sentenced to 3 
8  years in prison.  His trial lawyer failed to inform him 
9  that the prosecutor was willing to allow him to accept a 
plea offer to a misdemeanor charge and recommend 90 days 
10
11 
in jail.  Fundamental fairness and reliability of 
criminal process requires that an attorney provide his 
12 
13 
client information regarding matters in his case. 
14
the law to apply to this individual the punishment he 
15
16  deserved for the crime that he committed?  I mean, the 
17  object of the system is to put -- is to punish people 
18  who commit crimes in a certain degree. 
19
20
21  What could be more fair than that? 
 MR. QUEENER:  Fairness includes a whole 
22
23  range of sentencing options.  And in this case, the 
24  prosecutor was making a determination of what was fair 
25

 And here he admitted he did the crime, and 
he got the degree of punishment that the law provides. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  Why is it unfair for 

in this case when he made the offer. 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. QUEENER:  Part of the consideration that 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's true, and he did 

been guilty of more than what the prosecutor had 

liability that he's willing to accept in entering a plea 
of guilty. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ex ante, I suppose you 
1
2  could say that.  But when you look at it later, it's 
3  clear that that would have been unfair.  In fact, this 
4  individual was perfectly willing to admit that he had 
5
6  offered. 
7
8  a defendant has to make during the plea bargaining 
9  process or plea negotiation process is determining the 
10
11 
12
13  that when he entered the plea of guilty.  You -- you do 
14  not contest he was well advised when he entered that 
plea that it was knowledgeable and he admitted that 
15
16  that's what he had done and was willing to accept the 
17  degree of punishment prescribed by law. 
18
19  plea in terms of what he was admitting to, he was 
willing to and had to agree that he had committed the 
20
21  crime of driving while -- while revoked.  But the plea 
22  was open in terms of sentencing, and he was allowed to 
23  argue for something lower than the sentencing.  He only 
24  knew that was the available options at that time.
25

 MR. QUEENER:  Well, he was -- the guilty 

 He wasn't aware that the prosecutor had made

 And, number two, identify the right he was

7  made his plea unknowing or involuntary, number one? 
8
9  deprived of, substantive or procedural, by his 
10
11
12  involuntary because he was not made aware by his 
13  counsel's unprofessional representation of all of the 
14  circumstances available to him, the consequences of 
15
16  90-day on a misdemeanor if he had been aware of that. 
17
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose he had been told 
18  that -- suppose he had been told that, and the 
19  prosecutor said, well, yes, that's true; I made that 
20
21  was then off the table.  So, what good would it have 
22  done him to know about something that happened in the 
23  past but was no longer available? 
24
25

 MR. QUEENER:  Well, this offer was only no 
longer on the table at the time he entered the plea of 

entering that guilty plea, that would have included the 

offer, but it's off the table now.  And apparently, this

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I understand that, and 

1  guilty, because it had expired, and that was a result of 
2  counsel's ineffectiveness in failing to communicate that 
3  to him.  The lower court, the court of appeals, made a 
4  finding that this offer was available, and he could have 
taken advantage of it before it expired.  And that was a 
5
6  finding by the court below. 
7
8  it may have been unfair, but I don't see why it's 
9  involuntary.  Because I don't see that -- advising him 
that he had an option at some point in the past which 
10
11 
was no longer available really doesn't have much of a --
doesn't have any bearing on the voluntariness of his 
12 
13 
plea to a later less-favorable offer. 
14
15
16  it then.  It's not that it's involuntary now because 
17  that he knows it.  It was involuntary because he didn't 
18  know it then. 
19
20
21  expires.  Then there's a guilty plea hearing.  And he 
22  doesn't -- and the defendant enters a -- a guilty plea 
23  but doesn't know about the prior offer.  Is -- is there 
24  injury?
25

 MR. QUEENER:  I -- that's -- it seems to me 
that that's involuntary in the sense that he didn't know

which a plea offer's made, not communicated, and

1  increase in sentence.  And that's the situation here.
 
2
3  involuntary?  Is it -- pardon me.  Is it unknowing?
 
4
5
6  would he have done had he known? 
7
8  that he did not know the full consequences of --
9
10
11  earlier. 
12
13  about that is the potential consequence that he is 
14  choosing in deciding to plead guilty.  And if I may, 
that's the second part of your question.  The right that 
15
16  he has is the right to make fundamental decisions in his 
17  case, one of which is to accept a plea bargain and plead 
18  guilty. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Doesn't -- doesn't the rule 
19
that the plea offer may be withdrawn at any time by the 
20
21  prosecutor -- indeed, even after it has been accepted --
22  doesn't that well enough establish that there is no 
23  right to profit from that plea offer, that there is no 
24  constitutional right he's been deprived of, given that 
25

the prosecutor can withdraw it even after he accepts it? 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. QUEENER:  That can be -- excuse me --

He is entitled to the right to make a knowing and 

1

3  time by the prosecutor, but we're not arguing that there 
4  is a right to a particular plea -- a particular plea. 
5
6  voluntary acceptance of a plea, a knowing and voluntary 
7  guilty plea, and that requires that he know all of the 
8  information.  And the record that we have in this case, 
9  there's nothing to suggest that that plea would not have 
gone forward.  The mere potentiality for withdrawing the 
10
11 
plea --
12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I had hoped you were 
13  making some argument other than the knowing argument, 
14  because as prior discussion has shown, even if he had 
known, it would have made no difference to whether he 
15
16  accepted the later plea. 
17
 Suppose he had been told, "oh, by the way, 
18  there was an earlier plea.  It's too late to accept it 
19  now.  Do you want to take this plea?"  He says, "well, 
20
21  is gone.  Do you want to take this plea or not?"  He 
22  would have taken it.

7  said it lacked authority to order the State to offer any 
8  bargain, but also the court said, I'm not going to 
9  require the prosecutor to renew an earlier offer.
 One thing is clear in this case:  The 
10
11  prosecutor did nothing wrong.  The wrong was on the part 
12  of defense counsel.  So, why should the judge disarm the 
13  prosecutor, take away the prosecutor's right to change 
14  his mind?
15
16  Sixth Amendment violation, and that is to put the 
17  defendant back into the position as nearly as possible 
18  as he would have been in at the time and at the time the 
19  offer was open.  This is not a situation where the 
prosecutor is being ordered initially or the first 
20
21  instance to make an offer; it -- this is being viewed as 
22  the offer that was originally made is still available 
23  and open to the defendant.

8  voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative 
9  courses of action open to the defendant.
 MR. QUEENER:  Yes. 
10
11
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  On the next page, 
12  you say when Frye entered his guilty plea before the 
13  trial court, he was completely unaware that counsel's 
14  ineffective delay had forever foreclosed those options.
15
16  find you saying that this was a valid plea. 
17
18
19  validity is whether it's an intelligent choice, as you 
quote, among the alternative choices of action open to 
20
21  the defendant.  The next page you say these options have 
22  forever been foreclosed.  So, they weren't open to the 
23  defendant. 
24
25

 MR. QUEENER:  Well, those were foreclosed 
simply as a result of trial counsel's ineffectiveness, 

 Now, I put the two of those together and 

 MR. QUEENER:  No, it was --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The question of 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company

1  which -- which caused him to be unaware that they had 
2  been ever available to him, so that -- that how the plea 
3  becomes involuntary is not that he's aware of what the 
4  situation is at the time that he's entering the plea, 
because there are many other circumstances that go into 
5
6  his decision of whether or not to enter a plea.  Those 
7  alternatives were only no longer available to him as a 
8  result of counsel's failure to perform his duty 
9  professionally and communicate the offer.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  On the issue of remedy, as 
10
11  the Respondent are you not limited to the remedies that 
12  were provided in the judgment of the State court? 
13
 MR. QUEENER:  No, I don't believe so, 
14  because the State court, the court of appeals, simply

17  under the Sixth Amendment for that violation. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you didn't file a 
18
19  cross-petition, and there wasn't one granted.  So, 
aren't -- aren't you limited to defending the judgment 
20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why should -- now 

the plea offer was remade, the part about -- what was 
it -- 3 years with 10 days in jail? 

1  likelihood of succeeding at trial.  That's not going to 
2  do him any good.  That won't get him a misdemeanor where 
3  he'll be sentenced to 90 days.  The open plea is 
4  basically the same -- the very same thing that's causing

6  provided by Missouri Court of Appeals is essentially no 
7  remedy at all for the prejudice that he suffered.

10
11 
12
13
14  I'm not going to give him just 10 days; I'm going to put 
him in jail for the whole 3 years.  Now, if that's --
15
16  this is the sentence that the judge gave, he rejected 
17  the -- half of the plea bargain, so surely he would have

20
21  At the time that this -- or this guilty plea was being 
22  entered and the sentence was handed down, this was an

7  willing to plead to this without the prosecution having

1  judge was always free to reject either of those two? 
2
 MR. QUEENER:  I think the deference to the 
3  trial court on probation was in that first one, the 3 
4  years with defer to the court on probation.  If they had 
agreed on the 90 days in the misdemeanor, that would 
5

 MR. QUEENER:  Not binding the judge.  No, 
12  that would not bind the judge.  It never would.  The 
13  judge would have the opportunity, at that point -- the 
14  only time -- the only thing the judge would have

17  felony to a misdemeanor, the judge couldn't reject that.

3  would have accepted the 90 days? 
4
5
6  there is nothing in the record to suggest that that 
7  would not have happened.  The appellate court found --
8  in fact by making the determination that Mr. Frye was 
9  prejudiced, necessarily made the conclusion that that 
plea would have gone forward.  The motion court said 
10
11  nothing to refute that.  There was nothing in the 
12  court's findings that the court would not have accepted
