 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

 In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established 

 (11:11 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

9  Justice, and may it please the Court:
10
11  the now-familiar principle that the prosecution must 
12  hand over all favorable material evidence to the defense 
13  before trial.  This case presents a flagrant violation 
14  of that principle.
 The Orleans Parish district attorney's 
15
16  office produced almost no relevant evidence to the 
17  defense before Petitioner's trial, and Petitioner was 
18  convicted of first-degree murder based solely on the 
19  testimony of a single eyewitness.  Unbeknownst to the 
defense, however, that eyewitness had told the police on 
20
21  multiple occasions that he could not identify any of the 
22  perpetrators or, as he put it, that he would not know 
23  them if he saw them.

 If all of that information had been 

 In our view, in order to conclude that 

doubt on Petitioner's involvement and role in the 

1  office in this case also engaged in the wholesale 
2  suppression of statements of numerous other witnesses, 
3  statements that further undermined the sole eyewitness 
4  identification of Petitioner and, more broadly, cast 
5
6  shootings. 
7
8  disclosed to the defense before trial, the jury surely 
9  would have viewed this case in a completely different 
light.  The trial court therefore erred by rejecting 
10
11 
Petitioner's Brady claim, and its judgment should be 
12 
reversed. 
13
14  Petitioner is entitled to a new trial here, this Court 
15
16  statements of the key eyewitness, Larry Boatner. 
17  Respondent concedes that those statements were withheld 
18  from the defense before trial, and argues only that the 
19  failure to disclose those statements was not 
20
21
22  more clearly contradicted Boatner's confident 
23  identification of Petitioner at trial --
24
25

need do nothing more than to consider the suppressed 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, he saw a picture. 

Boatner saw a picture in a newspaper, and that turned on 

prejudicial. 

 Those statements, however, could not have

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is correct.  The basis

1  the light for him, right?  It wasn't any police 
2  suggestion. 
3
4  for Boatner's identification was that he saw a 
5
6  It was in connection with an article describing the 
7  shootings and suggesting that Petitioner was one of the 
8  suspects in the case.  And that was what led to his 
9  prior identification out of court.
 But just to be clear, Justice Ginsburg, 
10
11  we're not arguing today that the identification was 
12  somehow constitutionally problematic.  At most, we're 
13  arguing that the identification was of questionable 
14  validity in light of the fact that Boatner had only a 
15
16  of the circumstances that led to his identification. 
17
 Now, even if his identification were more 
18  clearly reliable, our argument today would be the same. 
19  In a case such as this one, in which the sole basis for 
linking the defendant to the crime is the testimony of a 
20
21  single eyewitness, and there is evidence that the single 
22  eyewitness said on multiple occasions that he couldn't 
23  identify anyone, we believe that, absent extraordinary 
24  circumstances, that will be sufficient to --

5

7
8  his head.  He was questioned at the scene, and at that 
9  time -- and this was in the evening -- he said:  I can't 
identify anybody.  But then, later that very day, wasn't 
10
11 
it, that very evening, after midnight, he was questioned 
12 
at the police station; am I correct? 
13
14
15
16  description of the person that he said was the one who 
17  first came through the door.  So, you know, that -- I 
18  don't know -- and then later, he said he -- there were 
19  statements to the effect that he couldn't identify 
20
21
 But in light of the fact that he did provide 
22  a pretty, you know, somewhat detailed description on the 
23  very evening of the event, doesn't that -- aren't you 
24  exaggerating when you say that he said numerous times --
25

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes, that's correct. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  And at that point he gave a 

description.  He did make an -- he did provide a 

anybody. 

the effect of these statements that he couldn't 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But I think more broadly, with regard to 

1  identify --
2
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Justice Alito, it is true 
3  that Boatner provided identifying details in the later 
4  statement that night.  I would respectfully submit that 
they were relatively limited identifying details, simply 
5
6  the fact that the first man through the door had a 
7  low-cut haircut and gold teeth.  And as we indicate in 
8  our brief, those were characteristics shared by numerous 
9  other suspects in the case.
10
11  both sets of statements at issue here, the State's 
12  explanations for those statements are at best plausible. 
13  And we really think that in a case such as this one, in 
14  which the evidence on its face is so clearly of high 
exculpatory or impeaching values, it takes something 
15
16  more than that.  It is not sufficient for Respondent to 
17  argue here simply that, even taking into account these 
18  statements, a rational juror could still reach the same 
19  result and return a verdict of guilty here, because this 
20
21  for Brady claims is not a Jackson v. Virginia type 
22  sufficiency of the evidence standard. 
 So, again, where you have statements that on 
23
24  their face are not simply statements calling a witness's 
25

Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that the standard 

credibility into question, but statements that really 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The standard is a 

1  directly contradict the confident in-court 
2  identification, it would take an exceedingly persuasive 
3  explanation for those statements to defeat a showing of 
4  materiality.  Now, with regard --
5
6  reasonable probability that the result would have been 
7  different, reasonable probability? 
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes, that's correct.  And 
8
9  this Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that that's 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21  briefly why we think that those explanations are frankly 
22  not even plausible.  With regard to the first statement 
23  to which Justice Alito referred, the statement that was 
24  made at the scene approximately half an hour after 
25

not a more likely than not standard.  That is 
essentially the same standard that this Court has 
articulated for prejudice for ineffective assistance of 
counsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, and by 
now it's a quite clearly established standard.  And, 
again, it requires something less than a showing of more 
likely than not and perhaps something slightly more than 
the showing required for harmless error under Chapman v. 
California. 

 But I do want to touch upon the State's 
explanations for these statements and explain very 

initial -- officers initially responded to the scene, 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

to 138 of the joint appendix. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  That may be true, but if you 

1  the State's argument is that Boatner was somehow too 
2  traumatized to make an identification at the time. 
 But not only did Boatner not so testify at 
3
4  the postconviction hearing -- in fact he testified that 
he couldn't recall the statement at all -- but the very 
5
6  officer who took the statement himself testified at 
7  trial in this case that at the time of the statement 
8  Boatner was, quote, "coherent and articulated very well 
9  the events that transpired."  And that is at pages 137 
10
11
12  were a juror and Boatner testified and he was 
13  cross-examined and they attempted to impeach him based 
14  on his failure to make an identification right at the 
scene, and he said, well, that was because five of my 
15
16  friends had just been killed and I was lying on the 
17  floor and I thought I was going to be shot too and I had 
18  a big gash on my head, and then a couple of hours later 
19  when I collected myself and they asked me the same 
20
21  and didn't say I couldn't identify anybody -- do you 
22  think jurors would just dismiss that and say, well, he 
23  couldn't identify him at the scene so he must have been 
24  lying when he identified -- when he provided a 
25

question at the police station, I provided a description 

description later at the police station? 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company

I couldn't -- I couldn't identify him. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wasn't there also an 

intervening -- didn't he say 5 days after that he 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Five days later he said: 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Justice Alito, I think that 
1
2  it's possible that a juror could credit that explanation 
3  in any retrial, though I --
4
5
6  couldn't identify?  And that was after what he said on 
7  the night, the same night. 
8
9
10
11
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is correct, Justice 
12  Ginsburg.  But even if we didn't have the March 6th 
13  statement or statements, I would frankly be happy to 
14  take my chances with the jury, even with regard solely 
to the March 1st statement, in light of that testimony 
15
16  of Officer Ronquillo that Boatner was in fact coherent, 
17  articulated very well the events that transpired, just 
18  like any witness, and so on and so forth. 
19
20
21
22  our burden to show that no juror could credit the 
23  State's explanation.  It's simply that we think that 
24  that explanation doesn't hold water.
25

 So, again -- -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor --
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- we don't think that it's 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, your argument

 Number one, was the testimony mixed 

across their face or over their entire head? 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  There was some degree of 

But you also mention other things, and Respondents spend 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  There --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the best take on 

1  now and in your brief suggests that you're relying most 
2  heavily on the failure to provide the impeachment 
3  materials of the only witness to this crime and the only 
4  piece of evidence that ties your client to the crime. 
5
6  90 percent of their brief arguing against the other 
7  things.  But I just want to clarify those other things. 
8
9  testimony about whether the assailants wore a mask 
10
11
12
13  what the evidence showed that was presented on that 
14  issue?
15
16  variation in what the witnesses said.  Now, in the main, 
17  we're talking, again, about statements that were 
18  withheld.  And I want to lay out those statements very 
19  briefly, if I may.  There were two eyewitnesses who made 
statements to the police indicating that some or all of 
20
21  the perpetrators, including the first man through the 
22  door, were wearing masks.  Those were the statements of 
23  Shelita Russel and the statement of Dale Mims. 
24
25

 Now, with regard to the statement of Shelita 

Russell -- and this was what we believe was the dying 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

So, it is at least theoretically possible --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I ask you 

1  declaration that she made at the scene in the immediate 
2  aftermath of having been shot multiple times -- Russell 
3  said she saw people barge into the kitchen; one had a 
4  black cloth across the face, first one through the door. 
5
6
7  something?  Who determines that issue of whether that's 
8  a dying declaration?  Do we determine that in deciding 
9  whether the withholding of the Brady materials was 
harmful or not?  Do we give deference to the lower 
10
11 
court's determination of that?  Do they have to decide 
whether it was a dying declaration?  What's the standard 
12 
13 
on something like this? 
14
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  The lower court did not make 
such a determination in this case on this or any of the 
15
16  other evidentiary issues that Respondent now advances, 
17  at least in part because it does not appear that 
18  Respondent advanced any of those arguments below.  But I 
19  think more broadly, Justice Sotomayor, in terms of the 
role of this Court or any other court considering a 
20
21  Brady claim, this Court hasn't quite spoken to the 
22  specific issue of whether a Brady court is supposed to 
23  itself make an evidentiary determination where there's a 
24  question about admissibility, but the closest that this 
25

Court came was in Wood v. Bartholomew, in which this 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Here, we really don't think that it's a 

that score.  That was a summary reversal in a per curiam 

appears that it's reasonably likely that the evidence 
would be admissible. 

1  Court indicated that with regard to Brady material, it 
2  either has to itself be admissible or be reasonably 
3  likely to lead to admissible evidence.  And the Court's 
4  reasoning in Wood v. Bartholomew was somewhat spare on 
5
6  opinion. 
7
 But I do think that it would be appropriate 
8  for a Brady court to make that determination itself or, 
9  at a minimum, make a determination as to whether it 
10
11 
12
13  close question, particularly with regard to the 
14  statement of Shelita Russell, because the context of the 
handwritten notes makes clear that the statement was 
15
16  taken at the scene of the crime.  Shelita Russell was 
17  taken to the hospital approximately a half an hour after 
18  the shootings occurred.  She told two witnesses that she 
19  believed that she was dying.  And so, under the law on 
dying declarations -- and I have no reason to believe 
20
21  that the law is any different in Louisiana from the 
22  Federal system or the 49 other States -- that would 
23  comfortably satisfy that requirement. 
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, Mr. Mims was the 

neighbor who saw the two -- there were three assailants 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  There's some doubt as to 

didn't say anything further other than that the masks 
were ski-type masks. 

1  in total, right, and two left the scene? 
2
3  whether or not there were three or four assailants.  And 
4  Mims himself, in all candor, was a little bit 
inconsistent on that point.  But he consistently said, 
5
6  both in the handwritten notes and in his testimony at 
7  the postconviction hearing, that all of the assailants, 
8  however many there were, were wearing masks and that --
9  that he saw them as they were getting into the car.  He 
10
11 
12
 But the State's argument with regard to the 
13  materiality of Mims's statement is that it is possible 
14  that the men would not have been wearing masks when they 
entered the house to allegedly commit the armed robbery; 
15
16  and, therefore, the fact that Boatner saw the first man 
17  unmasked can be reconciled with his statement.  And, 
18  again, we would be happy to take our chances with the 
19  jury and make the argument that that would be an 
20
21  armed robbery. 
22
23  Mims statements, I think it's important to remember that 
24  we view those statements as going directly to and 
25

contradicting Boatner's in-court identification.  And 

exceedingly unconventional way to go about committing an 

 And, again, with regard to the Russell and 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Does the defense have any 

1  so, in some sense, we view those statements as being of 
2  a piece with Boatner's own prior statements in which he 
3  indicated that he could not identify anyone and that he 
4  did not --
5
6  theory as to why Boatner would lie about whether he 
7  could identify this individual? 
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  First of all, Justice Alito, 
8
9  it would, of course, not be the defense's burden in any 
subsequent retrial to come up with a theory of its own. 
10
11 
The defense could simply argue, as it did at the first 
trial, that the prosecution simply didn't bear its 
12 
13 
burden on reasonable doubt.  But --
14
impact of your impeachment evidence would be related 
15
16  certainly to if a juror would ask, well, why would he 
17  lie about this?  And I -- I'm just asking, would -- did 
18  the defense have any theory about what his motive would 
19  be about whether he could identify somebody, whether 
20
21
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  As this Court will be aware 
22  from its recent consideration of eyewitness evidence, it 
23  doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that an 
24  eyewitness identification is mistaken that the 
25

eyewitness was somehow lying about it.  It may very well 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But, yes -- but the -- the 

this first person had a mask or not? 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And, indeed, as the amicus brief of the 
Innocence Project explains in this case, there is a 

1  have been that Boatner made a mistaken identification in 
2  good faith out of a desire to identify the person who 
3  killed several of his friends. 
4
5
6  phenomenon known as "mug shot exposure effect," where an 
7  individual who sees a mug shot in some other context is 
8  more likely to identify that same person when confronted 
9  with a subsequent line-up.  Of course, where, as here, 
the individual is exposed to the mug shot for the first 
10
11  time in seeing a newspaper article that depicts the 
12  individual in question and suggests that that individual 
13  is a suspect in the crime, it would not at all be 
14  unusual for the individual, when confronted with that 
15
16  that individual. 
17
18  said that the person wasn't masked and provided a 
19  description was long before he saw any mug shots.  It 
20
21  questioned at the police station. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, on the evening of the 
22
23  event, he provided those limited details about the gold 
24  teeth and the low-cut haircut.
25

photograph again in a line-up a few weeks later, to pick 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, but by doing that he's 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But the first time he -- he 

was the evening of the event.  It was when he was 

Official 

 But I think it's important to realize, 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, that may suggest that 

possible that the person somehow had part of his face 

details, he also made statements suggesting that he was 
not confident of his ability to actually make an 
identification.  And in that statement, which is found 
at page 296 of the joint appendix, he says:  I was too 
scared to look at anybody.  I wish I could give y'all a 
description. 

1  saying this person wasn't wearing a mask.  That's the 
2  critical point. 
3
4  the person was not wearing a mask.  Of course, it's 
5
6  covered. 
7
8  Justice Alito, that even with regard to that statement, 
9  while it is true that Boatner provided those limiting 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 So, in some sense, we think that the focus 
17  on the gold teeth and the low-cut haircut in this case 
18  is a bit of an aside, because the question here is not 
19  whether he saw enough to support the subsequent 
identification; the question is whether his suppressed 
20
21  statements in which he repeatedly said, I can't make an 
22  identification, contradict his in-court confident 
23  identification of Petitioner. 
24
25

 And we think that in order to decide this 

case, all that the Court essentially need say in an 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

have concededly been suppressed, the Brady materiality 

1  opinion is that in a case such as this one, in which all 
2  you have is the identification of a single eyewitness, 
3  where you have statements in which that eyewitness said 
4  I can't make an identification, and those statements 
5
6  threshold is satisfied. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Am I right --

24  all.  The only even remotely relevant thing that was 
given to the defense was the initial police report, 
25

statements, the first two -- the one at 252 in the joint 
appendix and then the statement on March the 2nd, which 
is the one you just referred to, 296, were parts of 
those statements given to the defense counsel or none of 
the statements?  And how long were the documents?  Were 
they 20 or 30 pages?  Can you tell me a little bit about

 Now, with regard to these specific
 

record that was received from the district court at
 

contained in a relatively voluminous document -- I 
believe it was an 83-page document -- that was a

everything that took place over the course of the 
investigation.  And none of that was disclosed.

 So, this is not a case in which selective

documents and not simply the withholding of selected

12  clear that a request is unnecessary to trigger the Brady 
13  obligation, and this Court has made clear in cases 
14  dating back to Brady itself that the good faith or bad 
faith of the prosecutor is irrelevant.  And, of course, 
15
16  the prosecutor has a duty under Brady to hand over not 
17  only materials in the prosecutor's own possession but 
18  also materials in the possession of the police as well.

 Justice Sotomayor, there was one thing you 

1  or perhaps semipermanent implants, and that in hip-hop 
2  culture in the 1990s, this was relatively common.  But 
3  whatever the provenance of this practice, it is 
4  undisputed on this record that multiple other suspects 
5
6
7  asked that I just want to get back to with regard to the 
8  remaining categories of evidence.  I just want to set 
9  them out, and then I'd be happy to answer any questions 
that the Court has about them.  And if there are no 
10
further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time. 
11 
12
 As we explain in our brief, there are three 
13  other categories of evidence at issue here.  There was 
14  the statement of Phillip Young, Petitioner's 
co-defendant, suggesting that Petitioner was not 
15
16  involved in the shootings.  There were also the 
17  statements that would have called into question the 
18  prosecution's theory that Petitioner was one of the 
19  shooters, a theory that was essential to establishing 
20
21  Louisiana law.  Louisiana is somewhat different from 
22  other States in that it doesn't require premeditation, 
23  but that it -- but it does require a specific intent to 
24  kill or inflict great bodily harm.
25

the intent required for first-degree murder under 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, on that point, the

 But I think that what's noteworthy with 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, we don't think that 
that's a meaningless distinction, and we cite numerous 

1  State says that you're drawing a meaningless distinction 
2  between a hand -- a 9-millimeter handgun and a 
3  9-millimeter automatic pistol. 
4
5
6  sources in our brief that draw precisely that 
7  distinction. 
8
9  regard to the statements at issue is that both Boatner, 
who identified the weapon that the perpetrator whom he 
10
11 
believed to be Petitioner was carrying, and the State's 
ballistics expert, Kenneth Leary, who identified the 
12 
13 
weapon that was responsible for the firing of the 
casings at issue, conspicuously failed to say that the 
14 
weapon at issue was a 9- millimeter handgun.  But at 
15
trial their testimonies suddenly converged, and Boatner, 
16 
17 
who had previously said only that the perpetrator was 
carrying a handgun, said that the perpetrator was 
18 
carrying a 9-millimeter handgun; and Leary, who said 
19 
that the casings at issue had come from a machine pistol 
20
of the Intratec or MAC-11 type, suddenly said that they 
21 
22 
came from a 9-millimeter handgun instead. 
23
24  possessed those statements, it could have sown doubt on 
25

 And so, at a minimum, if the defense had 

whether the firearm was in fact one and the same and, 

23

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, that's right with 

 And finally, the only other category --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'd just like to go back 
to that because I'm not sure I understand the argument. 

1  therefore, sown doubt on a critical element of the 
2  offense at issue. 
3
4
5
6  Both the ballistics expert at trial said that the 
7  casings were consistent with a 9-millimeter?  And I know 
8  that Boatner said that it was a 9-millimeter that was 
9  used.  And the issue was whether anybody would call a 
MAC gun a handgun as opposed to an automatic pistol, 
10
11  correct? 
12
13  regard to Leary's testimony.  I think the thing that was 
14  a little bit odd with regard to Boatner's testimony was 
the sudden degree of specificity.  Having said only that 
15
16  it was a handgun or a chrome automatic in his prior 
17  statements, he said at trial that it was a 9-millimeter 
18  handgun, which he had not previously said in the 
19  statements that were withheld.
20
21  consists of the notes of the interview in which Eric 
22  Rogers relayed Robert Trackling's confession to 
23  involvement in the shootings.  As the amicus brief of 
24  the NACDL points out, courts have routinely held that

here today -- was that presented to the State 
postconviction court? 

1  evidence, even with regard to offenses that may have had 
2  multiple perpetrators.  And we certainly believe that at 
3  a minimum the suppression of those notes, when 
4  considered in conjunction with all of the other 
evidence, comfortably satisfies the Brady materiality 
5
6  standard, and it's for that reason that we think that 
7  the judgment of the trial court should be reversed.

And, yes, some of the individuals who were pictured in 
5
6  those photo line-ups were other suspects.  The record 
7  reflects that Mr. Boatner scrutinized those 72 faces. 
8  At one point, line-up 11 was shown to him on March 22nd, 
9  and he remarked about the haircut.  He said:  My

for the delay? 

 MS. ANDRIEU:  His reason, Your Honor, is --

 MS. ANDRIEU:  Yes, he did. 
1
2
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It wasn't until they 
3  presented him with the line-up including Mr. Smith's 
4  face that he identified Mr. Smith.  What's the reason 
5
6
7  it's contained most specifically on page 191 of the 
8  joint appendix, and it is frankly that he was afraid. 
9  He -- and I think the jury would have understood that. 
He obviously knew what Mr. Smith was capable of.  He --
10
11 
I'm sure he feared --
12
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so what turned --
13  what changed his mind once the police showed him the 
14  line-up?
15
16  changed his mind, but he was presented with a line-up, 
17  and when he was presented with the line-up, he very 
18  quickly identified Juan Smith and said:  That is him; I 
19  will never forget his face.  So --
20
21 
 MS. ANDRIEU:  That was after.  And all of 
22
23  this, by the way, was vetted during -- during a motion 
24  to suppress hearing.  When the trial judge learned or --
that the photograph had been shown in the newspaper, he

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What is this?  I mean, I 
8  thought -- I may -- I thought the issue is that there 
9  were some notes, and the first note, which was made on 
the day, the policeman says that Boatner said he could 
10
11 
not supply a description of the perpetrator, other than 
to say they were black males.  Then he said they had 
12 
13 
golden teeth and a low-cut haircut. 
14
anyone because he couldn't see faces.  Then he said he'd 
15
16  only glanced at the first man.  He couldn't tell if they 
17  had their faces covered and didn't see anyone.  Then he 
18  said, I could not ID, would not know them if I saw them. 
19  And another set of police notes says he said that he

 Later, homicide Detective John Ronquillo 

postconviction testimony, he asked Larry -- he asked 
Larry Boatner for a description.  And Larry Boatner 
said, I can't give you a description. 

1  statement on the scene, two statements the day of the
 
2  incident.  To a first responding officer who was not
 
3  Detective Ronquillo, he gave a description, and that
 
4  description was heavy built, with a hair with a fade
 
with a little small top, with a lot of gold in his 
5
6  mouth.  That was while he was at the scene. 
7
8  arrived at the scene, and apparently, according to his 
9  notes and, most importantly, according to his 
10
11 
12 
13
 I'll put them all in perspective and then go 
14  back to what Detective Ronquillo and Mr. Boatner had to 
say about that.  But in any case, Mr. Boatner's severe 
15
16  laceration was treated, and then he was escorted to the 
17  homicide office, where he gave his formal statement. 
18  And in that statement, part of which has been reproduced 
19  here by opposing counsel, Mr. Boatner said:  I can tell 
20
21  face.  He was a black male with a low cut, golds in his 
22  mouth.  I don't know how many; that's all.  I was too 
23  scared to look at anybody.  All of them had guns, one 
24  with an AK; one with a TEC-9.  The one who hit me had a 
25

you about the one, the one who put the pistol in my 

chrome automatic.  It was big.  So --

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

says, I can't identify.  And taken in --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does that make it not 

 MS. ANDRIEU:  You would like to have it, but 

would like to have that statement where he said:  I 

1
2  could argue, presumably you did argue, that before the 
3  jury, and that would be compelling evidence for the 
4  jury.  And if you were the defense lawyer, you really 
5
6  couldn't identify them. 
7
8  it's not material because, sandwiched between two 
9  descriptions -- and he's -- between two descriptions, he 
10
11
12  material?  You can argue that it should be given 
13  diminished weight.  But an inconsistent statement by the 
14  only eyewitness seems to me most material and useful to 
the defense in cross-examining the eyewitness.  I really 
15
16  don't understand how you can -- you can argue that the 
17  jury shouldn't put much weight on it because there were 
18  these other things; but to say that it's immaterial I 
19  find that that is -- is not plausible.
20
21  eyewitness but, if I understand it correctly, the only 
22  evidence against the defendant.  This was the only 
23  evidence against him, this one eyewitness

1  identification of Juan Smith was bolstered by evidence,

Justice Ginsburg.  What you're telling us is that when 
the defense stands up and said, and isn't it true that, 
in this statement which you just have testified to on 
direct and which the police have put in on direct, you 
also said you could not identify any perpetrators of the 
murder -- and then the prosecutor says immaterial, and 
the judge says strike it. 

 MS. ANDRIEU:  But that's not --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just can't believe that. 
 MS. ANDRIEU:  But that's not what he says.

right.  That is -- that is -- now I think I can go back 
to Justice Kennedy's question, put it in those terms, 
and say, well, why wouldn't -- this could have made a 
difference.  I mean, here, we have this witness who said 
all of these great things for your side, and within a 

 MS. ANDRIEU:  Yes.

difference. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But I don't know if it's

Alderson Reporting Company 

fast-forwarding.  The next -- the statement after the 
statement made -- the one made in the homicide office 
was made on March 6th.  And at that time, Detective 
Ronquillo called Larry Boatner, and Larry Boatner said, 
I can't identify anyone.

1  space of hours, he has been telling the policemen that 
2  he can't identify anybody, he doesn't know.  I mean, 
3  what -- that sounds like there's a probability that 
4  would have made a difference.  Why not?
5
6  important evidence in this case is the testimony or the 
7  transcript from the postconviction relief hearing.  John 
8  Ronquillo, whose notes these are, was asked about the 
9  March 6th statement.  And I guess we are 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  say about that -- first of all, Larry Boatner didn't 
17  remember saying that.  But what Detective Ronquillo had 
18  to say about it -- and he was the person who was --
19  whose impressions -- about whose impressions we're 
20
21  many murder witnesses, was retreating, temporarily 
22  equivocating, as we wrote in brief.  He was retreating 
23  somewhat from his assistance with the police.  Not an --
24  not an abnormal phenomenon --
25

speaking -- was that at that point, Mr. Boatner, like 

 Based -- and what Detective Ronquillo had to

that excuse by Ronquillo? 

 MS. ANDRIEU:  They would, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And if they were 

statements that I can't identify someone not have been 
an argument that defense counsel could have used, number 
one, and that had a reasonable probability of making a 
difference? 

1  could the jury be entitled to reject that conclusion? 
2  They have four statements by this man who Ronquillo 
3  described as very coherent, very with it at the scene of 
4  the crime.  Would a jury be entitled to -- to reject 
5
6

9  entitled to do that, why would the absence of four

2
3  statements where he inculpated the defendant.  There are 
4  two statements.  Starting on the scene, there is a 
statement provided to the first responding officer, 
5
6  where he provides a description.  Larry Boatner provides 
7  a description --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it is a description 
8
9  that others, other suspects, fit.  The close-cut hair, 
the gold teeth.  That didn't identify Smith, as opposed

to the other suspects who had those same

characteristics.

 Just three very quick points.  First of all, 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 MS. ANDRIEU:  Thank you.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Shanmugam, 4

2  address was the materiality prong of Brady.

12  with regard to Larry Boatner's statements on March the 
13  6th, Justice Breyer, you'll be happy to know that your 
14  law clerks' notes were correct.  Boatner on March the 
15
16  appendix -- could not ID anyone because couldn't see 
17  faces; can't tell if had faces covered; didn't see 
18  anyone; would not know them if I saw them. 
19
20
 (Laughter.) 
21
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  It is quite clear that that 
22
23  statement applies to all of the perpetrators.  The State 
24  advances the argument today, as it did in its brief, 
25

that Boatner must have been too scared to cooperate by 

6th said -- and this is at page 308 of the joint

looking for Petitioner after seeing his photograph in 

that the -- that all of Boatner's -- all the notes about 
Boatner's statements were turned over to the judge 
before trial for in camera inspection? 

1  March the 6th, but that is utterly belied by the record 
2  in this case.  Boatner continued to cooperate with the 
3  police investigation in the following weeks, reviewing 
4  police line-ups.  He even testified that he wanted to go 
5
6  the New Orleans newspaper, pages 489 and 494 of the 
7  joint appendix.  He didn't leave New Orleans until June, 
8  3 months later, and he actually returned to New Orleans 
9  before Petitioner was even apprehended.  So, again --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It is your understanding

21  transcript what the court reviewed.  And, of course, 
22  even if the court had made an in camera determination, 
23  it would no way -- in no way affect our claim after the 
24  fact here.
25

 It's clear that the court reviewed 
something, but it is entirely unclear from that 

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Justice Alito, it is 

entirely unclear based on this record.  Counsel for 

 My second point:  The State today for the 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company

1  first time says, in response to the question from 
2  Justice Scalia, that there was more evidence here 
3  linking Petitioner to the crime and relies on the 
4  testimony of Eddie Young, the brother of Phillip Young, 
the individual who was found at the scene.  But the sole 
5
6  substance of that testimony was that Phillip Young knew 
7  Petitioner.  And we would respectfully submit that that 
8  is scarcely inculpatory, and if it was, anyone in New 
9  Orleans who knows a felon ought to be worried.  And, 
therefore, we really don't think that that adds anything 
10
11  to the evidence in this case.  The sole evidence linking 
12  Petitioner to the crime was the statement -- the 
13  testimony of Larry Boatner. 
14
the language in this Court's cases in Kyles and Agurs 
15
16  suggesting that prosecutors should err on the side of 
17  caution.  That is part of the constitutional standard 
18  because, after all, the materiality requirement is part 
19  of the requirement for a constitutional violation under 
Brady.  But all of the evidence at issue here, including 
20
21  Boatner's statements, was withheld from the defense, 
22  leaving aside this question of what the trial court may 
23  have reviewed in camera. 
24
25

 And the prosecutor's conduct in this case, 
with all due respect to Ms. Andrieu, was not, quote, "a

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel, 

1  little too close to the wind."  The Orleans Parish 
2  district attorney's office acted with flagrant disregard 
3  for its obligations under Brady in this case.  The Brady 
4  standard has been around for half a century.  There is 
5
6  we think that the conduct in this case was in fact 
7  egregious and clearly violated that standard.  We think 
8  that the trial court erred by rejecting Petitioner's 
9  Brady claim, and for that reason, we think that its
