 CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:  We'll hear  argument


next No. 02-1689, Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group.


 Mr. Boyce.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. BOYCE


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. BOYCE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


 The  central  question  here is  whether  Atlas'


post-filing change  in  citizenship should  be allowed  to


create retroactive diversity jurisdiction in this case.


 To  justify rewriting  the longstanding  time of


filing rule, Atlas relies on  the fact that this case  was 

tried  to  verdict  before the  jurisdictional  issue  was 

identified and raised in the district court. 

QUESTION:  May I ask you  with respect to that?


When  you  found  out  that  you  had  this  fundamental


jurisdictional  objection,  when  did  you  know  that the


partnership  included partners not only Texas entities but


two Mexican citizens?  When did you find that out?


 MR.  BOYCE: 

There  are  two answers  to  your


question, Justice  Ginsburg.  In  terms of when  we became


aware  of the  issue, that was  after verdict,  and that's


reflected in the affidavit which  appears in the record at

volume I, page 1887. 


In terms of  the question of was  there evidence


in  the  record that  could have  been pieced  together to


identify this issue  earlier, the answer to  that question


is  yes. 

If  -- if  -- it  probably  could  have  been


identified earlier, should  have been identified  earlier,


but it was not.


 QUESTION:  There's a  curious thing  about what 

Dataflux did.  Dataflux  at one  point moved  to add  the 

Mexicans as individuals as counterdefendants. 

MR. BOYCE:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  And why would it do that if they were


members of  the partnership.  If -- if it was  sure that


they were members  of the  partnership, then you  wouldn't


need  to  make  them  defendants  as  individuals  because


partners have individual liability.


 MR.  BOYCE: 

Two  answers  to  that  -- that


question,  Your  Honor.  First,  under the  Texas Revised


Limited Partnership Act, the -- the partnership can sue -­

the  limited partnership  can sue  on its own  without the


participation of the limited partners.  In terms of all of


the counterclaims against Llamosa  and Robles, again under


the Texas  statute, we can  choose to sue  the partnership


itself or we can sue individual limited partners.  In this


circumstance, our counterclaim against them was predicated

not on their status as limited partners, but rather on the


fact  that  Mr. Llamosa  and  Mr. Robles  made affirmative


misrepresentations, was our  position, directly  to us  to


induce us  to enter  the contract that  led to the  -- the


lawsuit.  So -­

QUESTION:  But  at that  stage, you called  them


employees or  former employees.  So  it seems that  the -­

that you had some inkling.


 MR. BOYCE:  There -- there was some  confusion


early on in terms of what exactly their status was and we,


Dataflux, did not thoroughly explore  that issue early on.


And -- and that should have been done earlier.


 But  I would also note that the bottom line here


is that  -- is that Atlas, the party with unique knowledge


of the exact circumstances of its partnership at the  time


of filing, is the party here who filed the case in Federal


court at a time when there was not diversity jurisdiction.


There  certainly could have been  more that we should have


done to explore the issue earlier.


 QUESTION:  Well, you've admitted it.  You -- you


just admitted it flat out in your answer.


 MR.  BOYCE: 

Yes,  Your  Honor. 

There  were


admissions that  jurisdiction existed, but I  would hasten


to  add  that  pursuant  to  the  longstanding  rule  that


jurisdiction  cannot be stipulated  to, agreed to, created

by  estoppel  or  waiver, that  those  statements  are not


effective to create jurisdiction  if it does not exist  at


the  outset.  And  -- and  I would emphasize  the language


that  was relied on most recently in this Court's decision


in Kontrick from January in  which the Court noted that  a


court's  subject matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to


account for the parties' conduct during litigation.  And I


think that principle addresses that. 


Is  there  more  that could  have  been  done to


explore  this earlier -- this issue earlier  and bring it


up?  The answer to that question is yes, but I don't think


that  that  circumstance undermines  the  fundamental rule


here, which  is that as of  the time of filing,  there was


not a diversity present, and because of that -­

QUESTION:  Well, there was in the constitutional


sense. 

There  wasn't  under the  statute. 

There  was


diversity, but not complete diversity.


 MR. BOYCE:  I think the -- there is some room to


discuss that, Justice Ginsburg, in  light of the dissent's


contention that there was, in fact, no diversity where you


have one litigant here, one  plaintiff, one defendant, and


both  are citizens of  Mexico at that  time.  It  may be a


situation where -­

QUESTION:  But that's not  what -- well, correct


me if I'm wrong.  I thought that Atlas is a partnership.

 MR. BOYCE:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  And  that it  -- and that  there are


three players involved -- five.  Two are Mexican and three


are Texan.


 MR. BOYCE:  There -- there -­

QUESTION:  So  then you would  have on one  side


Texan  and Mexican and the other side  Texan.  If you drop


out the Mexicans,  then you're left, from  the plaintiff's


side -- you're left with a complete diversity case.


 MR. BOYCE:  Atlas is  one entity with  multiple


citizenships, and  -- and if  -- if the  question suggests


that  there was some  kind of  a -- a  dismissal mechanism


available  to make the -- the Mexican citizenship go away,


I don't  believe that that is available under the facts of


this case because it's -- it -- there were -­

QUESTION:  But it's what  happened.  They did go


away for a reason unrelated to this lawsuit.


 MR.  BOYCE: 

Pursuant  to  Atlas' decision  to


change the constitution of its  partnership after the time


of filing and before  the case was submitted to  the -- to


the jury.  That is correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Yes, long before the case was tried.


 MR. BOYCE:  Before the -- approximate -­

QUESTION:  Well, so when the case  -- when this


case was tried, there was complete diversity.

 MR. BOYCE:  That is  correct.  Approximately  6


weeks prior  to trial,  the change  in Atlas'  composition


became  effective  so that  at that  point there  would -­

there is complete diversity if  that post-filing change is


given effect.


 And I  would submit to the Court  that under the


longstanding rule,  going back as far as 1824 in Mollan v.


Torrance, reflected in  the 1891  decision in Anderson  v.


Watt,  that  the longstanding  rule  has been,  and should


continue to be in this case, that post changes -­

QUESTION: 

I  thought  in  Mollan v.  Torrance


exactly what I described happened.  Chief Justice Marshall


said you've got one spoiler on the plaintiffs' side.  Take


it out and you'll have complete diversity. 


MR.  BOYCE: 

I  think  that the  statement  in


Mollan,  as  reflected  in  Conolly  and then  applied  in


Anderson  v. Watt, Your  Honor, is  that if the  change in


circumstances is the result of the addition or subtraction


of a  party,  that's one  circumstance, but  here we  have


something  entirely  different,  which  is  a  change  in


citizenship.  It  would be the same as if  a plaintiff had


lived in one State and then moved to another State.


 QUESTION:  No, it's not the same.  It isn't the


same because  a partnership is a citizen of every State in


which a partner resides.  Isn't that correct?

 MR. BOYCE:  Correct, under Carden.


 QUESTION:  So you have,  just as if  you'd have


five  individuals -- that's  what they  are in fact  -- in


effect, because they're jointly and  severally liable.  So


you have,  as I said before, three Texan and two Mexicans.


You don't have  one person that can say,  ah, I'm going to


defeat diversity by moving where  I live, or I'm going  to


create  diversity. 

You  -- none  of  these  people's


citizenships  has ever  changed.  That's quite  different


from somebody saying, I want to change my citizenship.


 MR. BOYCE:  I would respectfully  disagree, Your


Honor,  because  I  think  Atlas'  citizenship  changed by


virtue of changing the composition of its partnership, and


that is on  all fours the same  circumstance as if a  -- a


litigant had lived  in one State and then tried to move to


another State in an effort to create retroactive diversity


jurisdiction. 


QUESTION:  But  it didn't  leave Texas  behind.


Texas was always there.  The Mexican partners  left.  So I


just  don't see that it's anything like -- I mean, this -­

as I said before, there's the  same five people.  Two drop


out and  so you've got three Texans, and there were always


three Texans.  They didn't move to Texas.  They were there


from the start.

changing  its  citizenship after  the  time of  filing and


thereafter claiming  -- this  is Atlas'  argument -- that


that cures our  jurisdictional defect,  I would submit  to


the Court, is  the same thing as a citizen moving from one


State  to the  other  because, in  effect,  what Atlas  is


saying, by relying on that argument, is we moved out of -­

move out of Mexico and -- and resided exclusively in Texas


as of  the time  of suit.  That  is the  whole basis  for


Atlas'  argument  as  to why  the  jurisdictional  defect,


according  to Atlas, was  cured as  of the time  of trial.


And I think that's where the -- the conflict comes in with


the change of -­

QUESTION:  If  Atlas  had  been  a  corporation


incorporated in Texas, then there would have been complete


diversity.  Right?


 MR. BOYCE:  I'm -- I didn't -­

QUESTION: 

If  Atlas  -- instead of  being  a


partnership composed of five members,  it had organized as


a corporation, as a Texas corporation. 


MR. BOYCE:  Then it would  be under the  -- the


different provision of 1332.  It would be a citizen of its


place  of  incorporation  and  its  principal  place  of


business, and  that would not be the issue that -- that we


have here today. 


QUESTION:  But would -- would -- my question is

wouldn't  the  -- if  these  -- if  this  entity had  been


organized as a corporation, there would have been complete


diversity.


 MR. BOYCE:  There -- there -- yes,  there would


not be an issue here  because of a different operation  of


1332 as  applied to corporations, but the  point of Carden


was,  as  -- as  I  read  the  case,  is  that  limited


partnerships are going to be treated differently. 


QUESTION:  Yes.


 MR. BOYCE:  There is no analog from corporate -­

QUESTION:  But I don't want to belabor this any


further,  but  you  do  see  the  difference  between  an


individual moving  from New York to New Jersey, say, and a


-- a  partnership with five  partners, all of  whom remain


where  they are.  They don't  move anyplace else.  Those


partners, those live human beings,  stay exactly what they


were.  Their citizenship doesn't change.


 MR.  BOYCE:  I understand  the -- the point, and


our position is that when Atlas contends that it has cured


the jurisdictional defect  by changing the  composition of


its  partnership,  that  is effectively  the  same  as the


litigant moving from New Jersey to New York and claiming I


have -- I have fixed the jurisdictional problem because my


citizenship  has changed.  It comes  down to a  change in


citizenship,  and  I  think  that's  what  implicates  the

longstanding rule that the Court has enforced repeatedly.


 QUESTION:  Mr. Boyce,  can I ask you a  question 

about how  far your  position extends?  You  say that  it 

wasn't  too late to  -- to raise  the jurisdictional issue 

when  you  did.  Supposing  there had  been  a trial  and


instead  of your losing,  you had  won, and then  you knew


about the jurisdictional  defect, and  then you waited  to


see what would happen on appeal.  Then you lost on appeal.


And then you  decided to raise the  jurisdictional defect.


Would you say  that was -- they would then  be required to


dismiss?


 MR. BOYCE:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think the -­

QUESTION: 

All  right.  Suppose  then  it was


affirmed and then you decided  you didn't realize it until


after the  judgment had been entered and  become final and


so forth, and  then a year  later you  find out about  it.


Could you raise it then?


 MR. BOYCE:  I don't think it would be the proper


subject of a collateral attack  after the initial case  in


which  it has been adjudicated is over with.  But in terms


of where along the line within that case can it be raised,


our  position  is  it  can  be  raised,  indeed,  must  be


raised -­

QUESTION:  So you say it can always be raised on


direct -- while -- until final judgment is entered, but it

can never be raised on collateral attack.


 MR. BOYCE:  That is  my understanding.  And -­

and  I  think  the  most  closely analogous  case  to  the


hypothetical that -- that you're  putting forth would  be


the Capron v. Noorden case from 1804.  It was discussed in


-- in this  Court's recent decision  in Kontrick where  in


that case  the plaintiff who had filed the case in Federal


court  lost at trial  and then went  up on  appeal to this


Court.  The plaintiff  who filed  the case  at that  late


stage identified the  lack of  jurisdiction, and then  the


Court said there is no  jurisdiction here.  If there's  no


jurisdiction,  there's  no  jurisdiction  and  the  -- the


timing of the conduct of it is not germane to that inquiry


because  it's not  something that  can be  created by  the


parties' litigation conduct -­

QUESTION:  We have to punish you some other way,


maybe fine you  or make you pay costs  for the other side,


but  we cannot punish  you for  that by expanding  our own


jurisdiction.  That's your point.


 MR. BOYCE:  That -- that's our point.


 QUESTION:  Capron against Noorden was one party


on  one side, one  party on the  other.  It  wasn't a case


where  at  the  time  of  the  trial  there  was  complete


diversity. 


I  frankly have a  hard time distinguishing this

case from  Caterpillar which  started out  non-diverse but


before trial, became diverse. 


MR.  BOYCE:  I  -- I  would like to  address the


circumstances  under which  this  case is  distinguishable


from  Caterpillar  because that  obviously  is -- is what


Atlas relies very heavily on in its briefing.


 And  I  think there  are  a number  of important


distinctions here, the  first and foremost being  that the


citizenship  of  the  parties  to  the final  judgment  in


Caterpillar did not change.  That was a circumstance where


the  -- the  diversity-spoiling  litigant  was  dismissed


pursuant to rule 21.  That is not our circumstance here.


 QUESTION:  So if the  -- this would be the  same


if the  -- Atlas  had  come to  the court  and said,  now,


court, I  want you  to  dismiss the  two Mexicans  because


they're no longer  part of the corporation,  and gotten an


order to -- to do that.


 MR.  BOYCE: 

That  would  be  a  different


circumstance.  I -- I hasten to add that in terms of Atlas


suing  Dataflux,  Mr.  Llamosa  and  Mr. Robles  were  not


plaintiffs. 

Atlas  itself was  the  plaintiff,  and the


problem arises because  of the -- the  Mexican citizenship


of Mr. Llamosa and Robles is attributed to Atlas.


 But if  -- if a different circumstance  is -- is


hypothesized where there's a dismissal,  then I think that

brings rule 21 into play.  As -- as the Court discussed in


-- in  the Newman-Green  decision, there  is  a source  of


authority for addressing that circumstance under rule 21.


 Here we  have a  situation where this  is not  a


removal  case,  this is  not  a  dismissal case,  and  the


question arises -­

QUESTION:  My  question  was  could  they  have


dismissed and  -- and as far  as removal, I  perhaps don't


remember Caterpillar that  well, but  of course, it  arose


out of a removal.  That's how it happened.  But  the Court


didn't make the removal dispositive.


 MR. BOYCE:  Your Honor, I -- I would not presume


to -- to say what  the -- the  Court meant  to do, but  I


would highlight the discussion  in the subsequent  Lexecon


case  where the  point,  I  think,  was made  that  indeed


Caterpillar  was  grounded  on  the  removal  statute  and


specifically section 1441, the issue  being in Caterpillar


that the  case was not fit for Federal adjudication at the


time of removal and that that was the error.  There was an


untimely compliance with -­

QUESTION:  Yes.  It certainly  was a 1441,  and


the opinion certainly  alerts district judges that  when a


case comes over from the  State court, maybe you ought  to


look  at  it  to  make  sure  that  there  is  Federal


jurisdiction.  But I didn't  think that there was anything

peculiar about  1441 and the obligation of a judge to look


into  jurisdiction. 

I don't  know  why  the  same thing


wouldn't apply to 1332.


 MR. BOYCE:  I  would submit,  Your Honor,  that


there  are  different  -- there's  a  different statutory


overlay that -- that was being addressed  in Caterpillar,


the overlay of the removal  statutes.  Here we're under  a


circumstance where  this -- this  is not  a removal  case.


Therefore, we are under section 1332 alone, and the -- the


longstanding  rule  that the  citizenship  is going  to be


measured as of  the time of filing.  At -- at  this stage


where  the rule has  been followed  for some 180  years, I


believe  that similar to a complete diversity requirement,


it is now  part and parcel of  section 1332.  So  there --


there's no removal overlay to be addressed. 


And  -- and  there's an  additional circumstance


here  that  I  think  in  significant  part,  Caterpillar


operates  to protect a defendant's  right to removal.  The 

-- the  removal  in that  case -- the  removal right  was 

subject  to being  lost  because  of  the  timing  of  the 

dismissal of  the non-diverse  party.  There was  a -- a


problem for Caterpillar  in bumping up against  the 1-year


time  limit. 

In other  words,  Caterpillar  operates to


protect a -- a right to invoke the Federal forum.

 QUESTION:  Well, I don't -- I  don't follow that


because it was wrongfully removed by the defendant, had no


right to be in the Federal forum when he got there, and -­

and the poor plaintiff who wanted to be in the State court


got stuck with losing a Federal court  case.  So it wasn't


protecting the defendant  right to remove.  The defendant


had  no right to remove.  It  wasn't a proper Federal case


until -- who was it -- one of the parties got dropped out.

description of Caterpillar which is that there was an -­

at bottom Caterpillar cannot be  divorced from the removal


context in which it arose.  And it -- it was -- it was -­

QUESTION:  Do you rely  on a distinction between


a defendant's right to a Federal forum and the plaintiff's


to a Federal forum?  It seems to  me they're exactly  the 

same. 

At the  time  it's invoked,  it's  -- there's  no 

Federal jurisdiction. 

MR.  BOYCE: 

I  think  that  under  certain 

circumstances Congress  has made  a distinction  between a


defendant's  right  to  invoke  a  Federal  forum  and  a


plaintiff's right to invoke a Federal forum.

is -- is the rule you rely on  a constitutional rule or a


statutory rule?


 MR. BOYCE:  It is  a -- primarily a  statutory


rule operating -­

QUESTION:  In other  words, you  don't say  the


Constitution would prohibit us from affirming.


 MR. BOYCE:  I -- I  need to qualify  my answer,


Justice Stevens,  because under  some circumstances  there


may be Article III implications here because if -- if it's


a circumstance  where you have just an issue of whether or


not  there's complete diversity,  then that's  a statutory


issue. 

But  if -- if  retroactive  diversity is  being


recognized so  as to  allow a  case to  remain in  Federal


court  for  some  2  or  3  years,  as  happened  in  this


situation, where  there isn't  even Article  III diversity


requirement -- let's say you have an alien versus an alien


with  no citizen  present.  That  does  have Article  III


implications. 


QUESTION:  So  there's a  -- there's no  subject


jurisdiction as a  matter of  constitutional law, just  no


subject matter  jurisdiction.  But nevertheless, you  say


there could be no -- no collateral attack on the judgment.


I'm not sure that I  understand the -- why there  couldn't


be a collateral attack if you're dead right on this.


 MR. BOYCE:  I think that  -- and I -- I cannot

QUESTION:  You are correct in that respect.


 QUESTION:  I  think you're  right, but I'm  just


wondering why.


 QUESTION:  If there -- if there was -- if there


was  an  adjudication of  the  jurisdiction in  the direct


case,  that's binding on  the parties  when the  thing has


become final, just as well as the merits.


 MR. BOYCE:  But I -- I think maybe  the -- the


primary  focus here in  terms of the  applicability of the


time of filing  rule is one that  -- that turns on  the -­

the  purposes  of the  time  of filing  rule.  These  are


summarized in -- in the -­

QUESTION:  May I  take  you back a  little way?


It  is  unconstitutional because  incomplete  diversity is


fine.  Minimal  diversity is fine under  the Constitution.


The statute, 1332, has always  been interpreted to require


complete diversity.


 MR. BOYCE:  Correct.


 QUESTION:  When Marshall first mentions that you


can't oust jurisdiction  by something that happens  after,


he doesn't talk about the statute.  The cases that you are

-- are discussing, out  of which  the timely  filing rule


arises -- it's a kind of  a common law that he's spreading


out.  He  doesn't cite the  -- the jurisdictional  statute


for that.


 MR. BOYCE:  I -- I have  to agree that -- that


both  Conolly  v. Taylor  and  Mollan v.  Torrance  do not


specifically anchor it in the  statute, and to -- to  some


extent, I  would  -- I  would have  to  acknowledge  that


they're somewhat cryptic.  But I think the -- the clearest


statutory anchor  as  the basis  of this  rule comes  from


Anderson  v.  Watt  which,  applying  Mollan and  applying


Conolly, does specifically anchor it in the 1875 iteration


of  the diversity statute in the course of its discussion.


And -- and I  think that's  the clearest  indication that


this is indeed -­

QUESTION:  What was the date of Anderson?  1891?


 MR. BOYCE:  1891.  Correct. 


And the point that we would emphasize here, Your


Honor, is that the longstanding interpretation, similar to


complete diversity as  discussed in the Owen  Equipment v.


Kroger case, is now a part  and parcel of section 1332 and


its predecessors.


 And -- and  so it's not a  situation merely that


the Fifth Circuit is -- is stepping into some area  where


the Court  did not expressly address it in Caterpillar.  I

think the  Fifth Circuit has, in fact, gone beyond that by


creating this new  rule because it's a  circumstance where


it is going  contrary to  the longstanding  interpretation


and understanding of 1332.


 QUESTION:  As  I understand  the bottom line  of


what  the situation  would be, there  was a  trial between


totally diverse parties.  You -- you say  that has to  be


undone.  There's no  question now  that there's  complete


diversity between these same two parties.  So this isn't a


case where there's any federalism interest.  This wouldn't


go back  to the State  court.  This  is a proper  suit for 

Atlas  to bring in  Federal court,  and so you'd  have the 

same court, the  same parties going over exactly  the same 

case, which does seem a terrible waste.

 MR. BOYCE:  I -- I would focus on one portion of


Your Honor's question, which is  in terms of an assumption


that  this  case automatically  would  go back  to Federal


court.  That may well happen, but we don't know -­

QUESTION:  No, no.  It would be up to Atlas, but


Atlas at this point, being  totally diverse from Dataflux,


could walk in -- the day that  Atlas is thrown out, it can


come in  the  revolving  door  and  say,  here's  a  fresh


complaint.  Let's start all over again.


 MR. BOYCE:  I think  an underlying assumption of


that question  is that Atlas has not yet again changed its

-- its partnership, and I  do not know the answer  to that


question. 

QUESTION:  May -- may I ask you is there another

impediment  that you  do know  about  like the  statute of 

limitations? 

MR. BOYCE:  There will be an issue -- the answer


to  your  question  is  that  -- that  whether  or  not


limitations would prevent -- present  an obstacle to Atlas


is going to  be determined under the Texas savings statute


and/or the New York savings  statute.  There was a  choice


of law dispute in the case.


 QUESTION: 

Well, I  assumed  -- I  assumed you


looked into this.


 MR. BOYCE:  And there is a -- a savings statute,


assuming  Texas  law applies,  that  would allow  Atlas to


refile suit. 


One point that I would  note -- and -- and  this


is outside the scope  of the record, but I -- I would put


it before the Court to  completely answer the question  -­

is that Atlas already has  refiled once within 10 days  of


the initial dismissal.  It refiled  in Federal court  and


then  subsequently  dismissed  the  second  Federal  court


lawsuit.  There may be an issue under the savings statute


in terms of  how many times do  you get to refile,  and -­

and I don't know the answer to that.  We haven't looked at

that  specifically. 

But  there  is  a  savings  statute


available, and -- and I presume Atlas would invoke it.


 QUESTION: 

At  what point  did  they  file and


refile?  Because the court of appeals held in their favor.


 MR. BOYCE:  They  filed after  the trial  court


dismissal  and  before  the Fifth  Circuit  held  in their


favor, and I believe that the -- the second suit was filed


in December of 2000 and dismissed in approximately October


of 2001.  I think that's the chronology of it. 


QUESTION:  Dismissed after they won on appeal or


before?


 MR.  BOYCE:  I  think it  was before the  -- the


Fifth Circuit ruled in the case.


 But the -- the point that I  would emphasize is


that  the  -- the  purposes  of the  time  of filing  rule


transcend any individual case -­

the worst -- I don't  see a constitutional problem.  They


didn't notice till after judgment.

were to say,  as a matter of policy, if  you like, Federal


policy, there's an exception to the time of filing rule -­

when nobody notices until after the judgment is entered -­

to  prevent  manipulation?  What's  the worst  thing that


would happen?


 MR. BOYCE:  Justice Breyer, the worst thing that


can happen  is uncertainty in  what was formerly  a bright


line rule in  terms of litigants  being able to  determine


with some certainty whether or  not they belong in Federal


court. 


And I would also focus on this point, which is I


-- I think the  one question  that the Fifth  Circuit and


Atlas do not answer is what is the source of authority for


a Federal court to recognize this retroactive jurisdiction


here?  By process of elimination,  we know what it is not.


It  is  not  section  1653,  because that  addresses  only


defective allegations,  not defective  facts.  It is  not


section 1441 or 1446 because  this is not a removal  case,


and it's not rule 21.  So the -- the bottom line  inquiry


then is what is the source of  this authority and -- and I


don't think  the authority is there,  and in fact  this is


contrary to section 1332.


 And with that, I would reserve the balance of my


time.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


 MR. GREENBERG:  Mr. Chief  Justice, and may  it


please the Court:


 Respondent asks that this Court affirm the Fifth


Circuit's judgment and  hold that,  based on this  Court's


precedent, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction


at  the  time  of  trial  because  the  lack  of  complete


diversity between the parties was cured before trial.


 This Court unanimously held  in Caterpillar that


if the  jurisdictional defect  is cured  before trial  and


then  a case  is  tried on  the merits  and the  court has


Article III -- it's an  Article III court, it has  subject


matter  jurisdiction, that it has the judicial power to -­

to preside over -­

QUESTION:  Yes, but Caterpillar  involved a -- a


situation in which the jurisdictional  defect was cured by


a change in  which parties were in the case.  That has not


occurred here. 


MR. GREENBERG:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  The party is the same, and that makes


it a different case.  You can't possibly say we've decided


this.


 MR. GREENBERG:  With  all due  respect, Justice


Scalia, our position  is that  Caterpillar and the  thread


through Caterpillar of Newman-Green and Grubbs  points out

that that  is not an issue  that was determinative  of the


decision.  The Court  specified unanimously in Caterpillar


that once diversity  is cured -- it didn't say has  to be


cured a certain way.  It didn't say has to  be cured by a


dispensable party leaving, et cetera.  It said simply once


a case has been tried  and diversity obtained at the  time


of trial, that the -- that -­

QUESTION:  Well, Caterpillar  certainly is not a


white horse  case for you.  Otherwise, there wouldn't be a


conflict in  the  circuits the  way there  is.  Certainly


there  are  significant  similarities  but  there  are


differences too. 


MR.  GREENBERG: 

Respectfully,  Chief  Justice


Rehnquist, our position is that the facts in this case are


much  narrower  than  Caterpillar. 

We  fall  under  the


umbrella  of  Caterpillar.  Here  we  did not  have,  for


example, as  in Caterpillar  a mistaken  challenge at  the


inception  of  the  case  that  the  Court  decided  in


Caterpillar to overlook when it  did not remand the  case.


There is no issue of that ilk.


 QUESTION: 

But  there was  something  that you


overlooked or whoever was representing Atlas.


 When  did  Atlas  first become  aware  that  the


citizenship of each partner counts for diversity?  I mean,


this was set up as a Texas business, but in a partnership,

unlike  a corporation,  each partner's  citizenship counts


equally.  And when  did you  first become  aware of  that


rule?


 MR.  GREENBERG:  Justice  Ginsburg, I don't know


if  the  record reflects  that  issue, but  answering your


question,  I  don't  think  either  party  in  the  record


adverted to  that issue  until the  motion to  dismiss was


filed by Grupo Dataflux.  Therefore, the case continued on


from filing through trial to  verdict without either party


adverting  to  the  fact  that  there  may  have  been  a


jurisdictional problem until after -­

QUESTION:  Is it your  understanding that the -­

that the  attorney for Atlas in  this case would  have the


obligation to advise  the court of the  problem the moment


it was discovered?  Does the attorney have an ethical duty


to advise that the original pleading was -- was misleading


as -- as soon as the attorney finds out that this  problem


existed?


 MR. GREENBERG:  Justice Kennedy,  I believe so,


yes.  And  I -- and I  believe that the parties  on either


side,  as well  as the  court I  might add,  if the  court


learned of or had an issue would have brought it up, but I


think certainly counsel had an ethical duty to do so.


 The -- the issue before you is whether this case


creates a new or different  exception to the rule of  time

of filing, and we posit  it does not because  Caterpillar,


contrary  to  -- to the  position  of  the  petitioner -­

Caterpillar stands for the propositions, as I have stated,


which are overwhelming  according to the court.  Finality


in that opinion, costs of litigation, litigants waiting in


line.  That  is an exception  to the rule  of the time  of


filing.  This  case falls within much  narrower -- because


the Fifth Circuit said, if it's cured before trial and not


raised till after trial, then  that's the test.  That's  a


much narrower test. 


QUESTION:  What -- what's the latest time it can


be raised in the view of the Fifth Circuit? 


MR.  GREENBERG:  In  the -- in the view  of the


Fifth Circuit, raised before trial  -- cured before trial,


but  not raised -- but raised  after is what  the court's


test was.


 QUESTION:  Yes, but in your time of filing rule,


you -- you have  a very definite period.  Now,  this is an


exception.  And  when is  the -- under the  rule of  the 

exception, when is the last time this can be raised?

 MR.  GREENBERG: 

I  would 

--  

would 

--

respectfully,  Chief  Justice  Rehnquist,  I  would  think


before  trial is  -- is  the last  time  it can  be raised


because Caterpillar says once a case has been tried.  It's


very clear.

 And -- and our -- in this case Atlas was  tried


to a jury.  And as Justice Ginsburg correctly pointed out,


this case goes right  back to the same court.  And if the


considerations of  finality,  of costs  of litigation,  of


people,  litigants  waiting in  line  to have  their cases


tried  is  to have  any  meaning, then  this  Court should


overlay  that on the facts of this  case and say, well, it


would be as Yogi Berra said, deja vu  all over again, just


to go try this case.

 QUESTION:  Does -- does  the record tell us  why 

the partnership was changed in its composition?

 MR. GREENBERG:  The -- the record does not.  The 

-- the record only reflects that  6 -- 6 months before the


trial, the  two Mexican partners  were bought out,  if you


will,  were no  longer partners.  That was  not finalized


because  of  some -- it  was  -- it  was  final  from the


parties' standpoint, but  there was  a technical need  for


some document  from the NASD, and  I'm not sure  that's in


the record, that that's why petitioner says,  well, it was


really  only finally  cured  a month  before  trial.  But


nevertheless -­

QUESTION:  Did the  same attorneys represent the


partnership in -- in this change of partner transaction as


were representing the -- Atlas in the litigation? 


MR. GREENBERG:  No.  No,  Your -- no, Justice

Kennedy, that is not the case.


 QUESTION:  Do you see any impediment?  Or, first


of all, explain  to me what  that second filing was.  Mr.


Boyce told us -­

MR. GREENBERG:  Yes.


 QUESTION:  -- that you filed a second complaint.


 MR. GREENBERG:  That is not in  the record, but


what occurred is when the judge dismissed this  case after


the jury trial, the thought process was, well, let's start


anew so that whatever happens on appeal, that case will be


advanced so much it would be tried right away, we thought.


But after discussing  it and after  thinking about it,  we


didn't want two cases to go along at the same time.  So we


-- it  -- we  dismissed it  without prejudice,  relying on


whatever happens in this case.


 QUESTION:  So you did  that before you knew what


the outcome was -­

MR.  GREENBERG:  Oh,  yes.  We  did  that long


before  we knew what  the -- long before  we knew what the


outcome or the briefing was in  -- in the -- in the  Fifth


Circuit. 


QUESTION:  Do  you know of any impediment?  Now


-- now it's  for sure that  you can  go back to  the same


court with  the same parties, do  the same thing  all over


again.  Mr. Boyce said that as far as the Texas statute of

limitations is  concerned, it's not a  problem.  Is  -- is


there  anything  that  -- apart  from  repeating  the same


thing, that would put you at a disadvantage?


 MR. GREENBERG:  Mr. Boyce is a bright lawyer and


I don't know  what's in his mind, but as for me, I believe


there's a  savings clause  in the  Texas statutory  scheme


that  upon ruling by this Court, if  it were not to uphold


the Fifth  Circuit  and this  case had  to  be refiled  in


district court, I  -- I believe  that that savings  clause


would pertain  except -- except -- that in the  record it


shows that  New York law is  to apply to  this litigation.


And I don't  know whether New  York substantive law  would


apply or Texas procedural law would apply. 


My coming here today, of course, was the hope of


an affirmance and not have to face that issue.  And -­

QUESTION:  Under the Fifth Circuit rule, suppose


there's no  diversity when the  suit is filed  because the


plaintiff  resides  in  the  same  State  as  one  of  the


defendants,  and  then  the plaintiff  moves  in  order to


create diversity.  Doesn't the Fifth Circuit  rule permit


that to occur  without destroying the jurisdiction  of the


court?


 MR. GREENBERG:  I'll answer -­

QUESTION: 

Then let's  say  this is  done just


before trial.

 MR. GREENBERG:  And  the issue  then is  raised

 QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR.  GREENBERG:  I  would respectfully say this,


not only do I think the Fifth  Circuit rule allows that, I


think Caterpillar allows that.


 QUESTION:  You think which?


 MR. GREENBERG:  I think Caterpillar -­

QUESTION:  Caterpillar.


 MR.  GREENBERG:  -- the unanimous  decision of


this Court, would allow that same fact situation, but -­

QUESTION:  It's  -- it's  really -- it's  really


quite different  to say, look it, it's the same party here


who was here  at the outset  of the trial, this  very same


person,  and he's  been  here  all  through.  All  that's


happened  is  one  other  person  who  -- who  destroyed


jurisdiction has  gotten out.  It  seems to me  it's quite


something different  to say we had  -- we had  one person,


you know, originally  with -- with a  certain citizenship.


That's -- that same person is here.  It was bad as to  -­

as to him  originally, but now  it's changed because  he's


changed his  citizenship.  I'm not sure  that that's  the


same situation.  It seems to me quite different. 


QUESTION:  It seems to me that that situation is


just what  Justice Marshall  dealt with  when he  said you

cannot oust  a court of jurisdiction  once lodged.  So if


there is authority,  then it  doesn't matter whether  that


plaintiff  moves.  I  mean,  the plaintiff  who certainly


couldn't move and become non-diverse and hope to escape an


adverse judgment -- I thought  -- I thought that rule  was


firm, that a  single plaintiff, if  it's just a  two-party


lawsuit, jurisdiction  is not ousted.  And I  don't think


that  Caterpillar in any way suggests  that that one party


plaintiff situation would be different. 


The -- the  partnership is  sort of in  between.


It's not like a single individual, but it's not quite like


Caterpillar  either  where  there  were  wholly  discrete


parties.


 MR. GREENBERG:  I -- I noted  in Caterpillar at


page  11 that the  Court cited  the McMahan case  from the


Third  Circuit  in  which  there  was  a  change  in  the


partnership  after the filing, but before  the trial so as


to empower the court with complete diversity and the court


had the judicial power to decide the case.


 I take  it that if  this Court in  its unanimous


opinion referred  to the  McMahan case,  Knop v.  McMahan,


that it -- it understood that change in that  case and did


not  dispute the  fact, therefore,  that the  change in  a


limited partnership is acceptable so that when that change


occurs and then there is complete diversity and then there

is a  trial, that the court  has the Article  III judicial


power to decide the case. 


Or as -- or  as Justice Souter said  in Lexecon,


while not on  all fours with this case by any means, there


was no continuing defiance but merely untimely compliance.


In  this  case there  was  no continuing  defiance  of the


court's  jurisdiction. 

Once the  limited  partners were


bought out of the limited partnership, this court acquired


the power,  and once it acquired the power, the lineage of


cases,  the thread of  cases from -- from Grubbs, Newman-


Green,  and Caterpillar  say this  court has the  power to


consider that case. 


QUESTION: 

Well,  Grubbs -- what  -- what --


Grubbs was a removal case.


 MR.  GREENBERG:  Yes, that is  true.  The only 

direct filing  case -- you  are correct, Justice  -- Chief 

Justice Rehnquist. 

QUESTION:  I'm glad to know that.

 (Laughter.) 

MR. GREENBERG:  Well -- and -- and following on


that,  but  of  course,  Newman-Green,  a  rule  21  case,


admittedly is  very instructive here  because Newman-Green


-- the court  gave the plaintiff the  option of dismissing


the dispensable  party.  The plaintiff  took the  option.


While the case was on appeal, the appellate court gave the

option.  The plaintiff dismissed the dispensable party and


the court said okay, we had jurisdiction then to render -­

the district court had jurisdiction then to render summary


judgment in that case. 


The plaintiff could have turned down that  power


and said, no, I don't want to lose that dispensable party.


He may be the  money man.  He may be the  one that I  can


come after later on.


 So  you  do  have  this  Court  in  Newman-Green


approving,  if  you  will,  the  act  of  the  plaintiff


unilaterally to make  the decision  whether it's going  to


stay  in Federal  court or in  that case -- well, stay in


Federal court.


 Here,  there are  -- there are  -- the -- the


petitioner  raises  two  salient  issues: 

removal  is


different  than  remand  and this  was  unilateral.  I've


covered the unilateral in my  opinion, and I will say  one


final  thing  about  -- subject  to  questions,  about the


removal. 


And that is once a  case comes to this court  by


removal or  by direct filing, the jurisdictional questions


are  the  same at  that  point,  and  that  is,  is  there


diversity? 

And  in Caterpillar,  it  said,  well, there


wasn't  and  the  court erroneously  ruled,  but  later on


diversity  obtained and we  had Article III jurisdictional

power to try the case. 


I -- it's like  coming to  Washington, D.C.  by


train, boat, plane.  Once  you get  to Washington,  D.C.,


you're  subject to  the same  rules.  Once we be  -- came


before  the  Federal  court  by  direct  filing,  or  once


Caterpillar in the removal filing, the test was the  same.


We -- we believe this is a very, very narrow case.


 QUESTION: 

May  I  just  ask you  one  general


question?  In  -- in your  view  is the  rule  that  you


advocate a one-way street in  the sense that if there  was


jurisdiction when the case  was filed, then the next  week


the plaintiff moved  to the same  State of the  defendant,


there would nevertheless  continue to be  jurisdiction all 

the way down the line?

 MR. GREENBERG:  That -- Justice Stevens, that is 

correct. 


QUESTION:  So it's -- this -- this rule, if  we


adopt it, is  100 -- it's -- it's to -- it's always  to


preserve  or  to  allow  a  -- a  belated  creation  of


jurisdiction. 


MR.  GREENBERG: 

Once the  court  acquires the


power, it  doesn't lose it  or it is  not divested  by the


actions of the parties.


 QUESTION:  Okay.  Then the second question is -­

I just want to be  100 percent sure on your view  -- is if

the  original  defect  is discovered  before  trial,  even


though it had been corrected a day or 2 later, there would


still be a duty to dismiss the complaint, dismiss for want


of jurisdiction because  there was no jurisdiction  at the


time of filing, under your view.


 MR.  GREENBERG:  Respectfully,  Justice Stevens,


it's not  my view.  It's  what I believe  Caterpillar says


because Caterpillar speaks  of a  case having been  tried.


The words are cases tried on -- on -- and I hope it's page

MR. GREENBERG:  I think the court would have  to


dismiss the case. 


QUESTION:  Well,  that's  not what  Caterpillar


says.  Having been tried is what -­

MR. GREENBERG:  It says, having been tried.

having been completed.

you.  I think the court -­

MR. GREENBERG:  Yes.


 QUESTION: 

-- you  have  no  spoiler  in  the


picture, which was what Caterpillar was.


 MR. GREENBERG:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And  if there's a sentence  that says


something  different,  but  the facts  in  Caterpillar was


before the trial began, it was complete diversity.


 MR. GREENBERG:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Your answer to  Justice Stevens, when


he put his question, was yes.


 MR. GREENBERG:  Yes.


 QUESTION:  If  in fact  it's noticed before  the


trial is complete, it is  necessary to dismiss.  And  that


you  believe  the answer  is,  one, yes,  and  you believe


that's implicit in Caterpillar because you agree with what


Justice Scalia said.


 MR. GREENBERG:  That is  correct.  That's  very


well put and I thank you very much.

QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose -­

answer.

QUESTION:  I did too. 


MR. GREENBERG:  But -- but I also -- I also have


to hasten  to point  out that  Justice Ginsburg's  opinion


says cured -- you know, if it's cured before trial.  In -­

in  this case, it  was cured  before trial, but  it wasn't


raised before trial.  It  was raised after the trial.  We


fall well within the umbrella of Caterpillar.


 QUESTION:  Suppose  you had  gone to that  trial


with the two Mexicans still in the partnership and you had


won, and  then could you then  have said to  the court, we


don't need those  Mexican partners?  They're out  of here.


So now, we'd like to make  a motion under rule 21 to  drop


those two  people from the party  lineup.  Could  you have


done that?


 MR.  GREENBERG:  Under  rule  21, if  they were


dispensable, yes.


 QUESTION:  So you're suggesting that a plaintiff


could play the same game  as a defendant could play,  say,


oh, I'm going  to go in -- I'm  going to go in  and get my


trial,  and I'm going  to have  those two spoilers  in the


case, and if  I win, fine,  I won't open  my mouth.  If I


lose, out they go and I start over again.

respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, I would  say that rule 21,


Newman-Green, and Caterpillar does allow that. 


I would  say, though,  on the  other hand,  that


there  are other  checks on  -- on the  ethics  of -- of


lawyers.  If  they do go in with that type of mental frame


of mind, that  there are  ethical obligations, and  you're


going to face the wrath of the court.  The court  may have


a --  a hearing, for  example, to you  -- for you  to show


cause  why you  should be  sanctioned for  misrepresenting


things to the court.  I'm very concerned about that.


 QUESTION:  If  -- if  the rule you're  proposing


kind  of  invites the  sort  of conduct  that  you say  is


prohibited, maybe there's something wrong with the rule.


 MR. GREENBERG:  I'm not  proposing a rule, Chief


Justice -­

QUESTION:  Well, you're  -- you're  proposing a


rule that is derived, you say, from Caterpillar.


 MR. GREENBERG:  I'm proposing  that -- that this


case  on  its  facts  falls  within  the  exception  in


Caterpillar.  I'm not advocating any new rule.


 QUESTION:  Well, except  that there  was not  a


limited partnership in Caterpillar.


 MR.  GREENBERG: 

There  was  not  a  limited


partnership in Caterpillar, but diversity was cured before


trial and the issue was not raised until after trial.

 QUESTION:  And I suppose you would argue that if


we're looking  for bright line rules, we shouldn't make it


turn on  what the  nature of  a particular  jurisdictional


defect was or they moved to  another State or you let  one


partner resign  or something like  that.  The  bright line


rule, it seems to me, has to turn on whether it's  equally


bright line to say you can make this objection up till the


time of  a  verdict in  the trial  court  or it's  equally


bright  line to say you can do  it up to the time that the


appellate court  judgment is final.  You can't do it after


-- we all agree you can't do it on collateral attack.


 And I don't know why one is any more bright line


than the other,  unless you  get into these  ramifications


that there's a difference between  removal and filing or a


difference between the -- the  plaintiff moving to another


State or  -- or  adding a partner.  Those  are all  -- it


seems to me any  one of those  would depart from the  need


for a bright line rule.


 MR. GREENBERG:  Respectfully, Justice Stevens, I


do agree  with that.  I  think the  rule -- the time  of


filing  rule is  -- is a  general rule  and  it has  been


subject to  exception.  We  fall -- we -- this case falls 

within the  Caterpillar,  Newman-Green, Grubbs  exception. 

Yes, there  are distinctions  in the  factual issues,  but 

those distinctions are without a difference as far as what

we would ask this Court to do.


 QUESTION:  Well, they're pretty big distinctions


because in the other  cases, they were just  extra parties


that could  be dropped out.  Here the whole partnership -­

the nature of the partnership had to change.  There was -­

the -- the initial premise for the jurisdiction was  wrong


based  on  the  identity  and  the  composition  of  the


partnership, not the  identity and the composition  of all


of the parties that  are in the complaint.  Now, that may


be metaphysical, but it -- it does seem to me to open more


room  for manipulation than  existed just with Caterpillar


on the books.


 MR. GREENBERG:  Respectfully, Justice Kennedy, I


will answer your question.  I  -- I do not think it  opens


the door to more manipulation.  Two reasons. 


Number one, in Texas the general partner has the


right to bring lawsuits.  The limited partners do not have


the right to sue or be sued in their name on behalf of the


limited partnership.  That's a very important  distinction


here. 


The -- the second point  -- and I think this  is


more important  -- the  precedent of this  Court does  not


discuss intent.  Caterpillar, Newman-Green, Grubbs did not


talk about  what were the parties' intent at the time that


the jurisdictional Article  III power came to  this court.

Since there  is no discussion in those cases of intent, it


is  my reading  that  intent is  not an  issue.  It's  an


absolute.  Did the court have jurisdiction or does it not?


 And I  think there  are checks  and balances  on


lawyers who would manipulate, as you say, Justice Kennedy.


 QUESTION:  Can I get  back to -- to bright  line


rules?  It seems to me it is a bright  line rule, that you


can preserve jurisdiction  by dismissing a party.  That's


very bright line. 


I don't think it's very bright line  to say, you


know, whenever  there  was a  jurisdictional defect  which


later is cured -- in any way  whatever?  I mean, this case


involves  an  alteration  in  the  citizenship  of  the 

partnership.  What about an  alteration of the citizenship 

of  the corporation?  They  reincorporate somewhere  else 

before the  thing  happens?  What about  a  -- a  private 

individual who  decides to move to another State?  Is that


covered?  Is this bright line when  -- when we still have


all of these -- all of these future cases in front  of us?


It seems to me it is not.


 MR. GREENBERG:  Respectfully, Justice Scalia, in


Caterpillar  at 

page  11,  there 

are  overriding


considerations to those analogies, which of course are not


the  facts here. 

There's  no  showing of  intent  here.


There's -- there's -- the  only showing is  neither party

adverted to the issue.  This case was tried.  But -­

QUESTION:  There's  a  difference  between  the


absence of jurisdiction  at the outset,  which is what  is


involved when  you have a plaintiff from the same State as


the defendant which can't be cured by the plaintiff moving


to a diverse  State, and imperfect jurisdiction,  in other


words, that  you do have diversity, but you have a spoiler


in  the  picture. 

That is  -- that  is  very  clear in


Caterpillar, less clear in the  partnership.  Although the


partners are five individuals, they are not  an entity the


way a corporation is.


 MR. GREENBERG:  That's  correct.  In this  -- in


this partnership, there were, I think, two corporations.


 QUESTION:  Wasn't  the partnership  sued  as an


entity?  I thought that it was sued as a partnership.


 MR. GREENBERG:  It was  a sued as a partnership.


That is correct. 


QUESTION:  As a partnership.  And so -­

MR. GREENBERG:  Yes, and two individuals.


 QUESTION: 

So  there  was  no  jurisdiction


initially over the partnership. 


MR. GREENBERG:  That's correct.

sued.  It was the plaintiff, wasn't it?  The -­

the earlier statement,  it was not  a matter of  imperfect

Period.  The -- of the partnership.

 MR. GREENBERG:  According to Carden  v. Arkoma, 

Justice  Scalia, the way  I read it,  the jurisdiction did 

not obtain  at the time  of filing.  That was  only cured


later,  but  the overriding  consideration  in Caterpillar


unanimously by  this Court  is once a  diversity case  has


been tried in  Federal court, with the  rules of decisions


under State law, under Erie v. Tompkins, considerations of


finality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming.  If


I  have  to  take  those  words  as  they  are,  they  are


overwhelming, then it is overwhelming in this case because


this  case is narrower  than Caterpillar.  Why  send this


case back?


 I would ask this Court -- these principles apply


regardless of whether  the case  arrives to Federal  court


through  removal or  original filing.  I  would ask  this


Court, on behalf of the respondent, that this Court  apply


these principles to conclude that  the trial court in this

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. BOYCE


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. BOYCE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


I  would  like  to  elaborate  on an  answer  to


Justice  Breyer's question, which has been touched on by a


number of  the questions here,  which is what's  the worst


that can happen.  And  I -- I think the  point would  be


this. 

Once the  efficacy  of  a post-filing  change  in


citizenship is -- is taken as a given, then I think you're


-- you're  setting up  a situation  where the door  swings


both ways.  Jurisdiction can be created  and jurisdiction


can be destroyed by virtue of post-filing changes.


 QUESTION:  Well, he  says it's the opposite. 


I 

mean, you  -- you could  do that,  but I  mean, it's  very


clear to say it could destroy it; no.  It could create it;


yes.  I mean, that's not hard to understand, and there's a


lot of authority.

 MR. BOYCE:  The -- the rule -- if -- if the line


is drawn there, then I -- I think that raises implications


of manipulation.  You can move and create it and then move


back and not destroy it.  If -- if the concern is creating


incentives -­

QUESTION:  Only if the court says -- only if the


court says  so because  the rule,  even the  timely filing


rule was -- was something that John Marshall said and it's


been that way ever since,  with exceptions and recognizing


that a human individual is different from a corporation is


different  from a partnership.  If  -- if a court is going


to make such a regime, surely it would make a sensible one


and not one that's subject to abuse.


 MR. BOYCE:  If -- there -- there may be -- the


-- the court will do what it will do.  The -- the question


is, is there an -- a creation of additional opportunities


for manipulation or confusion, and we -­

QUESTION:  What are  they?  You were going  to


say.  What are they?


 MR. BOYCE:  And  -- and  I submit  that if  the


bright line rule is no longer bright, if it -- if it turns


on the  fact of how far  into the trial  court proceedings


before this came up, then it's -- the -- the time when you


need certainty  most, in  terms  of being  able to  decide


whether or not you have  jurisdiction, that's when there's

going to be the least  amount of clarity.  And  that's the


real -- the real problem that's -- that's created here. 


And -- and Justice Stevens had  -- had asked the


-- the question saying, well,  why don't we just draw  the


-- the line?  You want a bright line rule?  We'll -- we'll


draw it at the time of trial.  I think the problem here is


that what  you're setting up  is a circumstance  where for


some period  of time, a  trial court,  a Federal  district


court is  acting ultra  vires, to  borrow the phrase  from


Steel Company, for some period  of time prior to  whenever


you  say  the  -- the  post-filing  change  could  become


effective. 

You've got  a  Federal trial  court  that is


operating without authority.  It's issuing orders.


 QUESTION:  No.  You assume the  jurisdictional


defect has been cured. 


MR. BOYCE:  But prior to the time of that curing


of that  defect, you have a  circumstance as you  had here


for  3  years, for  example,  where you've  got  a Federal


district court issuing summary -­

QUESTION:  And as you had in Caterpillar.

 MR. BOYCE:  And -- and I guess the point I would 

make is  -- is this.  If Caterpillar  opened the door to a 

component  of retroactive  jurisdiction, it  did not  open


that door very  wide.  And -- and the -- the choice  is


should that -- should that  door be opened wider and  what

would  be  that  the  confusion  and  uncertainty  and


opportunities for manipulation  that are  going to  result


from  opening that door wider make it appropriate to leave


the line drawn where -­

QUESTION:  Can you imagine a plaintiff's lawyer


deliberately  filing a  Federal  lawsuit  where  he  knows


there's no  Federal jurisdiction?  Why would  he ever  do


that?


 MR. BOYCE:  That may not be a -- a circumstance


that -- that is likely to happen, but -­

QUESTION:  But  you're talking about  deliberate


manipulation, and I just don't  understand why a competent 

lawyer would ever do that.

 MR. BOYCE:  I  -- I  think the  -- the  greater 

issue  is  -- is  one  of  uncertainty  and  of  having  a


circumstance like this case or  going back as early as  -­

as the  Capron case  where the  case gets  filed and  gets


tried and then the issue comes up. 


I do want to  make one note about the  reference


to the Knop case. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Boyce.


 The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon,  at  11:47  a.m.,  the case  in  the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
