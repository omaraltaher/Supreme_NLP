(11:13 a.m.)


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 00-1770, the Department of Housing and Urban


Development v. Pearlie Rucker and a related case. 


Mr. Feldman. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS


MR. FELDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Confronted with the problem, an undisputed


problem, of severe violence and drug crimes and other


crimes in public housing, Congress enacted the statute at


issue in this case.  The statute provides that public


housing leases must provide that any drug-related criminal


activity engaged in by a public housing tenant, any member


of the tenant's household, or any guest or other person


under the tenant's control shall be cause for termination


of tenancy.  It sets forth the conditions by which the


household may possess and occupy Government property,


property that is largely financed by the Federal


Government. 


HUD has construed that statute, in accordance


with its terms, to authorize termination of the tenancy


when the drug-related criminal activity by one of the

named persons occurs without regard to the tenant's


knowledge or control. 


QUESTION:  Do you have any question about the


respondent's standing to contest the provisions that -- of


a lease that's made between HUD and the housing --


MR. FELDMAN:  The -- what happened in the


district court in this case, if I can just answer it this


way, is there was a -- we suggested that the court should


abstain, and this whole thing should be litigated in the


local courts in the unlawful detainer action.  The court


refused to do so on the ground that this was in part an


administrative procedure action against HUD and that HUD


wouldn't have been a party in the local court.  That issue


wasn't raised further on appeal and we didn't raise it in


our petition for cert.


I'm not sure if that answers the question or


not, but -- in any --


QUESTION:  Is the -- is the issue jurisdiction?


MR. FELDMAN:  No, I don't -- I don't think it is


jurisdictional.  The question about whether there's a


cause of action under the APA, for example, is not -- is


not a jurisdictional issue, nor is abstention.


Anyway, HUD has construed the statute in


accordance with its terms, to authorize termination of the


tenancy when there's drug-related criminal activity

regardless of the tenant's knowledge or control.  The


court of appeals read into the statute a limitation that


is nowhere expressed or implied with any of the words that


Congress used, that a tenancy may only be terminated when


the tenant knew or had reason to know of the drug-related


criminal activity.


The question --


QUESTION:  We read scienter requirements into


criminal statutes with some regularity, don't we?


MR. FELDMAN:  Yes.  But there's no -- but this


is a civil -- this is a contract.  It's a civil -- it's a


civil case.  It's a civil contract.  And the law of


contracts historically has been that contractual terms can


be violated without regard to any inquiry into the state


of mind of the contracting parties.


QUESTION:  What -- what about other civil


forfeiture actions?  Are you familiar with any -- any


others of those that don't contain a scienter requirement?


MR. FELDMAN:  I'm not sure -- well, under


Federal law, I'm not sure.  There is now generally a


Federal knowledge -- ignorant owner defense under the


Federal forfeiture statute.


QUESTION:  Was that --


MR. FELDMAN:  State -- in the United States --


in Bennis against Michigan, I don't think there was such a

-- there was such a provision. 


But I think the key point is this is completely


different from forfeiture.  Forfeiture involves someone


who has a property interest that the Government had -- has


nothing to do with and the Government is given the right


to take that property interest.  This is a case where the


tenants never had a property interest in occupancy of


their -- of their apartment in violation of the lease. 


And this is a case in which the Government is saying this


is our property and we're going to let you use it under


certain -- use and occupy it under certain circumstances. 


QUESTION:  Is it your position that the


Government can place any terms and conditions whatever on


leases as long as it doesn't violate some other


constitutional provision like the First Amendment? 


MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, I think that is our position.


QUESTION:  And so this is a condition that the


Government has the right to impose.  Is that your basic


position? 


MR. FELDMAN:  That's right.  And --


QUESTION:  Then you don't need reliance on


Bennis at all.


MR. FELDMAN:  No, no.  Our position is this is


fundamentally different from forfeiture.  Forfeiture


involves tens of millions of leasehold and fee interests

throughout the country.  This involves a -- a much


narrower slice of property interests in -- of -- of --


QUESTION:  Whether it involves a narrower or a


broader slice really doesn't make any difference.  It's


just a different kind of relationship. 


MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  It's a fundamentally


different kind of relationship.  This is the Government's


property to start off with.  It is saying, you can use the


property subject to certain conditions. 


QUESTION:  I guess I'm still -- I guess I'm


still puzzled by why a tenant can sign a lease and then


challenge it.  I mean, what's the -- is -- is he saying


that Federal law that binds the housing authority is


somehow invalid?  And how does he have standing to do that


if the housing authority agrees?


MR. FELDMAN:  I think that the tenant's position


-- I suppose the tenant -- you'd have to ask my opponent,


but I think the tenant's position here is that this lease


provision which embodies the -- the HUD rule of -- the


rule that Congress enacted concerning that there was no


innocent owner defense, that that is itself not authorized


by Federal law or not permitted by Federal law and


therefore was an invalid condition.  I assume that that's


what their position is. 


QUESTION:  The position of the Government in --

in saying that any misuse by any guest, whether on or off


the premises, will result in a forfeiture does seem to


operate in a rather draconian fashion in some of the


examples we've been given in the briefs.  And one wonders


why the Government wants to take such a -- an extreme


position even though it lawfully could.


MR. FELDMAN:  I think most -- I would say that


most of the examples that are given in -- that are given


in the amicus briefs supporting respondent are ones that


are based on third-hand hearsay, and I'm not sure that


they're accurate accounts of those events, but --


QUESTION:  Well, but if they are, they sound


pretty draconian. 


MR. FELDMAN:  I think the underlying point is


that Congress was facing a very serious problem, and it


had essentially three choices.  It could have said, we are


going to have a Federal zero tolerance policy and that's


all.  It could have done what it did, which is vest local


public housing authorities with this tool, a contractual


provision that permits them to get people out when there's


a serious problem or -- or when -- when it's necessary to


ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by the other


tenant.  Or it could have adopted a code of under what


circumstances you can and can't evict, and then left it up


to the -- it would be leave -- left up to the courts to

see whether the particular facts satisfy that code or


don't satisfy that code. 


I think Congress took the only course that was


workable.  If they -- if Congress had gone farther and if


Congress had enacted the statute that the court of appeals


thinks it enacted, then it would not be much of a tool for


public housing authorities because in each case, the


question, for example, of the tenant's knowledge would be


litigated.  The tenant would likely deny knowledge.  The


household members would deny knowledge.  The whole thing


wouldn't --


QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, how can you say that's


so when the district court -- the injunction was he's


drawing a line between on premises and off premises.  And


the injunction doesn't cover anything that happens on the


premises.  As far as that's concerned, the eviction holds. 


So, it's only the cases where the third person does a drug


deal or whatever off premises.  And we had one case in the


parking lot, another case in a bar.  But as far as inside


the premises, there is no case being made.  There's --


nobody is saying that -- at least as I understand it, that


the district judge didn't go far enough. 


MR. FELDMAN:  That -- that's correct.  But the


problem is that in fact drug-related criminal activity


that occurs, for example, in the parking lot of a housing

project can be more threatening to the peaceful enjoyment


of the premises by the other tenants than what would --


might occur in the apartment.  And the same with conduct


that occurs nearby. 


I think the point is that Congress was faced


with it and public housing authorities were faced with the


problem of very serious violence that the court of appeals


said that public housing projects in many areas had become


war zones and drug markets.  And they wanted a -- a


practical, effective way to be sure that public housing


authorities can take those households that are causing the


problem and remove them and replace them with other


households of the many, many households who are on the


waiting list and who wouldn't cause the problems. 


QUESTION:  But you say this is -- a housing


authority may not must. 


MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  And I think in your brief, as well as


in Judge O'Scannlain's opinion for the original panel,


there was a suggestion that the housing authority should


be equitable in the way it administers it, that it


shouldn't evict every time it theoretically could.  And my


question to you is, in recommending that kind of equitable


discretion to be exercised, do you envision that to be an


unreviewable discretion or would there be court review of

the housing authority's determination, say, in these cases


not to exercise equitable discretion? 


MR. FELDMAN:  I don't think there would be


because I think Congress -- the way the scheme works is


this is a provision in a lease which is a sort of


contract.  And there is -- the law of contracts is that a


contracting party may enforce its lease -- its lease


provisions -- Congress was surely aware of that -- when it


wants.  And ordinarily whether it's a Federal contract, a


government contract, or a private contract, the court


doesn't inquire into what are the reasons why you're


enforcing your -- your lease provision here.  They just


inquire -- or your contractual provision.  They just


inquire has the contract been breached or has it not been


breached.  And I think again that that was the only


workable way for this scheme to work. 


Now, in some instances, there may be a public


housing authority faced with some of the really extreme


conditions that came out in congressional hearings and


that are discussed throughout the papers here that may


decide that a zero tolerance policy is the only way to


assure that this -- the drugs are going to be cleaned out


of the housing unit and that the housing -- the households


that are causing the problem are going to be replaced with


some of the other ones on the waiting list that won't

cause the problem. 


QUESTION:  Do I understand --


MR. FELDMAN:  There -- there might be other


cases where that's not appropriate. 


QUESTION:  But you did take the position that


here and now with this, that the housing authority should


not evict automatically, that they should do it on a case-


by-case basis.  Or am I wrong in saying --


MR. FELDMAN:  I think what -- well, you know, I


hesitate to say yes to that because I think what -- our


position is that the housing authority has the discretion


to enforce these provisions or not, and there may be cases


where zero tolerance policy is necessary or required, in


which case that's what they should do.


QUESTION:  But the discretion is unreviewable


and in the -- in the final analysis, as I understand your


argument, it doesn't have to exercise any discretion at


all.  It can zero tolerance across the board. 


MR. FELDMAN:  They -- it could say zero


tolerance across the board. 


QUESTION:  And if -- if you say it's reviewable


by the courts, talk about an unworkable system.  That


would be it. 


MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct because you -- with


respect to the particular issue of knowledge that's at

issue here, as I said, it's going to be very hard for a


housing authority, which is not a criminal prosecution


agency -- they're in the business of running housing --


housing developments, not prosecuting crimes -- to prove


who had exactly what state of mind or who had what level


of control. 


Indeed, both respondents in the court of appeals


suggest that if the tenant -- even if the tenant knew, if


the tenant couldn't control the drug-related activity,


that that would also be a defense.  Well, that would, in


some cases, allow exactly the families and the households


that are causing the biggest problem for the -- for their


-- for their neighbors and for the truly innocent tenants


to remain, and there would be nothing the public housing


authority could do. 


But I think, in general, what Congress wanted


was to give public housing authorities a tool that would


be actually useful in remedying the very serious problem


of not only drug -- drug-related criminal activity but


other criminal activity in public housing units.


The underlying principle really is one of


household-wide responsibility.  No one -- no one suggests


that if the -- everybody agrees, let me put it that way,


that if the tenant is -- engages in drug-related criminal


activity, that the whole household can be removed from the


14

unit.  But in a very real sense, although the legal


relationship is between the housing authority and the


tenant, the practical relationship is they're giving that


whole household the right to occupy the Government


premises.  And it's just the very same rule.  It's whoever


in that household has used -- has engaged in criminal


drug-related activity, that person is liable to be removed


from the tenancy because it -- that person violated a


lease term. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, how do you answer that


the statute doesn't say anything about the duration of


time or the place?  I mean, the hypothetical that the --


let's say the grandson could have dealt with drugs 5 years


ago or could have done it in L.A. and this housing project


is in Massachusetts.


MR. FELDMAN:  In terms of time, I think that


there -- generally the statute doesn't say anything about


time, and I think it would be open to HUD to fill in a --


in a gap, although certainly a very broad period of time


would be -- would be suggested.  It wouldn't be a very


short --


QUESTION:  But you're saying the part of the


unreviewable discretion is it could be 5 years ago.


MR. FELDMAN:  That's -- that's correct, but that


-- that -- it was not -- the issue of time and place --

and let me say place is addressed in the statute because


Congress -- originally it said on or near, and Congress


amended in 1996 to say on or off.  So, the one thing we do


know is that place is not something that was relevant.


And again -- actually if I can turn to place for


a second, you could have a drug crime that occurs 3,000


miles away, and ordinarily -- and I think it would never


be -- I don't know of any case where anyone has been tried


to be evicted.  It's a very theoretical possibility that


anybody would be.  But if that crime was that that person


was trying to import drugs and bring them to that person's


unit in the housing complex, it would be highly relevant.


And what Congress intended was that public housing


authorities have the tool to take care of the problems


that they saw.  They're not evicting people who are -- who


are engaged in drug crimes 3,000 miles away or 20 years


before.


Respondents rely and the court of appeals relied


on the forfeiture provision.  I've already said that the


forfeiture raises a completely different issue.  And the


fact that -- it is true that Congress added leasehold


interest to the forfeiture statute in it -- when it --


when it rewrote this statute in 1990, although it didn't


substantively change the terms of the statute.  But I


think the -- it's very express innocent owner defense

that's in the lease -- in the forfeiture statute contrasts


very sharply with the absence of not only any such defense


but even any word that suggests such a defense in this


statute. 


The doctrine of in pari materia, which they


appeal to, can sometimes be used where you have a


particular term in a statute that in a closely related


statute is either defined or, by context, has a very clear


meaning and the same meaning then is -- is imported.  It's


quite a different thing here where -- this is a -- the


forfeiture statute is entirely different from --


QUESTION:  Well, it runs up against expressio


unius too, doesn't it --


MR. FELDMAN:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- as a --


MR. FELDMAN:  Right, and -- and I think in this


case where there's no word in this statute that requires


that -- that requires interpretation and the context that


you're trying to take the meaning from is quite a -- an


entirely different context, I don't think that that in


pari materia is soundly applied.  In fact, I think just


the contrast between the statutes clearly points out


Congress' -- what Congress intended. 


The -- the -- you know, I'd add that this --


this -- the rationale of this statute ensures not only

that there's the maximum incentive for tenants in public


housing to ensure that their household members and they


themselves are not engaged in drug-related activity and to


find out about that activity rather than remaining


ignorant, but in the end, it ensures that households in


Government subsidized housing who are a threat to their


neighbors or who may be a threat to their neighbors in the


view of the public housing authority, that they are


removed and that -- and replaced with others of the many


families who are on the list who would not pose such a


threat.


Finally, the court of appeals also relied on the


doctrine of constitutional avoidance, but this statute is


clear and there's no warrant for applying that doctrine. 


And in any event, there isn't any serious constitutional


problem with interpreting it as HUD has.  Although the


tenants have a property interest in their lease, that is


-- that entitles them to the right to the full procedural


due process protections before the lease is terminated,


but it doesn't govern what the substantive terms of the


lease are. 


QUESTION:  They can litigate that in the


unlawful detainer action.


MR. FELDMAN:  That's right, and they have the


right to litigate all of the issues that would come up in

the unlawful detainer action, but it doesn't -- the -- the


fact that they have a property interest in their lease


doesn't, in turn, give them a property interest in acting


in ways substantively that are contrary to the terms of


their lease. 


If there are no further questions, I'd like to


reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Feldman.


Mr. Lafayette, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY T. LAFAYETTE


ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONERS


MR. LAFAYETTE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In response to Congress' enactment of


1437d(l)(6) and HUD's regulations, the Oakland Housing


Authority revised its lease to properly reflect the


changes that had taken place with regard to the HUD


regulations.  And it specifically did that in three


instances.  It revised the lease at paragraph 9(m) and it


revised the occupants' responsibility statement, and then


it revised what is known as the tenant agreement to


maintain a drug-free environment. 


In each instance, it -- it advised each tenant


and requested each tenant to sign a statement


acknowledging that they clearly understood that if this

type of conduct took place within their apartment or off


housing authority property, that they could be subjected


to a lease cancellation. 


In this case, we came forward with four


individuals whose leases were canceled because of this


particular type of activity.  And the housing authority's


position is it was necessary for it to take the action


with regard to each one of these particular individuals


because of the conduct that they were participating in or


the conduct of individuals in their households were


participating in, which conduct which posed a significant


risk of injury to other members of the housing authority


and to the community in which these particular


developments are located. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Lafayette, how big a problem is


this in this housing authority? 


MR. LAFAYETTE:  It's a -- it's a significant


problem.  One of the things that we've pointed out in our


moving -- in -- in our merits brief was that this is a


housing authority that has approximately 8,000 individuals


who are scattered in 3,308 low income to moderate income


housing units.  From 1998 until November of this past


year, there were 700 felony arrests for drug-related


criminal activity in or near Oakland Housing Authority


property.  Significantly, between January 1, 2001 and


20

21

22

23

24

25

November 6, 2001, the number of felony arrests was 250 for


drug-related activity.  That's a significant sum.


One of the things that I think is also


significant is that this is a housing authority that does


not necessarily have large housing development complexes.


A number of its developments are smaller units.  For


example, in the Hill and Lee cases, those are individuals


who resided in -- in a development that is approximately


eight units, eight units in a neighborhood that is


comprised almost exclusively of single family dwellings. 


When these individuals participate in this drug activity


in the front of that unit, it is not only affecting the


members of the housing authority community itself, it is


affecting the general community at large and all the


individuals there. 


And significantly we need to point out that we


responded there not because we happened to be driving by,


but the response was -- was premised on a complaint being


made.  And that's part of the record.  So, what's


happening is this housing authority is responding to


complaints made by residents, and one of the things that


we point out is this housing authority has been subjected


to litigation by -- being made by its residents demanding


that the housing authority take more affirmative action


and steps to address these issues of drug and drug-related

activity. 


In -- it seems to me -- to me that there is no


issue that in each one of these particular cases there was


just cause for the housing authority to go forward and --


and to exercise this discretion reasonably and that it did


so.  And one of the things that -- that seems to appear is


the question of whether or not it is exercising


discretion, and we always point the Court to the case of


Pearlie Rucker because that's a case where the housing


authority initially proceeded with termination of that


lease and, in the process of doing so, came to understand


that the individual in the household who was participating


in the drug activity, Gelinda Rucker, was a person who had


actually become incarcerated and therefore no longer posed


a risk of injury to the remainder of the housing authority


or the community.  Realizing that, the agency at that


point discontinued its efforts to dismiss that -- to


terminate that lease.  And at the time this lawsuit was


actually filed, there was no longer a pending dispute


between the housing authority and Pearlie Rucker who was


the -- who was the tenant responsible for that lease.


QUESTION:  But that was not required of the


housing authority, and if they had gone and said, well, we


don't care that circumstances have changed, out you go,


that would be unreviewable.

 MR. LAFAYETTE:  That would be unreviewable.  And


the reason for that is the housing authority needs the


discretion to act where it believes it is necessary for it


to act.  And in each one of these instances, this housing


authority has come forward with that position.  And


without that discretion, a housing authority would be


strapped to look for and to document events that require


it to move or compel it to move or would set some -- would


meet someone else's satisfaction of when it should move. 


And those things may not be present from the information


that it might have before it. 


The -- and one of the things we think that --


that Congress recognized, that housing authorities are not


as well equipped as are the Federal Government in order to


respond to these types of issues, particularly with regard


to the loss of additional funds to cities.  With that in


mind, it is significant that this housing authority has


responded in the way that it has responded. 


We -- we have -- have listened to the Solicitor


General's discussion this morning, and we are in accord


with regard to the position that he has taken with regard


to what Congress intended and how Congress went about


evaluating the various needs of residents of public


housing. 


One of the things that I think that needs to be


23

clearly stated is that the housing authority itself does


not benefit from a statute like this because the housing


authority is only going to take that apartment unit and to


re-lease that apartment unit out to someone else who is in


need of low income public housing.  The housing authority


has this provision in its lease because, one, there --


it's required by the HUD regulations, and number two, it


needs to be able to provide its residents with safe and


decent housing, which is what this is really all about, is


how it goes about providing safe and decent housing.


QUESTION:  Do you take the position that you


could have this provision in the lease even without the


Federal statute?


MR. LAFAYETTE:  There is nothing that restrains


us from putting this provision in this lease before that. 


And in fact, prior to -- though not part of the record,


prior to this provision being enacted by Congress, there


was a similar provision in the lease itself.  It just did


not embrace the concept of activity off of housing


authority property.  The provision was amended after the


-- after Congress acted.


QUESTION:  That -- that in premises has not --


has never been an issue in this case, I take it. 


MR. LAFAYETTE:  In premises has not, but in


premises alone does not address the problem with regard to

this type of activity in public housing.  It's not


unforeseeable that individuals who participate in this


conduct off premises may not lead those who have issues


with them onto housing authority property and thereby


jeopardize the interest and the -- the right to enjoyment


of the other residents. 


With that, I'll reserve the rest of my time


for --


QUESTION:  May I ask one question, if you're


through?  Is there any procedure at all to -- I'm pointing


-- I'm referring to the fact that the housing authority


has such broad discretion.  They can not only make


charges, but they can decide to waive them.  Is there any


procedure at all to be sure that that power isn't abused


by waiving it in cases of all Democrats but enforcing it


for all Republicans or something like that? 


MR. LAFAYETTE:  There -- there isn't a procedure


in place for anyone to review these decisions based on


some arbitrariness standard.  No, there isn't. 


QUESTION:  Well, but I mean, in the precise


instance that Justice Stevens gave you, that would be a


constitutional violation, wouldn't it? 


MR. LAFAYETTE:  If --


QUESTION:  And you -- you would have judicial


review for -- for violation of some constitutional

provision. 


MR. LAFAYETTE:  It's foreseeable if there is a


constitutional issue.  If, for example, this -- this


policy is only being used against people of a particular


race --


QUESTION:  Of course. 


MR. LAFAYETTE:  -- then those issues could be


reviewable. 


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. LAFAYETTE:  But --


QUESTION:  What?  In a 1983 action against the


housing authority?  Is that what -- what would -- how


would it be? 


MR. LAFAYETTE:  That could be and it could be a


1983 violation against the housing authority. 


QUESTION:  Well, wouldn't it have to be on your


view?  Wouldn't it have to be in a separate 1983 action on


the -- on the view that you take? 


MR. LAFAYETTE:  It could be -- landlord-tenant


disputes in California are summary proceedings which


particularly dovetail into the issues in dispute, and it


probably would be a separate action as a 1983 claim.  But


one of the things we don't have here is a claim that says


that these individuals are being singled out for lease


cancellation because of their race or some other suspect

Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Lafayette. 


Mr. Renne, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. RENNE


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. RENNE:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the


Court:


In this case, as we've heard in -- in the


argument of HUD is that HUD says, by reason of this lease


provision, which Congress mandated in section 1437d(l)(6),


it is the judge and jury as to whether or not innocent


tenants, such as the -- the respondents who are before


this Court, whether they can be summarily evicted from


their homes. 


QUESTION:  Well, that doesn't really differ from


the role of any landlord in a landlord-tenant situation,


does it? 


MR. RENNE:  Yes, Your -- Chief Justice, it does


because what they're saying is that there can be no


defenses raised in the eviction proceeding other than an


attack on whether or not there was a drug-related


violation.


QUESTION:  Well, but as the Chief Justice points


out, that's true in -- I've drafted many leases and we

have clauses --


QUESTION:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  -- that this premises is used for


commercial purposes.


QUESTION:  Regional eighths.


QUESTION:  The lease is void and that's -- and


that's it.  Now, you may say that -- you can argue about


whether or not the -- the provision itself was violated,


but I know of no authority where it says where the lessor


can't exercise this option. 


MR. RENNE:  Justice Kennedy, under most State


laws, the eviction court has a right to make a


determination whether under all the facts and


circumstances to -- to terminate the lease would be, for


example, a forfeiture because of the violation not being


sufficient or the circumstances such as -- that don't


bring it under those terms. 


Now, what -- and interesting enough, we heard


nothing about it, but Congress also mandated --


QUESTION:  We just don't have before us a


question in which you're contesting that the drug activity


occurred.


MR. RENNE:  Yes, but the Congress mandated that


in any action taken to evict, HUD, or the Oakland Housing


Authority in this case, had to provide some grievance

mechanism of an independent evaluation whether eviction


should occur.  However, it said that HUD can grant due


process exemptions under the circumstances where HUD makes


an affirmative determination that the eviction court


provides due process to the tenant.


QUESTION:  This wasn't the basis of the Ninth


Circuit's decision, was it? 


MR. RENNE:  Yes.  The -- the Ninth Circuit talks


in terms of the -- of the opportunity to present defenses.


Now, what the Ninth Circuit was going on, it was


saying that there's nothing in the statute -- and it was


Congress' intent not to take away an innocent tenant


defense.  And that would be presented to the eviction


court.  And Congress has provided for the eviction court


to have a right to hear all legal and equitable defenses.


QUESTION:  Well, this doesn't sound to me like


the Ninth Circuit's reasoning at all.  Perhaps I'm


mistaken.


MR. RENNE:  Well, it -- it is, Your Honor, if


you look at what the Ninth Circuit is saying.  The Ninth


Circuit is saying that that section does not take away an


innocent tenant defense.


QUESTION:  Where does it come from in the first


place? 


QUESTION:  Well, where did -- exactly.  Where

did it come from in the first place? 


MR. RENNE:  The innocent tenant defense? 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. RENNE:  From the -- the statute which


provides that in eviction proceedings, the eviction court


shall provide an opportunity for the tenant to present all


legal and equitable defenses. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but the question is whether or


not this is a legal defense. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  That's the only question before us.


MR. RENNE:  That's correct.  And, Your Honor, it


is our position that it is a legal defense that is


recognized in most State court proceedings.


QUESTION:  But it's not recognized in the


Federal statute or in the regulations.  That's the


problem.  This is manufactured by the Ninth Circuit.  It


isn't there. 


MR. RENNE:  The -- the statute doesn't say


anything about defenses.  The statute is only saying


here's a lease provision that you shall put into the


lease.  HUD's own regulations say, if you want to enforce


it, you have to go to an eviction court, and the eviction


court has a right to consider all equitable legal


defenses.

 QUESTION:  But these tenants didn't let it get


to that stage.  They preempted it and filed some kind of a


suit to get an injunction before there had ever been a


proceeding. 


MR. RENNE:  That's correct.  And that was on the


point that it was a violation of the -- of what power


Congress had given HUD to interpret the statute which is


totally silent.  It says nothing about defenses.  And when


you look at what happened at the same time when Congress


enacted that particular provision in 1988, it was the same


time in which it took public housing leases, put them


under the forfeiture statute, and said under forfeiture


statutes, you must provide an innocent tenant defense.


QUESTION:  Why didn't it say that here?  I mean,


you -- this suggests that when Congress said nothing about


the defense here, it meant the defense didn't exist. 


Where it wanted the defense --


QUESTION:  It put it in. 


QUESTION:  -- it specified it.  And you say they


say nothing about it.  They say nothing about it because


it didn't exist. 


MR. RENNE:  I -- I submit the reason why they


didn't is because landlord-tenant law is a -- in public


housing is a amalgamation of Federal and State law, and


that's well recognized in all the cases.  They knew, at

the time that they passed section 1437d(l)(6), that there


was also the provisions that said legal and equitable


defenses may be presented.  They were not -- they were not


focusing on what defenses are available. 


QUESTION:  These provisions are -- that say


legal and equitable defense can be presented are -- appear


in Federal law or in State law? 


MR. RENNE:  They appear in HUD's regulations. 


In the -- they can only grant a due process exemption if


they find that the State eviction court gives the tenant


an opportunity to present legal and equitable defenses. 


Congress, when it was passes -- passing section


1437 --


QUESTION:  And you think this is an


authorization for all sorts of defenses? 


MR. RENNE:  Absolutely.  Whatever defenses are


recognized by the eviction court.


QUESTION:  Then you are going considerably


beyond where the district court left off.  And the


district court made a distinction between on premises and


off premises, and it didn't give any injunction with


respect to on premises.  Your argument doesn't have that


limitation.  Your argument is equitable defense of


innocence; I didn't know.  And it doesn't draw any line at


all between in and off premises.  So, you are asking this

Court to take -- to state a rule of law that would go


considerably beyond the district court injunction that was


then reviewed by the Ninth Circuit.  You're asking us, in


-- in effect, to reverse the district court because it


didn't go far enough, if I understand your argument. 


MR. RENNE:  I believe you are correct, Justice


Ginsburg, that we believe that that defense of a totally


innocent tenant should be available whether the offense


occurred off or on the premises just as it does in the


forfeiture statute.


QUESTION:  Did you object in the Ninth Circuit


because the district court didn't go far enough?


MR. RENNE:  I don't believe so, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  A very odd procedural posture you're


in.  You're trying to overturn your victory in the


district court.


MR. RENNE:  I'm not trying to overturn it, Your


Honor, I suggest, but I would be perfectly happy if this


Court addressed just the off premises, which is what the


district court held.  But the whole --


QUESTION:  But you say there's no logical line


that one could draw.  On your -- if your theory is


innocent tenant is a defense, then how can you defend that


defense for off premises only?


MR. RENNE:  The -- the Ninth Circuit didn't draw

that line either.  The Ninth Circuit took the position


that the innocent tenant defense was not precluded and in


fact was preserved under that --


QUESTION:  I thought the Ninth Circuit affirmed


the district court's judgment.


MR. RENNE:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  And the district court said the --


there is no problem with on premises.  Off premises is


what's unreasonable.


MR. RENNE:  What the district court said is, I'm


not going to issue an injunction for on premises.  Might I


respectfully submit what the court was saying there was


that the balancing and the clearness of the likelihood of


prevailing was not necessarily clear as he felt it was at


the -- at the off premises, so that in the context of a


preliminary injunction, he did not make a ruling as a


matter of law at the end of the day that that -- that he


would adhere to the position that he was taking for


purposes of the injunction. 


QUESTION:  But you said there's no difference at


all.  So, it would be just as arbitrary.  I mean, if -- if


you say innocent -- innocence is the defense, the innocent


tenant, then whether it's preliminary injunction or


permanent injunction, it's a line that you say cannot


logically stand.

 MR. RENNE:  On the facts that were before the


district court judge, all he had to deal with, for


purposes of the injunction, was the -- the off premises. 


And I respectfully submit it's not a final judgment that


he was addressing.  He was addressing what's the


likelihood of success.


Admittedly -- and I don't -- I think we all


recognize that if there's an offense on the premises, the


likelihood of a innocent tenant defense being successful


is far less, but in the case where you have someone, like


the three female respondents in this case who are long-


time tenants who have had no problems -- and certainly the


Oakland Housing Authority is not arguing they had problems


with them -- and you have a grandson who smokes cigarettes


in the parking lot, and HUD takes a position -- and


Oakland Housing Authority takes a position that we can


apply some kind of collective guilt because, regardless of


what the Government wants to say and characterize it as a


contract action, the end result to these three respondents


and the innocent -- innocent members of the household is


to throw them into the streets.


QUESTION:  You think it's irrelevant that the


tenants signed a contract which specifically provides this


in the -- in the rider.  It's at page 69a of the appendix. 


You think that that's just irrelevant.

 MR. RENNE:  No, Justice Kennedy, it's not


irrelevant.  The --


QUESTION:  I -- I frankly don't understand your


-- your standing to contest the housing authority's


interpretation of a HUD regulation anyway.  You just


signed a lease that -- that HUD gave you and that's it.


MR. RENNE:  The -- the question is -- and I


think the contract question is way circular, that if -- if


Congress did not mandate that it's an automatic eviction


with no opportunity to present any kind of a defense, if


Congress didn't mandate it, the fact that it's in the


lease doesn't change it.  You still have to get to -- the


question is did section 1437d(l)(6) -- did it mandate? 


And it would be the only section of the lease.


QUESTION:  Well, but I'm not sure you're correct


in your argument there, Mr. Renne, because perhaps you --


if you had a prohibition against that sort of a thing in


the statute, certainly HUD would be bound by it.  But with


no -- no provision one way or the other, certainly that's


something that HUD is entitled to interpret, and it has


interpreted it by its regulations. 


MR. RENNE:  The -- but it's also, in its


regulations, said that the tenant has a right in the


eviction court to present equitable and legal defenses.


QUESTION:  But as Justice O'Connor said, you

never let it get to the eviction court.  The -- it wasn't


litigated as to whether the lease should be revoked or


not.  All that was litigated was whether HUD had a right


to put this provision in its lease.


MR. RENNE:  I respectfully submit, Mr. Chief


Justice, that is not what they litigated.  They litigated


that they did not have a right to terminate -- to


terminate an innocent tenant, not to put that in their


lease.  That -- there's nobody saying that they can't put


the provision in their lease.  The question is -- and --


and nobody is disputing that there is a serious problem of


drugs in public housing, and we aren't -- we aren't


suggesting anything to the contrary.  But I suggest that


the respondents and the way they're being treated by the


Oakland Housing Authority are making them victims as well.


QUESTION:  Well, but they're being treated in


accordance with the provisions of their lease.  And you


ordinarily can't come into a court and say, gee, you know,


you're putting these tenants out on the street if in fact


they've breached their lease in a way that permits the


landlord to do that. 


MR. RENNE:  But again, with all due respect,


that's assuming the answer, and that is that the lease


does say that you can't present an innocent tenant


defense.  And again I go back to --

 QUESTION:  Well, that's a different -- now that


Ninth -- that's -- finally you're talking about something


the Ninth Circuit talked about, and it seems to me that


that's just absolutely dead wrong.  Page 69 of the


appendix has a rider, a supplemental provision of some


kind, which makes it crystal clear that there is no


innocent defense.


MR. RENNE:  But the -- if you are suggesting


that the tenant has any choice in a public housing


situation in which the -- the only choice of housing they


have is public housing, to say that somehow or other they


have agreed to a provision which Congress didn't require.


QUESTION:  Well, but -- but now -- now you're


skating away from the point where we were finally at


issue.  You said the lease doesn't provide this, and --


but now your answer is, well, even if it did, it


shouldn't.  I mean, that's just -- that's just not


responsive to my point.


MR. RENNE:  My -- Justice Kennedy, what I was


saying is that section 1437 of the -- of the statute


didn't require the language that they are putting in.


QUESTION:  But under -- under your theory, you


have to show not just that it didn't require it, but that


HUD could not, as an administrative agency, interpret it


to allow that.

 MR. RENNE:  And I believe --


QUESTION:  It seems to me your argument -- when


-- when you have to argue that point, the argument, as I


regard the Ninth Circuit opinion, is just extremely weak.


MR. RENNE:  I address that in three ways.  One


is that I believe that when you look at the circumstances


under which that section was passed in conjunction with


881, the forfeiture statute, you look at the -- what


little comments were made by any committees that were


addressing it, and when you look at the alleged rationale,


none of them support HUD.  But even more basic, if you


accept HUD's interpretation, we respectfully submit that


it raises serious constitutional issues. 


QUESTION:  And precisely what are those issues?


MR. RENNE:  The due process issues, Your Honor,


in that what they are threatening to do is to attach


punishment and collective guilt, and in American


jurisprudence, we always put individual --


QUESTION:  If you're -- you're saying if you're


-- if you're evicted from a tenant -- as a tenant from a


public housing, you are, A, punished, and B, you're found


collectively guilty?


MR. RENNE:  You are certainly being punished,


and Rucker being thrown out in the street is certainly


being punished.

 QUESTION:  Well, then -- then every eviction


proceeding in the country punishes the tenant.  Every


successful eviction proceeding. 


MR. RENNE:  And it's because the tenant has


supposedly violated and the eviction court has found,


based upon all the evidence that it hears, that eviction


is appropriate. 


QUESTION:  Well, we're just going in circles,


Mr. --


QUESTION:  You -- as I understand the provision


that you object to, it -- it says, in effect, the -- the


tenant who signs the lease is going to be the guarantor


that there will be no drug activity in the apartment or by


other people who are -- are inhabitants or even people who


come to the apartment, going to be a guarantor.  Are you


saying that that kind of a guarantee provision is simply


forbidden by the Constitution? 


MR. RENNE:  Under these circumstances, yes. 


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. RENNE:  In -- for the same reason that I


believe this Court has at least indicated in -- in dicta,


that when you are essentially seizing what is property,


particularly somebody's home, you must afford them due


process including --


QUESTION:  Well, we're -- now, you're talking

about procedural due process, and there's no claim here,


as I understand it, that the tenants were denied


procedural due process.  I understand your argument to be


that substantive due process forbids this kind of a


guarantee provision, and when I say why, I'm asking you


why substantively does due process forbid. 


MR. RENNE:  And substantively is that you are --


you are punishing without any guilt and without allowing


the tenant to establish that he or she is innocent.


QUESTION:  So, no one can be made the guarantor


under a contract for the conduct of a third person.


MR. RENNE:  Not in public housing --


QUESTION:  -- from the Government.  Is that --


is that --


MR. RENNE:  In the public housing situation.


QUESTION:  Is that your position?


MR. RENNE:  That is correct.


QUESTION:  Then you're challenging something


that you have, as I see it, no standing to raise in this


Court because I looked back at the district court's


opinion, and what it said as to conduct occurring in the


tenant's union -- unit -- it didn't say, well, we just


won't extend it preliminarily.  It said, eviction under


such circumstances appears rationally related to a


legitimate public housing goal and constitutional.  It was

a ruling on the merits that as far as the in premises


setting is concerned, it was constitutional.  And you're


arguing that that's not the case, and I don't see how you


can argue that when you haven't filed any cross appeal


ever.


MR. RENNE:  Well, with all due respect, Justice


Ginsburg, the cases in this Court have said that


respondents are entitled to rely on anything that would


affirm the judgment below.


QUESTION:  But the judgment below that's being


affirmed deals only with off premises. 


MR. RENNE:  It's the Ninth Circuit judgment that


is being attacked, and the Ninth Circuit does not limit


itself in terms of the arguments that it raises and it --


conclusions it reached --


QUESTION:  Are you not making a distinction


between a judgment and an opinion?  I mean, what was


affirmed was the judgment of the district court.


MR. RENNE:  What was affirmed was the


preliminary injunction. 


QUESTION:  Yes, and that preliminary injunction


was only with respect to off premises activity, and that's


all that the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 


MR. RENNE:  Yes, I don't disagree with that at


all.

 But the rationale of the Ninth Circuit opinion


applies with equal force because the only thing they had


before them is whether or not the district court had


abused its discretion in the grant of preliminary


injunction.


But continuing to address the -- the due process


is that all we are saying is that these tenants have a


right to establish that they should not be punished by


reason of somebody else's conduct without a showing --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I realize that's your


position, but in order to maintain that position on a


substantive due process basis, you've got to say, I


suppose, that there's no reasonable relationship between


this kind of guarantor of conduct provision and the kind


of drug problem which I presume it is conceded the


Government can deal with.  And it seems to me that there's


a pretty obvious substantial relationship between them and


that's why your argument doesn't seem to have any sort of


intuitive plausibility to it.  Can you address that?


MR. RENNE:  Well, I don't think that -- when you


say it seems to be obvious, with all due respect again, I


would say they talk about deterrent.  It seems to me that


Ms. Pearlie Rucker who took steps to assure that there


were no violations, told her daughter there were no --


what the problems were, and as far as she knew, knew

nothing about what happened three blocks away from the


apartment.


QUESTION: 

Well, she didn't take enough steps


under the lease.  Under the lease she assured the housing


authority that her premises would not be the site of drug


activity nor would anybody who brought drug activity into


the housing -- into the environs of the housing authority


be residing in her --


MR. RENNE:  And --


QUESTION:  Now, she could do that, and you're


saying she was blameless.  Well, perhaps she was


blameless, but she didn't do what she had committed to do,


and that is to make sure that nobody in her apartment


caused that place to be a drug area. 


There seems to me nothing unconstitutional about


that, saying we're going to let you in here if you assure


us that no one who resides in the -- in the premises that


we're giving you under this program will be the source of


a drug problem.  What's unconstitutional about that? 


MR. RENNE:  I suggest that we took -- we take --


compare it to the forfeiture statute where we have


specifically -- Congress has mandated that in the


forfeiture situation where the drug offense can be -- on


the premises can be horrible, it can be a very serious


drug offense, and they cannot forfeit the tenancy.

 QUESTION:  Congress has said that.  You think


Congress had to say that?


MR. RENNE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  My goodness.  I -- there are many


instances under State law where you forfeit an automobile


which is being used for contraband even if you do not know


that it's being used.  It's your responsibility to make


sure your car is not used for contraband.  That's


unconstitutional? 


MR. RENNE:  And the -- the -- it's not -- this


Court has held it is not --


QUESTION:  Not --


MR. RENNE:  -- if there's a nexus either because


the automobile was used --


QUESTION:  It's your car.  And -- and what the


State says is when you have a car, it's your


responsibility to make sure it's not used for contraband,


and if it is, we take it away.  That's not


unconstitutional.  Why is this any different?  In fact,


this is a good deal less because it's not even her


premises.  It is a condition of giving her this benefit.


MR. RENNE:  Well, I -- I think the courts


recognized that it is her premises.  It's her home


regardless of the fact that it's a public housing or it's


private.  And as I believe that this Court has commented

in opinions that you don't forfeit a house if somebody


smokes one marijuana cigarette in it --


QUESTION:  But --


MR. RENNE:  -- even though it may have occurred


on the premises.


QUESTION:  -- forfeiture suggests the Government


coming in from the outside and taking the property because


of criminal activity.  Here the Government isn't coming in


from the outside.  The Government is the owner of the


property.  It is the landlord.  And so, you're not talking


about the same sort of forfeiture at all. 


MR. RENNE:  Well, 881 talks specifically about


public housing leases as being subject to forfeiture.  So,


you are -- in those contexts you're talking about the


identical situation that under the forfeiture statute


somebody could come in to Ms. Rucker, if she violated some


criminal law -- could come and try to forfeit it.  But


it's much easier.  Let's get the Oakland Housing Authority


to come in here and we don't have to show she knew


anything about it.  She could be perfectly innocent, and


that is, we submit is fundamentally unfair.


QUESTION:  Does the landlord have some duty to


provide a secure -- a secure premises, i.e., secure from


drug use? 


MR. RENNE:  Yes.  And I -- and I submit that

easily enough to do as they said -- as -- as counsel said


with Ms. Rucker.  They said, we withdrew the unlawful


detainer action, although I might say they didn't withdraw


the eviction notice, but they withdrew the unlawful


detainer action when the individual who was involved was


separated from the premises.  That's what we respectfully


submit is -- that's the easy problem in the innocent


tenant case, is to go to that tenant or to have the tenant


come to HUD and say, look, I've got a problem.  My son is


-- is into marijuana and he won't listen to me.  I want


him removed.  Take him off the household list. 


Now, is she going to do it confronted with the


fact that HUD could say or Oakland Housing Authority could


say, well, sorry, Ms. Rucker, rather than ask your


daughter to go off, we're going to throw you out?  Why


would she ever go there?


QUESTION:  The housing authority wants to put


the responsibility on her.


MR. RENNE:  Right. 


QUESTION:  It wants to put the responsibility on


the tenants to make sure that they are not being the cause


of a drug problem in the facility.  It seems to me


perfectly reasonable, and if she -- if she has been at


fault in not doing that or even in all innocence hasn't


done it properly, nonetheless, she hasn't fulfilled her

obligation under the lease, which is to make sure that


nobody on her premises is a source of a problem. 


MR. RENNE:  And -- and the best way for -- to


make sure that that doesn't happen, that is, that no one


on her household violates a drug law or -- remember, the


statute doesn't just relate to drugs.  It relates to


criminal activity.  And as the amicus briefs point out,


there -- and -- that there are spouses who are being


evicted by reason of the fact that they're subject to


spousal abuse which violates the criminal law.  And -- and


all we're saying is they have to have a chance to go to


the eviction court and present that to the eviction court


so that the eviction court has a right to deal with


whether or not there is good cause. 


And it's interesting in the -- in the statute


we're talking about there is a -- in section 5, it talks


about repeated, constant violations and other good cause. 


When you get to 6, it only talks about shall be a cause


for eviction.  Good cause is the thing the eviction court


should have a right to deal with, and there's nothing that


said the State law was being preempted. 


I'm suggesting that if -- if what HUD wants is


to have voluntary cleanup by good people like Ms. Rucker


and Ms. Hill, Ms. Lee, they should encourage them to say,


give us help to make sure that we can live with that

for a grandmother to be told the only way you can assure


yourself is make sure nobody else lives here, it's the


only way that -- that these people can assure themselves


that they aren't going to get thrown out --


QUESTION:  Well, you're hypothesizing an


exercise of discretion by HUD that's just not in the

MR. RENNE:  All right.  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Renne.


Mr. Feldman, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS


MR. FELDMAN:  Thank you. 


I'd first like to add that the -- the people --


the people who had committed the drug offenses in this


case were between ages 20 and 44 years old.  They weren't


teenagers. 


The question of -- as to the relationship of --


of Federal law and the -- the Federal law that waives --


that permits HUD to waive the grievance procedure in the


housing authority and say you can just go to the eviction


court -- and that law does provide that HUD has to -- it

can only permit that if it can ensure -- assure that the


eviction court gives you full due process rights to


litigate whatever issues there are.  And in that sense,


Federal law does guarantee you the right to have all of


your defenses litigated in the eviction proceeding if HUD


is going to grant such a waiver, which it's done in 47


States.


QUESTION:  And the eviction proceeding is in the


State court? 


MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, but what Federal law doesn't


do is say that there's any particular defenses.  As the


question of what the defenses are that you have to have


the full right to litigate, that's a question of -- of


substantive Federal law. 


Now, in this case, the statute makes clear I


think that serious -- that drug-related criminal activity


is cause for termination of tenancy, and HUD has construed


it to mean that. 


Now, the question then about -- the only


possible source for a defense would be State law, and the


question about for State law defense would be does that


conflict with either the Federal statute or the purposes


Congress was trying to achieve.  It wouldn't be possible


for a State court to disagree with the balance that


Congress struck when it -- when it passed the statute.

So, the only question would be, therefore, if you have any


State law defenses, they would have to be ones that don't


conflict with the judgment that Congress made that


eviction under 1437d(l)(6) is for serious -- it's for drug


-- drug-related criminal activity by a household member.


I'd like to add just one other point which is in


42 U.S.C., section 1437, which is kind of the statement of


policy right at the beginning of the United States Housing


Act, it says, it is the policy of the United States -- and


it names a bunch of things, which I'm not going to read. 


And it says, to vest in local public housing agencies the


maximum amount of responsibility in the administration of


their housing programs.  It was those local public housing


agencies that know what the conditions are, and that -- it


is consistent with that that HUD has construed the statute


and Congress in fact enacted the statute to give them the


discretion with this clause, as with enforcement of rent


clauses or any other clause, to decide when they should be


enforced and when they should be enforced.  That's not a


role for the eviction court. 


Thank you.
