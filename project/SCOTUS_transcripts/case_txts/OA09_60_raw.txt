CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-60, 

Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder. 

Mr. Srinivasan. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Long-time lawful permanent resident aliens 

with two convictions for minor drug possession offenses 

are subject to removal from the United States, but they 

are not categorically ineligible to seek discretionary 

relief from removal from the Attorney General based on 

their connections and deep family ties to the country. 

Categorical ineligibility for discretionary relief 

arises under the Immigration and Nationality Act when a 

permanent resident has been, quote, "convicted of an 

aggravated felony," close quote, with the relevant 

category here permanent residents who have been, quote, 

"convicted of a felony punishable under the Controlled 

Substances Act," close quote. 

Individuals, such as Petitioner, who have 

been convicted of drug possession, but as to whom there 

3

has been no finding of recidivism, have been convicted 

of a misdemeanor punishable under the Controlled 

Substances Act rather than a felony. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Srinivasan, as a 

threshold question, is there a mootness problem here, 

because, as I understand it, the Petitioner came back to 

the country illegally and committed another minor crime? 

But his coming back illegally and being turned away 

again, as I understand the law, means that he cannot get 

any dispensation as a result of the illegal entry. 

So even if we were to hold in your favor 

now, I take it that he could not -- he would not have 

any hope of getting any cancellation of removal or any 

other dispensation.  Is that so? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's not correct, 

Justice Ginsburg, in our view.  And the government, it's 

notable, doesn't make a mootness argument.  And I think the 

reason they don't is that the -- in Lopez, this Court 

understood that the initial removal doesn't annul the 

ability of an individual to get cancellation.  And so, 

as Your Honor correctly observes, the question would be 

whether the reentry has an effect on the cancellation 

and the eligibility for cancellation.  And it does not 

because Petitioner was removed again by reinstatement of 

the original removal order.  And so, if there’s an

argument that the initial removal order wasn't good 

because cancellation should have been granted, that also 

carries through to the reinstatement. 

And as a consequence of that procedural 

context, there is no mootness argument and I think 

that's why the government doesn't make -- doesn't take 

that position. 

So the question before the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I -- I'm not sure I 

understand what you’re saying.  You’re saying that his 

reentry was not illegal because his removal was illegal? 

Is that what you are saying? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, it's not that his 

reentry wasn’t illegal.  It's that when he was then 

again removed, that the -- the way that that was 

accomplished was by reinstatement of the original 

removal order. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  And so, if the original 

removal order would have been extinguished by a grant of 

the cancellation order, then that carries forward to the 

reinstatement of the original removal -- removal order 

as well. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but does --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Nothing additional happens

because of the reentry. 

Official 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But does it make the --

the second unlawful entry now lawful? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It doesn't make the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought -- I thought 

it's a separate offense to enter, to reenter improperly, 

and -- and that stays no matter, isn't that correct, 

regardless of the correctness of the prior removal 

order? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It does, Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or am I wrong? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- but I think -- I think 

the way that gets taken into account is it would be one 

of the discretionary considerations that the Attorney 

General could take into account in determining whether 

to grant discretionary relief in the same way that the 

original conviction for drug possession could be taken 

into account.  Our position --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I -- I think also in 

the picture is that he never contested removability. 

The only thing was the grace:  Would -- would he qualify 

for discretionary relief by the Attorney General?  So 

the -- the removal order itself, I take it, would stand. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  The removal order would 

stand, but if cancellation were granted, then he

couldn't be removed pursuant to that removal order, 

because the -- the effect of granting cancellation would 

be that he’s no longer removable.  He gets favorable 

discretionary relief that enables him to stay in the 

country.  And I think the predicate of Your Honor's 

question is correct, that we don't contest removability. 

He was removable because of his drug possession -- drug 

possession conviction. 

The question is whether he retains 

eligibility to seek a favorable exercise of relief from 

the Attorney General based on affirmative equities in 

his -- in his favor, such as his deep family ties to the 

country, the presence of United States citizen children 

here, his lack of connections to the country to which he 

would be removed, his employment history, and 

considerations of that variety. 

And the question before the Court is whether 

he and other individuals who are similarly situated 

should have an opportunity to make that case to the 

Attorney General.  He is removable.  The question is 

whether the Attorney General is in a -- is in a position 

to grant him a favorable exercise of discretion. 

And we think the Attorney General is, 

because in order to be categorically ineligible for 

discretionary relief from removal, a permanent resident

alien has to have been convicted of a felony punishable 

under the Controlled Substances Act.  And when you’ve 

been convicted of drug possession and there has been no 

finding of recidivism, you have been convicted of a 

misdemeanor punishable under the Controlled Substances 

Act. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What elements would a 

State conviction have to contain to qualify as a finding 

of recidivism in your view? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  What elements? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.  What would have 

had to have been determined in a State conviction for 

you to recognize, under your argument, that it would 

qualify as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Sotomayor, at the 

very least what would have had to have happened is that 

he would have had to have been found to be a recidivist 

under a State provision that attaches sentencing 

consequences to being found to have been a recidivist. 

And so, what you need is an analogous State 

offense to the Federal offense of recidivist possession. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you know of any State 

law that is analogous to the Federal law, precisely 

analogous? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, analogous enough to

count, in the sense that what you need under the Federal 

law is a finding of recidivism at least.  That's our 

principal submission. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what I'm trying 

to -- to get to.  What are the elements of that finding? 

What exactly -- because different labels are attached to 

different crimes that qualify you for recidivism under 

some State statutes, et cetera.  I'm trying to get you 

to articulate what finding of recidivism counts, what 

are the underlying --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It's a determination by the 

court that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which court now, the 

State court? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  By the State convicting 

court.  In the case of a State conviction, it would be a 

determination by the State convicting court that the 

person in fact has a prior conviction.  And then as a 

consequence under the State scheme, a sentencing 

consequence would attach. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So are you arguing that 

a State court has to make a finding of a valid prior 

conviction; is that it? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes, in -- in the context 

of a State conviction.  It --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it doesn't have to be a

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It doesn't have to be a 

State felony, no. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The felony has to be a 

Federal felony, right? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's correct.  And that's 

the work done by the words "punishable under the 

Controlled Substances Act." 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Punishable as a felony 

under the Federal Act. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But this was punishable as 

a felony because it was his second drug offense.  He was 

a recidivist.  And although it was only a misdemeanor 

under State law, under the Controlled Substances Act he 

could be prosecuted for a felony, for a Federal felony. 

I -- I -- I don't know why that doesn't fit the statute. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  But -- but, Justice Scalia, 

he has to have been convicted of the felony.  That’s 

the critical distinction.  He may have committed a 

felony --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He can't be convicted of a 

Federal felony in a State court.  He has to be convicted 

of a crime --

10

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  He has to have been 

convicted of a crime --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- which may be a misdemeanor, 

which would subject him to a felony conviction in 

Federal court under the Controlled Substances Act.  And 

I think that's - that's what this is.  He's convicted of 

a drug offense, and if - if he were prosecuted in Federal 

court, he would -- he was punishable as a felon --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  He was --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- in Federal court under 

the -- under the Controlled Substances Act. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  He was not punishable as a 

felon in Federal court for two reasons:  First, he was 

convicted of drug possession.  A person in Federal court 

who is convicted of drug possession is a misdemeanant, 

not a felon, unless and until there’s a finding that 

he's a recidivist.  You have to have the finding of 

recidivist in order for a felony sentence even to 

conceivably attach to an individual, and you just don't 

have that in the context of this case, where all you 

have is a conviction of drug possession alone.  A felony 

sentence doesn't even come into the picture unless there’s 

a finding of recidivism.

Official 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn’t the crux of your argument 

that for present purposes the term "conviction" must 

include a determination of recidivism? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  For present purposes, 

that's correct.  And Justice Alito, I think it's 

important to understand -- and this goes to the second 

response to your question, Justice Scalia -- that the 

statute, the Immigration and Nationality Act, defines 

"conviction" in a particular way.  It defines 

"conviction" as "a formal judgment of guilt … entered by 

a court." 

As Your Honor's opinion for the Court in 

Deal v. United States understood, statutes could define 

convictions in one of two ways:  It could define a 

conviction as a finding of guilty, or it could define a 

conviction as the formal judgment based on that finding. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what would you say --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Here we have the latter. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you say about 

21 U.S.C. section 851, the Federal recidivism provision, 

which says:  "No person who stands convicted of an offense 

under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment 

by reason of one or more prior convictions." 

So under that statute, the conviction does not

include the recidivism determination. 

Official 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Under --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn’t that right? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Under that statute --

different statutes conceive of it different ways, but 

the applicable definition of "conviction" here, because 

we’re talking about an immigration consequence, is 

the definition of "conviction" under the Immigration and 

Nationality Act.  And that definition is set forth at 

page 2a of the appendix to our brief, the blue brief, 

the opening brief.  And it's 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(48)(A), 

and it says that:  "The term 'conviction' means, with 

respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the 

alien entered by a court." 

And so, here you have "a formal judgment of 

guilt" as the operative definition of a conviction, and 

that formal judgment of guilt includes both the 

adjudication of guilt and the sentence.  And so the 

important point to bear in mind is that at the time that 

the conviction, as defined by the Immigration and 

Nationality Act, is entered, we know whether the person 

has been found to have been a recidivist.  At that point, 

the adjudication of guilt has happened, the sentence has 

been imposed, and we know whether a finding of recidivism 

has been made.  In the absence of such a finding, the

maximum sentence they could attach under Federal law, 

Justice Scalia, is a misdemeanor sentence of 1 year of 

imprisonment. 

A felony sentence is not on the table, and 

if the maximum sentence to which a person is subject is 

a misdemeanor sentence, the person has been -- has been 

convicted of a misdemeanor; they haven't been convicted 

of a felony.  And that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's assume we’re not 

talking about immigration consequences.  Let's -- let's 

assume we’re talking about an American citizen who has 

committed a -- a misdemeanor drug offense.  When he is 

brought up under the Controlled Substances Act, even 

though he wasn't found to have been a recidivist by the 

State conviction, couldn't he be prosecuted under the 

Controlled Substances Act for a felony because in fact 

he is a recidivist? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Oh, sure.  But -- but I 

think -- I think that confuses two things.  In that 

situation, the second proceeding is in Federal court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- and in that Federal court 

proceeding, you can take account of the prior State court 

conviction, but in that second proceeding, the fact that 

he was convicted previously in State court would have to

have been found by the Federal court.  That's the relevant 

finding of recidivism, and in the absence of that finding of 

recidivism, the Federal defendant wouldn't be subject to 

a felony sentence.  He would only be subject to a 

misdemeanor sentence. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but -- the crucial word 

here is "punishable" as a felony under the Controlled 

Substances Act.  And the fact is if indeed he’s a 

recidivist, he could be punished for the -- for the 

felony.  Now, you’re quite correct that the Federal 

court would have to find the recidivism, but -- but 

still he would be punishable as a recidivist. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  He has to be convicted of a 

felony, Justice Scalia, and in the absence of a finding 

of recidivism, he can't have been convicted of the 

felony.  He may be punishable as a felon in the abstract 

ex ante.  So I don't take issue with the proposition 

that a person commits recidivist possession when they 

commit possession and they have a prior conviction.  In 

that abstract sense, the person has committed recidivist 

possession, and if they were charged and found to have 

been a recidivist, they would be convicted of recidivist 

possession.  But in the absence of that finding, they 

haven't been convicted of recidivist possession, and --

State law, what’s required before the recidivist 

sentence is triggered?  Is it a formal finding of 

recidivism by the -- by a jury? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It doesn't have to be by a 

jury, and I think it would depend on the State, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  It doesn't necessarily have to be by 

a jury, because I think several States have the 

recidivism component of the offense as a finding that 

could be made by the court, but the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And we've held that’s 

okay --

isn't it, that have no recidivist provisions? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  There are --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the thrust of your 

argument or the logical consequence of your argument, if 

you have one of those States with no recidivist 

provisions and you have ten separate possession 

convictions, they're still not a recidivist under the 

Federal rules?

Justice Kennedy, but I don't think that should give the 

Court a great deal of pause, for the following two 

reasons. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  In my 

hypothetical, what would happen if -- if there was a 

deportation proceeding? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  What would happen is this: 

The person would not be categorically ineligible for 

discretionary relief. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because there is no 

recidivist finding. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  They wouldn't have been 

convicted of recidivist possession.  But it's important 

to note, Justice Kennedy, that doesn't mean that those 

prior convictions don't enter into the picture at all. 

They do, because, in the exercise of discretion by the 

Attorney General, the Attorney General can take into 

account any prior convictions, including those that 

don't render somebody categorically ineligible. 

All we’re talking about here is whether the 

person has a chance to make a discretionary case.  They 

do have that chance in Your Honor's hypothetical, but 

those convictions would be taken into account. 

Now, I want to point out, though, that there’s 

another reason that I think the fact that in that

hypothetical it wouldn't render the defendant 

categorically ineligible for discretionary relief 

shouldn't give the Court a great deal of pause.  And 

that's because the relevant category of aggravated 

felony that we're talking about here is illicit 

trafficking in a controlled substance.  That's the 

category that's outlined by the statute. 

Now, with respect to that category, every 

State has trafficking laws.  Every State punishes drug 

trafficking.  So every State's offenses do count for 

purposes of this category of aggravated felony.  When 

we’re -- that's the iceberg.  The tip of the iceberg is 

recidivist possession, which is a subset of illicit 

trafficking in a controlled substance.  Now, with respect 

to that tip, Federal convictions for recidivist possession 

still do count, so we have those.  With respect to the State --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but the State 

prosecutors often prosecute when they have a recidivist 

provision under that, rather than the much more difficult 

illicit trafficking crime.  I mean, if you’re going to 

go to jail for a certain amount of years for a 

recidivist possession, that's easier to show than illicit 

trafficking. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, sure, but if a 

State -- two responses, Mr. Chief Justice:  If a State

prosecutor does prosecute under an available recidivist 

possession offense, then that would count because the 

State prosecutor would have brought the charge, the 

finding by hypothesis would have been made.  That would 

be felony recidivist possession under Federal law, and 

there would be categorical ineligibility. 

Now, I think what may be -- what may be sort 

of lurking beneath Your Honor's question is the 

recognition that the Federal consequences of a State 

conviction are going to turn on State prosecutorial 

decisions.  That's true.  But that's a fixed feature of 

any scheme in which Federal immigration consequences 

turns on what happens in State court, and this Court's 

decision in Lopez recognizes that. 

For example, States -- several States don't 

have a Federal offense of possession with intent to 

distribute drugs.  That's a Federal offense.  What 

States, some States, have instead is possession with a 

degree of penalty attached to the amount of drugs 

possessed.  They don't have the separate offense of 

possession with intent to distribute. 

Now, the fact that certain States don't have 

that offense doesn't mean that an individual who is 

convicted of state possession with no finding of an 

intent to distribute would be categorically ineligible

for discretionary relief from removal, because what 

Congress understood was that some States will have 

qualifying offenses and some States won't.  In those 

States that do, where the State has the offense and 

where the State prosecutor makes the decision to charge 

under that offense will -- at that point the State 

conviction will count as a Federal felony.  It will be a 

felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, 

and the person at that point would be categorically 

ineligible for discretionary relief. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know.  It seems to 

me you go further than you need to and, moreover, 

imagine a State offense that just says possession of 

marijuana, zero to 5 years.  Now, our problem is, 

reading those words, is that or is that not analogous to 

a Federal -- a Federal -- what a Federal law would make 

a felony?  And suppose you discovered as a matter of 

fact that all the people who did have a prior conviction 

got more than a year.  In simple possession, they got 

less than a year, which you’d have to do research to 

find out. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if those were the 

facts, I would say it is analogous to the Federal 

felony where this person was sentenced to more than a

that there’s a line, because it seems to me the rule is

what's the case?  You know --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Lopez? 


JUSTICE BREYER:  What? 


MR. SRINIVASAN:  Is it Lopez?  Is that --


JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, Lopez.  It says:  "A 


state offense constitutes a ‘felony punishable under the 

Controlled Substances Act’ only if it proscribes 

conduct."  So we’re not looking at what happened in 

reality.  We’re reading some words from a State 

statute. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what proscribes 

conduct punishable as a felony under that Federal law. 

This would be normal.  We get some words in the State 

statute, and you have to decide are the -- those 

words cover some events in the world.  And you look at

those words, what -- the events they cover and discover, 

did they or are they analogous or not analogous to what 

is a felony under Federal law?  Sometimes that's easy, 

sometimes it's not. 

You have a case, I think, that's easy.  But 

I can imagine the case you’re talking about, not easy. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So you say, what do you do? 

I see no rule there.  I see no rule absolute how you treat 

it, so I probably would treat it by trying to look at what 

really happens under this statute in the world. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well -- well, with respect, 

Justice Breyer, I don't think that's the inquiry that's 

called for even by this sentence.  I think what this 

sentence called for is an inquiry into what the State 

offense captures in its offense elements to make up a 

conviction. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why -- where does it say 

"offense element"? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Because I think that's

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It asks whether -- the 

sentence asks whether the State offense proscribes 

conduct. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  And I read "proscribes 

conduct" to mean there would be offense elements 

of proscribed conduct. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you say that it says 

"elements."  I don't see any of our cases that say 

"elements."  And I -- and I think that -- that what we 

could do is look to the conduct that's likely to be at 

issue under these State words, and if in fact it's 

regular that the State does punish people for more than 

a year when in fact they do possess for the third time, 

at least there would be a good argument --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes, I don't want to take

certainly, but I would just make the following point: 

That if I’m understanding what Your Honor is saying 

correctly, and I'm not sure that I am, but if I’m 

understanding what you're saying correctly, I would just 

point out to the Court that the Court dealt with that 

sort of situation in the four corners of Lopez itself 

when it talked about -- talks about what happens with 

possession with intent to distribute. 

Some States don't have possession with 

intent to distribute as an offense; they only have 

possession.  Now, I -- as I understand what Your Honor 

is suggesting, you could look at all the -- the ken of 

individuals who have been convicted of State possession 

and you could ask as a matter of fact, do they in fact 

possess with intent to distribute?  And then you could 

reach some consequence on that basis. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I know, but the reason I 

ask my question is it seems to me your approach, which I 

think is consistent with Lopez and Nijhawan 

absolutely --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Okay.

because I don't think -- if I'm right, your case doesn't

JUSTICE ALITO:  If -- suppose a State makes simple 

possession a felony.  Now, that doesn't make it a felony 

for these purposes, right? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  But in 

sentencing the -- the defendant in State court for this 

felony, the -- the defendant concedes that he had a 

prior conviction, and the judge finds that and takes that 

into account in imposing the sentence.  What would 

happen there?

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It wouldn't constitute the 

analogy to the Federal offense of recidivist possession, 

Justice -- Justice Alito, because that could also happen 

in the Federal system.  In the Federal system, you could 

have an individual who is convicted of possession, and 

then the fact that they had a prior conviction could 

have some role in the -- for example, in the 

presentencing report. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what's missing there? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  You don't have --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the difference 

between that and -- and a situation where, just because 

of the vagary of State law, recidivism is something that 

has to be proven in order to bring the offense into the 

-- into the felony level? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Two things are 

missing, Justice Alito:  First, you don't have a formal 

judgment of guilt entered by the court, which is what 

a conviction requires.  And the consequence of not 

having a formal judgment of guilt is that the statutory 

maximum penalty isn't raised.  And I think what’s 

relevant here is that when you have a finding of -- a 

formal judgment of guilt of recidivism in the Federal 

system, which happens when the prosecutor brings a 

charge and the court makes the finding at sentencing,

the maximum sentence that could be imposed against the 

defendant is raised from a misdemeanor sentence to a 

felony sentence. 

But that doesn't happen in a situation in 

which the fact of a prior conviction is taken into 

account, for example, under a presentencing report.  It 

doesn't raise the statutory maximum, and there’s no 

formal judgment entered based on that determination by 

the court.  And so that's the distinction. 

And I think the relevant way to look at it 

is you take account of what would happen in the Federal 

system and you ask:  Would it have the consequence in 

the Federal system of rendering somebody guilty of the 

felony of recidivist possession as opposed to the 

misdemeanor of simple possession?  And it wouldn't in 

the Federal system, and by parity of reasoning it also 

would not have that consequence in the State system. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  That seems to be a totally 

formalistic distinction that's based on the vagaries of 

State law.  What -- what is the difference between 

someone who is found by a court under a State recidivism 

provision to have -- to be eligible for an increased 

punishment as a result of that finding and someone who 

is found by a court in the context of sentencing, 

discretionary sentencing, to have a felony possession,

to have a prior -- a prior conviction and receives an 

increased sentence as a result of that? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the -- is there any 

functional difference between those two situations? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think there is, 

Justice Alito, and let me just say as a preliminary 

matter it's not based on the vagaries of State law, 

because it's -- I'm applying the same analysis to State 

convictions as I do to -- to Federal convictions. 

But one way to look at it is to ask, suppose 

that a State or even Federal law made it salient for 

sentencing purposes whether somebody intended to 

distribute when they possessed.  They were convicted of 

drug possession.  There is an offense of possession with 

intent to distribute, but they’re not charged with that 

offense; they’re charged with drug possession.  And 

then sentencing somehow makes it salient, not for 

purposes of raising the statutory maximum, but just for 

purposes of sentencing within the range whether the 

person intended to distribute. 

I don't think anybody would say that the 

individual was convicted of the felony of possession 

with intent to distribute because the -- the judge in 

sentencing took into account an intent to distribute

in some way under a sentencing scheme. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But does it matter in that 

situation that that's an element, that has to be an 

element of the offense? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It has to be a sentencing 

factor that raises the statutory maximum.  And the 

reason that matters is that under this statute, the 

person has to have been convicted of a felony, and the 

only way they’re convicted of a felony is the offense 

of which they are convicted can lead to a felony 

sentence. 

And the sentencing factor in this case of 

recidivism is necessary in order to give rise to a 

Federal sentence.  In the absence of that finding, the 

person has been convicted of a misdemeanor, because the 

maximum sentence they can receive is a misdemeanor 

sentence of 1 year of imprisonment. 

If the Court has no further questions, I’d 

like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

please the Court: 

Official 

Congress's judgment here was that all aliens 

who engage in the same serious conduct would be treated 

the same for immigration purposes.  And Petitioner 

doesn't dispute that he has two convictions for drug 

possession, and he also doesn't dispute that had that 

second case been prosecuted in Federal court, he could 

have been punished as a felon.  What he is saying is:  I 

don't want my aggravated felony to count because of a 

difference in State law, because of a difference in the 

State prosecutor's decision. 

But what this Court held in Lopez is that 

Congress's judgment controls about the seriousness of 

the offense. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The exact words of 

Lopez, which I think are important:  "We hold that a 

State offense constitutes a felony punishable under 

Controlled Substance … only if it proscribes conduct 

punishable as a felony."  Okay? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Under Federal law.  Now, 

there’s an ambiguity when you use a word like "offense" 

or "crime."  Sometimes you mean what this guy did, and 

sometimes you're referring to a statute.  It's statutes 

that proscribe, not what this guy did.  So we’re

talking about the statute.  So what it tells us to do --

and we said the same thing in Nijhawan, and I have 

written in other opinions the same thing -- you go read 

the State statute.  Forget what he's done.  Read the 

statute and see if the statute proscribes conduct that 

would amount to a felony under Federal law. 

So let us read the statute.  We turn to the 

statute of conviction.  What it says is it is a class A 

misdemeanor for which you are punishable of less than a 

year if you possess less than 28 grams or whatever.  It 

says nothing about recidivism.  There is no increased 

punishment for recidivism. 

So all we did was read the statute.  The 

statute does not proscribe conduct that would be a 

felony under Federal law; it proscribes conduct that 

would be a misdemeanor.  QED.  This person has not been 

punished in Texas under a statute that proscribes 

conduct that would be a felony under Federal law.  End

are two questions.  The first is:  Does the State 

offense correspond to an offense under the CSA?  Does it 

correspond to a Federal offense, and that’s based on 

the elements, and the Court said that that was based on 

the elements on page 51 of Nijhawan --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Okay. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  But there’s a second 

question, which is:  If it corresponds to a Federal 

offense, how would that Federal offense be punishable? 

The "punishable" under the CSA language determines that 

we need to look at that second inquiry. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No --

MS. SAHARSKY:  If in addition to that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where does it say 

that?  Where does it say that in the language? 

You are looking to the conduct that the 

statute proscribes, not what he engaged in.  Suppose the 

State statute says it is a misdemeanor to steal a 

chicken, okay? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It is a misdemeanor.  He is 

convicted of stealing a chicken.  It turns out that the 

way he stole the chicken was to burn down the farmhouse.

JUSTICE BREYER:  It is called -- it is 

written right here in this case.  It is written in 

Nijhawan.  What is it that tells us to go beyond the 

conduct that the State statute proscribes, not some 

other thing? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  The conduct is what the State 

statute proscribes, but there’s an additional question 

of how it is punishable --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where is the additional 

question?  Read me the words of the statute that --

there might be.  I'm not -- I'm being argumentative, but 

I want to know what words in the statute say there -- or 

what words in a case say go look to some other thing 

beyond what the State statute proscribes? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Okay.  This is on the gray 

brief, page 10a, and this is the definition that is 

incorporated into the aggravated felony definition in 

the INA, and it says that it encompasses, quote, "any 

felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act." 

And in Lopez the Court interpreted that language to mean

an offense that is punishable as a felony under the 

Controlled Substances Act. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  What offense?  The 

offense proscribed --

MS. SAHARSKY:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- by State law.  That's 

why I asked you:  Where does the State statute proscribe 

something that has to do with recidivism?  I’ve read 

that State statute three or four times. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Recidivism isn't part of the 

offense.  It is a sentencing factor.  Justice Scalia 

mentioned that.  That's something this Court has 

recognized on many occasions, that recidivism is 

something that can be established by the sentencing 

court. 

You are right:  The offense is drug 

possession.  He was convicted of drug possession in 

State court.  That's what he would have been convicted 

of in Federal court.  But the fact that he was convicted 

of drug possession doesn't answer the separate question 

of how that offense is punishable.  If it were his first 

offense, it would be punishable as a misdemeanor.  If it 

was his second offense, it would be punishable as a 

felony. 

And we think that that -- that approach is

dictated by two different opinions, the first of which 

is Lopez, which says we look for a correspondence 

between the State offense and the Federal offense, but 

then we also have this question of how the offense is 

punishable in Federal court, and this punishability 

question is extremely relevant.  The entire basis for 

the Court's -- the entire basis for the Court's opinion 

was that Congress's judgment about the seriousness of 

the offense controls.  It is not State by State 

judgment. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Saharsky, do we take 

into account at all -- I mean, in Lopez as I understand 

it, the petitioner prevailed because it would not have 

been a felony under the Federal law.  Is that right? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Here we’re talking about 

two crimes.  One is a small amount of marijuana.  He 

gets 20 days in jail.  The other is a pill that I never 

heard of, a Xan-something, and then he gets, what, 10 days 

in jail for that.  If you could just present this scenario 

to an intelligent person who didn't go to law school, 

as you're going to not only remove him from this 

country, but say never, ever darken our doors again

of reading the statute that would not lead to that 

absurd result, you would want to read the statute. 

If you are forced to read it because there’s 

no other way -- but maybe there is another way. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  We don't think that there is 

another way, because the Court said in Lopez in 

interpreting the statutory language that the State's 

judgment about how an offense is punished does not 

control.  What controls is Congress's judgment, and 

Congress has taken a hard line over the past 20 years on 

criminal aliens, particularly recidivist criminal 

aliens --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it has --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me what --

MS. SAHARSKY:  -- particularly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What would happen if 

there -- forget the State.  There are two Federal offenses. 

The first Federal offense is drug possession; the second 

Federal offense, drug possession, but the prosecutor is 

not quite sure that he has a strong case or she has a strong 

case for recidivism because of the first conviction. 

So the -- on the second go-around, the 

conviction is without the added finding of recidivism. 

What does the INA do with that case?

aggravated felony, as punishable as a felony, because 

the aggravated felony language incorporates the word 

"punishable," how it could be treated under Federal law, 

not how it actually was punished.  And that's because 

Congress made a -- a judgment in the immigration code 

that what it wanted to do was to take all individuals 

who had been engaged in the same conduct --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you’re telling us --

MS. SAHARSKY:  -- repeated drug possession, 

and treat them the same.

been convicted in Federal court of recidivism -- now

INA for what is not a felony under Federal law?

yes, because it's punishable as a felony under Federal 

law, because Congress made a judgment that those two 

drug possession offenses, the fact of recidivism makes 

it serious enough that it could be--

that we’re discussing, the -- the two Federal offenses 

but no finding of recidivism, does the INA have the 

authority to question the first conviction because it 

was uncounseled or in effect collaterally question the 

first conviction? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  It -- it's well established 

that those kind of challenges can't be brought in 

immigration court.  What needs to happen is they need to 

be brought in the State court of conviction through the 

procedures that are --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, what -- our

individual would need to seek relief in Federal court in 

terms of getting his conviction --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought if it’s in 

the Federal court, and the -- they are going 

to use it as a recidivist offense, (a) the defendant is 

notified of that, and (b) is given an opportunity to say 

there’s something infirm about that first conviction. 

That's totally absent from this picture. 

You say, oh, well, that's just a matter 

of procedure, so he doesn't have to get that anyplace.

I think that Congress is requiring that.  It's certainly 

an element of fundamental due process fairness, notice 

and opportunity to say, no, the first conviction 

shouldn't count. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  With respect, we disagree 

because Congress made different judgments in the 

immigration context and in the criminal context. 

Immigration is very different from criminal proceedings. 

This Court has said that on numerous occasions the 

rights in terms of due process and counsel and the like 

are very different. 

And in immigration, Congress made a 

categorical judgment that individuals who have been 

convicted of conduct should all be treated the same and 

that they all should be removed from the United States 

and should be -- not be able to get discretionary 

relief.  In the criminal sentencing context, which you 

are talking about, section -- the section 851 procedures, 

Congress made a judgment that those procedures which have 

criminal consequences and already are individualized, that 

there would be this notice provision.  But that provision 

Congress did not apply anywhere in the immigration laws. 

And if you look --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You go ahead.

you look all through the aggravated felony provisions --

they are in our brief; there are 21 of them -- for none 

of those provisions was Congress concerned about notice 

or the like.  It said the individual has engaged in 

this conduct that we think is serious. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But my point is that if 

it all happened in the Federal court, if these two 

possession offenses all happened in the Federal court, 

at the time of the second one the -- the defendant would 

have gotten the notice and the opportunity to knock it 

out. 

I'm not talking about immigration, but 

just -- and he doesn't have that opportunity the way you 

treat it.  He doesn't -- didn't get that in the State 

court because nobody thought that this was a recidivist 

offense in the State court. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  That's right.  And that's 

because Congress made the decision to have those types 

of notice procedures in criminal proceedings, but they 

are not applicable by their terms anywhere in the 

immigration laws.  And just to make sure that I 

understand the hypotheticals that you and Justice 

Kennedy have been talking about, if there is a Federal 

prosecution and the person has sought to challenge the 

validity of his conviction and it has been proven to be 

40 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

invalid, then in that case, yes, there would be a 

question whether that conviction could be used in the 

immigration proceedings.  There is an entire body of law 

that when a conviction has been vacated, it doesn't 

count as a conviction under the immigration proceedings. 

So the answer is if it is a person in State 

court and they think that there’s a problem with their 

underlying conviction, they need to go to State court or 

use whatever procedures are available for challenging 

that.  But, again, the Court has said on numerous occasions 

prior convictions are presumed valid.  We do not -- we 

do not assume --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we know practically, 

both on the State side and on the Federal side, do 

prosecutors presented with a simple possession case, 

do they -- do we ever see in real life this combination 

that somebody's going to be convicted as a recidivist 

when it's one marijuana cigarette on one time and one pill 

on another? Do prosecutors, Federal or State, do that? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  I -- I can't speak to State 

prosecutors.  I know there are circumstances in which 

Federal prosecutors do it, although, quite honestly, 

most of the Federal drug prosecutions regard the more 

serious drug crimes.  The persons that come to our 

attention usually can be charged with at least

possession with intent to distribute or drug trafficking 

or something like that.  And when we do charge them with 

possession, it's usually because they pleaded down and 

we’ve agreed not to give them an enhanced sentence. 

But the judgment here is the one that 

Congress made about whether two drug possessions is 

serious, serious enough to qualify as a felony.  And 

Congress --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I ask you a related 

question, which will show what I'm trying -- another 

thing that’s worrying me.  Suppose we’re in the Armed 

Career Criminal Act. 

Now, I have -- this is my hypothetical.  You’ve 

heard of cat burglars.  Well, this gentleman is 

called the pussycat burglar, and the reason is he’s never 

harmed a soul.  He only carries soft pillows as weapons. 

If he sees a child, he gives them ice cream. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It is absolutely 

established that this person in breaking into that house 

at night only wanted to steal a pop gun, and he is the 

least likely to cause harm in the world. 

Question:  He is convicted of burglary.  Is 

that a crime of violence?  Answer?

burglary definition depends on the Court's modified 

categorical approach, you just look to see what he 

had been convicted of and not the individual --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Correct. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  -- circumstances of the case. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The answer is of course, 

because we are not looking to whether he is the pussycat 

burglar or the cat burglar.  We are to look to the 

statute of conviction and see what it is that that 

behavior forbids -- the statute forbids.  Lewis, 

Nijhawan say -- do precisely the same thing with this part 

of that long list.  Indeed, Nijhawan lists this 

provision as an example of what you would do the same 

thing for. 

Now I'm back to my first question.  Let's do 

it.  Read the Texas statute.  And where in that Texas 

statute does it say a word about recidivism or punish 

that conduct? 

Now, if I adopt your position, am I not, 

not simply overturning Lewis and Nijhawan, but getting a 

very mixed up area of the law which we have tried to 

straighten out -- Taylor, ACCA -- once again totally 

mixed up.  That's my concern. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  With respect, I think that 

our position is entirely consistent and, in fact,

follows from Lopez and Nijhawan and is consistent with 

the Court's modified categorical approach. 

So, let me just talk about Lopez and 

Nijhawan, because I want to make sure there's not any 

confusion about that.  Lopez said that we have a 

question here about whether the State offense -- and a 

State offense is made up of here drug possession; 

recidivism isn't something that you’re convicted of, 

it's a sentencing factor. 

You look at the State offense and you see 

does it correspond to a Federal offense?  Here it does. 

There is State drug possession; there is Federal drug 

possession.  And then you ask another question.  And 

this Court said in Lopez that that's an important 

question because we care about what Congress thought, 

which is how is this offense punishable under Federal 

law. 

This is a two-part inquiry where the first 

part, the offense elements, does need to be established 

in State court, and the second part, which goes to how 

it is punishable, does not need to be established in 

State court.  And that's exactly what the Court 

recognized in its opinion under Nijhawan --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under the Federal --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under the Federal statute, 

it's only punishable on -- for recidivism purposes if the 

prior conviction was valid, because, as Justice Ginsburg 

pointed out, the statute permits a defendant to object. 

Who has the burden of proof of proving validity is irrelevant. 

It's not punishable as recidivism unless the prior conviction 

was valid, constitutionally valid. 

So why isn't that same standard or proof 

thereof required either in the State conviction under 

your -- under any theory, or by the IJ?  The IJ fails to 

make that finding, how has he and on what basis has he 

ruled that there was a valid prior conviction? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  What makes an offense 

punishable as a felony under the Federal Controlled 

Substances Act is contained in section 844, which 

defines the substantive punishments available.  It says 

that drug possession is punishable as a felony in 

certain circumstances.  And this Court in Lopez, 

particularly in footnote 6, recognized that repeat drug 

possession qualifies as punishable as a felony and under 

the CSA and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But only under a process 

that requires notice --

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, this is what is 

interesting.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- And --

MS. SAHARSKY:  I'm sorry.  What's 

interesting is the Court cited for this provision 

section 844(a), which defines the substantive penalties 

available.  It didn't cite -- no one thought was 

relevant section 851, which defines procedures that 

happen after a conviction to impose a certain 

punishment. 

So, what we’re talking about are these 

procedures that are necessary.  And it's not a finding 

of a valid conviction.  It's -- it's a long set of 

procedures.  There doesn't necessarily need to be a 

finding of a valid conviction if the defendant doesn't 

object at all.  There's burden shifting.  It's very 

complicated.  Congress did not apply it to the 

immigration code by its terms.  It's not applicable to 

the States by its terms. 

What the Court said in Lopez in saying, in 

footnote 6, that recidivist possession counts as 

punishable under the CSA, it pointed to section 844, 

which defines the penalties available and not anything 

about procedures.  And even conviction --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, you would 

suggest, then, that even if a prior State court 

conviction was secured without the advice of counsel,

that would qualify as a Federal offense of recidivism. 

So let's assume this case, that in neither the 

conviction for the one marijuana stick or the conviction 

for the one sleeping pill, that if those convictions 

were secured without the advice of counsel, that would 

be enough to qualify him as a recidivist under the 

Federal law. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, that -- that raises a 

very narrow question that, so far as we are aware, has 

never been addressed in the immigration context, which 

is whether there could be a proceeding to challenge the 

narrow question of a conviction obtained in the complete 

absence of counsel. 

This Court said in Custis that there -- even 

though there is a very broad general rule that prior 

convictions are presumed valid, that in one narrow 

situation, the complete absence of counsel, that a due 

process type challenge could be brought. 

Now, that question has never been raised in 

this case, whether such a challenge could be brought in 

immigration proceedings despite the general rule that 

there are no such collateral challenges, but that is a 

different rule and a different body of jurisprudence 

from this Court, the due process body, as opposed to 

importing all of the very complicated section 851

And just to get back to the --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could a -- could a defendant 

whose prior conviction was under a State recidivism 

statute claim that that conviction was invalid because 

that defendant was at that time deprived of the right of 

counsel?  Do you see a difference between that situation 

and the situation in which -- and the situation in the 

sort of case we have here with respect to the issue of 

whether the prior conviction was invalid because of the 

deprivation of the right of counsel? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes, I think that they’re 

potentially distinguishable.  But, you know, this is --

this is not a question that has ever come up in the 

immigration context.  It would be a special rule that 

would be based on the Court's decision, we think, in 

Custis and not anything about “punishable” referring to 

section 851 procedures. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why are they 

distinguishable?  You could -- you can -- you could 

-- a person faced with removal could challenge 

a prior conviction on the ground that there was a 

deprivation of the right of counsel, whether or not it 

was pursuant to a recidivism -- whether or not there was 

a recidivism issue in it, couldn't -- couldn't they?

MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes, but I think 

recidivism -- I think there’s some confusion in the 

Court's discussion, perhaps, that recidivism is not an 

element of the offense.  You’re never convicted of 

recidivism.  You’re convicted of an offense, and you 

might be subject to an increased punishment for that 

offense because you are a recidivist. 

And that's essentially what Petitioner wants 

here, is to define the State court offense as having an 

element of recidivism, but there is one thing that’s 

clear from this Court's jurisprudence to this point is 

that recidivism is separate and unique from anything 

else that might --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what case do I 

read to establish that? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  That recidivism is separate 

and unique? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Almendarez-Torres would be 

one.  The Court's decision in Rodriquez would be 

another. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but 

Almendarez-Torres was a different offense; was it not? 

I mean this is -- this is a drug offender who -- it's

trade.  This is -- this is a drug offender who continues 

to repeat under the drug offense laws, and I thought the 

position was that this shows a particular propensity, a 

particular immoral attitude that’s not being corrected. 

And so that the recidivism makes him a worse person. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, what this Court said in 

Rodriguez generally about recidivist punishments is you’re 

always being punished for the last offense, but 

you're being punished more severely because it’s shown 

that incapacitation and deterrence isn't working for 

you. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what was worrying 

me, that's why I asked the other question.  But the --

what was worrying me would be a statute where they --

it's big enough in the State to cover possession with 

recidivism or not, and they deal with it at the 

punishment stage, and I can see your point in respect to 

that.  But that isn't this statute. 

This statute not only doesn't deal with it 

at the punishment stage; it's forbidden to take it into 

account because what this says is you can only get 

recidivism if you previously had a conviction for a 

class A misdemeanor, and the prior conviction here was a 

class B; and, therefore, one thing we know about the 

statute is that under this statute, his behavior as a

recidivist is as close to irrelevant as you could make 

it.  That's why I’m back to the cat burglar. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  And what -- what I'm 

suggesting about that State statute is that -- and this 

Court said this in Lopez -- that Congress didn't want 

those variations in State law to change the treatment 

for individual offenders. 

What it wanted, and it did this in 

aggravated felony provisions, all throughout them, is to 

identify categories of persons who had done certain 

conduct that Congress thought was serious enough and 

treat them all the same for immigration purposes.  And 

the Court said in Lopez, we’re not going to make the 

way that State law treats recidivism -- or we're not 

going to make State law treats an offense change the 

outcome.  The outcome is going to be based on how 

Federal law treats the offense. 

And that's why, to get back to one of my 

earlier answers to your questions, we think that this 

Court's decision in Nijhawan is extremely important 

here, because what the Court recognized in that decision 

is that Congress, in defining an aggravated felony, 

sometimes talks about required elements of the offense, 

and it sometimes talks about extra facts that can be 

established in the immigration court.  In Nijhawan, there 

51 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

was a fraud or deceit offense with this extra fact of 

this loss amount of $10,000 or more.  And Congress did the 

same thing in this provision.  They had --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It did?  Well, Nijhawan uses 

this provision as an example of where it didn't. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, we think that that 

refers to the first part of the definition.  There are 

actually two parts of the definition.  This is I think 

on page -- right at the beginning of the appendix to our 

brief.  If you look at page 1a of the gray brief. 

You know, there are two different parts 

here.  In 43(B), there is “illicit trafficking in a 

controlled substance … including a drug trafficking crime 

(as defined in section 924(c)).”  So this -- this first 

part, illicit trafficking, is like a generic burglary 

type offense where you need to just look at whether 

the -- essentially elements correspond under a modified 

categorical approach. 

But then the second part of it, the drug 

trafficking crime, is the one that's defined as a felony 

punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.  And 

when you look at a felony punishable under the Controlled 

Substances Act, which this Court interpreted in Lopez as 

a -- an offense that is punishable as a felony under Federal 

law, it is just like Nijhawan.  It is an offense with

a certain extra fact.  In Nijhawan, it was a fraud --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask you --

MS. SAHARSKY:  -- and deceit offense. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- because your time is 

running out.  I take it your answer would be the 

same -- at least these two misdemeanors were 

committed a year apart, but if they were 10 years apart, 

your answer would still be the same? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes, and I think that’s 

because Congress has said when it wants the -- the 

timing to matter.  For example, in the end of the 

aggravated felony definitions, Congress said it didn't 

want felony convictions that were more than 15 years old 

to matter.  You know, Congress -- when it wants something 

old not to matter, it says so, an older conviction.  So 

we don't think that there would be a difference for that 

purpose. 

So I just want to make sure I’ve answered the 

question.  We just think this is like that situation 

where you have a conviction for a certain type of 

offense, which here is drug possession, and an extra fact, 

how it’s punishable in Federal court, and that extra 

fact can be established in immigration court.  It's not 

the kind thing that this Court has said under 

Almendarez-Torres needs to be treated like an offense

element. 

Official 

I should note that --- and this is the point 

you made, Justice Breyer, that there was not a 

recidivist enhancement available in Texas court. 

Justice Kennedy, that just highlights some of the 

problems that you identified in terms of the wide 

variations that we would see in how similarly situated 

people who have done the same things, two drug possession 

offenses, would be treated differently under the 

immigration laws.  And that's just not what Congress 

intended. 

We talk in our brief -- and there’s a long 

list of differences in State laws, not only in the 

State procedures, which vary widely from Federal court, 

but in the State laws in terms of, you know, if you can 

consider a second possession offense for recidivist 

enhancement, or only a third or fourth; whether the 

first offense has to be final, et cetera, et cetera, 

et cetera.  That there -- these differences would just 

lead to a -- a patchwork application laws of the 

immigration laws, and if there’s any place where we don't 

want that, it's -- it's in immigration, with respect to 

immigration consequences. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was another 

crime, I thought a more serious crime, though still a

misdemeanor, in this picture, but the Texas prosecutor 

didn't make anything of that.  Remind me of what that 

was, but I thought it was a -- a more grave offense. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  You might be thinking of his 

prior offense for domestic violence. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  That that may have been able 

to be used to -- to enhance his -- his drug crime to an 

enhanced sentence, but that -- there wasn't an 

enhancement sought on that. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes --

MS. SAHARSKY:  That was a -- a 2003 

conviction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So we respect that 

judgment on the part of the prosecutor, not to make it a 

-- a ground for a recidivist charge, but we don't 

respect the prosecutor -- Texas prosecutor saying I'm 

just going to treat this like it's a first-time 

misdemeanor; that's it. 

MS. SAHARSKY:  In neither case does the 

prosecutor's judgment matter.  What matters is the 

offense conduct that was established by the conviction 

in State court.  What matters is the offense that the 

person was convicted of and if that corresponds to a 

Federal offense that was punishable as a felony in

Federal court. 

Official 

It is true that some charges may be 

brought and some charges may not be brought, and that 

would impact what a person has been convicted of.  So 

there could be disparities based on that.  But what 

Congress decided was that it had to balance its need for 

uniformity with a rule that is administrable, and the rule 

that it picked as administrable is, let's look at the 

offense conduct that was established by the conviction. 

And when you look at that offense conduct, you have to ask 

how it could be punished in Federal court.  And it's that 

“punishable” language that requires this more hypothetical 

inquiry on how the events -- how the offense could be 

treated. 

And just to summarize, it is clear from the 

last 20 years that Congress has had a very serious 

concern about recidivist criminal aliens in the United 

States, and Congress has made a judgment since 1970 in 

the drug laws that two drug possession offenses should 

be punishable as a felony.  And under those 

circumstances, a person who concededly has committed 

those two drug offenses and who concededly, if taken to 

Federal court, could have been punished as a felony, just 

should not be able to escape the aggravated felony 

designation that Congress intended for all aliens who

If the Court has no further questions, we

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Ms. Saharsky. 

Mr. Srinivasan, you have 4 minutes 

remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We usually think of 

recidivism when we talk about statistics as being 

repeated for any crime.  This is a recidivism of a special 

kind.  It's repeating the same -- the same thing.  Is 

that essential to your argument?  I know it's essential 

to the -- to the Federal statute. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Right, and because it's 

essential to the Federal statute, it's necessarily a part 

of our argument.  I don't think our argument would be 

any different if the Federal statute read differently, 

but you can only be punishable as a felon under Federal 

law if you had a prior drug conviction, and if you had a 

prior drug conviction that was in fact found to exist. 

And I think, Justice Kennedy, the first point 

I’d like to make in rebuttal -- there's two points I’d 

57 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

like to make.  The first addresses a question you 

raised concerning what happens in a situation in which 

the second proceeding is a Federal proceeding rather 

than a State proceeding. 

And I think this is important to highlight 

the government's response, because if the second proceeding 

is a Federal proceeding, we have a person who has a prior 

conviction for drug possession.  We have a person who is 

then prosecuted in Federal court for a second time for 

drug possession.  The prosecutor by hypothesis never 

brings the initial conviction into play.  The court 

therefore never finds that the person is a recidivist. 

As a consequence, that person cannot as a matter of law 

receive a felony sentence.  They can only be sentenced 

as a misdemeanant.  But nonetheless, the government would 

say that they have been, quote, "convicted of a felony, 

punishable under the Controlled Substances Act," close quote --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do you --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- even though no felony 

sentence could be imposed. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do you distinguish 

Nijhawan?  I mean, there what made it a Federal felony 

was the fact that more than $10,000 was obtained from 

the victims.  But that was not found in the -- in the 

State conviction.  It simply was not.

MR. SRINIVASAN:  There were -- there were 

two things that made it a Federal felony, 

Justice Scalia.  First was it had to be an offense that 

involved fraud. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  And then -- and that had to 

be found by the convicting court. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  There was no issue about 

that.  Our --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No issue. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Our point is that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what about the 

$10,000? That --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  That’s the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He was never convicted of 

having obtained by fraud more than $10,000 from the 

victim. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  But -- but there's a very 

important textual distinction, Justice Scalia, because 

under the provision at issue in Nijhawan, the offense 

had to involve fraud, and then there was a separator in 

which the loss exceeds $10,000.  And the Court focused 

on the fact that the text read "in which."  That was 

critical, and another thing that was critical in

Nijhawan was that if you looked at Federal statutes and 

asked, were there any that as to which the elements would 

require a loss in excess of $10,000, there were none. 

And because of that practical consequence, 

the Court reached the conclusion that Congress would 

have intended, that the $10,000 be something that the 

immigration judge could have found. 

We have the opposite situation here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You still had the word 

"convicted." 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  You had -- sure. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is what you’re 

relying on.  That word was applicable there as much as 

it’s applicable here, and we did not require him to 

have been convicted of having obtained more than $10,000. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Because, again, the test --

the text also had "in which," which the Court found 

critical -- that text is lacking here -- and because the 

statute would have had no practical consequence, absent 

the Court's interpretation. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that’s -- that --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's not true here. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because she got to that argument 

at the end, and she said my -- I wrote that, I think, and I --

when I used as an example or the text uses an example, this

provision is one where you don't look to real conduct. 

She said that was a mistake, really.  It 

was overstated, because what they’re saying is that 

recidivism analogous to the $10,000 was meant to be a 

real conduct aspect, not just offense of conviction, and 

-- and she gave similar reasons.  That's why -- similar 

reasons are that the States are too mixed up in 

this; it will be too difficult to look at that element 

itself.  So she’s trying to analogize that to the 

$10,000. 

Now, why isn't that a good analogy? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Because for both reasons 

that the Court found that you could look to the 

circumstances in Nijhawan, neither of those two reasons 

applies here.  You don't have a textual separator.  You 

don't have the words "in which."  All you have is the 

word "convicted."  And you also don't have the 

consequence that the -- the provision would cease to 

have any practical implications under our reading. 

It would absolutely have practical 

implications under our reading, because anytime a person 

was found to have been a recidivist and their sentence 

was raised, their maximum sentence was raised as a 

consequence, they will have been deemed to have been 

aggravated felon.  But here, that didn't happen.  You'd 

61 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

have to understand that in the Federal system, even 

though an individual could not as a matter of law be 

sentenced as a felon, they nonetheless would have been 

deemed to have been convicted of a felony, and at the 

very least -- and this is the second point I'd like to 

make, if I could just --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Make your second 

point short. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

Principles of lenity which the government 

agrees are potentially applicable here would dictate ruling 

in our favor even if you thought that the text was 

ambiguous.  The principles of lenity do apply.  An 

individual who pleads guilty to possession in exchange 

for a prosecutor's decision to refrain from charging him 

as a recidivist and, therefore, could only be sentenced as 

a misdemeanor I think should be allowed to be convinced 

that he has been convicted of a misdemeanor rather than 

a felony. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
