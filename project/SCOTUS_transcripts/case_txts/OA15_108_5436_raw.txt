CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  15­1808,  the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  v.

Mr.  Landau. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CHRISTOPHER  LANDAU 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  case  turns  on  the  straightforward  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  people  of  Puerto  Rico  are  the  source  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  for  the  laws  of  Puerto  Rico.  That  means  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  prior  Federal  conviction  has  no  Double  Jeopardy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implications  for  the  enforcement  of  the  Commonwealth's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  laws  because  Commonwealth  law  and  Federal  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emanate  from  different  sources  of  authority:  The  people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Puerto  Rico  on  the  one  hand  and  Congress  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Landau,  could 

  

 

 

 

Congress  amend  48  U.S.C.  1704,  which  covers  Guam,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virgin  Islands,  American  Samoa?  Could  it  amend  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  and  put  Puerto  Rico  in  there  as  well? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  It  could  certainly  amend  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  Your  Honor,  with  respect  to  Federal

prosecutions  in  Puerto  Rico  pursuant  to  its  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  Federal  prosecutors. 

 

 

            

Your  question,  Your  Honor,  raises  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

intricate  question  with  ­­ with  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  In  ­­ in  the  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ it  works  both  ways. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  In  the  statute,  Your  Honor,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  because  there's  no  question  Puerto  Rico  is  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unique  status  different  than  Guam,  the  Virgin  Islands, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  American  Samoa  precisely  because  those  are  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territories  governed,  as  traditionally,  by  organic  acts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Congress. 

 

            

there  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  is  there  ­­ is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  ­­ what  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Northern  Marianas? 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Your  Honor,  they  are  in  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interesting  position  that  is  generally  more  analogous  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  in  the  sense  that  they  are  a  Commonwealth  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Northern  Marianas  with  a  compact  of  their  own  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  very  much  modeled  on  Puerto  Rico,  although  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat  different  than  the  Puerto  Rico  model.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  profound  distinction  that  goes  to  the  heart  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  between  the  home  rule  territories,  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress,  to  be  sure,  has  delegated  a  measure  of

self­government  to  those  particular  territories,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

each  of  them,  Guam,  the  Virgin  Islands,  and  American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Samoa  are  still  governed  by  organic  acts  of  Congress,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  Puerto  Rico  prior  to  1952. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Landau,  could  you 

  

 

 

 

 

finish  your  answer  to  my  question?  You  said  yes,  as  far 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  what  the  federal  Congress  can  deal  with,  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

federal  prosecutors  do,  but  the  statute  works  both  ways. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Are  you  saying  it  couldn't  ­­ Congress  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  power  to  do  that  with  respect  to  Puerto  Rico? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  I  would  say,  Your  Honor,  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  raises  a  very  interesting  and  tricky  issue  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  compact  that  the  1950  Public  Law  600 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered  the  people  of  Puerto  Rico  that  was  accepted.  As 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  said  in  the  Flores  de  Otero  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1970s  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You're  saying  it's  a  hard 

   

  

 

 

 

question,  but  you  haven't  given  me  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  think  the 

   

   

   

  

 

 

answer  is  probably  not,  insofar  as  this  Court  said  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I'm  not  saying  this  myself.  I'm  quoting  this  Court. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  relinquished  control  over  the  organization  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  internal  affairs  of  the  Island. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  one  point  to  make  very,  very  clear: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our  position  today  on  the  double  jeopardy  issue  does  not

turn  on  that  relinquishing  issue.  But  to  answer  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  specifically,  if  Congress  started  to  tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Puerto  Rico  prosecutors  what  cases  they  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecute,  that  might  raise  some  serious  questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Just  take  the  statute  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  is.  Just  add  Puerto  Rico  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ not  telling 

  

 

 

 

prosecutors  what  to  do  in  a  particular  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  and  ­­ and,  again,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  I  think  the  critical  point  here,  and  I  think  what 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  most  telling  going  back  to  some  of  the  colloquy  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  happened  in  the  other  case,  Congress  since  1952  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  attempted  to  do  anything  like  that,  to  tell  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  ­­ to  exercise  control  over  what  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officials  in  Puerto  Rico  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  doesn't  mean  it 

  

 

 

 

 

couldn't.  That  doesn't  mean  it  couldn't  change  the  law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  it  essential  to  your  case  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  Puerto  Rico  as  a  sovereign? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  It  is  not  essential  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  Puerto  Rico  as  a  sovereign  with  a  capital  "S," 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

because  if  you  get  12  political  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  our  usual  double 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official ­ Subject to Final Review 

7 

jeopardy  law,  isn't  it? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  It  ­­ it  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ two  sovereigns,  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different  matter. 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  It  is  the  shorthand  that  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  typically  used,  the  dual  sovereignty  doctrine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  the  court  made  clear  this  is  the  lesson  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wheeler  case  where  the  court  was  ­­ the  Ninth  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  gee,  these  Indian  tribes  don't  look  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereigns  to  us,  because  they  are  subject  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plenary  control  of  Congress.  That's  not  what  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

typically  think  of  as  sovereigns. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  this  Court  says  you're  missing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  Ninth  Circuit.  What  we  mean  in  the  context  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

double  jeopardy,  the  language  we  are  construing  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  offense.  Laws  ­­ offences  created  by  two  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entities  are  not  the  same  offense  if  they  flow  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  sources  of  court. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  don't  understand  how 

   

  

 

 

 

that  helps  you,  Mr.  Landau.  You're  saying  that  the  test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  what  the  source  of  authority  is,  and  you're  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  source  of  authority  here  is  the  Puerto  Rican 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people. 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct.

you're  not  taking  another  step  back.  What's  the  source 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  authority  of  Puerto  Rican  people?  The  source  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  of  Puerto  Rican  people  was  a  Congressional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

act.  If  you  go  back,  the  ultimate  source  of  authority 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  Congress. 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  That,  Your  Honor,  is  the  crux 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  case.  And  with  all  respect,  I  disagree  with  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion  that  the  ultimate  source  here  is  Congress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  could  be  ­­ what  Your  Honor  just  described  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  much  like  a  home  rule  jurisdiction,  where,  let's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  you  have  the  Virgin  Islands  legislature  that  passes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  Virgin  Islands  law.  But  that  government  of  the  Virgin 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Islands  is  itself  a  creature  of  Congress,  as  was  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  of  the  Philippines  in  the  early  1900s,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  in  '30s  at  the  time  of  the  Shell  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  made  all  the  difference  in  the  world, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  was  in  1950  to  '52  Congress  said,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  and  fully  endorse  the  government  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concept  of  government  by  consent.  So  we  are  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delegating  authority  to  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  but  Congress  today,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  felt  like  it  ­­ and  of  course  it  won't.  But  if  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felt  like  it,  could  Congress  go  back  on  that  decision? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  this  then  goes  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relinquishment  issue,  Your  Honor,  in  terms  of  what  is

the  nature  of  the  compact.  This  has  been  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

emotional  and  hot­button  issue  in  Puerto  Rico.  As  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  McGruder  noted  in  his  article  in  1953  already, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  divergent  views  at  the  time  from  the  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outset  on  whether  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  suppose  we  assume 

  

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  could  rescind  the  existing  compact. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

case? 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Do  you  then  lose  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  LANDAU:  Absolutely  not,  Your  Honor.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  ­­

lesson  of  Wheeler.  It  was  uncontested  in  Wheeler  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plenary  congressional  control  over  the  Indians  ­­ over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Indian  tribes  meant  that  Congress  could  abrogate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian  sovereign  immunity  with  the  stroke  of  a  pen,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  abrogate  the  tribes  and  derecognize  the  tribes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  that  didn't  mean  that  the  existing  tribal  laws  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  were  not  considered  the  laws  of  the  separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribes  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Are  there  ­­ you  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"sovereignty"  is  a  slippery  word.  That's  why  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

framers  didn't  use  it  in  the  constitution.

Are  you  suggesting  there's  kind  of  a  second 

   

 

 

 

 

 

class  sovereignty  and  a  first  class  sovereignty? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

couldn't  agree  more  with  your  insight,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"sovereignty"  is  a  slippery  word.  If  you  got  12 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

political  philosophers,  they  would  all  give  you  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  answer  as  to  what  "sovereignty"  means.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  is  precisely  why  Wheeler  said  we  can't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges  and  courts  trying  to  decide  double  jeopardy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  by  asking  abstract  questions  of  sovereignty, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  you  know,  even  the  State  sovereignty  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  than  the  sovereignty  of  the  independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nations.  They  don't  have  ambassadors,  et  cetera.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  this  Court  has  made  clear  is  that  the  test  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

double  jeopardy  context  is  all  about  the  source  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  for  the  laws. 

 

 

 

            

And  going  back  to  Justice  Kagan's  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  I  think  cuts  to  the  heart  of  the  case,  in  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  case  Congress  said,  we  ­­ and  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  demands  for  ­­ by  the  people  of  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  government  by  consent.  The  people  of  Puerto  Rico 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  we  are  tired  of  being  a  colony.  We  want  to  create 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  own  government.  And  so  the  Constitution  of  Puerto 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  could  not  be  more  explicit  on  this  score,  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  "The  political  power  of  the  Commonwealth  emanates

from  the  people."  That  document  was  submitted  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  voters.  So  you're  a  Puerto  Rico  voter  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  say  this  is  what  I'm  voting  for.  It  was  submitted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  President  of  the  United  States  and  Congress,  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approved  that  particular  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Landau,  we  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation  as  a  result  of  the  decision  of  the  Supreme 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  of  Puerto  Rico.  I  think  it  was  two  of  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justices  who  said  we're  not  going  to  get  into  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  about  the  Constitution.  We  think,  interpreting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

our  own  double  jeopardy  provision,  somebody  should  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  tried  a  second  time.  So  that's  going  to  be  the  law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Puerto  Rico.  That's  ­­ if  the  Puerto  Rico  Supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  that,  then  we  would  have  the  situation  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  led  us  to  grant  cert  in  this  case.  That  is,  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  prosecution  first  in  the  Federal  government,  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  will  not  have  a  second  prosecution.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  it  first  in  Puerto  Rico.  The  Federal  government  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

free  to  institute  a  second  prosecution. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  You're  absolutely  ­­ you're 

  

 

 

 

 

absolutely  right,  Your  Honor.  And  that  was  the  position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  two  of  the  nine  justices  on  the  Supreme  Court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico.  That  position  did  not  command  a  majority, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  why  there's  no  adequate  and  independent  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground  here.  The  majority  was  very  explicit  ­­

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  they  could.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

could.  If  ­­ if  the  ­­ if  we  told  the  majority  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong,  nothing  would  prevent  them  from  agreeing  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  two  justices,  right? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  No,  that's  absolutely  right. 

  

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  about  21  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Then  there's  no  way  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

could  break  that  situation  of  having  ­­ it  depends  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  ­­ which  jurisdiction  goes  first. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

And  that  ­­ that  is  true  in  about  21  states,  that  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  State  law,  either  statutory  or  constitutional, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  not  allow  a  subsequent  prosecution. 

   

 

 

 

            

 

But  again,  that  doesn't  change  the  point. 

 

 

 

 

 

What  ­­ what  made  a  cert  grant  appropriate  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

intolerable  was  that  the  Federal  ­­ was  the  difference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  the  Federal  and  State  courts  in  Puerto  Rico  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  federal  constitutional  question.  It  was  not  if  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  Federal  and  one  were  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Landau,  there's 

  

 

 

 

something  you  said  that  resonates  with  me,  'cause  I've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  trying  to  find  a  definition  of  "sovereignty."  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

one  has  been  created  in  the  briefing  by  saying  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

states  are  sovereign;  yet  if  you  look  at  international 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usage,  they  wouldn't  consider  states  necessarily

sovereign  because  they  can't  order  their  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affairs.  They  can't  print  money.  They  can't  do  lots  of

elements  of  sovereignty  with  respect  to  the  Double

people  say. 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Absolutely. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  it  can't  be  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  the  compact  alone.  So  what  is  it?  What  are  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Absolutely.

MR.  LANDAU:  To  ­­ to  take  your  ­­ your

clear  in  a  series  of  cases  starting  in  Wheeler  in  1978 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  really  tries  to  synthesize  what  the  Court  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  with  respect  to  the  dual  sovereignty  doctrine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  a  century. 

   

            

And  what  the  Court  said  is,  in  the  Double 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jeopardy  context,  we  are  trying  to  decide  whether  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses  from  different  entities  are  the  same  offense.

That  has  traditionally  been  called  "dual  sovereignty." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  what  we  mean  by  "dual  sovereignty"  in

that  the  separate  entity  possesses  the  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  what  shall  be  an  ­­ an  offense  against  their

MR.  LANDAU:  It  is,  Your  Honor.  And  I  ­­

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ by  this  distinct 

  

 

 

 

 

            

and  I  ­­

   

            

source  of  power? 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  If  ­­ if  could  just  say  ­­ make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  quick  points  in  response  to  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  Lanza  is  not  the  last  word  on  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Wheeler,  in  the  '70s,  clarified  what  Lanza  meant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  for  instance,  the  Ninth  Circuit  in  Wheeler 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  well,  the  Indian  Tribes  don't  fit  the  Lanza 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  because  Congress  has  plenary  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overrule  at  any  time.  So  that  goes  to  the  first  part  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  question. 

 

            

To  the  second  part  of  your  question,  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  acting  in  tandem  with  the  people  of  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  critical.  In  other  words,  it  is  certainly  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  people  of  Puerto  Rico  that  could  unilaterally  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  reference  to  Congress  just  say,  guess  what?  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  source  of  authority  of  our  own  laws.  And  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  the  end  of  the  story. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Landau,  I  thought 

   

  

 

 

that,  in  the  ­­ in  the  case  of  the  Indian  Tribes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ what  the  Court  said  is  they  were  once  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  we  got  here  and  we  took  some  of  that  sovereignty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away.

That's  not  the  case  with  Puerto  Rico. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  LANDAU:  Yes.  We  are  certainly  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

saying  that  we  are  absolutely  on  all  fours  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian  Tribes.  There  are  ­­ what  Your  Honor  said  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true.  Although  one  thing  to  keep  in  mind,  of  course,  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  not  all  tribes  proceeded  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  creation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  United  States.  In  fact,  if  Congress  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  Indian  Tribes  to  this  day,  the  standard  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  25  C.F.R.  83.7.  And  an  entity  that  existed  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recently  at  1900  can  still  be  considered  an  Indian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribe.  So  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  the  rationale  was 

  

 

 

 

 

that  the  tribes  had  this  sovereignty,  and  that's  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  being  respected. 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  That  ­­ that  ­­ that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct,  Your  Honor.  The  ­­ the  ­­ the  tribes  had  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherent  sovereignty.  But  I  think  the  point  for  Double 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Jeopardy  purposes  doesn't  require  the  inherency.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  requires  a  ­­ a  recognition  by  Congress  of  an 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  of  sovereignty.  And  that  goes,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  what  is  it?  That  is, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

look.  If  we  simply  write  an  opinion  and  it  says,  Puerto 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  is  sovereign,  that  has  enormous  implications. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  It  does.

totally  changed  in  their  applications. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  political  implications 

  

 

 

 

I'll  just  stay  away  from. 

 

 

 

 

            

On  the  other  hand,  if  we  write  an  opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  says  it's  just  a  territory,  that  has  tremendous 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

implications. 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  How  did  we  tell  the  UN  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  a  colony?  Why  are  we  not  reporting  on  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

colony  every  year? 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  either  way,  between 

  

 

 

 

 

those  two,  the  implications  in  law  and  in  politics  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  else  are  overwhelming. 

 

 

 

            

Therefore,  you  argue  a  third  and  middle 

   

 

 

 

 

position.  Your  position  pointing  to  four  cases  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court,  so  you  have  very  good  authority.  It's  for  Double 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jeopardy  purposes.  There  is  a  different  question.  The 

   

  

  

 

 

 

question  is  what  are  the  sources  of  the  law?  And  then  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  four  cases  that  say  just  what  you  said.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  you  say  the  sources  of  the  law,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sources  of  criminal  law  here  are  different.  Okay.  What 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  Justice  Sotomayor  wanted  you  to  say  is  explain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.

MR.  LANDAU:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Take  a  little  time,  if  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

like.  In  what  way  are  they  different? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Absolutely,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

They  are  different,  Your  Honor,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  invited  ­­ in  Public  Law  600,  Congress  said,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  the  principle  of  government  by  consent.  That

Justice  Breyer  is  trying  to  stay  away  from. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  is  a  very  simple  question. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right?  Can  the 

  

  

 

 

 

Federal  government  override  a  Puerto  Rican  law?

Puerto  Rico  in  the  legislative  assembly.  In  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

words,  the  Puerto  Rico  Constitution  could  not  be  more

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  laws  were  made  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico's  comparable  Congress. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  That  is  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  this  is  the  ­­ I  think  the  point  I'd  really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  to  underscore,  because  I  think  it's  critical  here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  this  arrangement  was  not  something  that  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  as  a  rogue  usurpation  of  authority.  This  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  the  invitation  of  Congress  and  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blessing  of  Congress.  That  was  submitted  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress.  The  Congress  saw  that  language. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Even  in  saying  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Landau,  you're  putting  Congress  in  the  driver's  seat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here:  It  was  done  at  the  invitation  of  Congress. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  approved  it.  Presumably  Congress  can  unapprove 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  if  Congress  ever  wished  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  Congress  is  in  the  driver's  seat,  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  Congress  the  source  of  authority  for  the  purposes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  our  Double  Jeopardy  jurisprudence  ­­

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ which  seems  to  make  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  issue?  I  mean,  you  can  imagine  a  different  Double 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

Jeopardy  jurisprudence  where  the  issue  was  who  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercises  authority  in  the  real  world?  But  that  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  to  be  what  we  ask. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  That's  ­­ that's  correct. 

  

 

 

 

 

That's  correct.  And  I  think  that  ­­ that  the  key  point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I'd  like  to  make,  Your  Honor,  is  that  you  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  ­­ Congress  has  plenary  authority  over  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territories  under  the  Territorial  Clause.  Our  position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  Congress  is  not  the  prisoner  of  its  plenary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority;  it  is  the  master  of  plenary  authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  therefore,  when  Congress  can  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  for  the  long­term  future  of  Puerto  Rico,  it  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  think  it  is  appropriate  or  good  for  ­­ for  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  or  the  United  States  to  have  direct  or  delegated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  power  in  Puerto  Rico.  It  says  we  accede  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  request  of  the  Puerto  Rican  people  to  create 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  own  government  and  to  be  the  source  of  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  their  own  law. 

 

 

 

            

So  that's  what  Congress  invites.  The  people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  Puerto  Rico  accept  the  invitation.  They  enact  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  that  is  entirely  explicit  saying  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  power  of  the  Commonwealth  creates  the

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  does  that  ­­

the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  have  that  authority? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where  did  it  come  from? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  The  ­­ Congress  can  recognize 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  invite  an  exercise  of  sovereignty,  just  like  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  recognized  in  Lara.

Puerto  Rico.  And  ­­ and  what  it  did  is  the  Constitution 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Puerto  Rico  adopted  and  that  Congress  then  accepted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  says  political  power  emanates  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  So  Your  Honor,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  is  ­­ I  mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  seem  to  fix  on  invited  as  somehow  different  than

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  even  if  you  said  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  the  point  is  authorized  sounds  like  a  delegation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  authority. 

 

              

I  think  the  point  is  Congress  said,  look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  go  adopt  your  own  constitution.  That  in  and  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  doesn't  necessarily  answer  the  question  of  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  authority  from  that  constitution  comes  from.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  when  it  says  fully  recognizing  the  principal  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  by  consent,  this  is  what  the  people  of

people  of  the  territory? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  You  could.  And  in  fact,  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  tradition  in  the  19th  century.  We  cited  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  cases  ­­ of  course  there  weren't  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  kind  of  cases  in  the  19th  century  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  had  very,  very  limited  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power.  So  these  come  up  in  things  like  counterfeiting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  and  selling  liquor  to  the  Indians.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Recognized  how,  because 

  

 

 

 

this  was  ­­ it  was  a  very  close  case,  as  you  know. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

again  ­­

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And 

  

  

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  so  I  don't  think  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

was  settled  before  then. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  but  it  ­­ it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  ­­ it  has  been  an  issue  that  had  divided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  in  the  Court.  In  the  more  recent  cases  since  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1950s,  it  has  not  been  a  particularly  divisive  issue. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  just  to  be  clear  in  this  case,  there  is  no  call  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  side  to  overrule  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I'm  questioning  you 

  

 

 

 

looking  back  before  the  Bartkus  case,  for  precedent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right.  But  Bartkus  didn't  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  the  blue,  Your  Honor.  Bartkus  has  antecedents. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Lanza  was  the  first  case  in  1922  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibition  is  what  really  suddenly  had  federal  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws  that  were  quite  widespread  throughout  the  country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  Lanza  is,  I  think,  the  first  case  you  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characterize  as  a  square  holding  of  this  case  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dual  sovereignty  doctrine. 

 

 

            

It  continued  to  be  a  somewhat  controversial

doctrine  up  until  the  1950s,  and  then  it's  been,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  settled  since  then.  And  it's  not  been  challenged 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Mr.  Landau,  I'm  not  sure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  answered  my  question  about  why  territorial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislatures  are  different. 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  They  are  different  because 

  

 

 

 

 

those  ­­ the  other  ones  are  Home  Rule  legislatures.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  there's  a  Virgin  Islands  Organic  Act, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  Guam  Organic  Act.  So  Congress  ­­ and  a  D.C. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Home  Rule  Act. 

 

 

            

 

Congress  created  that  government  structure 

 

 

 

and  endowed  it  with  authority.  Pursuant  to  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  did,  the  people  have  a  certain  degree  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

autonomy.  They  elect  their  legislators.  D.C.  has  D.C. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

laws.  The  Virgin  Islands  has  Virgin  Islands  law.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  to  some  extent  or  other  those  can  be  vetoed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe,  by  Congress. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  If  you  say  that  the  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  source  of  the  law  in  question,  it  seems  to  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  territorial  legislature  is  as  much  the  source 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  law  as  is  the  legislature  of  Puerto  Rico. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  The  question,  Your  Honor,  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ultimate  source  of  authority  for  the  law.  So  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  a  Home  Rule  jurisdiction  ­­ again,  this  is  ­­

I'm  not  saying  that  this  is  what  this  Court  has  held, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  when  you  have  a  Home  Rule  jurisdiction  ­­ this  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Waller  case,  for  instance,  where  it's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipality,  was  clearly  ­­ the  city  council  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

source  of  the  law.  But  the  ultimate  source  of  the  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  delegated  power  from  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  critical  point  here  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico,  the  legislative  assembly  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  ­­ this  goes  back  to  Justice  Sotomayor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  and  Justice  Kagan's  point  ­­ is  not  exercising 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  delegated  by  Congress  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  see  your  ­­ I  see  your 

    

   

 

 

 

 

time  is  getting  up.  It  seemed  to  me  that  in  a  way,  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  answered  Justice  Scalia's  question,  well,  yes,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ it  is  true  that  local  legislature  is  the  source  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law,  and  there  is  Double  Jeopardy  there  too.  Yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  you  ­­ again,  that  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  another  way  of  looking  at  the  ­­ at  the  issue.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  frankly,  was  the  historical  way  of  looking  at  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  you  go  back  to  the  1850s  cases,  they  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territories,  which  at  that  time  were  creatures  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress,  that  was  considered  to  be  a  separate  sovereign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  Double  Jeopardy.  That's  the  historical  antecedent. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

But  in  the  20th  century,  particularly  in  Wheeler  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  recent  cases,  the  Court  has  said  the  question  is

the  ultimate  source  of  authority. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  ultimate  source  of  authority  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws  of  Puerto  Rico,  unlike  the  ultimate  source  of

people  of  Puerto  Rico,  not  Congress. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

I'd  like  to  reserve  the  balance  of  my  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Unikowsky. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ADAM  G.  UNIKOWSKY 

 

 

 

 

 

              

 

 

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

Under  our  Constitution,  States  are  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

and  territories  are  not. 

 

 

 

            

Although  Puerto  Rico  has  indisputedly 

 

 

 

 

achieved  a  historic  degree  of  autonomy,  it  remains  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

territory  under  Article  IV.  As  such,  it  cannot  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered  sovereign  for  Double  Jeopardy  purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

An  unbroken  line  of  this  Court's  Double 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jeopardy  cases  has  stated,  both  before  and  after  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enactment  of  the  1952  constitution  of  Puerto  Rico,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territories  are  not  sovereign  for  Double  Jeopardy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It  does  seem,  Mr.  Unikowsky, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

as  if  Congress  has  given  Puerto  Rico  as  much  authority

itself.  Do  you  disagree  with  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Well,  two  responses.  One, 

  

  

 

 

 

yes,  I  disagree  with  that.  And  two,  even  if  I  agreed 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  that,  we  do  think  that  there  is  a  sharp  dividing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  between  States  and  territories  for  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes. 

            

it? 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  kind  of  territory  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  It  is  a  ­­ we  think  there's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

only  one  type  of  territory  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  There  is.  The  ­­ the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

insular  cases  have  at  least  two. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Well,  yes.  The  insular 

  

  

 

 

 

cases  that  hold  that  it  is  considered  an  unincorporated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territory.  That  is  true. 

  

 

 

            

            

            

Asociado? 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  So  it's  that  kind. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  what  is  Estado  Libre

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  no.  I  just  wonder  as 

    

  

 

 

 

 

it  appears  in  the  Constitution  of  Puerto  Rico.

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Well,  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  just  wonder  what  it  is. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  We  believe  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Constitution  does  not  include  that  as  a  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

category,  just  as  it  doesn't  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Where  does  it  say  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  that  Congress  cannot?  After  all,  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  admit  a  State.  It  says  that  specifically. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  It  certainly  does  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Talks  about  territories. 

  

 

 

 

So  you're  saying  Congress  and  the  President  too  do  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  authority  to  associate  with  some  other  entity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  form  of  Estado  Libre  Asociado? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  That  is  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Where  does  it  say  that  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  of  our  cases? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Well,  I  think  the  Yankton 

   

  

 

 

 

case  very  clearly  says  that  if  a  portion  of  land  is  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  State,  then  it  has  to  be  under  a  territory. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  what  are  the  Indians? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Your  Honor,  the  Indian 

  

 

 

 

 

tribes  are  a  sui  generis  category  explicitly  recognized

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Because  ­­ because  we  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  recognize  explicitly  in  the  Constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

"Commonwealth,"  therefore  there  is  no  Commonwealth?  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  what  you  want  us  to  say? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  I  want  you  to  say  that  this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  already  held  in  the  Harris  case  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  is  a  territory.  And  not  only  that,  that  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  With  some  purposes.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  issue  here,  as  I  see  it  ­­ which  maybe  will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  a  second  ­­ is  there  are  four  cases  that  say  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  to  reach  these  grand  questions.  All  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  is  decide  what  the  source  of  power  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  their  argument  is  that  even  if  you  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  the  Foraker  Act,  which  indeed  did  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  of  Puerto  Rico  making  laws,  and  if  you  then  add 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Resolution  600  which  delegated  the  authority  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Constitution,  the  Constitution  itself  which  speaks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  "We  the  People"  of  Puerto  Rico  making  a  law,  the  fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  later  Congress  and  the  President  said  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  a  Republican  form  of  government,  the  fact  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequent  to  that  we  went  to  the  United  Nations  and  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  withdraw  the  requirement  to  report  on  a  colony 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Puerto  Rico  is  not  a  colony  ­­ ­ and  you  know 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  words  as  well  as  I,  and  they  sure  sound  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"sovereign."

And  in  Valle,  which  no  one  mentions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Trias  Monge  wrote  that  in  fact  all  these  laws  ­­ and  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  talking  about  civil,  but  I  suppose  it  applies  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commonwealth  too  ­­ are  to  be  interpreted  in  light  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  civil  code  tradition  of  Europe,  which  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tradition  that  applied  prior  to  1900,  and  not  the  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

              

I  don't  see,  when  you  put  all  those  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together,  if  you're  looking  at  the  facts  of  what  the  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Puerto  Rico  is  in  the  area,  it  sounds  to  me  like  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil  code  coming  out  of  a  constitution  which  I  grant 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

you  was  given  by  authority  of  Congress.  So  there  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are. 

            

Now  five  things  they've  listed  there  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  it  different,  not  only  from  anything  you  can  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  but  from  anything  I  can  think  of.  So  why  don't  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reply  to  those  five  things,  if  you  want. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Your  Honor,  those  five

undoubtedly  achieved  a  significant  degree  of  autonomy, 

   

 

 

 

 

but  those  characteristics  are  not  the  characteristics

that  matter  for  sovereignty  purposes  or  for  Double 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jeopardy  purposes.  The  question  is  the  ultimate  source 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  power,  and  here  the  ultimate  source  of  power  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress,  which  delegated  the  authority  to  enact  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rican  Constitution. 

 

 

                     

And  I'd  also  point  out  that  if  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks  at  the  characteristics  of  sovereignty  as  defined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Constitution  and  this  Court's  cases,  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  them. 

 

 

       

For  instance,  in  the  Alden  cases,  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained  one  of  the  reasons  we  call  States  sovereign  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  one  cannot  frame  their  generally  ­­ general  police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  as  the  delegation  of  Federal  power  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  doesn't  have  a  general  police  power 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  States,  so  there's  nothing  to  delegate.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  not  true  in  Puerto  Rico  where  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  that  was  not  true  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  of  the  territories  that  were  admitted  as  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  came  in  to  Statehood  and  were  conferred  by  a  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty  was  conferred  by  a  ­­ agreement  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government.  And  States  were  admitted  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

agreement,  and  sovereignty  were  confirmed  on  them  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement. 

            

And  so  are  you  telling  me  that  if  ­­ let's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  one  of  the  islands  in  the  Caribbean.  I'll  make  one

up.  Okay? 

  

            

Atlantis  has  been  ­­ never  kicked  out  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  colonial  status  200  years  ago,  but  it  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  many  resources.  And  it  comes  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  and  it  says,  I  want  a  treaty.  You'll  take 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

care  of  all  of  our  external  affairs.  We'll  follow 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  you  say  with  respect  to  external  affairs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  even  going  to  use  the  American  dollar  'cause  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convenient,  but  you  can't  touch  our  internal  affairs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  Congress  approves  that  treaty.  Would  that,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Double  Jeopardy  purposes,  not  be  a  sovereign? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  I  think  it  wouldn't  be  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  if  that  was  not  part  of  the  United  States,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  ­­

 

            

wouldn't? 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  couldn't  hear.  Would  or 

    

  

 

 

 

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  It  wouldn't.  So  for 

  

  

 

 

 

instance,  we  can  see  that  Micronesia  and  Palau,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  independent  countries,  I  believe  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

United  Nations,  are  ­­ are  genuinely  sovereign,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  there  are  defense  agreements  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  because  the  United  States  has  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allies  with  whom  they  have  many  treaties  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationships,  and  those  foreign  allies  may  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign,  but  those  aren't  territories.  They're  not  ­­

the  American  flag  doesn't  fly  over  them,  they're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  plenary  power  of  Congress  and  Federal  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  the  distinction  in  Puerto  Rico,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  indisputably,  a  territory  ­­

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  if  Congress  has  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

treaty  power,  why  does  it  have  similar  power  under  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  and  Regulation  Clause  of  the  Constitution?  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  limiting  principle  of  what  rules  and  regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  can  make. 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Well,  let  me  refer,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  both  to  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Under  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  I  apologize. 

    

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR  ­­ under  that 

  

 

 

 

constitutional  clause,  there's  no  suggestion  of  how  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  what  kinds  of  treaties  ­­ perhaps  not  in  violation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Constitution,  but  what  kind  of  treaties  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  make.  And  it  makes  an  awful  large  number  of  them. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  It  does,  Your  Honor.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

let  me  refer  to  both  the  constitutional  text  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structure  as  the  basis  of  our  argument.  Beginning  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  text,  Article  IV  characterizes  territories  as, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote,  "belonging  to  the  United  States."  And  we  believe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  antithetical  to  the  concept  of  sovereignty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress  has  the  ultimate  power  to  enact  a

wide  variety  of  the  governmental  forms  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territories,  but  the  sine  qua  non  of  a  territory  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  in  fact,  Congress  does  possess  that  power. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

And  I'd  also  refer  to  the  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

structure.  The  framers  of  our  Constitution  split  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

atom  of  sovereignty  between  the  Federal  government  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  States.  And  I  think  that  presupposes  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  what  types  of  sovereigns  would  exist  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  is  a  question  of  constitutional  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  Indians.  What  about 

  

  

 

 

 

the  Indians? 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Unikowsky,  it  sure  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

as  though  in  the  early  1950s,  Congress  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico,  said  we  want  to  give  it  some  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  We  want  to  give  it  an  enormous  amount  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Home  Rule  authority,  basically  everything,  and  we  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  some  idea  in  our  heads  that  Puerto  Rico  ought  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  sovereign  with  all  the  things  sovereigns  have  like  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  and  a  "We  the  People"  clause. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  why  isn't  that  something  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ it's  an  unusual  idea,  to  be  sure,  a  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  territory.  But  Congress  seems  to  have  wanted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  exactly  that. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Well,  I'd  first  push  back  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  premise.  I  don't  think  that's  what  Congress  wanted

to  do.  I  think  that  the  history,  the  legislative 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

history,  and  the  ­­ the  events,  the  historical  record, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  Congress  wanted  to  delegate  autonomy,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  creating  a  sovereign. 

   

 

 

            

 

 

So  first  I'd  ­­ I'd  turn  to  the  issue  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  20  in  which  Congress  just  unceremoniously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stripped  a  portion  of  the  Puerto  Rican  Constitution  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

permanently  barred  Puerto  Ricans  from  enacting  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

reenacting  it.  That  is  not  consistent  with  what  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  ordinarily  consider  a  sovereign. 

   

 

 

            

And  I'd  also  point  to  the  legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  and  record.  I  mean,  there's  testimony  from  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Secretary  of  the  Interior,  from  The  Resident 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commissioner  of  Puerto  Rico,  from  the  Governor  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico,  in  the  House  report,  in  the  Senate  report. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  of  that  seemed  to  contemplate  that  the  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status  of  Puerto  Rico  wouldn't  change  and  this  was  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  delegation. 

 

              

I  mean,  there  was  actually  a  hearing  we 

   

 

 

 

 

quote  on  page  30  of  our  brief  where  the  chairman  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  Senate  committee  basically  tells  everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  in  fact,  Congress's  powers  over  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  be  altered  at  all;  that  ultimately  this  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delegation  of  power  that  one  ­­ that  was  revoked  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  change  Congress's  ultimate  power  over

Puerto  Rico. 

 

            

So  I  actually  think  it's  Petitioner's 

   

 

 

 

position  that  really  is  fundamentally  inconsistent  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  historical  record  as  it  existed  at  the  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

We  don't  dispute  that  there's  ­­ this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

historic  legislation.  I  mean,  it's  true.  Petitioner's 

    

  

 

 

 

brief  characterizes  the  1950  to  '52  legislation  as, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote,  "path  marking."  And  we  actually  agree  with  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  path  marking.  It  was  historic  legislation  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delegated  a  significant  amount  of  power  to  the  people  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico,  and  it  was  very  historically  important,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remains  important  today. 

 

 

            

But  there  is  a  difference,  a  meaningful 

   

   

 

 

constitutional  difference  between  the  delegation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

power  and  the  conferral  of  sovereignty.  The  former 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred  in  Puerto  Rico,  as  it  has  occurred  in  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territories.  The  latter  can  only  apply  to  States  within 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  union. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  is  ­­ is  our  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  abstract  that  it  doesn't  acknowledge  real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practicalities  of  multiple  prosecutions?  Of  ­­ of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

course  Mr.  Landau  couldn't  come  up  and  say,  please 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forget  Heath  and  Wheeler  and  Walter  and  Grafton.  Let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  something  other  than  sovereignty.

commentators  and  so  forth  that  this  whole  inquiry  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty  and  source  of  power  is  a  little  bit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

misplaced? 

            

Of  course,  you  have  the  problem  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cities  within  its  ­­ within  separate  ­­ within  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State,  which  is,  it  seems,  ought  to  be  subject  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single  rule.  But  have  there  been  any  commentaries  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lead  us  to  another  approach  altogether?  I  don't  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  overrule  four  cases,  but  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  I  will  acknowledge  that 

    

 

 

 

there  has  been  some  larger  articles  suggesting  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  line  of  cases  is  wrong  and  the  Court  should  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  something  else,  to  autonomy.  But  certainly  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  cases,  going  back  a  century,  haven't  followed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  approach  at  all. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  actually  think  the  municipality 

   

 

 

 

example  is  a  very  good  one  for  us  because  cities 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regularly  enact  Home  Rule  charters  through  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

similar  type  of  Democratic  process  that  Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describes  for  Puerto  Rico. 

 

 

 

            

The  fundamental  principle  of  Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

position  here  is  that  the  enactment  of  a  ­­ of  a  charter 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  local  self­government  setting  forth  the  parameters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  local  self­government  in  and  of  itself  leads  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty.  That's  how  they  distinguish  the  Shell

I  didn't  fully  understand  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Unikowsky,  you  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  before  that  Congress  didn't  mean  to  confer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty  here.  Do  you  think  Congress  could  do  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  No,  Your  Honor,  it  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not.  We  think  that  the  Constitution  prohibits  that,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  exercise  of  its  powers  was  fully  consistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  that  constitutional  requirement. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  You  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

you're  saying  to  me  that  Congress  can't  make  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent? 

            

Honor. 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Of  course  it  could,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  if  it  can  do  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  can't  it  have  other  arrangements  with  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  it  has  with  everybody  else?  Why  are  we  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  with  respect  to  territories  they  don't  have  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power? 

            

MR.  UNIKOWSKY:  Your  Honor,  I  think  if 

   

  

 

 

 

Congress  ­­ if  Puerto  Rico  is  to  remain  a  territory, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  it  is  under  Article  IV,  as  this  Court  has  held, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  Congress  must  retain  the  ultimate  power.  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  follows  from  the  constitutional  structure  in  which

sovereignty,  which  clearly  identify  the  status  of

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  ­­ I  have.  You've  read 

    

   

  

 

 

the  same  thing.  There  are  about  ten  words  such  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"republic,"  "not  a  colony,"  "attributes  of  political

I  do  ­­ not  everyone  does  ­­ happen  to  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  what  we  tell  the  UN  to  get  it  removed  from  the

differences  between  a  municipality  and  Puerto  Rico,  such 

   

 

 

 

 

 

as  Puerto  Rico  has  a  much  more  delegated  power  than  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typical  municipality.  That  is  undoubtedly  true. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

But  the  ­­ there's  no  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  think  that  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

have  meaning?  In  most  municipalities,  their  offenses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  treated  as  criminal  offenses  and  not  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infractions.  They  can  only  pass  laws  with  respect  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  limited  amount  of  issues. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  States  have  control  over  many,  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  things.  They  are  substantially  different.  Why 

  

  

 

 

 

 

would  we  have  bothered  talking  about  the  structure  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Florida's  system  with  municipalities  in  Waller?  We  went 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  how  the  State  controlled  all  of  the  ­­ most  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  internal  affairs  of  municipalities,  and  we  said  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  separate  sovereigns  because  of  this  control. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  we  could  have  said  is  what  you  want  us  to  say  now,

Rico  enjoyed  that  broad  police  power.  That's  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  argument  turns  entirely  on  the  existence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Constitution  of  Puerto  Rico.  And  our  point  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  act  of  Constitution  making,  we  don't  think,  can

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  NICOLE  A.  SAHARSKY 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

              

I  think  to  respond  to  some  of  the  questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  have  come  up,  I'd  like  to  go  back  and  address  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  has  said  this  test  is,  for  dual  sovereignty  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Double  Jeopardy  context,  and  why  it's  been  using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  test. 

 

            

And  the  test  that  the  Court  has  consistently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  for  the  past  100  years  is  by  looking  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate  source  of  the  authority,  the  laws  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecuting  and  the  authority  to  prosecute.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  that  the  Court  has  said  that  it's  looked  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate  source  is  because  the  dual  sovereignty  doctrine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rests  on  the  basic  structure  of  our  Federal  system. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  what  the  Court  said  in  Wheeler.  And  the  Court

has  been  very  careful  to  guard  who  is  a  sovereign  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Constitution  and  who  is  not,  because,  after  all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  talking  about  a  weighty  power  here,  which  is  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability  of  two  sovereigns  to  prosecute  a  person  for  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense  with  the  same  elements. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  you  trace  the  history  of  what  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  done,  it  started  with  Lanza  and  Grafton. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lanza  was  a  case  about  the  Federal  government  as  opposed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  States.  And  the  Court  said  should  they  have  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  to  dual  prosecute?  Well,  we  look  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution,  and  the  unique  structure  that  was  put  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place:  The  splitting  the  atom  of  sovereignty.  And  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  a  circumstance  where  both  the  States  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  have  this  sovereign  power.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

should  both  be  able  to  prosecute. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  then  the  case  ­­ the  Court  turned  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  about  the  territories,  which  was  the  Shell  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  Puerto  Rico,  but  then  also  the  Grafton  case  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Philippines,  and  it  said,  no,  the  territories  derive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  ultimate  power  from  Congress.  That's  true  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

virtue  of  the  Territory  Clause. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  one  thing  that  the  Court  has  considered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  course  of  those  cases  as  they've  evolved,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  is  the  suggestion  that  Justice  Kennedy  made, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  maybe  we  should  focus  on  something  else  like

autonomy  and  the  ability  to  prosecute,  and  what  it  looks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  practically,  or  on  the  ground. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  Court  has  consistently  rejected  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  along  those  lines,  and  I  think  that  we  have  three 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data  points  for  that. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  They  haven't 

  

  

 

 

 

issued  that. 

 

            

In  all  of  those  cases,  Grafton  and  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ones  pre­1952,  the  Court  pointed  to  the  fact  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  these  islands  pass  laws,  they  could  be  vetoed  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  or  ­­ or  were  ­­ that  was  the  Organic  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  all  of  these  places,  Congress  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appointing  their  legislature,  in  part,  or  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appointing  colonial  governors.  And  we  went  through,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  one  of  them,  very  carefully,  what  the  issues  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control  that  remained,  that  didn't  make  them  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  any  way,  that  made  them  classic  territories. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

So  it's  not  that  we  didn't  ­­ we  eschewed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  that. 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  I  don't  think  that's  right. 

    

 

 

 

 

And  I'd  like  to  just  look  at  the  specific  example  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  that  the  Court  considered  in  the  Shell  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  you  say,  by  that  point,  Puerto  Rico  ­­ or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  you  suggested,  there  had  already  been  significant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­government  in  Puerto  Rico.  There  were  two  houses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official ­ Subject to Final Review 

47 

of  the  legislature  elected.  And  the  Court,  when  asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  question  about  whether  there  could  be  both  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  antitrust  defenses  and  Federal  antitrust  defenses, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went  through  the  situation  in  Puerto  Rico  and  said  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  significant  self­government  in  here  now.  It  defined 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  as  having  an  autonomy  similar  to  that  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  ­­ that's  in  1937  ­­ and  said  that  Congress  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  it  a  sweeping  grant  of  legislative  authority. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  Court  nonetheless  said  that  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  constitutional  system,  as  a  territory  of  the  United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  subject  to  Congress's  authority,  that  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  a  separate  sovereign. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you  forget  that 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress  could  veto  those  laws. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAHARSKY:  It  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Before  1952,  Congress 

  

 

 

 

could  veto  Puerto  Rico's  laws.  It  has  relinquished  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right. 

            

MR.  SAHARSKY:  I  don't  think  that  that's 

    

 

 

 

 

right.  I  don't  think  that  that's  right,  and  to  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent  the  Petitioner  suggests  it,  it's  just  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  Territory  Clause  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution,  which,  after  all  ­­

Congress. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  This  is  ­­ it's  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interesting  what  you're  saying. 

 

 

 

            

 

Remember,  though,  one  of  the  provisions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Puerto  Rico  Constitution,  which  Congress  approved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  said  it  was  a  Republican  form  of  government,  is  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  actions  shall  be  conducted  in  the  name  and  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  authority  of  the  people  of  Puerto  Rico. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that  sounds  like  a  delegation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

authority  as  to  source,  to  go  back  to  the  Spanish  system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  want. 

 

 

            

Now,  if  I  take  your  view,  then  I  guess  you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  say  ­­ and  it  has  considerable  implication  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  doesn't  matter  because  Congress  can  take  back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  gave. 

 

 

            

Now,  is  that  the  position  of  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  the  executive  branch?  Because  that  has  tremendous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

implication. 

            

            

MR.  SAHARSKY:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Because  obviously,  there  is

with  many  forms  of  possible  relationship.  That's  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  view  was. 

 

 

            

And  now,  is  the  position  of  the  executive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

branch  ­­ I  mean,  you  want  to  take  a  position  on  this? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  ­­ that  ­­ that  Congress,  if  it  wishes,  can  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  that  back  and  Puerto  Rico  has  no  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independence  than  ­­ in  principle,  than  any  of  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places  that  were  territories? 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  ­­ that's  a  big  question.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

do  ­­ do  you  ­­ do  you  see  it's  an  important  question? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  want  to  know  if  the  government's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

position  rests  upon  it,  because  that's  ­­ that's  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  statement  for  the  executive,  in  my  opinion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  two  ­­ two  responses  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  question. 

 

            

The  first,  I  think,  is  the  first  part  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  question,  this  statement  in  the  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  that  the  authority  to  prosecute  comes  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  people  of  Puerto  Rico  and  that  it's  in  the  name  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  people  of  Puerto  Rico.  That's  been  true  since  1900. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  was  in  the  1900  Organic  Act;  that  was  true  in  1917. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  is  not  claiming  that  it  was  a  sovereign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then.  So  I  ­­ I  would  not  rely  on  that. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  second  and,  obviously,  more  weighty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  you  raised  is  the  question  of  could  ­­ could

Congress  revise  the  arrangements  it  has  with  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico?  And  we  think  the  answer  is  yes,  and  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follows  from  the  structure  of  the  Constitution  and  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history. 

              

I  want  to  explain  why  that's  why,  but  first, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  it's  very  important  for  us  to  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  position  towards  Puerto  Rico,  starting  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1900  through  1917  with  the  elected  legislature  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elected  legislators;  1947,  the  elected  governor;  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  this  act  in  1950,  has  been  one  of  increasing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­government,  recognizing  the  benefits  of  that  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  of  Puerto  Rico.  That's  why  Congress  authorized 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  enactment  of  the  Constitution.  We  think  that  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  good  thing.  We  have  no  reason  to  believe  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  would  revisit  that.  And  we  think  it's  had  many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits  for  the  people  of  Puerto  Rico  and  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

But  asking  the  constitutional  question, 

 

 

 

 

which  is  what  the  Court  has  asked  in  its  double  jeopardy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  about  whether  Congress  could  revise  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangement  with  Puerto  Rico,  the  answer  is  yes.  And  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  that  follows  from  its  status  as  a  United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  territory  because  of  two  parts  of  the  Territory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause. 

            

The  first  is  that  territories  belong  to  the

United  States,  meaning  that  they  are  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty  of  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  second,  that  Congress  is  the  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  makes  the  rules. 

 

 

 

            

And  if  I  could  just  make  one  more  point, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  historically,  the  fact  that  Congress  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  United  States  was  the  sovereign  and  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  in  the  territories  was  very  important  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  that  the  Constitution  was  put  together. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

You  may  recall  that  the  United  States  had 

 

 

 

 

land  there  through  the  Northwest  Ordinance,  but  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  figure  out  what  to  do  with,  and  there  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  with  the  States,  what  would  happen.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  provision  needed  to  be  added  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  to  make  clear  that  Congress  was  the  one  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  going  to  make  rules  for  the  territories,  and  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  under  the  sovereignty  of  the  United  States.

insular  cases  right  there. 

 

 

 

            

There  are  different  kinds  of  territories. 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  because  of  that  that  Frankfurter  says  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  has  left  the  field  of  invention  open.  The

decisions  in  the  insular  cases  mean  this,  if  they  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything:  That  there's  nothing  in  the  Constitution  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hamper  the  responsibility  of  Congress  in  working  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangements. 

            

Now,  if  that's  so,  why  couldn't  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delegate,  without  the  power  to  take  it  back,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  Puerto  Rico  to  work  out  its  own  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

code  subject  to  the  constraints  of  the  Bill  of  Rights, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

et  cetera?  Why  couldn't  it?  I  mean,  if  Frankfurter  is 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  Or  do  you  take  the  opposite  position,  that  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't? 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  The  insular  cases  were 

  

 

 

 

 

talking  about  something  different  and  narrower,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  all  the  protections  of  the  Bill  of  Rights  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  territories  by  their  own  force.  But  to  answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  broader  question  that  you  answered,  or  asked,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  it's  inconsistent  with  the  grant  of  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Congress  in  the  Constitution  for  a  territory  to  be  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territory  but  no  longer  be  sovereign,  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Territory  Clause  defines  territories  of  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  as  subject  to  the  authority  of  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Do  you  think  it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

possible,  Ms.  Saharsky  ­­ I  mean,  putting  aside  whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  done  it  here,  but  you  think  it's  simply  not

that  would  matter  for  the  Double  Jeopardy  Clause? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  it  certainly  could  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

making  it  a  State  ­­

   

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes. 

  

 

MS.  SAHARSKY:  ­­ or  by  making  it

of  that. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  ­­ but  ­­ but  not  short 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  SAHARSKY:  We  think  that  that  would  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  fundamentally  inconsistent  with  the  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

design.  And  if  I  could  just  maybe  give  the  ­­ the  last 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  my  historical  answer,  because  I  think  it's  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important,  is:  When  this  provision  was  put  into  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution,  it  was  coupled  with  the  New  States  Clause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  was  understood  that  the  options  for  sovereignty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  statehood.  It  was  not  that  if  this  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territory,  that  the  territory  was  controlled  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,  and  I  think  it  would  have  been  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surprising  to  the  States  in  the  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conventions  to  think  that  when  States  were  defined  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  important  things  in  the  Constitution,  sharing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty  with  the  United  States,  that  Congress  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow  create  a  sovereign  territory.  We  just  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  that's  correct.

say,  could  it  not,  that  ­­ in  its  criminal  code,  that  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  crime  has  been  prosecuted  and  under  Puerto  Rican  law

wanted  to? 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well,  I  think  there  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Couldn't  it  say  that  if  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  SAHARSKY:  I  think  there  are  two 

    

 

 

 

 

different  options.  Congress  can  define  what  crimes  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  whether  they  are  crimes  in  Puerto  Rico,  as  opposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  somewhere  else.  So  if  that's  what  you're  suggesting, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  I  think  that's  what  Congress  could  do.  What  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  that  Congress  could  do  is  change  the  meaning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Fifth  Amendment  and  the  Double  Jeopardy  Clause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that's  something  for  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  No  ­­ well,  but  ­­ no, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  Congress  cannot  ­­ cannot  deny  double  jeopardy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  to  something  that  would  be  double  jeopardy,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  talking  about  a  statute  that  says,  even  though  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  have  double  jeopardy  effect,  we  say  ­­ we  say  no. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Well  ­­ right,  and  what  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  is  I  think  Congress'  ability  is  to  define  crimes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  to  set  out  what  ­­ what  they  are  and  where  they  are, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  if  the  question  is  what  the  Fifth  Amendment  permits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  doesn't  permit,  we  really  think  that's  up  to  this

Court. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  it's  not  a  matter  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

what  the  Fifth  Amendment  permits.  Congress  just  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  will  ­­ the  Justice  Department  will  not  prosecute  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime  that  has  already  been  prosecuted  in  ­­ in  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico. 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right.  And  the  Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

Department  can  work  with  Puerto  Rico  to  decide  who  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecute  what  crimes.  In  fact,  we  do  that  as  a  general 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  so  that  there's  usually  not  any  overlap  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  that  occurred  in  this  case.  But  I  think  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  very  different  thing  from  suggesting  that  Puerto 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  is  a  sovereign  under  the  Double  Jeopardy  Clause. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  No,  no,  I  understand  that.

MS.  SAHARSKY:  Right  ­­ I'm  sorry  if  I

Puerto  Rico,  for  double  jeopardy  cases,  is  ­­ for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Double  Jeopardy  Clause  is  ­­ is  treated  like  a  State. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  SAHARSKY:  That's  right.  The  government 

  

  

 

 

 

took  that  position  in  two  courts  of  appeals  and  defended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  in  a  brief  in  opposition  to  this  Court,  where  we  also 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  the  issue  didn't  matter.  But  since  that  time,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  revisited  this  issue,  given  substantial  attention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  it,  both  within  the  Department  of  Justice  and  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  agencies  of  the  Federal  government,  and  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  as  set  out  in  our  brief  is  that  it  is  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  sovereign.  And  we  think  that  that's  entirely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  other  things  we've  learned  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  that  DOJ  and  others  have  given  to  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  Puerto  Rico's  current  status  and  options  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future.

The  end  of  our  brief  talks  about  the  task 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force  that  the  President  has  put  in  place,  that  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued  reports  three  times  over  the  past  decade  and  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half,  which  have  said  this  is  the  constitutional  status 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  has  now.  To  the  extent  the  people  of  Puerto 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  want  to  change  it,  here  are  the  options  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  Constitution.  Tell  us  what  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want,  and  then  Congress  will  decide  where  to  go  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there. 

            

So  I  would  not  want  to  suggest  that  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result  of  this  case,  that  Puerto  Rico's  options  are  set 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  stone.  We  don't  think  that  they  are  set  in  stone. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  just  think  that  right  now  Puerto  Rico  is  a  territory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  United  States,  and  as  a  result  it's  not  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  sovereign  under  the  Double  Jeopardy  Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  just  to  give  the  court  the  three  data 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points  where  the  Court  has  said  we're  going  to  focus  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty  under  the  Constitution  and  we're  not  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  focus  on  autonomy  or  level  of  control,  you  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  v.  Shell  case  which  was  where  the  Court  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  already  has  autonomy,  but  they're  still  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  double  jeopardy  sovereign.  You  have  Waller,  which  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  municipalities  and  the  State  of  Florida  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically  treat  its  municipalities  as  a  sovereign,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  said,  no,  no,  no,  you  are  not  in  the  same

relationship  to  your  municipalities  as  the  States  are  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  government;  the  municipalities  are  more  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  territories,  there's  a  different  ultimate  source  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  And  then  the  Court,  with  respect  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian  tribes,  said  even  though  Congress  has  the  ability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  legislate  for  the  tribes,  they  still  have  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherent  source  of  authority  that  predated  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  and  was  recognized  in  the  Constitution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  for  the  Court  to  turn  away  from  that,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  would  really  upend  that  precedent,  and  not  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  reason,  because  ­­ I  think  I'd  like  to  conclude,  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  can,  where  I  started,  which  is:  This  power,  this  dual 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty  power,  is  a  weighty  power  the  Court  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserved  for  those  entities  that  have  the  ultimate  power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  our  Constitution,  defined  in  our  Constitution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  for  that  reason,  Puerto  Rico,  despite  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  self­government,  is  not  a  sovereign  under 

   

 

 

 

 

the  Constitution.

there's  two  real  questions  here,  as  the  questioning  has

brought  out.  First,  what  happened  in  1950  to  '52?  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B,  if  so,  is  that  constitutional? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's  no  question,  if  you  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents  of  1950  to  '52,  that  Congress  required  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  to  have  a  Republican  form  of  government,  which  is  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  by  the  people,  of  the  people.  This  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  at  the  time  to  be  a  new  experiment.  This  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  another  organic  act.  And  the  Constitution  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico,  which  was  approved  by  Congress  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President,  says  the  power,  the  political  power  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commonwealth  emanates  from  the  people.  And  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  that.  Okay.  So  that  goes  to  the  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened. 

            

Then  you  go  to  the  real  meat  of  the  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  the  constitutional  argument.  It  is  shocking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Respondents  and  the  United  States  government  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  are  using  the  Territorial  Clause  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restriction  on  power,  a  limitation  on  power  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government.  This  is  so  ironic,  for  exactly  what  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer  was  saying:  That  the  insular  cases,  if  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stand  for  anything,  mean  that  Congress  has  plenary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control  over  the  territories.  That  means  that  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  come  up  with  inventive  solutions  which  are  broader 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  the  only  menu  that  they  give,  which  is  a  colony 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governed  pursuant  to  direct  or  delegated  Federal  power,

statehood,  or  independence.  Where  do  they  get  this  view 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  can't  come  up  with  something  inventive  like  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commonwealth,  or  the  estado  libre  asociado,  as  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer  said?  This  is  the  genius  of  our  system,  that  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows  us  to  have  these  unincorporated  territories  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Landau,  would  you 

  

 

 

 

 

explain  what  "estado  libre  asociado"  means  in  Spanish? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  It  means  "free  associated 

  

 

 

 

 

state,"  literally,  and  again,  I  think  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Literally. 

  

 

MR.  LANDAU:  ­­ it  has  the  concept  of  free 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  has  the  concept  of  associated,  and  state,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estado. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  know  why  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  use  that  phrase  in  the  compact  with  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States? 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  I  think  they  thought  that  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  Commonwealth  was  the  more  natural  English  word. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  not  sure,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  believe,  because  I've 

    

 

 

 

seen  the  Act,  that  they  didn't  because  States  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  meaning  in  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  And  again,  we  are  certainly  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  we  are  a  State.  Again,  that  was  the  whole 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

genius  of  the  Commonwealth.  It  allows  flexibility  by

Congress  to  come  up  with  these  kind  of  creative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solutions.  So  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  Solicitor  General's 

  

 

 

 

office  claims  that  Grafton  says  that  when  we're  looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  double  jeopardy,  we're  looking  at  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  We're  looking  at  territory  versus  state.  Do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  agree  with  that  reading  of  the  Shell  case  and  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grafton? 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Absolutely  do  not  agree  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Grafton  said  that  in  any  and  all  contexts,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regardless  of  any  kind  of  territory,  it  is  invariably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  have  that  political  relationship.  Grafton  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

describing  the  particular  relationship  there,  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Governor  of  Puerto  ­­ of  the  Philippines  was  appointed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  President.  He  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  how  about  Shell? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  LANDAU:  Just  to  finish  that  one  point, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  Grafton  ­­ it  was  called  Grafton  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  because  the  Phillipine  prosecution  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  in  the  name  of  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Shell  is  exactly  the  same  thing.  The  Shell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  said  that  was  pursuant  to  an  Organic  Act,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  changed  in  the  50s  fundamentally. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm  not  just  saying  this.  This  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  in  the  whole  series  of  decisions  in  the  '70s

that  there  was  a  fundamental  transformation  and  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  represents  a  very  unique  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

experiment  in  our  history,  about  how  we  have  an
