 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 
argument next in case 07-751, Pearson v. Callahan.

 (11:08 a.m.)

 Mr. Stirba.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER STIRBA,
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. STIRBA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 At the time of the arrest in this case there 

were three different Federal circuits and two State 
courts that established it was Constitutionally 
permissible for police officers to enter a home without 
a warrant as a follow-up entry to effectuate arrest 
after an illegal drug transaction when a government 
agent had occurred and probable cause had been 
established.

 Although the rule has become known as the 
doctrine of consent once removed, and the lower courts 
have banned various rationales in support of the rule, 
the name or label is not important.  What is important 
is that the rule is predicated upon well recognized 
Fourth Amendment principles, and that at the time of the 
arrest the consent doctrine was well established in the 
lower courts as settled Fourth Amendment law.

Thus, irrespective of how this Court rules 

on the constitutionality of the rule itself, the 
Petitioner officers could have reasonably believed that 
what they were doing was lawful.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, because the 

Fourth Amendment principle of consent was well 
established?  In other words, if a police officer goes 
to the door and says "May I come in," that is -- that is 
perfectly acceptable.  Is that -- that the level of 
generality that you think we ought to analyze this issue 
at?

 MR. STIRBA:  No, certainly we think that the 

generality of just pure consent is not the level at 
which it should be determined.  In fact, that was the 
problem with the Tenth Circuit case.  But it has to 
be -- the right has to be defined in a specific clear 
way, and it has to be -- the contours of the right have 
to be sufficiently clear that police officers know that 
when they engage in the conduct, they know what they 
they're doing is unlawful.

 In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, all of the 

law that was in existing at the time of the entry was 
supportive of exactly what the police officers did.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it seems to me that 
misses the point of the case.  I mean, the point of the

case is that consent to the police was established, 
consent to police informants was not, and that when I 
consent I am not consenting to the -- to the whole 
world.  If I am consenting to somebody who is not a 
police officer, that is not equivalent to consenting to 
a police officer.  That's the point of the case; and as 
I understand it, there was -- there was only one case at 
the time that this occurred which equated the 
confidential informant for the police with the police; 
and that was the Seventh Circuit case; isn't that 
correct?

 MR. STIRBA:  Justice Souter, we are not --
we are not contending this is an implied consent case, 
although that has been a theory that has been advanced 
in the lower courts.  We believe that the way that this 
was constitutionally lawful -- this is really a Lewis 
case, and that is once you engage in some illegal 
conduct with a government agent in your home, you have 
waived any expectation of privacy.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but that -- that 

equates -- in terms of existing law, that equates the 
government agent, which in this case is not a police 
officer, but a confidential informant, with a police 
officer.  And it seems to me that is the nub of the 
case:  Is that person equivalent, so that consent to one

in effect is consent to as many police as want to come 
in, or is it not the case?  And it seems to me what you 
have got to argue here is that the confidential 
informant and the police officer for Fourth Amendment 
purposes should be treated as identical.

 MR. STIRBA:  Absolutely.  And we do -- and 

we think --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  And there is no clear law 

on that.  That's why we are here.  There's one -- at the 
time that this search was made, as I understand it, 
there was only one case which held there was such an 
equivalence, is that correct?

 MR. STIRBA:  There are two points, 

Justice Souter.  First of all, with respect to the 
lawfulness of the confidential --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, first -- I want to 
hear what you say, but tell me, is it correct that at 
that time there was one case that held the equivalence?

 MR. STIRBA:  No, Your Honor.  There actually 
-- there were actually three out of the Seventh Circuit, 
the Pollard case out of the Sixth Circuit, which 
involved a police officer and a confidential informant 
--

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Which was not a circuit 

case, right?

MR. STIRBA:  That is a circuit case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  District case?

 MR. STIRBA:  That was a circuit court case,


U.S. v. Pollard.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  So there were three circuit 

court holdings that the confidential informant was 
equivalent to a police officer?

 MR. STIRBA:  There were three out of the 
Seventh Circuit.  Paul, Diaz, and I think it's Aziano 
were all confidential information cases where the courts 
ruled squarely that there was no difference between a 
confidential informant and a police officer.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, did you -- now, do 

you have other circuits that held that?

 MR. STIRBA:  Yes, Your Honor.  The Pollard 

case involved a confidential informant --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Where is Pollard from?
 MR. STIRBA:  Sixth Circuit.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Sixth.
 MR. STIRBA:  And they cited in support the 
confidential informant cases from the Seventh Circuit. 
We also read Gramble -- this is a 2000 -- I'm sorry, a 
995 Ninth Circuit case which talked about a government 
agent, it did not draw a distinction between a 
confidential informant and a police officer -- as

supportive as well.  That's exactly what Judge Kelly 
determined in the dissenting opinion in the Tenth 
Circuit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  Now why -- why are 
they correct?  Why should the confidential informant be 
treated as equivalent to a police officer?

 MR. STIRBA:  Well, fundamentally -- and of 
course the test for Fourth Amendments purposes is the 
Skinner test -- that once you are a government agent or 
a government actor, there really is no material 
difference in terms what the confidential informant 
would do or the undercover police officer would do.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Oh, but there is an 

enormous difference between the training and the 
character of a police officer and, as this very case 
illustrates, the confidential informants are often very 
shady characters who can't be counted on to be 
truth-tellers, and have a powerful incentive to get 
someone for the police, because in most cases they are 
seeking to have their own case dealt with 
sympathetically.  So, how can you equate a police 
officer with a confidential informer, who is usually 
someone who knows where the drug house is because he's a 
dealer himself?

 MR. STIRBA:  Two points.  In our reply

brief, pages 6 and 7, we point out the wide variety of 
confidential informants.  They come in many different 
shapes and sizes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about this one? 

Wasn't this one that fits my description, the one in 
this case?

 MR. STIRBA:  This one clearly had a drug 

problem.  This one also attended college.  This one also 
was a star athlete in high school, and this one also was 
reliable in a previous drug transaction.  Moreover --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  He was trying -- and he was 

trying to make a deal to get leniency with the police.

 MR. STIRBA:  Well, there is no question 

about that.  But once again, he is a government actor. 
For purposes of Fourth Amendment liability it doesn't 
matter whether it's a police officer or a confidential 
informant, as long as he is an agent of the government, 
which clearly he was.  He was a government actor --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you -- you certainly 
cannot argue -- maybe you are, but I don't see how can 
you argue in response to Justice Ginsburg that the 
integrity to be expected from a confidential informant, 
taking that as a category of law including all sorts of 
informants, is the integrity that we would expect in a 
police officer.

MR. STIRBA:  Well, as a general proposition, 

Justice Souter, you can't make that kind of 
determination.  We point out --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why can't I?
 MR. STIRBA:  Because sometimes confidential 

informants are retired police officers; sometimes 
confidential informants are police cadets.  Sometimes 
confidential informants --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then if that -- if that is 
true, as it clearly is, they run the gamut from the good 
to the bad.  You can't make -- adopt the proposition 
categorically that confidential informants should be 
regarded as having the same integrity as a police 
officer.

 MR. STIRBA:  I wouldn't want to make that 

statement.  I don't know that it's material, though, to 
the analysis under the Fourth Amendment and whether or 
not, once you are a government agent or a government 
actor, there really is no legal significance that flows 
from that to draw a distinction between one who is 
actually employed by the police, taking a paycheck from 
the police, and one who is not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's one feature of 

this is that I think is really puzzling:  What this case 
is about is the Fourth Amendment, that requires, with

certain exceptions, the main rule is to get a warrant. 
And here you have a confidential informer going to the 
place to make sure that they really do have the goods. 
Then he goes back to the police.  He spends two hours. 
He's being wired and whatever else.  Why didn't somebody 
pick up the phone and get a warrant at that point?  The 
confidential informer could say:  "I was there and I saw 
the drugs."  What -- the whole purpose of these rules is 
to have the police get a warrant when they can.  And how 
do you explain that two hours lapse between when they 
had probable cause and when the -- when the informant 
returns for the second time?

 MR. STIRBA:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

officers testified why they didn't get a warrant, 
244-245 in the joint appendix, and 256 and 257.  Two 
problems:  One, they weren't sure the drugs were going 
to be there.  These are small amounts of drugs in a 
rural area; they dissipate very quickly.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  We're talking about 

probable cause.  If they got a warrant within an hour or 
two of the time that that informant says he saw them 
there, do you seriously question whether there would be 
probable cause?

 MR. STIRBA:  I am only going on the record 

and what these informed officers testified to.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But we're asking for the 

basis.  You're asking for a rule and our questions go to 
the reason for having that rule.  And the officers may 
have said -- and I will assume they said -- in this 
case:  Oh, gee, we weren't sure the drugs would still be 
there.  But in terms of probable cause law, that's just 
not a serious answer, is it?

 MR. STIRBA:  Well, it is.  In essence we are 
talking about an anticipatory warrant, and under U.S. v. 
Grubbs you not only need probable cause to believe that 
the drugs will be there --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  They don't even need an 

anticipatory warrant.  They need a warrant to go in and 
search that place on the grounds that there are probably 
drugs there, and if they saw drugs there a couple of 
hours beforehand and they had no affirmative evidence 
which they should bring forward under the Frank standard 
to indicate that the drugs were being taken out, is 
there any serious question that probable cause would be 
found?

 MR. STIRBA:  Justice -- Justice Souter, I 
don't believe at the time, approximately 9 o'clock in 
the evening, the police had probable cause to believe 
the drugs were there.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  An informant just came out

and said there were drugs there and they don't have 
probable cause?

 MR. STIRBA:  At the time of 9 o'clock, I 

don't think it was established that there were drugs --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why not?
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought it was 

established not only that there were drugs, but that he 
actually tasted some.

 MR. STIRBA:  He never told the police that. 

And the purpose --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But --
MR. STIRBA:  The purpose of the operation, 

of course, was to establish that there was in fact drugs 
in the house.  The transaction would occur and that 
would conclusively establish probable cause.  I don't 
think we should fault the police for essentially being 
careful before they entered the home to make sure that 
in fact they had probable cause.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  The reason the police are 
being faulted is that they didn't get a warrant.  And 
the warrant requirement is a generally good starting 
place for a Fourth Amendment argument.

 Justice Ginsburg's point is that if they had 
an informant who had seen drugs in the place within two 
hours, they had, if they'd been before a magistrate, the

basis in probable cause to get a warrant.  And I still 
haven't heard why in fact they couldn't have got one or 
why they didn't have the probable cause.

 MR. STIRBA:  Well, as I -- as I explained 

before, they believed the drugs in --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm not interested in what 
they personally believed.  We're talking about objective 
Fourth Amendment standards.  Did they or did they not 
have a basis to establish probable cause at that point?

 MR. STIRBA:  We don't believe they did, Your 
Honor.  And we don't believe they could have gotten a --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  That is --
MR. STIRBA:  -- an anticipatory warrant.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I will admit that is the 

most astonishing view of probable cause I have heard in 
this courtroom.  Of course they had.

 MR. STIRBA:  Well, the record evidence 

doesn't substantiate that, or they would have gotten --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why doesn't it?
 MR. STIRBA:  Or they would have gotten a 

warrant.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why doesn't it?  As I 

understand, the record evidence is that their informant 
was in that guy's home, and within two hours of the 
point that we went through, the second entry, he had

seen drugs.  Why wasn't there probable cause within that 
two-hour period?

 MR. STIRBA:  Because the police did not 

believe that at the time that they could have gotten a 
warrant, that the drugs would not have been dissipated. 
And they -- as they testified --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is that a reasonable 

belief?

 MR. STIRBA:  Pardon me?
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, we're talking about 

probable cause, not an establishment of mathematical 
certainty.

 MR. STIRBA:  Here's another point.  That is 

just an option, Justice Souter, the police -- if you 
believed the police could get a warrant.  They didn't 
have to get a warrant.  They obviously were engaged in a 
buy/bust operation, which eventually led to them to the 
particular position where they clearly established 
probable cause.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  They clearly would have 

been if they had sent a police officer in.  You're 
asking us to extend the police officer rule to include a 
confidential informant rule.  One reason for doing so 
is, or would be, that in practical terms there is a need 
for it.  Justice Ginsburg's question was, why is there a

need for it, when they could have gotten a warrant?  And 
we still haven't heard an answer.

 MR. STIRBA:  In rural Utah -- and this is 

page 47 of the joint appendix -- the officers testified 
that one of the reasons why they need to use 
confidential informants is because the police are all 
known.  And, therefore, if they're going to engage in 
any drug --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then why didn't they use 

the confidential informant to get a warrant?

 MR. STIRBA:  Well, I don't know how I can 

answer the question any more than I have, 
Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That doesn't --
MR. STIRBA:  They -- they chose not to, for 
reasons they didn't believe they had probable cause and 
they were concerned that the drugs had been dissipated.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, in every --
given the posture of the ultimate issue in this case on 
the underlying constitutional question, you do not have 
to prove that you are right; isn't that correct?  You 
have to establish that the contrary principle is not 
clearly established?

 MR. STIRBA:  That's correct.  And the law at 
the time that these officers engaged in this operation,

entered the home -- and once again, it was based upon 
probable cause -- supported in fact constitutionally 
what they did, and that it was indeed permissible.  And 
that was the basis upon which we believe, irrespective 
of how the Court views whether they should or should not 
have gotten a warrant and the constitutional 
implications of that, that the law was clearly not 
established sufficiently such that these officers were 
entitled to qualified immunity.  That was one of the 
problems with the Tenth Circuit case.  They --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I just establish one 
thing?  Tell me if I am wrong.  That this argument about 
consent once removed was not presented in the lower 
courts.  That is, in the trial court you argued exigent 
circumstances, and then on appeal the inevitable 
discovery rule.  So there was -- in the courts below, 
this was not given as the reason, the consent once 
removed was not alleged as the basis, as the 
justification for this search?

 MR. STIRBA:  That's true.  On the criminal 

appeal, the State did not argue Lewis, did not argue 
consent once removed.  And that is part of the problem 
with a number of cases that have been cited by the 
Respondent.  They are exigent circumstances cases where 
the consent once removed doctrine of Lewis isn't even

advocated or litigated.  We think that's very important.

 Unless the justices have any other 

questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time.

 MR. STIRBA:  Thank you.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Stewart.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The police entry in this case was 

constitutional and, in any event, did not infringe any 
constitutional right that was clearly established at the 
time the officers acted.  The mandatory order of 
decision for qualified immunity cases announced in 
Saucier v. Katz should be overruled.

 I did want to begin by clarifying the answer 
to your question, Justice Ginsburg, because I'm not sure 
if it was entirely clear.  There were really two cases 
here, one of which was the criminal prosecution of Mr. 
Callahan, the Respondent in this Court.  And the 
individual officers were not parties as to that case. 
That was handled by the State of Utah.  And you're

correct that in the criminal proceeding the consent once 
removed argument was not made.  And that led to the 
motion to suppress ultimately being granted and 
consequently Mr. Callahan was not subject to criminal 
proceedings.

 Mr. Callahan did file a civil suit against 
the individual officers who were involved in effecting 
the arrest, and in that civil proceeding the consent 
once removed argument was made all the way up.  It was 
made in the district court, and it was made in the court 
of appeals as well.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Stewart, could I follow 
up on one other thing that came up during the preceding 
argument?  Isn't the issue whether there was or was not 
probable cause quite separate from the consent once 
removed doctrine?  What -- assuming that there was 
probable cause here, there may be many instances in 
which the consent once removed doctrine would be 
applied, if it's a valid doctrine, where there wasn't 
previously probable cause.

 MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  I think the 
consent once removed doctrine would have its greatest 
utility in cases where the police suspect but don't have 
probable cause to believe that a particular individual 
is engaged in criminal activity, and so they send an

informant or an undercover police officer in to try to 
either confirm or dispel their suspicions.  They 
wouldn't be able to get a warrant at the outset because 
they would not have probable cause at that time of 
ongoing criminal conduct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if our question is 

should consent once removed be recognized as a doctrine 
that covers the confidential informant in this case, one 
question that we may sensibly ask is, is there a need to 
recognize that broad a consent doctrine?  And one 
question that would bear on that would be, in these 
cases, is there difficulty or impossibility of getting a 
warrant under normal probable cause standards?  And I 
think that was the point of Justice Ginsburg's question. 
Do you doubt that they could have gotten a warrant 
within the two-hour period?

 MR. STEWART:  We certainly think that they 

had probable cause.  There was testimony from police 
officers to the effect that magistrates in Utah would be 
reluctant to grant warrants based on these circumstances 
because of the possibility that the drugs would be 
dissipated.  I am not in a position to second-guess 
their empirical experience as to the circumstances under 
which Utah magistrates will and will not grant warrants. 
But we think as a legal matter that there was probable

cause, and that a warrant should have been issued.  But 
certainly there are -- there are plenty of 
circumstances --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's -- it's not just 
this case.  Maybe you can tell me.  I thought because 
they were dealing with a confidential informant rather 
than a police officer, they sent him in to do the dry 
run.  I mean the -- in the police officer cases usually 
the -- the undercover police officer goes in.  The other 
police officers are there ready to come in when he gives 
them the signal.  But the police officers don't 
ordinarily go through this dry run that they had here 
with the confidential informer.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, I -- I would think that 
with either police officers or with informants you could 
have some situations in which the undercover operative 
has very recently attempted to confirm the presence of 
drugs.  And you can have other cases in which the 
undercover operative, again either an informant or a 
police officer, could hear rumors on the street that a 
particular individual was engaged in drug-dealing, might 
not have probable cause, and they might decide that the 
best way to set up the operation was to send this person 
in to attempt to make a buy at a time when probable 
cause was lacking.  But they would want to arrange the

operation in such a way that if the operative's 
experience confirmed their suspicions and gave them 
probable cause to arrest, they would be able to go in 
immediately.

 And our principal contention is not that the 
consent to the entry of Bartholomew was implicit consent 
to the later entry of the police officers.  It was that 
once a person has, even unknowingly, admitted a 
government agent into his home, his expectation of 
privacy is sharply reduced and the entry of the officers 
works an insubstantial incremental invasion of privacy.

 And I would like to return to the point that 

Mr. Stirba was making.  It's true that the informant 
here lacked the training and skills that -- and 
integrity, for that matter, that you would expect a 
police officer to have.  But he was for Fourth Amendment 
purposes a government agent a State actor.  If his 
handlers had instructed him to look for an opportunity 
to rummage through the drawers --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Stewart, could I 

interrupt you, because there is something that hasn't 
been reached.  Do you think that we should answer the 
constitutional question first or the immunity question 
first?

this case should address the constitutional question 
first because it is the subject of the square circuit 
conflict, it's been briefed and argued, it's a question 
that independently warrants resolution.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It is quite difficult.  I 
mean there -- we don't know quite a lot about whether 
they would have gotten a warrant, how -- how dangerous 
it was, whether the drugs were likely to be hidden.  And 
I was thinking of it, and that's why I am saying this, 
is that it's a perfect reason since constitutional 
questions in this area are -- are like the stars in the 
sky.  There are so many.  Rather than having the judges 
answer each one and getting everything mixed up, why not 
just have them take whatever is the easier path?  As a 
judge I like to take what is the easier path.

 MR. STEWART:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And if it's easier to deal 
with the qualified immunity, deal with it and forget the 
rest of it.

 MR. STEWART:  I guess the first thing I 
would say in response to that is we think that the --
the balance or the way in which discretion will 
ordinarily be exercised will typically be different in 
the case of the lower courts than in the case of this 
Court, because the principal role of the lower Federal

courts is to decide individual cases before them usually 
in the most expeditious and noncontroversial way where 
they --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see that, but unless we 

do that here, they are never going to get the right 
message.  And so what we will have is 1,000 judges 
trying in an average in a year 50 or 60 cases each with 
multiple facts, and we will have approximately over a 
10-year period hundreds of thousands.  I've exaggerated, 
but there will be many, many -- many, many conflicts, 
many, many confusions.  And unless we say, no, we are 
not doing it ourselves, how will they ever get the 
message?

 MR. STEWART:  Well, I think they will get 

the message --

JUSTICE BREYER:  We don't always have to do 

it, but I mean once.

 MR. STEWART:  I think they will get the 

message if the Court tells them that the mandatory rule 
of Saucier is no longer in effect, that courts have 
discretion to decide based on their sound judgment 
whether it is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why isn't it -- why 

isn't it an advisory opinion, if we do not have to 
decide -- to decide the ultimate question whether this

is constitutional or not, but simply whether or not it 
was clearly established whether it was unconstitutional? 
Why isn't it purely an advisory opinion to say whether 
it's constitutional or not?

 MR. STEWART:  I mean, in one sense it's an 

advisory opinion, but in another sense there are --
there are often cases in which two alternative grounds 
for a decision are proffered, either one of which, if 
accepted, would compel a judgment in one litigant's 
favor.  And the fact that it would theoretically -- if 
the court concludes there is only --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  Those are 

different grounds, it seems to me.  Those are two 
independent, as you said.  Here it's kind of a -- it's a 
progression.  You first ask, either, under somebody's 
view, I guess, Saucier, whether or not it's 
constitutional or not and then whether it's clearly 
established.

 I just don't know why the first question 
isn't purely advisory, because you don't have to know 
whether it's constitutional or not.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, it's true that if the 
Court announced that this search was constitutional, 
that it would necessarily be saying:  And there was no 
clearly established constitutional law to the contrary

at the time the officers acted.  But the Court --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- to the question.  I 
mean, look, if I have to answer the constitutional 
question -- and what bothers me is this consent at one 
remove.  What?  You are saying a drug seller who lets in 
a disguised policeman in order to sell him a drug 
because he thinks he's a druggie is suddenly consenting 
to the entire LAPD coming into his house?  I would think 
that is the last thing he would have thought about 
wanting, not the first.

 MR. STEWART:  But that -- that would be 

equally true in the case of the undercover police 
officer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, maybe they both 

should be the same.  I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's what I wanted to 
know, and it gets back to the merits and not Saucier. 
We are going through two different things here.

 Assume this is an undercover officer, not an 

-- not a -- not an informant.  Now, the undercover 
officer sees a crime being committed, and he is ready to 
make the arrest.  Can he automatically ask for police 
assistance and -- and other policemen?  Are the police 
then entitled to come into the home in your view, or do 
there have to be some exigent circumstances?

MR. STEWART:  No.  We think he could 

automatically ask for the police to come into the home 
because the incremental intrusion on privacy by having 
several police officers rather than one to make the 
arrest would be insubstantial.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But isn't the reason it's 

insubstantial is that we have a rule for independent 
reasons having nothing necessarily to do with this kind 
of situation in which one officer's knowledge is 
regarded as another officer's knowledge.  The police are 
regarded as a group, so that we have a rule ready, in 
place, saying:  You show one, you have shown the whole 
department.

 We don't, however, have any such rule with 

respect to agents generally.

 MR. STEWART:  I think you don't have that 
precise rule, but it is nevertheless the case that the 
undercover operative here, the informant, was a State 
actor.  Had he been instructed to look in private places 
without consent, his conduct would have constituted a 
Fourth Amendment violation because he would have been 
regarded for that purpose as -- as an agent of the 
State, and he should, therefore, be regarded as a State 
agent for these purposes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just -- just to be clear,

if -- if I may, I know your red light is on:  Your 
position is if an undercover officer is in the premises 
and sees a crime being committed, he automatically can 
invite police in to assist him in making an arrest 
without exigent circumstances?

 MR. STEWART:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's -- what do I read? 

What authority do you cite me for that proposition?

 MR. STEWART:  I don't think this -- this 
Court has ever squarely so held.  I believe that the 
Respondents concede that because they don't take issue 
with the fact that consent once removed is applicable 
when the person already inside is an undercover police 
officer.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE P. METZLER, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. METZLER:  Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 This is a case about consent.  By consenting 

to the entry of a confidential informant, that Mr. 
Callahan consented to the entry of police.

 The answer is no, and no reasonable officer 

could have believed otherwise.

This Court has long held that it is 

presumptively unreasonable for police to enter a home 
without consent or exigent circumstances or a warrant. 
Here there were no exigent circumstances; there was no 
warrant, nor was there any consent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  YOU -- was Mr. 

Stewart correct that you concede that if this person 
entering the house were in fact a police officer, that 
this would have been okay?

 MR. METZLER:  No, Your Honor.  We think it's 

a closer case, but if it is a -- if this confidential 
informant had been a police officer, it would be the 
same analysis.  There is no exigent circumstance here; 
there is no consent.  And -- and the consent to be 
competent to the police officer in your case would not 
extend to the police officer in your case would not 
extend to the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you would agree he 
could make the -- the arrest by himself.  Assuming he 
was a police officer --

MR. METZLER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- he could make the 

arrest by himself.

himself.  But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- and -- but you are 
saying he can't ask for assistance to make that arrest 
effective in all cases.  There has to be some exigent 
circumstance.

 MR. METZLER:  Correct.  If -- if there are 
some sort of exigent circumstances, in this case they 
would plan that in advance; and police are not allowed 
to create their own exigency to get around the Fourth 
Amendment.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You are advocating a rule 

that is going to get police officers killed, aren't they 
-- aren't you?  If an undercover police officer is in a 
house making drug buy, and you want to say that the 
single officer who is there in an undercover capacity 
can say, "You guys are all under arrest," he can't 
signal for other police officers to come in and help him 
effect the arrest without anybody being killed?

 MR. METZLER:  Of course, the safest thing 

for him would be to simply withdraw, get on the 
telephone, and get a warrant to come back in, or during 
the two hours that they were planning this entry he 
could have gotten a warrant then or an anticipatory 
warrant.  There are plenty of stated options.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it seems to me that 

in the case that Justice Alito put, that there are

exigent circumstances.

 MR. METZLER:  Well, to the extent they 

planned it in advance, and the basis of their entry --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that -- that's a 

different point and I have some question about that.  It 
seems to me the police are never quite sure exactly 
what's going to happen.

 MR. METZLER:  Well, if they -- if they 

planned on an exigent circumstance as being the reason 
that they are allowed to go in, under this Court's 
decision -- the long line of decisions in Payton and 
Steagald saying exigent circumstances or consent are the 
way to get in without a warrant, then it would not be 
permissible.  If --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Imagining -- you are 

imagining different cases.  We can imagine a spectrum of 
cases.  In some cases the policeman or the confidential 
informant will be there, and he really couldn't have 
gotten a -- a thing in advance -- a warrant in advance. 
It wasn't certain, and they are in there and they see a 
lot of drug behavior going on, and the drugs are going 
to be hidden, go, disappear the second he leaves; and if 
he tries to arrest them, everybody is going to jump on 
him and kill him.  Okay?

 So there are a lot of cases just like this

one, but with a few changes, which are -- he needs to 
call the police, and there will be others where he 
doesn't.

 So that's why I am so uncertain about what 

it is we are deciding here on the merits.  We would have 
to say on the merits this is a case where there are no 
exigent circumstances.  Can we say that?  I -- would not 
want to "never are there."

 MR. METZLER:  I think certainly in this case 
there were not exigent circumstances.  The informant was 
on his way out the door.  He -- he wasn't attempting to 
make an arrest.  No one thought that the -- that Mr. 
Callahan would destroy the drugs or that anyone would 
leave.  In fact, the Petitioners abandoned exigent 
circumstances in the court of appeal.  So I think you 
can decide this case on the merits, as there were no 
exigent circumstances.  And then ask, is it reasonable 
to think that because there was an informant inside and 
because he sent out a signal that there was probable 
cause, a drug transaction had happened inside the house, 
does that make any difference whatsoever as to whether 
there was consent?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a tough -- at 

least I find it a very difficult question.  I do not 
find it necessarily a terribly difficult question

whether that -- whatever the answer is -- whether it was 
clearly established, precisely because I find the 
underlying questions difficult.  So you have a handful 
Court of Appeals decisions, you have got a factual 
variation; the issue is whether to extend the police 
coming in to a confidential informant, all of those 
questions are very difficult; but precisely because they 
are, it doesn't seem that the rule, whichever rule is 
adopted, is clearly established.

 Why don't -- and yet if I were on the lower 
court of appeals, you would say -- or Saucier would say, 
I have got to decide that very difficult constitutional 
question and then decide what's a very easy qualified 
immunity question.  Does that -- why does that make 
sense?

 MR. METZLER:  With respect, 

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it's a difficult 
question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know you 

don't because you are arguing one side of it.

granting cert on one.  Why shouldn't the lower courts 
have the same luxury?

 MR. METZLER:  Well, with regard to the 

Saucier question, we think the Court should keep the 
Saucier question, and particularly in this case where 
there is a circuit split, the court should decide the 
constitutional question and not move on to the clearly 
established question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why, because we need 

to provide guidance on that question?

 MR. METZLER:  Yes.

it can't come up any other way?

against the political subdivision, right?  You could 
have sued some other political entity other than the 
officers individually, right?

 MR. METZLER:  Certainly.  Mr. Callahan did 

sue the county in this case.  But --

rights are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that was 

my question.  There are other ways for the law to 
develop.  The issue can come up on merits in the suit 
against the municipality which doesn't raise the 
qualified immunity question.  If you come up -- if you 
have a search where a person sues to get whatever was 
seized back.  You know, if there's a -- and also the 
option is, if the question of which order want to

 I -- I'm just wondering what benefit there 

is in an absolute rigid rule that courts of appeals -- I 
had a few of these cases in courts of appeals; I thought 
it was very odd that I had to go and decide a difficult 
constitutional issue and then not worry about it because 
in one sentence you say well, but the issue is not 
clearly established and so it's qualified immunity.

 MR. METZLER:  Well, that would take us to 

back before Saucier, the Court -- it's a recent decision 
that hasn't been proven to be workable.  And in fact --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but my point 

though is that at least in my experience it was 
unworkable, or at least frustrating, in that we had to 
decide not just a factual question but a constitutional 
question in a context where it wasn't necessary.

 MR. METZLER:  Well, it depends on your view 
of necessity.  In some cases certainly, it won't really 
come up in other contexts and the law is not established 
in section 1983; it may never be established.  But here 
we are talking about a question where there is a circuit 
split and the Court definitely should provide guidance 
to the lower courts.  I don't think that --

that there is a circuit split almost by definition mean 
that it's not clearly established?

 MR. METZLER:  Well, this Court has looked to 

controlling -- its own precedents and controlling 
circuit law to decide what is -- what law is clearly 
established, and here, Payton and Steagald the courts 
held that there is a bright-line rule that's very simple 
for police officers, it's easy for them to understand.

 If they would like to enter without a 

warrant and they don't have exigent circumstances and 
they don't have consent, then it is presumptively 
unconstitutional.  And it's a good rule and an easy rule 
and it's also why this is not a difficult constitutional 
question.  There are no exigent circumstances in this 
case, and no reasonable officer could conclude that the 
presence of a confidential informant in the house means 
there is consent to the police officer.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if -- what if the 
officers in this case had read the Seventh Circuit 
decision, and they said these are judges on the United 
States Court of Appeals, and they think this is 
consistent with the Fourth Amendment?  And what's more, 
one of these is written -- one of these opinions is 
written by Judge Posner, and he's the smartest man in 
the world --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  He knows everything there is 

to know about law and economics and jurisprudence and 
literature and many other subjects.

 (Laughter).
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it unreasonable for them 

to follow that?

 MR. METZLER:  Well, I think the officers in 

the Tenth Circuit need to be aware the way that our 
Federal court system works, and the Seventh Circuit 
decision isn't binding on the Tenth Circuit.  And with 
all due respect to Judge Posner, he dropped ball on this 
one.  He says this -- this is a the case where -- it's 
the United States v Paul -- there are no exigent 
circumstances; the officers there could have gotten a 
warrant and in fact should have gotten a warrant but he 
said it was justified by consent.  He's saying that 
consent to one person is consent to many.  And this 
Court's cases have said that consent is based on 
ordinary social expectation.  When you let one person 
into your house, you just don't let in the whole world.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If the Tenth Circuit 
says this is not allowed, and every other circuit since 
the Tenth Circuit's decision has held that it is, is 
that clearly established that it's not allowed in the

Tenth Circuit?

 MR. METZLER:  Yes.  I think certainly an 
officer in the Tenth Circuit would be bound to follow 
the Tenth Circuit rule.  I mean, it's not irrelevant 
that other -- that other courts have decided it 
differently, but to the extent that there is controlling 
law in the circuit, I think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Then it is 

irrelevant.  Then it is irrelevant that ten other 
circuits have decided it differently.

 MR. METZLER:  Well, that very well might 

wind up in this Court if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, right, but do 
the police officers get to decide that?  Do they get to 
decide that not only Judge Posner thinks this, but ten 
other circuits think this, and it has been five years 
since the Tenth Circuit.  I mean, do they have to go 
through that type of analysis?

 MR. METZLER:  Well, we don't expect officers 

to survey the entire case law and come up with a law 
professor's view of whether this is reasonable or not. 
We expect them to follow the clearly -- the bright lines 
that this Court has set down and that are set down in 
their home jurisdictions.  And if their home 
jurisdiction says it's unconstitutional it's not

reasonable for them to follow some out-of-circuit 
decision.  If, for instance, the Seventh Circuit had 
said that a warrantless home entry is okay so long as 
the officer had breakfast in the last half-hour, that's 
an unreasonable rule, and it wouldn't be reasonable for 
any officer to follow that.  And the facts here are 
about as relevant to consent as to whether there was --
the officer had breakfast that morning.

 So the officers here are not entitled to 
qualify -- nor can they rely on the Seventh Circuit. 
The Petitioners have not given you any reason to adopt a 
new exception here.  They say this is based on a waiver 
theory or that it's a private search or that it is 
incident to arrest.  But all of those ignore the 
substantial interest in the sanctity of the home.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do any of the other 

cases involve -- the other circuit cases involve 
confidential informants as opposed to police officers?

 MR. METZLER:  Other than the Seventh 

Circuit?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
 MR. METZLER:  The -- one case in the Sixth 
Circuit there was both a confidential informant and a 
police officer were admitted.  And then there's a later 
case in the Sixth Circuit that did say this is okay for

it, which came after this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So at the time every 
circuit other than the -- you know, if there is a police 
officer and a confidential informant, I think that could 
be considered a police officer because he is going to 
call the police in -- every court of appeals decision 
involving a confidential informant said it was okay.

 MR. METZLER:  Actually we have cited three 

circuits where these same facts happened.  In the Eighth 
Circuit, the First Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And in those 

circuits, did the court focus on the distinction between 
the police officer and the confidential informant?

 MR. METZLER:  Well, no.  The court looked to 

whether there were exigent circumstances or consent. 
The courts followed this Court's decision in Payton and 
Bramble and that line of cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you believe 

that -- what is the appropriate level of generality to 
look at in addressing this question, a case involving a 
confidential informant?

 MR. METZLER:  I think the appropriate level 
of generality is that the facts under the court -- the 
court has covered the field when it comes to warrantless 
home entries.  If you have a warrant, you are okay.  If

you have exigent circumstances, you are okay.  And if 
you have consent, you are okay.  Everything else is 
presumptively unconstitutional.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is that?
 MR. METZLER:  That's a good question.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why isn't it that 

the issue hasn't come up, this question of a 
confidential informant is one that hasn't come up?  Why 
would we say that is presumptively unconstitutional?

 MR. METZLER:  Well, the Court's language is 
presumptively unconstitutional has said that many times.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You are talking about the 

main role of police is get a warrant, except -- and I 
think the Court has said a number of times to make this 
search reasonable, the police have to get a warrant if 
you want to interject the judicial between police and 
the person in jeopardy.  So the main rule is warrant 
unless -- and then you have exceptions, but I think your 
point is that there is a main rule.

 MR. METZLER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This Court has gotten 

from the Constitution?

 MR. METZLER:  Yes.

a situation where the exigent circumstances are the 
creation of the scenario that the police have set up, 
the police cannot -- and you have a police officer who 
is being the undercover operative who has the power to 
make an arrest, that police officer cannot signal for 
other officers to come in and assist with the arrest?
 MR. METZLER:  Well, our position is that 

would be -- the additional officer entry would violate 
the Constitution --

JUSTICE ALITO:  The additional officers 

would -- that would violate the Fourth Amendment?

 MR. METZLER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Even if there is an officer 

safety problem there?

 MR. METZLER:  Well, to the extent that they 

have created an officer safety problem, obviously the 
officers are going to go in to help him, no one is going 
to get hurt.  But the additional officer's entry can 
violate the Fourth Amendment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the police say, you 

know, we made a mistake.  We should have had a warrant, 
but we have our man in there now, we have got to do 
something.  The police cannot send assistance?

 MR. METZLER:  No, of course, they can send 

assistance.  And they probably --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  You say they have 

created the exigent circumstances.

 MR. METZLER:  Yes, they have, which is why 
the additional officer's entry would violate the Fourth 
Amendment.  Now, there might be limited --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so my first 

statement was correct.  It's illegal for the police to 
send their assistance, the other officers in?

 MR. METZLER:  Yes, my answer was as a 

practical matter no -- no police officer is going to 
leave, even if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but then he is 

going to get sued.

 MR. METZLER:  He very well may get sued and 

there are questions of fact as to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you say as a practical 
matter we have to say that under the Constitution we can 
endanger -- we must endanger the officer?

 MR. METZLER:  Well, I disagree that the 

officer could be in danger --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  The hypothetical 
is that they have to send people in to assist him.  But 
the hypothetical also is they should have anticipated 
this, and therefore, in your words, they created exigent 
circumstances.

MR. METZLER:  They did create the exigent

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that 

dilemma and that paradox casts considerable doubt on 
your proposition that if the police create the exigent 
circumstances, they cannot rely on it.  I seriously 
question that proposition.

 MR. METZLER:  Even if -- even if you 
disagree with me on that, it shouldn't make any 
difference in this case where there was no exigent 
circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  I want to talk 

about the general rule.

 MR. METZLER:  Okay.  Well, the general --

never mind --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want us to write an 
opinion saying that any time police create the exigent 
circumstances, they can't rely on them if they had had 
the time to get a warrant.  And I find that a dangerous 
rule.

 MR. METZLER:  I don't think you would need 

to to write the opinion that would say that, because 
exigent circumstances are not in this case.

adopted the positions that for purposes of establishing 
probable cause, the knowledge of one police officer is 
also the knowledge of all police officers, at least 
within a department or working on a particular problem. 
So that if in a case in which there is a search without 
a warrant, if you add up everything that individual 
officers knew and that amounts to probable cause, then 
the search is good.

 Why don't we apply, in effect, the same rule 
in the hypothetical case that you have been given, which 
is a police officer who was admitted by consent and 
there are other police officers outside.  At the point 
at which the police officer who has been admitted has 
the knowledge necessary for an arrest and has that 
knowledge as a result of the invitation and the waiver 
of privacy as to him, why don't we regard that on sort 
of general doctrinal grounds as a waiver of privacy with 
respect to the police in general, just as we regard 
police knowledge as being imputed to all police 
officers?

 That way you don't have the problem that, 

for example, Justice Kennedy's hypo raises, even in the 
case of exigent circumstances.  But it doesn't open the 
door to what you were objecting to here.  Why isn't that 
a proper solution or proper answer to this hypo?

MR. METZLER:  Well, if you are to adopt that 

sort of -- I think you certainly could adopt that 
rationale.  But I don't think the way to get there is 
through a waiver, because real there's nothing that the 
person -- the suspect has done that he knows about that 
would mean that he waived the expectation that 
additional people would come in.  There might be --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, you are absolutely 

right in terms of his psychological process, the only 
person he has invited in is the one person.  The reason 
for coming up with the answer I suggested is a broader 
doctrinal reason.  That is the reason that we have for 
probable cause purposes regarded the police -- or the 
knowledge of one police officer as the knowledge for 
all.

 Why don't we, for the same reasons, since it 

is privacy that is at stake in all of these cases, 
regard the invitation of one police officer as the 
invitation of all, or to all?

 MR. METZLER:  Again, I don't think that the 
way to get there is through consent.  If you want it to 
balance and say, well, the government has an agent in 
there who is making the arrest and there is safety 
concerns and other reasons why we would want to do that, 
that might be one way to get there.  I don't think it's

through consent.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  It would be consent to one 
officer plus a doctrinal basis to construe that consent 
for Fourth Amendment purposes as a broader consent.

 MR. METZLER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That's what we would be 

doing.  We wouldn't be doing it because the individual 
in the trailer says I am inviting in the whole L.A. 
police department.  We are doing it because he invites 
one L.A. police officer in, and we have doctrinal basis 
for regarding the police, as it were, collectively 
rather than individually for probable cause purposes 
when privacy is at stake.

 MR. METZLER:  That would be -- that would 

certainly be a basis to allow for police officers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Would it not open the door 

to, I guess, to what you are objecting to?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would probable cause 
solve the problem at all?  There is clearly probable 
cause here.  They are listening to what goes on.  So 
they're -- do you dispute that when they hear that the 
drug transaction is taking place, that they lack 
probable cause?

 MR. METZLER:  No, I think they do have 
probable cause.  But in Payton, the Court said that

police officers who are outside who have probable cause 
need more than probable cause to get inside.  They need 
a warrant, exigent circumstances.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.  I think I may have 

created this problem for you and -- and maybe I -- I 
should get you out of it.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm not suggesting that the 

probable cause rule is what is operative here.  I'm 
saying that for probable cause purposes we regard the 
police collectively, and why, since our privacy is at 
stake there and is at stake here -- why shouldn't we 
have a collective consent rule, too?

 MR. METZLER:  You certainly could --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  That -- that's my proposal.
 MR. METZLER:  You certainly could adopt that 

rule, and that would be a -- an additional reason for 
police to enter beyond what has been thus far 
established by this Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you decide 

whether the confidential informant should be considered 
an employee of the police?  Let's say this is the tenth 
undercover operation he has engaged in.  They give him 
$100 after every undercover operation.  I mean, is he an 
employee of the police department?

MR. METZLER:  I don't think his employment 

status is -- is what is at issue.  The question is 
whether he is an agent of the state for the purpose that 
he is inside -- for the purposes of making an arrest of 
the person inside the home.

 Here the confidential informant, all he is 
really doing is acting as a surveillance device.  He is 
telling the officers outside what is happening inside. 
And he gives them probable cause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why doesn't -- that 

doesn't make him an agent of the police?

 MR. METZLER:  No, I don't think so.  He 
might be an agent for some purposes but he is not an 
agent for purposes of making an arrest inside, which is 
what they want to do.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What is it there is a State 

statute that says that confidential informants may be 
designated by the police department to assist in making 
arrests?

 MR. METZLER:  If there was some assist to 

making an arrest -- of the government, then assuming we 
are following Justice Souter's few exceptions, then I 
think that they would fall into that exception.  But 
here, of course, the confidential informant is no such 
thing.  This confidential informant was not active

politically.  He wasn't making an arrest.  There was 
no --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He wasn't acting on 

his own.  He was acting for the police.  He didn't 
decide I'm going to do this and -- because you know, I 
want to do it, and it just so happens the police are 
involved as well.

 MR. METZLER:  Well, that's true.  He was 
acting with the police but he wasn't acting for the 
police.  And nothing that the -- that the confidential 
informant did inside, even if attributed to the police, 
would give police the right to cross that threshold.  If 
this confidential informant were a police officer, I 
think you would have to base it on the power of the 
police to make the arrest inside, the power of the State 
to make that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even if there is such a 
thing as citizen's arrest, I think it was part of this 
record that -- that they do not want confidential 
informers to go making arrests, so that the police 
distinguish the confidential informer.

 MR. METZLER:  That's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg.  Both the Solicitor General and the 
Petitioners agree that confidential informants should 
not and would not be making these arrests.  So the

function of the confidential informant is really as I 
said, just a surveillance device; and what is important 
is not what he is doing but what the police are doing 
who are outside.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But going back to why 

should we decide this question, particularly in Fourth 
Amendment cases when these issues will come up on 
suppression motions, so there isn't a need to decide 
them in the -- in the civil context.

 MR. METZLER:  But I think in general we are 
talking about a very small category of cases like this 
one where their -- the criminal defendant won on the 
Fourth Amendment and then the police bring up some new 
argument on a qualified immunity defense because there 
would already be some law on the questions that were 
decided in the -- in the criminal case.

 So in those limited circumstances it seems 
to put too much of a thumb on the scale on the side of 
police that says well, you can come up with a new theory 
and you don't even have to show that it applies; all you 
have to show is that nobody has ever rejected your 
theory and then it is not fairly established.  I don't 
think in that small number of cases that the balance 
should really tilt that far towards police.  And here, 
here it's certainly not, where the Solicitor General and

the Petitioners both agree that the Court should decide 
both questions.

 The constitutional question here is not very 
difficult.  It boils down to, in the absence of exigent 
circumstances, could any reasonable officer have 
believed that the two circumstances they would like to 
see in previous cases -- that is, that a confidential 
informant is inside, and that he sends a signal out that 
there is probable cause -- do those make any difference 
whatsoever to the calculation of whether there are 
exigent circumstances or consent?  The answer is no and 
no reasonable officer could have believed otherwise.  If 
there are no further questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Stirba, you have three minutes

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY PETER STIRBA,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. STIRBA:  The colloquy about the safety 
concerns when the officer or the confidential informer 
are in the home I think highlight why the distinction 
between a confidential informant and the officer really 
doesn't make much meaningful headway in terms of the 
Fourth Amendment.  Obviously if the police officer was 
acting under cover in this particular situation he would

not have announced -- there were three arrestees who 
were actually in the premises at the time of the 
follow-up entry.  He would not have said after the drug 
transaction occurred "oh, by the way, I'm a police 
officer, I'm here to arrest you," for obvious reasons 
connoting safety and other issues which would have been 
attendant to them.

 Similarly the confidential informant isn't 

going to do that, either, for the same particular 
problem, even if the confidential informant had arrested 
powers under State law.  The issue is the police officer 
can call up for backup and assistance to effectuate 
arrest, which is specifically what occurred here. 
Similarly, there is no really distinction to be drawn 
between a confidential informant as a government actor 
allowing for the additional entry or follow-up entry of 
additional officers for backup and assistance to make 
sure the arrest is safe and secure than if you have a 
police officer.

 The second point I would like to make is the 

first time any Federal circuit drew this distinction 
between a confidential informant and a police officer 
was the Tenth Circuit decision.  They adopted consent 
once removed.  They just limited it to a police officer. 
Obviously the police officers involved in this case

could not reasonably be expected to anticipate such a 
distinction being drawn, especially given the fact that 
there was at least a Seventh Circuit body of law, the 
Sixth Circuit body of law, and as we argue, which we 
think is a fair reading of Gramble -- because they cite 
the Seventh Circuit body of law that includes the 
confidential informant -- there were at least three 
circuits that rejected that distinction, and you in 2000 
confirmed that in the Sixth Circuit there is no 
distinction as a matter of this particular doctrine 
between a confidential informant and a police officer.

 And finally with respect to the exigent 

circumstances cases, and you can look at any one that 
was cited by the Respondent, there is no mention of 
Lewis, there is no mention of consent once removed, 
there is no mention of any abrogation of privacy.  Those 
issues were not raised, just like the issues were not 
raised in the criminal appeal of Mr. Callahan's 
conviction; and so therefore they are really not 
relevant, they are not probative, and we are not 
suggesting this is an exigent circumstances case, nor 
are we suggest relying on for purposes of the Fourth 
Amendment issue any implied consent.

 We have rested our -- the justification for 
the Fourth Amendment issue on search incident and also
