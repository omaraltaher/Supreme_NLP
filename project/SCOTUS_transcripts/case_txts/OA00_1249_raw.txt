CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 00-1249, Caren Cronk Thomas and Windy City


Hemp Development Board v. the Chicago Park District.


Mr. Wilson.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. WILSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. WILSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court,in the unanimous opinion in Freedman


versus Maryland this court stated that when the government


imposes a permit requirement on the exercise of free


speech, that permit scheme must include certain procedural


safeguards which are there, quite obviously, to prevent


the unwarranted and perhaps unlawful delay or suppression


of speech that might occur without them.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, Freedman was a


quite different case from the present one. You agree with


that, don t you? I mean, there you re talking about some


form of censorship. Here you re talking about a permit to


use a park that a lot of other people want to use.


MR. WILSON: While agree that there s a


difference between the two cases,this case begs for more


protection than the speech involved in Freedman. Because


after all, the Freedman case was specifically -

specifically arose from a censorship scheme which was


aimed at sexually explicit speech. This is a case


involving core political speech. And although the -


QUESTION: Well is this content neutral in your


view, the regulation?


MR. WILSON: I believe that the regulation in


this case is content neutral. It is rife with the


opportunity to make viewpoint based decision, but not on


its face.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I have to say that


thinking about the case, I suppose analytically this is a


prior restraint. And we have said that there s a heavy


presumption within validity. But on the other hand, it s a


content based time, place and manner regulation, and we


have sustained these in case after case, and you want to


make this a Freedman case.


Freedman was a case where you had to submit your


speech to prior examination, prior submission of speech,


and it was in that context, and the Court was very clear,


as I recall, in Freedman to say when -- there must be


prior submission of speech, then you have to have the


procedures Freedman set forth, so I think you're really


stretching our precedents, particularly Freedman, to put


Freedman in your case.


It's true you may have some other arguments, if

there were some content-based suppression going on, but


this isn't a Freedman case.  Our authorities just don't


allow us to make that leap.


MR. WILSON:  Justice Kennedy, with respect, I


could not disagree with you more, and I think we can look


at a few cases to show that this is surely a prior


restraint case, and the one that comes to mind most


readily is where that exact same question was presented to


this Court when, in FW/PBS v. The City of Dallas, the


Fifth Circuit had held that the Dallas licensing scheme,


which was content-neutral, period, in all regards, which a


content-neutral licensing scheme licensing sexually


oriented business in Dallas, was a time, place, and manner


restriction, and this Court rejected that approach and


said, first we find that it is an unlawful prior


restraint, and therefore it is --


QUESTION:  Well, I think your premise may be one


that we're going to have trouble adopting.  This is use of


a public park.  It is limited in terms of size and space,


and presumably there may well be competing interests


trying to use the park at the very same time, when it


can't accommodate every possible use at all times.  Now,


is there no way that the park can attempt to find rules of


the game so that everybody gets accommodated?


MR. WILSON:  Justice O'Connor, there's no

indication in this record or in any situation that I'm


aware of --


QUESTION:  But just answer whether that is


possible, under First Amendment time, place, and manner


doctrine.  Yes, it's public space, and yes, it is


political speech, but is it a possible time, place, and


manner regulation to say a group of 300 wants to use it


Tuesday, and a second group of 600 wants to use it


Tuesday, we have to sort out who gets it and when?  Is


that not possible?


MR. WILSON:  Certainly, Justice O'Connor, that's


possible.  What we complain about is when the Government


can say, we will decide who gets to use the park,


particularly when the scheme is such, when it lacks the


kind of standards required that the Government can make


that choice improperly.


QUESTION:  But aren't you --


QUESTION:  Under the standards there was a list


of 13, and they seem to be reasonable, fairly clear


standards, and you are coming to us with a facial


challenge, and are we to project that those standards will


not work properly?  You're not coming to us with any


concrete case.


MR. WILSON:  Justice Ginsburg, the record in


this instance is a solid, concrete case.  Mr. McDonald was

denied his right to core political speech using those


standards.


QUESTION:  And then he was granted it, as I


understand it.


MR. WILSON:  Mr. McDonald never received a


permit.  From the time he filed this application for


permit --


QUESTION:  He did conduct his expression.


MR. WILSON:  He was allowed to conduct a


spontaneous rally on a very limited basis.  No sound


system was allowed.  No vendors were allowed, no stage, no


structures.


QUESTION:  What about, in the list that we have


are functions that were being held at the park.  One of


the permitted events was -- it may not have been


Mr. McDonald.  He may not have been with us any more, but


it was for the same organization, was it not?


MR. WILSON:  One of the events in the lodging


material?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. WILSON:  Yes, that is true.  Those have not


been obtained without great difficulty, however.  Indeed,


the brief of the Chicago Park District indicates that the


permit for the event for this fall was granted.  The park


district filed that brief before the organization was

notified that somehow the park district had lost that


application and the permit therefore was not valid, and


they'd have to go some place else.


QUESTION:  In any --


QUESTION:  Well, still the point remains that I


just think you overstate the case when you tell us this is


a Freedman case.  Justice O'Connor gave you the simplest


time, place, and manner regulation that's content-neutral,


if there are two groups that want a use a space that hold


100 and they're each 100, do you have to sort out the two. 


That is not a Freedman case.  Sure, I suppose if you push


us to the wall it's a prior restraint.  Of course there


are cases that say that prior restraints have a heavy


burden.


But we have sustained in countless cases


content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations for


the use of parks and those are not Freedman cases, period,


as I read the cases.  Now --


MR. WILSON:  Justice Kennedy, I think clearly


it's a prior restraint.  I mean, there are two --


QUESTION:  Well, I happen to disagree with


Justice Kennedy's suggestion.  I think you just have to


strain all over the case to find that this is a prior


restraint.  It's public property, and you're just standing


in line with a bunch of other people to get the use of it.

 MR. WILSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, from Neer v.


Minnesota forward, the Court has said that when speech is


prohibited in advance, that is a prior restraint.


QUESTION:  Okay, but Neer was the shutting down


of a, padlocking of a newspaper --


MR. WILSON:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- of a private -- the shoe is on the


other foot here.  Nobody is telling your client he can't


run a printing press in a private place.  What -- your


client is coming and saying, we want to use this public


park that a lot of other people want to use, and to say


that you're going to have to get in line and obey some


rules, it doesn't come close to being a prior restraint.


MR. WILSON:  My problem with that, Mr. Chief


Justice, is not that you have to get in line with other


people and share the use of the park, which was Justice


O'Connor's concern when she posed the time, place, and


manner question.


My complaint is that the way this scheme is set


up, it allows the park district to choose which people in


that line can come forward and get their pass to speak,


and which people in that line --


QUESTION:  Do you think the language of, may


grant, is something that allows too much discretion?  Is


that your complaint?

 MR. WILSON:  It is one of our complaints, and


even that --


QUESTION:  Or do we read may as shall grant, if


these conditions are met?


MR. WILSON:  Well, it says --


QUESTION:  I don't know what it means.


MR. WILSON:  It says may deny, is what it says.


QUESTION:  It says may deny, but maybe it


mean -- means that the permit must be granted if the


categories are met.


MR. WILSON:  But that's not what it says,


Justice O'Connor.  Indeed, the Seventh Circuit recognized


that the use of the word, may in this scheme creates the


potential --


QUESTION:  You agree it must be granted if


conditions are met.  You just say, it need not be denied


if the conditions are not met.  That's your complaint,


isn't it?


MR. WILSON:  Correct.


QUESTION:  You agree that if the conditions are


met, your client meets all the conditions, he gets in.


MR. WILSON:  I agree with that, Justice Scalia. 


What I --


QUESTION:  Okay.  You're saying if your client


doesn't meet some of the conditions, he may not be allowed

in, whereas somebody that the park district likes more


will be allowed in.


MR. WILSON:  Yes, Justice.


QUESTION:  That same thing was true, wasn't it,


in Poulos? I mean, the language in Poulos was even more


protean than the language in the may phrase.


MR. WILSON:  I think Poulos would have been


decided differently by this Court had the --


QUESTION:  So we've got to overrule it to hold


your way.


MR. WILSON:  Yes.  Had the -- had your court,


the supreme court of New Hampshire, not construed that


statute in such a limiting way to say that if you apply


for a permit under Poulos and under Cox you get the


permit, there was no discretion to deny, and in the


opinion that this Court wrote in Poulos, it pointed that


out, that that cured the problem in that case, and I think


realistically this Court has recognized the --


QUESTION:  But wasn't the discretion left the


same discretion, in effect, to evaluate facts, and to act


based upon that evaluation which the Chicago scheme


allowed Chicago?


MR. WILSON:  My understanding of that case is


that after the construction the New Hampshire court placed


on it, that became part and parcel of the statute, and

even though the statute retained the discretion, it had


authoritatively been limited by the New Hampshire supreme


court, so the discretion was gone by judicial act and not


by legislative change.


QUESTION:  The discretion was gone to deny


somebody who met the conditions?


MR. WILSON:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  But there -- was there no discretion


to grant someone who did not meet the conditions?  Did the


New Hampshire supreme court speak to that?


MR. WILSON:  Well, the interesting --


QUESTION:  It's the latter that you're


complaining about, not the former.


MR. WILSON:  It is the latter.  By the way,


Justice Scalia, there's another aspect of your inquiry,


and we both agree, obviously, that if you meet the


qualifications, you're entitled to the permit.  It goes no


further.  In this case, however, it is very difficult, if


not impossible, to show that you meet the qualifications


because of the behind-closed-doors way that this permit


scheme is imposed and implemented, and this case presents


the perfect example.


As the Court knows from the record in this case,


Mr. McDonald vehemently and categorically denied that he


had done those things which under the code would deny him

a permit, but that made no difference.  Not only did the


park district say that as far as we are concerned you did


it, and you are not entitled to speak, that prevents you,


in our opinion, from ever speaking in a park for the rest


of your life, and anyone associated with you.


QUESTION:  But that didn't happen, and you


say -- you give us this one instance.  You don't have a


record of uneven applications, and beyond that, I would


really like to know what is your idea of a scheme that


would be compatible with the First Amendment.


In answer to Justice O'Connor you said yes, they


can have rules of the road, so there aren't too many


people at any time, that there aren't colliding events. 


What scheme do you say is necessary to meet the First


Amendment?


MR. WILSON:  First, in direct answer to Justice


O'Connor's inquiry, a scheme that says you may not obtain


a permit for an event at a day and time for which another


permit has already been issued, no question.  There's no


complaint that anyone could have.


QUESTION:  Well, of course, that assumes that


you have a permit scheme, so it doesn't work.


MR. WILSON:  I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.


QUESTION:  That assumes that you can have a


permit scheme.

 MR. WILSON:  Surely you can have a permit


scheme.  I think this Court has made it very clear you can


have a --


QUESTION:  Well, that's what we're asking, what


the requisites are for the permit scheme.


MR. WILSON:  The question may well be, when can


you lawfully deny a permit for free speech under this --


under a permit scheme in what is the traditional public


forum, a public park, and what is the most precious of


speech, core political speech.


QUESTION:  Well, you're saying the most precious


speech.  Are you suggesting that if, say, somebody wanted


to have a softball game in the park and they applied, and


your client wanted to have a speech in the park, and he


applied, that your client should be given some sort of a


preference over the softball game because it's free


speech, or --


MR. WILSON:  No.


QUESTION:  -- core speech?


MR. WILSON:  No, Mr. Chief Justice.  I am saying


that if that softball game had a permit, the free speech


event would have to take place at another day, at another


time, or at another location.


QUESTION:  But they're both before the board.  I


mean, you say, first come, first serve, is that it, there

has to be that rule, too, if --


MR. WILSON:  It would seem --


QUESTION:  You're positing a situation in which


somebody has already been granted a permit for the time. 


What if -- what about the situation where you have several


people who want to get in for a time that has not yet been


committed to anybody.


MR. WILSON:  A first come, first serve rule


would certainly help the situation and, of course, these


permit applications are dated, time-dated and time-stamped


when they are submitted, but there is no requirement that


it be first come, first served.


QUESTION:  Okay.  What if they collide on their


way in to file the permit.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  What's your rule then?  Does


political speech always win?  Is that the tie-breaker?


MR. WILSON:  Well, obviously it's a very


difficult question on facts which might never, ever occur,


and I'm not claiming that when the park district is making


a decision on whether to issue a permit, or space A on day


A, it has to look at these permits and say, oops,


political speech, first in line, and that's --


QUESTION:  If it doesn't say that, doesn't it


retain exactly the discretion that you're complaining

about?


MR. WILSON:  No, sir.  If it said first come,


first serve according to the time date and time stamp,


that would solve the problem.  Your hypothetical


assumes --


QUESTION:  Okay, we've got the collision at the


door.  If the tie-breaker rule is political speech always


wins, your problem doesn't arise.  If there isn't that


tie-breaker rule, it seems to me, there is enough


discretion left to be a violation on your view.


MR. WILSON:  Well, I would certainly think that


this case need not turn on that somewhat unlikely


occurrence.


QUESTION:  Well, maybe, but I'd like to know


what the principle is that you want us to apply, and I


think the principle that you want us to apply means that


when they bump each other's foreheads at the door,


political speech has got to win, or there's an


unconstitutional discretion left, amounting to the


possibility of a prior restraint.


If that's wrong, tell me why it's wrong.


MR. WILSON:  I believe that's wrong because --


well, first of all, again, we're not going to find that


situation, but let's assume we did, and they bump their


heads on the way in.  First come, first served is a

reasonable approach, if that is a concrete and


consistently --


QUESTION:  Yes, but you just keep changing the


hypothetical.  What's the principle in the case that the


time rule, first come, first served, doesn't work?  What's


the principle?


MR. WILSON:  When first come, first served does


not work?


QUESTION:  Yes, the hypo.


MR. WILSON:  It would seem that as long as the


event is suitable for that particular park, first come,


first serve should always work.


QUESTION:  But by hypothesis, Justice Souter's


question is you can't apply it here because they both came


at the same time.


MR. WILSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  You don't have an answer for that,


right?  You don't have an answer for that situation.


MR. WILSON:  I don't.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. WILSON:  I really don't, and --


QUESTION:  But you think first come, first serve


is a thoroughly reasonable rule.


MR. WILSON:  I do.


QUESTION:  But you're going to tell us that --

 QUESTION:  When --


QUESTION:  Your brief tell us that --


QUESTION:  Excuse me, please let me finish.


When Pope Paul visited -- John Paul visited


Chicago there was a rally, or a gathering in the Chicago


parks.  If your client had filed for that day 2 years


earlier, right, the park would have to say, gee, I'm


sorry.  The park couldn't have a 30-day before rule, we're


not going to grant any applications until 30 days before


the event, and we're going to look over all of the


feasible applications at that point.  That would not be


reasonable?


MR. WILSON:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  So that it finds, gee, you know, the


Pope is only going to be here one day, and you know, maybe


we can have this --


QUESTION:  Hemp concert --


QUESTION:  -- Hemp concert later, yes.


(Laughter.)


MR. WILSON:  One would assume that the --


QUESTION:  Can't do that?


MR. WILSON:  -- holder of the permit would be


reasonable in accommodating such as an extraordinary event


as this, and if --


QUESTION:  No, no, this is an unreasonable --

QUESTION:  The park district always has the


availability of going to court to seek a court order in


that unusual situation to demonstrate to a court that this


is such an extraordinary event that they should be able to


withdraw that permit and make reasonable accommodation to


the other events, and it's -- like Justice Souter's


hypothetical, it conceivably could happen.  It's not going


to happen very often.  It may never happen.


QUESTION:  It's not Pope John Paul, it's the


Beatles, and the Beatles are only going to be there for


one day.  I mean, you're going to have courts decide


whether the Beatles are more important than your Hemp


concert?


MR. WILSON:  No, sir, and that's why I believe


that a first come, first serve rule is going to be


reasonable in almost all situations.


QUESTION:  All right, but just --


QUESTION:  It seems to me the problem with


that --


QUESTION:  Just testing your brief, you say that


even under the first come, first serve rule the Government


has the obligation to go to court to validate the permit,

under Freedman, and I just don't get that out of our --


sure, that's what Freedman said, but Freedman was a very


special case, and a time, place, and manner regulation for


a park is not.


MR. WILSON:  Well, of course, Freedman has -- I


mean, the analysis from Freedman has been used in


noncensorship cases, but in that case the Government needs


to bear that burden.  It's a very slight burden.  It's


a --


QUESTION:  Mr. Wilson, where -- where?  You say,


the Government goes to court.  The park district goes to


court and shows that there's no conflict with the First


Amendment.  The court you're assuming, I gather, if you're


following the Freedman mode, is a State court, and yet


from this very litigation it seems that you prefer the


Federal court, so how would a Freedman scheme do you any


good at all, considering that your preferred forum is the


Federal court, and I don't think, if the Government


brought that case, if the park district brought that case


in the State court, wouldn't you be stuck there?


MR. WILSON:  No question, of course, the


Supremacy Clause makes Freedman applicable to that State


court, but the likelihood that an individual is going to


insist on going forward with judicial review when his


permit was denied because another permit had already been

issued is slight.


QUESTION:  No, but I'm asking you -- I asked you


before, what is the scheme that you said would be


constitutional, and one part of it surprised me.  You said


Freedman.  You go to the State court.  But it seems to me


you don't want to be in State court.  You were brought


here a 1983 action.  You could have gone to State court


with a 1983 action, but you didn't.


MR. WILSON:  The problem with that, we have


brought a facial challenge in this case because of the


difficulty, every single time one is refused a permit, in


going to State court or Federal court and litigating


whether that particular denial was appropriate, and the


medicine here is to get rid of the bad ordinance which


allows inappropriate and content-based, or viewpoint-


based decisions behind closed doors, even if they are not


authorized on the face of the scheme.


It's a burden that the Government ought to bear


in core political speech cases, and it is not a great


burden.  It would be a form complaint, spit out of the


word processor, to say the permit was denied, here is a


copy of the previously issued permit, we rest.


QUESTION:  Do you know any park district that


does it that way?


MR. WILSON:  Well, some have to now.  For

instance, in California, it's not a park district, but in


response to the decision of the Ninth Circuit in Baby Tam,


the California legislature enacted Chapter 49 of the


California statutes, which mandates that when a permit is


denied for a First Amendment business, which the Baby Tam


case involved, it is the Government who must bear the


burden, and the time limits are very stringent.  The --


QUESTION:  We're talking about a business, a


permit to operate a business, not to hold an event in a


public park.


MR. WILSON:  Well, I would suggest, Justice


Ginsburg, that a permit to hold a core political speech


rally in a public park deserves at least as much


protection as the permit to operate an adult bookstore.


QUESTION:  Well, you're arguing for content-


neutral --


QUESTION: 

You're simply wrong under our cases


there.


MR. WILSON:  I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  I say, I think you're wrong under our


cases there.  The Government has a right to make


substantial choice in determining who's going to use its


premises, whereas the owner of private premises is


entitled to use them as he pleases, subject only to the


permit process.

 MR. WILSON:  But this Court has said that in


cases of public parks, the power of the Government to


restrict free speech activity is at its most


circumscribed.


QUESTION:  And where did we say that?


MR. WILSON:  We said that in Hague v. -- you


said that in Hague v. CIO.


QUESTION:  Well, that was 60 years ago.


MR. WILSON:  But no one has ever suggested, Mr.


Chief Justice, that that is not the law today, and indeed,


that one quotation from Hague appears in core political


speeches through this day, and it is one of the most oft-


repeated statements from the cases.


QUESTION:  Yes.  That doesn't make it valid


today.


QUESTION:  But isn't your argument for applying


it this.  Your argument seems to boil down to saying, a


content-neutral set of criteria can be abused, and isn't


the answer to that an applied challenge as opposed to a


facial challenge?


MR. WILSON:  No, it is not, Justice Souter.  My


answer to that is, make the Government come into court and


demonstrate to a reviewing court that it was not abused,


that it was an appropriate denial of speech, and that's


where the burden belongs.

 QUESTION:  That's why the -- there's no need to


retreat from Hague, I wouldn't think.  It is important,


but the question is what set of rules are appropriate to


safeguard the interests of the many people who might want


to use the park for different purposes, so why don't you


go back to Justice Souter's question and say, well, why


isn't it -- answer, why isn't it perfectly appropriate to


have a set of neutral criteria, that is a fair set of


criteria, and if they are a disguised way of censoring


someone, simply leave that up to the as-applied


circumstance where the person who is being censored will


go into court and say, judge, this is a trick, they're


after me, and the judge will decide?


MR. WILSON:  Justice Breyer, in order to do that


it would seem that this Court would have to retreat from


what it said in Forsyth, in which it stated that when a


prior restraint in the form of a permit to conduct a


political event in a public forum is involved, a facial


challenge is appropriate, and the court --


QUESTION:  Nobody says -- nobody denies you can


make the challenge.  I just want to know why you don't


lose on the ground that it's a fair set of criteria, and


if, in fact, they're not applying that set of criteria


fairly, sufficient unto the day.


It's the same question, but I think that that's

initially what I got from Justice Souter, and I just want


to know directly your answer.


MR. WILSON:  My answer is that this a particular


situation where facial challenges are appropriate.  This


is not a case where the individual need to go to court and


demonstrate that in this particular instance his permit


was wrongly denied.  It is the very existence of this


scheme, as the Court said in Lakewood, that creates a


danger that it was wrongly denied, and because that danger


is there, the permit scheme cannot be allowed to stand --


QUESTION:  May I just ask one question about


your rule about priorities, and it's the basic rule.  I


assume they might have a cut-off, say we won't consider


applications more than 90 days ahead of time, or something


like that, but do you say it is totally impermissible for


the park district to use content of what is going to be


done in the use of the park as one of the criteria for


deciding who gets the -- on competing demands?


MR. WILSON:  Content of the speech.


QUESTION:  One is a baseball game, another is a


concert, another is a lecture on dinosaurs, and another is


political speech.  Is it totally impermissible to decide


that one of those uses is more appropriate on a particular


time and place within the park?


MR. WILSON:  If there are competing applications

and one of them is a free speech event and one of them is


a softball game, and the decision is made based on what


the free speech is urging, what the message is, that is


entirely inappropriate.


QUESTION:  If it's hostility to the message, I


agree completely.


MR. WILSON:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  But just supposing all you know about


it is, they want to make -- it's a political rally of some


kind on the one hand, baseball, music, all those -- can


the content, without any hostility to the particular


message, be one of the criteria that can break ties?


MR. WILSON:  If your question assumes that each


of those events would be appropriate for that specific


location --


QUESTION:  It does.


MR. WILSON:  -- then no.  The first applied


should get the space.


I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Wilson.  Mr. Strauss,


we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. STRAUSS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:

 First, if I may, I would like to clarify


something about the park district's regulations.  The park


district does use a first come, first serve rule.  It


occurs in at least two places in the regulations in joint


appendix 143 and joint appendix 146.


Joint appendix 143 prescribes the order in which


applications shall be processed.  They shall be processed


in the order of receipt.  146 criterion number 6 for


denial, one ground for denial -- this is -- I'm reading


from joint appendix page 146.  One ground for denial is


that a fully executed prior application for permit for the


same time and place has been received, and a permit has


been --


QUESTION:  But neither of those requires the


early application to be accepted, at least not as I read


it.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, first come, first serve if


the application is valid, yes.


QUESTION:  It is required to be accepted?  Which


one of those says that.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, the -- a valid, a fully


executed prior application for a permit has been received,


and a permit has been granted --


QUESTION:  That's a reason for denial.


MR. STRAUSS:  That's a reason for denial, right.

 QUESTION:  But it doesn't say the converse, that

MR. STRAUSS:  Well, the -- a -- the only ground


for denial -- there are other grounds, possible grounds


for denial, but one ground for denial is someone was there


first.


QUESTION:  Well, it works out that way because


of the provision that says applications shall be processed


in --


MR. STRAUSS:  In the order of receipt.


QUESTION:  That doesn't require a decision on


the processing.  I don't see -- I really don't see it, and


I'm not sure it's commanded, either, but --


MR. STRAUSS:  I guess --


QUESTION:  Let me ask you this.  Do you think


that that's constitutionally required there be a first


come, first serve rule?


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, it is our system, Justice


Stevens.  I -- so really this would be a question that


wouldn't be implicated in our defense of our system.


I guess I think no, it is not constitutionally


required to proceed on a first come, first serve basis. 


There could be other legitimate criteria that might be


used, but I do want to emphasize that is what we do.


QUESTION:  Can you ask for the park 3 years in

advance?


MR. STRAUSS:  My understanding, Justice Scalia,


is that we have a practice, although I don't know if it's


written down anywhere, of not accepting applications for


more than some period of time in advance, I think 6


months.


QUESTION:  I would think there would have to be


something --


MR. STRAUSS:  There's some provision --


QUESTION:  Now, the whole scheme is written on


the basis that the permit may be denied, and there are a


set of criteria, but it doesn't appear to be any


affirmative requirement that anything be granted if it


meets all the requirements.


MR. STRAUSS:  Oh, Justice O'Connor, we do have


to grant it if it meets those requirements.  That language


that the park district --


QUESTION:  May deny.


MR. STRAUSS:  -- may deny is an authorization to


the park district to deny in these circumstances.


QUESTION:  And not otherwise.


MR. STRAUSS:  And not otherwise.  And not


otherwise.


QUESTION:  And it doesn't do anything to govern


how you grant competing applications, other than the fact

that you say there's some kind of built-in first come,

MR. STRAUSS:  The way the competing applications


are handled is on a first come, first serve basis.


QUESTION:  One of the objections made by the


petitioner was that either in this case or, reading the


regulations, you don't have to give written reasons.  He


said that there was no record and so forth.  It seemed to


me that was -- I'd like you to respond to that.

reasons.

QUESTION:  That was my -- and you did in this


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes, we did, in this case.  That


is in the record.  The exchange of letters between


petitioner's predecessor, Mr. McDonald, and the park


district is in the joint appendix, and --


QUESTION:  This is based on previous damage and


material misrepresentations in the earlier --


MR. STRAUSS:  That's right.  It was based on


previous violations and, in fact, in this case we gave


Mr. McDonald notice that he had engaged in conduct in


violation of his permit when he did it, before he


submitted the subsequent application.


QUESTION:  And do the regulations require that

MR. STRAUSS:  Yes, they do.  I'm reading now on


joint appendix page 145.  The section is misnumbered. It's


correctly numbered in the appendix to our brief, but the


substance is the same.  Notice of denial and application


for a permit shall clearly set forth the grounds upon


which the permit was denied.


QUESTION:  Thank you.


MR. STRAUSS:  It then goes on to say that where


feasible, if there is a competing use the park district


will propose a way to accommodate the use.  That's a


requirement on us, to try to provide an alternative site


or alternative date to --


QUESTION:  Could you explain the degree of


discretion to grant, in the event that the conditions are


not satisfied?


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes, Justice Souter.  Our view,


which we think is really the only reasonable reading of


the ordinance, is that we can exercise discretion, as it


were, within the criteria, so that if there is a way to


grant the application that -- an application that is in


violation that does not defeat the purpose of the


conditions, we will try to do that.


Let me be more concrete about it.  The place


where this comes up most frequently is with a late

application, and --


QUESTION:  Late?


MR. STRAUSS:  A late -- late application,


application that's not submitted.  We have a schedule of


deadlines which are very specific.  Often, they're not


met.  In fact, they're habitually not met by, in Justice


Black's terms from Oregon v. City of Struthers, the poorly


financed causes of little people.  Those are the people


who often get their applications in late, and the park


district's view is, if it's -- if we can make the


necessary accommodations, and do the necessary setup and


necessary coordination and free the space for you, even


though your application is late, we will do it, and that's


the kind of discretion we exercise.


QUESTION:  Would there have been discretion in


this case?  Let's assume the only prior violation had been


the fact that if that earlier gathering people were still


hanging around at 11:00, after -- or after 11:00 when the


park closed.  Would there have been discretion to forgive


that?


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes, there would have been, if we


had concluded that -- if the applicant said to us


something that gave us reason to believe it wouldn't


happen again, or if the nature of the event were such that


it was scheduled earlier in the day, or something like

that, that it wouldn't happen again, or if it happened


again it wouldn't be so much of a problem, but we don't


assert, and I don't think you can assert, consistent with


the ordinance, a kind of free-floating discretion to


overlook violations for people we like and not for people


we don't like.  I think that would be a violation of the


ordinance.


QUESTION:  Does the record tell us how many


permits are granted and how many denied each year by the


park?


MR. STRAUSS:  Justice O'Connor, on the grants,


the record, the most precise number we have in the record


is there are thousands of applications and thousands of


grants a year.  We submitted to the Court the permits in


our lodging, the permits granted from January through


August of this year, and there were over 1,000 of those in


one region of the park.


QUESTION:  How about denials?


MR. STRAUSS:  Denials, Justice O'Connor, is a


hard number to come up with, and this bears on the


Freedman v. Maryland point, because what often happens is


that the denial takes the form of saying, we can't


accommodate you at this space at this time, but if you're


willing to move your event a week later, or willing to


move it to this alternative site, then we can accommodate

you.


Now, I suppose that's a denial, because we're


not granting the permit applied for, and I suppose if


petitioner prevails we would have to go to court and


defend that denial, which seems a really unworkable


scheme, but because of that the park district really


can't -- couldn't tell me how many denials there are,


because so many of them are worked out and the event goes


forward in a different time or place than that which was


applied for.


I think there are really three ways in which


this case differs from Freedman v. Maryland.  One which


was suggested by some questions from the Court, perhaps


the most important one, of course, is in Freedman the


Board of Censors, self-described Board of Censors was


explicitly concerned with the content of speech.


We are not only not concerned with the content


of speech, we are not concerned with whether the event


involves speech or expressive activity at all, and if you


look at the application form, unless the applicant somehow


discloses it, there is really no way for us to know from


the application form what kind, whether this is a speech-


related event or not.  The box that Mr. McDonald checked


was named corporate/festival, which could include a


variety of events not involving speech.

 QUESTION:  I guess a permit was denied to


Mr. McDonald based on some prior event where people stayed


after 11:00.


MR. STRAUSS:  Justice O'Connor, it was denied


for multiple reasons.  It was denied partly because it


wasn't filled out properly.  The form omitted information,


partly because one of the applicants was not an


organization that had the capacity to sue or be sued, and


also because of a series of violations of which that was


only one.  There was also --


QUESTION:  Are there administrative mechanisms


in place for someone who wants to challenge the basis for


the denial to raise it administratively?


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes, there is, Justice O'Connor. 


There's a provision for an appeal to the general


superintendent of the park district from the decision made


by the permitting officers in the park district, and you


can submit any material you like to the general


superintendent, who must rule on it promptly.  If he


doesn't rule on it promptly, then the appeal is deemed


allowed.


QUESTION:  I take it that's the second


distinction from Freedman.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, the second distinction from


Freedman -- that is a distinction, Justice Souter, but the

second distinction really is that a key premise of


Freedman is that the decision in question was one that the


courts had superior competence to make, and that the


agency was to be distrusted in making.  The Court said the


decision was whether the speech was constitutionally


protected or is obscene, and a theme of Freedman is, as


the Court said in Freedman, a censor's business is to


censor, and this is really something that requires, in the


Court's words, judicial participation.


What we're dealing with here is the management


of parks, where I think the story is reversed, and when


you're dealing with whether a particular use is


appropriate for this area of the park with this


infrastructure, this is the kind of park district has


superior competence with, and there's really no reason to


insist, as the Court did on judicial --


QUESTION:  Does the same problem get injected by


the exception clause in the ordinance, that in fact they


can waive conditions if there would be a First Amendment


violation?


MR. STRAUSS:  Justice Souter, that clause, two


things about that clause are salient, I think.  First,


that clause only comes into play, the clause that provides


that we shall waive certain fees when someone is engaged


in First Amendment activity and otherwise couldn't hold

the event if we didn't waive the fees, that only comes


into play if someone applies for a waiver, so we're in a


situation where someone has come to us in order to seek


this dispensation, has told us we're engaging in


expressive activity, and the second thing --


QUESTION:  Which happened here.


MR. STRAUSS:  Which happened here.  In one


instance he got his dispensation.


The other thing is, we feel we have to have that


in there because of suggestions in this Court's opinions


in Murdock and Forsyth County that there might be a


constitutional issue if we charge more than a nominal fee.


QUESTION:  And the third distinction that you


want to rely on?


MR. STRAUSS:  The third distinction, Justice


Souter, is that in the Freedman context the Court had


indicated a strong preference for after-the-fact


regulation, that if the -- if a community is concerned


about obscenity, the way to regulate that is by after-


the-fact criminal prohibitions.


Prior restraints are strongly disfavored and be


allowed only in narrowly hedged circumstances, but the


Court has never suggested that when it comes to managing


parks, the preferred way to do it is somehow by allowing


people to do what they will and then punish people after

the fact who have done the wrong thing, who have conducted


an event in a way that conflicted with another event.


QUESTION:  Mr. Strauss, you've ably


distinguished Freedman, but do you think that none of the


procedural safeguards that were involved in Freedman are


applicable here, starting with the basics, the


administrator has to have some time limits to act on these


petitions to hold events?


MR. STRAUSS:  Justice Ginsburg, I would put that


part of Freedman in a different category.  I think that


the requirement that the administrator act within a


specified period is a corollary of the rule that the


administrator cannot have unlimited discretion over


whether to grant or deny.  Just as unlimited discretion


over whether to grant is a problem, unlimited discretion


over when to grant is a problem.


QUESTION:  I think there's considerable merit,


what you have just said, although at the end of the brief


you make the final argument that this is really not a


speech statute anyway.  Am I to infer from that that you


think we could write an opinion to say that neutral


standards are not necessary?


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes.  That was going to be the


second part of my answer to Justice Ginsburg, Justice


Kennedy.  That is our position.  Our claim does not hinge

on that.  The Court could disagree with us on that and


still rule in our favor in this case, but it is our


position that because this statute applies, this ordinance


applies so broadly to such a wide range of conduct, much


of which, most of which is not expressive, that it really


should be viewed as more like a business license, or a


building permit, which, of course --


QUESTION:  Or a zoning ordinance.


MR. STRAUSS:  Or a zoning permit, variance of


some kind, which, of course, apply to expressive


activities, but to a lot of other activities, too.


QUESTION:  The easy way to answer that argument


is to say we've never done this with reference to parks.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, that's right, Justice


Kennedy, but as some of the questions from the Court


suggested during my colleague's argument, because these


are parks, perhaps the Government has more leeway than it


would have in telling people what they can do on their own


property.


I understand that on the other hand they are


public forums, and I am not sure how that -- whether those


arguments cancel out, but it seems to me the crucial fact


here is that the park district is not only not engaged in


the business of censoring speech, it is at the far extreme


from that, and it is regulating conduct because it affects

the infrastructure of the parks, and uses of the parks,


and much of this conduct is in no obvious way expressive,


and in our view that seems to make it more like a business


license.


QUESTION:  But you did say that you feel some


compulsion from the First Amendment to have to make a


decision within a set time to guard against abuse of


discretion.  You said that.  How about, need there be any


avenue for judicial review after we get through with your


park administrator?


MR. STRAUSS:  Justice Ginsburg, I think -- well,


for anyone claiming a violation of a constitutional right,


there should be an avenue for prompt judicial review, and


further, I think that part of Freedman is intended to deal


with that situation like that present in some of this


Court's cases, in FW/PBS and in Shuttlesworth in


particular, a situation where the applicant can't be quite


sure when the permit's been denied, so the applicant


doesn't quite know when it's okay to go to court.


That was what happened in Shuttlesworth, and I


think that troubled the Court, and I think that's the idea


that when the Court said in FW/PBS there must be an avenue


for prompt judicial review, that's what the Court had in


mind, that the permitting scheme cannot be set up in such


a way that whenever -- when the applicant goes to Court

the permitting authority can then step back and say, oh,


we haven't denied the permit yet.


Here, it's clear when we deny it.  We have to


act within a certain number of days.  We have to issue a


statement.  The statement has to give reasons, and there


is -- and at that point the decision can be challenged in


State court in a variety of ways.  It can also be


challenged --


QUESTION:  I suppose the very fact that you have


those provisions in means it's a little different from the


ordinary zoning ordinance or business license, because


those are all motivated by First Amendment concerns, I


assume.


May I ask you, how would you -- I understand


your basic position, but are you saying that this is not a


prior restraint, or that it's a permissible prior


restraint?


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, Justice --


QUESTION:  Or are you just ducking the issue?


(Laughter.)


MR. STRAUSS:  No, Justice Stevens, I don't -- I


wouldn't want to duck the issue.  I'd want to say it was a


terminological issue, which I guess is different from


ducking it.


I think it's misleading to characterize it as a

prior restraint.  As Justice Kennedy said, there were some


technical definitional way in which yes, it is a prior


restraint, but it really has none of the characteristics


that have caused the Court to subject prior restraints to


the presumption of unconstitutionality.


In particular, as I said to Justice Souter, this


isn't an area in which the Court has said the preferred


way of regulating is by after-the-fact criminal


punishments.  The Court has always recognized that what


common sense tells us, that this an area where you really


do need before-the-fact guidance, or at least before-the-


fact guidance is acceptable.


That, combined with the fact that it's not a


content-based -- not only not a content-based scheme, not


a content-based scheme that even refers to expression at


all, I think gives it none of the characteristics that


have troubled the Court about prior restraints, so in


light of that, whether it is technically called not a


prior restraint, or a valid prior restraint, I think


really is a terminological point.


QUESTION:  So if something like this is to be


considered valid, what are the limits to make it


reasonable as a regulation?  We've already mentioned


prompt action should be required, perhaps, by the park. 


Do you agree with that?

 MR. STRAUSS:  If the Court does not accept our


argument that this is more like a business license, then


yes, prompt action or a specified time for action by the


administrator.


QUESTION:  And prompt judicial review


opportunity.


MR. STRAUSS:  And an opportunity for prompt


judicial review, that's right.  Otherwise, just --


QUESTION:  How about the adequacy of judicial


review?  I take it one objection was that you don't get


any actual hearing in court.  Everything is on the paper


record.


MR. STRAUSS:  Justice Ginsburg, my reading of


the Illinois cases is that that's not true even in State


court and, of course, the applicant has the option of


going to the Federal court.


My reading of the Illinois cases is that you can


join a claim for equitable relief with the common law


certiorari, which is the Illinois way of reviewing


administrative proceedings, and you can certainly -- it's


clear you could join a 198 -- a State court in a 1983


action, and that would allow you to conduct full


discovery.


But I guess my more fundamental answer to your


question, Justice Ginsburg, is, it seems odd in this case

to speculate about the adequacy of Illinois procedures


when petitioner has not invoked them, and has not


complained about the adequacy of the Federal proceedings


that he has invoked, that the place to decide whether


Illinois provides adequate proceedings would be in a case


where someone invokes them, and the Court then sees what


the Illinois courts are prepared to do in cases of this


kind.


If the Court has no further questions --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Strauss.


Mr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


MR. FELDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


It's our position that the park district's


ordinance satisfies the First Amendment standards and the


judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.


QUESTION:  Do you think we should view it as Mr.


Strauss urges, as a zoning ordinance, or a business


license, or as some kind of content-neutral time, place,


and manner restriction?


MR. FELDMAN:  I think more the latter. 

This is


a public forum.  There was a finding -- there may be other

Government property that wouldn't fall within that


category, but it is a public forum, and restrictions on


speech in a public forum are subject to the First


Amendment, but the restriction in this ordinance, the


relevant restrictions are that the discretion that has to


be -- that may be exercised by the administrative body


can't be unfettered, but on the other hand, total


precision is not required, and I think, as Mr. Strauss


explained, there are 13 specified grounds under which a


permit may be denied here, and those are the only grounds


under which it may be denied, and I think that's adequate


guidance for whatever discretion or flexibility would be


in the system. And indeed, some flexibility is necessary


in a system where you re trying to accommodate competing


users and where the alternative, as the Court of Appeals


said, if you allowed no flexibility at all, would be even


a minor or technical violation of one of those criteria,


would have to lead to a denial of a permit, which would


mean a lot fewer people using the park, both for speech


and for nonspeech purposes.


QUESTION:  It would make it a lot fairer,


wouldn't it?  I mean, you either meet the criteria, or you


don't.  If you don't meet them, you don't get a permit. 


What's the matter with that?


MR. FELDMAN:  The problem would be exactly the

kind of thing that Mr. Strauss described, is that if there


is a minor -- if you put in your permit application


slightly too late, or there was a stray mark on your


application, requiring total strictness on any of these


criteria would just mean that people who really should be


entitled to have the opportunity to speak --


QUESTION:  Well, they didn't follow the rules. 


I mean, you're giving enormous discretion to the city. 


They don't have discretion to deny, but among those that


are deniable, they can allow some in and not allow others


in.


MR. FELDMAN:  But I think --


QUESTION:  Why don't you just say, these are the


rules, if you come in late, you haven't complied with the


rules, period.  That's very fair.


MR. FELDMAN:  I think as Mr. Strauss -- I think


it was Mr. Strauss said, the -- whatever the flexibility


or discretion that remains in a system like this would


be -- has to be exercised in accordance with those grounds


for denial.  Those are the only grounds that are listed,


and I think those are the only things the park district is


supposed to be taking into account in deciding whether to


grant or deny a permit, and -- but you can --


QUESTION:  How do you say it doesn't frustrate


the purpose of the provision which says, you know, the

thing has to be in, you know, 2 weeks beforehand, if you


get it in 1 week beforehand?  How can you possibly say


that doesn't frustrate the purpose of the provision?  The


purpose is to give you 2 weeks to consider it.


MR. FELDMAN:  Right, but I think -- well, it


could well be that the purpose is to make sure that the


park district can guarantee it can consider it, but if


they -- if it comes in on a day, 1 day late but there's


nothing else on top of it that they're waiting to


consider, if it's in the wintertime when they have very


few permit applications, they can get to it anyhow, and


there's no reason for them not to permit that use of the


park.  In any event, that's --


QUESTION:  Even apart from that, I assume


there's no way to write a regulation that is not going to


require some judgment, some discretion.  I mean, what's


material in the falsehood, what is the conflict in the


uses?  I don't suppose you can eliminate that degree, the


degree of flexibility that is implied in applying concepts


like that.


MR. FELDMAN:  I think that's right, and I think


a crucial feature of this requirement is that, of the


ordinance here is that the parks are used for multiple


uses by multiple people.  There's a concern with


preserving the park's own facilities so that people who

will use the same place in the future will have that


available to them, and there has to be some availability


to accommodate all of that in the normal, in an ordinary


administrative scheme, and I think this scheme is well-


drawn, and if there are further difficulties with it, they


can be challenged on an as-applied basis.


One thing the park district can't do is make its


decisions based on favoring or disfavoring particular


kinds of speech.


QUESTION:  Would it be --


MR. FELDMAN:  That should be addressed on an as-


applied basis, and I think it could be in the State court


proceedings, or in a 1983 proceeding.


QUESTION:  Along the lines of Justice Scalia's


question, would it be proper for a city council or


municipality to draft an ordinance just like this one and


then at the end saying, the commissioner of parks, in his


sole discretion, may waive any or all of the foregoing


requirements?


MR. FELDMAN:  I think the -- the only


difficulty -- it would depend on what that meant.  If it


said, in his sole discretion meant he may consider


anything he -- anything, I think that would be -- that


would probably be a problem, but if it meant, considering


the factors that are the legitimate factors on whether

someone should use the park, which are the ones that are


set out in the criteria, in the ordinance, I think it


would be actually similar to what the ordinance is.


QUESTION:  Well, we've said in a case like


Forsyth that discretion has to have some definition and


some control to it, and if you have at the end an absolute


waiver provision, it seems to me that would contradict


that.


MR. FELDMAN:  Oh, I think -- well, I think


that's right.  If the meaning of that provision is that


notwithstanding what we've just said, the commissioner has


absolute discretion, I think that that would be correct,


and that would pose a problem under Forsyth and the other


cases that have said that you can't have that kind of


unfettered discretion.


This is a guided -- this is a statute that has


quite limited and guided --


QUESTION:  Well, how do we know that?  Where


does it say that the may, the may grant anyway is limited


to those applications that generally meet the purposes of


the -- where does it say that?  Do we just take your word


for it?


MR. FELDMAN:  Well --


QUESTION:  Or the park district's word for it?


MR. FELDMAN:  I think that that would at least

be the most reasonable construction of an ordinance like


this, where there's attempt to detail these 13 specific


criteria quite specifically, and there's no suggestion


that there's any other basis on which the park district


can act, and I think that that's just the most reasonable


interpretation of this kind of ordinance.


And again on a facial as-applied -- one


difficulty with a facial challenge to an ordinance like


this is, you don't want to construe it in such a way as to


intentionally render it unconstitutional and therefore


limit the ability of the park district to make its


facilities open, to have a permit scheme that really makes


its facilities open to all.


QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, do the Federal


regulations for the use of Federal parks, the use of the


Mall, do they differ with respect to the may deny?


MR. FELDMAN:  No.  They're -- well, they're very


similar.  The specific criteria are different, and are


differently --


QUESTION:  But there is the may deny, implying


there are cases where, although you could, you don't have


to deny?


MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  And no criteria for the waiver in the


Federal scheme either?

consistently been applied is, those are the grounds that


are to be considered in determining whether you can grant


a permit, and there aren't other grounds on which a permit


would be denied.


Now, there -- the only other -- but actually, in


the Federal scheme at least, and probably here, too, some


types of other -- some types of considerations can be


considered.  For example, if someone has a particular


facility that would be particularly good for one use, if


someone wants to hold a rally on a baseball field, someone


else wants to have a baseball game there, I think they can


say, well, you have the baseball game on the baseball


field, and you have your rally at another location, and


there is some of that that goes on in proposing different


particular locales so as to accommodate all of the


different users who want to use the park.


QUESTION:  And is there a first come, first


serve rule?


MR. FELDMAN:  Basically, yes.  If you satisfy


the other requirements of the rule, it's basically similar


to this.  It's subject to -- the actual first come, first


served rule under the National Park Service parks here in


Washington like this has to do with the date of the


application, not the date on which it's processed.

Mr. Wilson, you have 2 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. WILSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. WILSON:  Justice O'Connor, I'd like to


address quickly two points that you raised.  First,


there's no meaningful administrative procedure.  There is


no mechanism.  They send you a letter telling you that


your permit was denied, and they read off the violations. 


You send a letter back and say, I did not do any of that,


and they say, oh, yes, you did, denied.  That's the end of


it.  There is no hearing.  You don't even get to know who


made the allegations.


Secondly, in your inquiry as to judicial review,


this Court unanimously provided us with a crystal clear


definition of prompt judicial review.  There should be no


mystery in the Federal circuits.  Another unanimous


opinion, Blunt v. Rizzi, written by the same Justice who


wrote Freedman, and on a Court that contains six of the


justices who participated in Freedman, Blunt defined


prompt judicial review as follows:


A final judicial determination on the merits


within a specified brief period.  That was in 1971, so

there should have been no mystery from the plurality of


opinion in FW/PBS, because that plurality opinion did not


say, there must be the availability of judicial review. 


That opinion said, there must be availability of prompt


judicial review --


QUESTION:  Mr. Wilson, what does that mean if


you pick the Federal court, that Illinois is going to


write a statute that says, and if you choose to come to


the Federal court rather than the State court, the Federal


court is going to have X number of days to decide it?


MR. WILSON:  Justice Ginsburg, that would be the


choice of the park district of the City of Chicago,


because the park district is the party that has to go to


court to seek --


QUESTION:  Oh, if you're -- but that's not what


Justice O'Connor said in her case.  She didn't take that


last part of Freedman.


MR. WILSON:  But there's certainly a distinction


between those businesses that Justice O'Connor was writing


about in FW/PBS and a core political speech.


QUESTION:  Well, suppose we reject your notion


that the scheme is invalid unless the park goes to court,


and the court has a tight time line?  Suppose we reject


that?


MR. WILSON:  I would then say, Justice Ginsburg,


53

that this Court has elevated the kind of sexually explicit


speech in that case above the core political speech in


this case, based on the context of the speech, which would


fly in the face of --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't follow that at all.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Wilson. 


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the above-


entitled matter was submitted.)
