13  immigration.  In addressing those costs, Arizona 
14  borrowed the Federal standards as its own and attempted

17
18  the extraordinary step of seeking a preliminary 
19  injunction to enjoin the statute as impliedly preempted

22  inverting fundamental principles of federalism.

2
3  authorization for its enforcement efforts.  Rather, the 
4  burden is on the parties seeking to preempt a duly 
5
6  statutory law that does the preempting.  Now, the United 
7  States can't really do that here, and the reason is 
8  obvious.

12  Federal immigration officials, in order to ascertain the

16  respond to inquiries from state and local officials 
17  about somebody's immigration status.  1373(a) goes even 
18  further.  That provision says that no Federal agency or 
19  officer may prohibit or in any way restrict the ability 
of state and local officers to communicate with Federal 
20
21  immigration officers to ascertain somebody's immigration 
22  status.

 So, for example, 1373(c) specifically

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- could I interrupt? 

1
2  And turning to 2(B), could you tell me what the state's 
3  view is -- the Government proposes that it should be 
4  read on its face one way, and I think the state is 
arguing that there's a narrower way to read it.  But am 
5
6  I to understand that, under the state's position in this 
7  action, the only time that the inquiry about the status 
8  of an individual rises is after they've had probable 
9  cause to arrest that individual for some other crime?
 MR. CLEMENT:  That's exactly right, Justice 
10
11  Sotomayor.  So this only operates when somebody's been, 
12  essentially, stopped for some other infraction.  And 
13  then, at that point, if there's reasonable suspicion to 
14  try to identify immigration status, then that can 
15
16
17
18
19  there just one moment?
 That's what I thought.  So, presumably, I 
20
21  think your argument is that, under any circumstance, a 
22  police officer would have the discretion to make that 
23  call.  Seems to me that the issue is not about whether 
24  you make the call or not, although the government is

 MR. CLEMENT:  Sure. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- just stop -- stop you

5

 And to the extent that the government wants 

1  individual, meaning -- as I understand it, when 
2  individuals are arrested and held for other crimes, 
3  often, there's an immigration check that most states do 
4  without this law.
5
6  to remove that individual, they put in a warrant of 
7  detainer.  This process is different.  How is it 
8  different? 
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, it's different in one 
9
important respect, Justice Sotomayor, and that's why I 
10
11  don't think that the issue that divides the parties is 
12  only the issue of how long you can detain somebody 
13  because I think the Federal government takes the rather 
14  unusual position that, even though these stops and these 
inquiries, if done on an ad hoc basis, become preempted 
15
16  if they're done on a systematic basis --
17
18  their argument.  I can question them about that. 
19
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

how -- assuming your position, that doing it on 
a systematic -- there's nothing wrong with doing it as 
it's been done in the past.  Whenever anyone is 
detained, a call could be made.  What I see as critical 
is the issue of how long and under -- and when is the 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I understand that's 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Okay.  But -- so that's --

both immigration law and civil rights law.

2  person? 
3
4  don't think Section 2(B) really speaks to that, which is

6  systematic inquiry has to take any longer than the
 
7  ad hoc inquiry.

21  believe would happen, which is to say, at that point, 
22  then, the officer would ask themselves whether there's 
23  any reason to continue to detain the person for state 
24  law purposes.
25

 So, there --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm putting all of this 

MR. CLEMENT:  But -- but, if what we're 

 And that, I think, can be very well 

illustrated by Section 6 -- I don't want to change the 

1  offense that the person was pulled over needs to be 
2  dealt with or something like that. 
3
4  outside of -- of -- the --
5
6  talking about is simply what happens then, for purposes 
7  of the Federal immigration consequences, the answer is 
8  nothing.  The individual, at that point, is released. 
9
10
11  subject unnecessarily, but there is arrest authority for 
12  somebody who has committed a public offense, which means 
13  that it's a crime in another state and in Arizona, but 
14  the person can't be arrested for that offense, 
15
16  sentence for the offense; and then there is new arrest 
17  authority given to the officer to hold that person if 
18  they are deportable for that offense. 
 Now, I think, in that circumstance, it's 
19
very clear what would happen, is an inquiry would be 
20
21  made to the Federal officials that would say, do you 
22  want us to transfer this person to your custody or hold 
23  this person until you can take custody?  And if the 
24  answer is no, then that's the end of it.  That 
25

individual is released because there is no independent

5
6
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 
7  think there's two answers to that.  One is -- you're 
8  right, sometimes, it's a complex inquiry.  Sometimes, 
9  it's a straightforward inquiry.  It could be murder.  It 
could be a drug crime.  But I think the practical answer 
10
11 
to the question is, by hypothesis, there is going to be 
inquiry made to the Federal immigration authorities, 
12 
13 
either the Law Enforcement Support Center or a 287 --
287(g) officer.
14 
 And, presumably, as a part of that inquiry, 
15
16  they can figure out whether or not this is a removable 
17  offense or at least a substantially likely removable 
18  offense.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what would be the

5

7  offense.  And you say, under the Fourth Amendment, you

MR. CLEMENT:  Yes, ultimately, it's a 
reasonable inquiry.  And I think that, under these 
circumstances, what we know from the record here is 
that, generally, the immigration status inquiry is 
something that takes 10 or 11 minutes, I mean, so it's 
not -- we're not talking about something -- or no more 
than 10, if it's a 287(g) officer, and, roughly, 11 
minutes on average if it's the Law Enforcement Support

 Do you want to represent that or not?

 And, now, they put him in jail.  And are 
5

7  can or not -- can you represent to us he will not stay

after a day.
 

 You -- from your representation, I think
 
that there will be a significant number of people --

1  question.  I don't know how long the Fourth Amendment 
2  allows.  I don't know on that.  There probably is a 
3  range of things.  But we do know that a person, 
4  ordinarily, for this crime, X, would have been released 
5
6  Oh, you know, the Fourth Amendment would have allowed
 
7  more.  So, now, what I want to know is what, in
 
8  practice, will happen?
 
9
10
11  some of whom won't be arrested.  It takes 11 minutes for 
12  some.  For citizens, it might take two hours.  It might 
13  take two days.  Okay.  There will be a significant 
14  number of people who will be detained, at the stop or in 
15
16  in the absence of 2(B). 
 Is that a fair conclusion? 
17
 MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think it is, Justice 
18
19  Breyer, and here's why it's not:  Because, even though 
there certainly are situations where state authorities 
20
21  will arrest somebody and then release them relatively 
22  rapidly, they generally don't release somebody until 
23  they can nail down their identity and whether or not 
24  they are likely to come to a court hearing at a 
25

prison, for a significantly longer period of time than 

subsequent --

 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Scalia, it is

3

6
7  neither --
8
9  on this that it violates the Fourth Amendment?
10
11  government, that also has a lot of immigration arrests 
12  that are subject to the Fourth Amendment, is not making 
13  a Fourth Amendment claim here.  And it's neither an 
14  immigration law concern or something that should be the 
15
16
17  different argument --
 MR. CLEMENT:  But I do want to -- but I do 
18
19  want to be responsive and make the point that I think 
the factual premise that this is going to -- 2(B) is 
20
21  going to lead to the elongation of a lot of arrests is 
22  not true. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Can I make the 
23
24  following statement in the opinion -- and you will say 
25

that's okay.  Imagine -- this is imaginary.  "We

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think what you could say is 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But can I say that? 
 MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think you can say just 

person would have been detained in the absence of 2(B)." 
 Can I make that statement in an opinion, and 

1  interpret" -- imagine -- "we interpret Section 2(B) as 
2  not authorizing or requiring the detention of any 
3  individual under 2(B), either at the stop or in prison, 
4  for a significantly longer period of time than that 
5
6
7  you'll say, that's right? 
8
9  that --
10
11
12  that. 
13
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No. 
14
 MR. CLEMENT:  I think you can say something 
similar, though.  I think you probably could say that, 
15
16  look, this is a facial challenge.  The statute's never 
17  gone into effect.  We don't anticipate that Section 2(B) 
18  would elongate, in a significant number of cases, the 
19  detention or the arrest.  I think you could say that.
 And the reason is, as I indicated, it's 
20
21  something that happens even without this law that, when 
22  you arrest somebody -- and there are some offenses that 
23  are -- you can arrest and release under state law, but 
24  before you release the individual, you generally want to 
25

ascertain that that individual is going to show up at 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, here's the other reason why I don't 

think, factually, this is going to elongate things 

1  the hearing, and that's what really distinguishes those 
2  cases, where there's arrest and release, from those 
3  cases where there's arrest and you book somebody. 
4
5
6  because, already, in a significant number of booking 
7  facilities in Arizona, you already have the process that 
8  people are systematically run through immigration checks 
9  when they are booked as part of the booking process. 
That's reflected in the record here in the Maricopa 
10
11  County system, that that's done by a 287(g) officer as a 
12  matter of routine. 
13
14  statute, but they are very proud of their Secure 
15
16  program also makes clear that everybody's that's booked 
17  at participating facilities is -- eventually has their 
18  immigration status checked. 
19
status check is likely to lead to a substantial 
20
21  elongation of the stops or the detentions.  Now, 
22  obviously --
23
24  I have a clear representation from you.  If, at a call 
25

to the Federal agency, the agency says, we don't want to 

Communities program.  And their Secure Communities

2  unless it's under 6, is what you're telling me.
 
3  Or under 6, 3, or some -- one other of Arizona's
 
4  immigration crimes.

 MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly.  Obviously, if this 
5
6  is somebody who was going -- you know, 60 miles an hour 
7  in a 20-mile-an-hour school zone or something, they may 
8  decide, wholly apart from the immigration issues, that 
9  this is somebody they want to bring back to the station.
 But, for the purposes of once they make the 
10
11  contact with Federal immigration officials, if the 
12  Federal immigration officials say, look, we have no 
13  interest in removing this person, we have no interest in 
14  prosecuting this person under the Federal criminal

2  the Federal government -- yes, he's an illegal 
3  immigrant, but that's okay with us. 
4
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and the state has no 
5
6  power to -- to close its -- its borders to -- to people 
7  who have no right to be there? 
8
9  here's my response, which is all of this discussion, at 
least as I've understood it, has been about 2(B) and, to 
10
11 
a lesser extent, 6. 
12
 Now, Section 3 of the statute does provide 
13  an authority, under state law, to penalize somebody who 
14  has violated, essentially, the Federal registration 
requirement.  So if that's -- as to that provision, 
15
16  there would be a state authority, even under these 
17  hypotheticals, to take action with respect to the 
18  individual --

2  law?

 MR. CLEMENT:  And I think my answer to that 
7  is no.  I think the reason my answer is no has more to 
8  do with our defense of Section 3 and other provisions 
9  than it does with respect to the inquiry and arrest 
10
11
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, before you move on to 
12  the registration requirement, could I take you back to 
13  an example that's similar to the one that Justice Breyer 
14  was referring to?
 Let's someone -- let's say someone who is a 
15
16  citizen and a resident of New Mexico, has a New Mexico 
17  driver's license, drives across the border, is stopped 
18  for speeding, not 60 miles an hour in a 20-mile zone, 
19  but 10 miles over the speed limit on an interstate.  And 
20
21  may be an illegal alien.  How would that work out? 
22
 If you do the records check, you're not 
23  going to get anything back, right, because the person is 
24  a citizen?  So what -- where would the officer take it

 MR. CLEMENT:  And that might be a situation 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, if I can just kind of 

reasonable suspicion for the officer.  But I'll take the 

1
2  work back for a second?  I mean, obviously, it's a 
3  pretty unusual circumstance, where somebody produces an 
4  out-of-state driver's license, and that doesn't dispel 
5
6  hypo --
7
8  reasonable suspicion if it's -- if the officer knows 
9  it's a state that issues driver's licenses to aliens who 
10
11
12  where that's the case, and then -- then it wouldn't 
13  dispel the reasonable suspicion.  But, say, in the 
14  average case, I think it would.
 They would then go further.  And then they 
15
16  would then make the inquiry to the Federal officials. 
17  And then if -- because of the fact that the individual 
18  actually is a citizen or something like that, then what 
19  would happen is, at some point, you'd get to the end of 
a permissible Terry stop, and the officer would release 
20
21  the individual. 
 Now, it might not be the end of the matter 
22
23  because, of course -- you know, they -- they still have 
24  the name, they still have the ability to collect that 
information and try to continue the check as they move

2  driver's license. 
3
4  you know, this statute doesn't authorize them to detain 
5
6  Amendment limits.  And it really doesn't authorize them 
7  to do anything that the official couldn't do on an 
8  ad hoc basis without the statute.

21
22  the person was removable, then they could hold the 
23  person, presumably, until the -- the person's status was 
24  completely verified, isn't that correct?
25

 Now, it does do --
JUSTICE ALITO:  That -- that may be the 
case, and I would like to ask General Verrilli about 
that.  But, under the Fourth Amendment, presumably, if 
the officer can arrest -- the state officer can arrest a 
person on -- simply on the ground that the person is 
removable, which is what the Office of Legal Counsel 
opined some years ago, then, presumably, the officer 
could continue to detain that individual that 
I mentioned, until they reached a point where the Terry 
stop becomes an arrest.  At which time, they would have 
to have probable cause. 

 But, if they had probable cause to believe 

Official 

 But I think the important thing is that --

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's correct, 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

really is going to apply to criminal aliens. 

 It does do one thing that's very important, 

 Now, as we read Section 6, because there's a 

1  Your Honor. 
2
3  pre-existing definition of public offense in Arizona 
4  law, we don't think this is kind of the -- the full 
Office of Legal Counsel situation, where you have broad 
5
6  arrest authority for removable individuals.  This is a 
7  relatively narrow slice of additional arrest authority 
8  that happens to give arrest authority for people that 
9  seem to fit the Federal government's priority because it 
10
11
 But I don't -- I don't take any issue with 
12  what you're saying.  I do think, though, it's important 
13  to understand that 2(B) really doesn't give the officer 
14  an authority he didn't otherwise have.
15
16  though, which it does have the effect of overriding 
17  local policies that actually forbad some officers from 
18  making those communications and -- because that's one of 
19  the primary effects of 2(B).  It just shows how 
20
21  because those kind of local policies are expressly 
22  forbidden by Federal statute.  1373(a) and 8 U.S.C. 1644 
23  basically say that localities can't have those kind of 
24  sanctuary laws.
25

difficult the government's preemption argument is here 

 And so one effect that 2(B) has is, on a 

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. CLEMENT:  They are removable.  I don't 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, could -- does 
Section 6 permit an officer to arrest an individual who

2  local officers telling you not to make those inquiries. 
3  You must have those inquiries. 
4
5
6  has overstayed a visitor's visa by a day?  They are 
7  removable, correct? 
8
9  think they would have committed a public offense --
absent a very unusual situation, I don't think they 
10
11 
would have committed a public offense under Arizona law. 
So I don't think there actually would be arrest 
12 
13 
authority in that circumstance, as Justice Alito's 
question has -- has --
14 
15
16 
17
 MR. CLEMENT:  A public offense definition --
18  it's actually -- it's a petition appendix -- well, I'm 
19  sorry.
20
21  something that is a crime in another jurisdiction and 
22  also a crime in Arizona.  And so what makes this kind of 
23  anomalous is, normally, if something is a crime in 
24  Arizona, there's arrest authority for that directly.
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What is the definition 

of public offense? 

 The definition is, basically, that it's

relationship. 

1  have committed a crime are no longer arrestable for the 
2  crime because they have served their sentence or some 
3  other peculiarity, but they are, nonetheless, removable 
4  because of the crime.  And so --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, maybe it's 
5
6  a good time to talk about some of the other sections, in 
7  particular Section 5(C). 
 Now, that does seem to expand beyond the 
8
9  Federal government's determination about the types of 
10
11 
12
13  Federal government, of course, prohibits the employment, 
14  but it also imposes sanctions with respect to 
application for work.  And the state of Arizona, in this 
15
16  case, is imposing some significantly greater sanctions. 
17
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, it's certainly imposing 
18  different sanctions.  I mean -- you know, it's -- it's a 
19  little bit -- kind of hard to weigh the difference 
between removability, which is obviously a pretty 
20
21  significant sanction for an alien, and the relatively 
22  modest penalties imposed by Section 5(C). 
23
24  something that there is no direct analog in Federal law. 
25

 But I take the premise that 5(C) does 

But I -- but that -- that's not enough to get you to 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And one of the things that makes 5(C), it 

1  preemption, obviously. 
2
3  seems to us, a weak case for preemption is that it only 
4  targets employment that is expressly forbidden by 
Federal law.  And so, then we look at -- you know, 
5
6  essentially, the government is reduced to arguing that 
7  because, in 1986, when Congress passed IRCA, it only 
8  focused on the employer's side of the equation and 
9  didn't, generally speaking, impose restrictions on 
employees, that, somehow, they are going to draw a 
10
11 
preemptive inference from that. 
12
13
14  that -- would you accept, as a working hypothesis, that 
we can begin with the general principle that the Hines 
15
16  v. Davidowitz language controls here, and we're going to 
17  ask our principal -- our primary function is to 
18  determine whether, under the circumstances of this 
19  particular case, Arizona's law stands as an obstacle to 
20
21  and objectives of Congress? 
22
23  standpoint?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you agree

test.  I mean, Justice Kennedy -- you know, there

 And here's why I don't think that --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but then the
 

1  obviously have been subsequent cases, including DeCanas 
2  that -- and Whiting, that give additional shape and 
3  color to that test, and -- but I don't have any -- I 
4  don't have any real quarrel with that test.
5
6
7  government on this section is going to come and say,
 
8  well, there may be -- this must be -- this -- the
 
9  enforcement of this statute, as Arizona describes it,
 
will be in considerable tension with our -- with our 
10
11 
basic approach; isn't that what I'm going to hear from 
12 
the government? 
13
14  hear, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think you just take 
15
16
17  itself, the SG said that that California statute was 
18  preempted.  And, in DeCanas, this Court didn't say, 
19  well, you know, we've got this language from Hines, and 
we have the SG telling us it's preempted, that's good 
20
21  enough for us.  They went beyond that, and they looked 
22  hard. 
23
24  this is an area where the presumption against preemption 
25

applies.  So that seems one strike in our favor. 

 And what they did is they established that 

 MR. CLEMENT:  It may be what you're going to 

the Federal government for its word on these things. 

 You know, it's interesting, in DeCanas 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 We have here a situation where there is an 

discussed, and explicitly rejected. 

So the only thing they have is this inference --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, for those of us 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  And --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The preemption language 

1
2  express preemption provision, and it -- it only 
3  addresses the employer's side of the ledger.  So the 
4  express preemption provision clearly doesn't apply here. 
5
6
7  for whom legislative history has some importance, there 
8  seems to be quite a bit of legislative history that 
9  the -- that the idea of punishing employees was raised, 
10
11
12
13  would be geared to what was decided to be punished. 
14  It seems odd to think that the Federal government is 
15
16  decided not to punish employees. 
17
18  there's a big difference between Congress deciding not 
19  as a matter of Federal law to address employees with an 
20
21  decision itself has preemptive effect.  That's a rather 
22  remarkable additional step. 
23
24  legislative history, for those who do, it really 
25

supports us because here's what Congress confronted.  I

 MR. CLEMENT:  But -- but, Justice Sotomayor, 

 And here's why I think, if you consider the

 At that point, here's the state of the 

here -- they illegally entered, so they are already 
subject to an independent criminal offense. 

 So, at that point, Congress is facing a 

 In addition, Congress was told that most of 

1  mean, they started thinking about this problem in 1971. 
2  They passed IRCA in 1986. 
3
4  world:  It's already unlawful, as a matter of Federal 
law, for the employee to get -- to have this unlawful 
5
6  work; and, if they seek this unlawful work, they are 
7  subject to removal for doing it. 
8
9  the aliens who get this unlawful work are already 
10
11 
12
13  world where the employee is already subject to multiple 
14  prohibitions.  The employer is completely scot-free as a 
matter of Federal law.  And so, at that point, in 1986, 
15
16  they address the employer's side of the equation.  They 
17  have an express preemption provision that says nothing 
18  about any intent of preempting the employee's side of 
19  the ledger.  And, in that, I don't think --
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

provide -- I mean, your position was the Federal 
legislation regulates the supply side.  That leaves the 
demand side open.  But there is regulation, and the 
question is whether anything beyond that is inconsistent 
with the -- the Federal -- it's not just that the person 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They did -- they did 

27

 So we have the -- what you call the supply 

more. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Two quick responses, and then 

actually assist in regulating the employer's side 
because what they are worried about is a fraudulent 
document that then is used, essentially, to trick the 
employer to employing somebody who shouldn't be 
employed.

1  is removable, but, if they use false documents in 
2  seeking work, that's a Federal crime. 
3
4  side is -- is regulated, but you want to regulate it 
5
6
7  I'd like to save time for rebuttal, Justice Ginsburg. 
 The first is that, if you look at what they 
8
9  regulate on the employee's side, it's really things that 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  IRCA as actually regulating part of the employee's side, 
17  then I think the more persuasive it is that the express 
18  preemption provision doesn't reach the employee's side 
19  of the equation.
20
21  plenty of rebuttal time, but I'd like to hear what you 
22  have to say about Section 3 before you sit down. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
23
24  I appreciate the opportunity to do that.  I do think, as 
25

 The second thing is the more that you view

 So it's, generally, not a fertile ground for 

1  provision that is parallel to the Federal requirements 
2  and imposes the same punishments as the Federal 
3  requirement. 
4
preemption.  But, of course, there are cases that find 
5
6  preemption even in those analogous circumstances.  They 
7  are the cases that the government is forced to rely on, 
8  cases like Buckman, cases like --
9
prosecutions be -- suppose that an alien were prosecuted 
10
11  under Federal law for violating, basically, the terms of 
12  3.  Could the states then prosecute him as well? 
13
14  general double jeopardy principles and the dual 
sovereignty doctrine.  Obviously, if that was a 
15
16  particular concern to you, that might be the basis for 
17  an as-applied challenge, if somebody was already 
18  prosecuted under Federal law. 
19
20
21  you had the statute of California that prohibited 
22  somebody operating as an interstate carrier without the 
23  ICC license.  It was raised -- you know, you have to let

exactly that argument, in California against Zook, where

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Clement, it 

you is Hines, which said the registration scheme --

 So I don't see the alien registration as a 
question of obstacle preemption, but appeal preemption 

1  prosecution.  And this Court rejected that argument 
2  there. 
3
4  seems that the -- I would think the largest hurdle for 
5
6  Congress enacted a complete registration scheme which 
7  the states cannot complement or impose even auxiliary 
8  regulations. 
9
10
11  that alien -- we don't want a competing registration 
12  scheme.  We want the registration scheme to be wholly 
13  Federal. 
14
think that's part of the reason why I accepted Justice 
15
16  Kennedy's characterization of the relevant language in 
17  Hines because, although there is some general discussion 
18  there of field preemption, when the Court actually 
19  states what its holding is, it does state it in terms of 
20
21
 And here's where I think there is a critical 
22  difference between what the Court had before it in Hines 
23  and what you have before you here. 
24
25

 In Hines, Pennsylvania passed its statute 
before Congress passed the alien registration statute. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

obstacle preemption.

registration law and the Federal registration law.  And 

those standards as its own, and then it imposed parallel 
penalties for the violation of the state equivalent. 
 And so I -- I think the right analysis is 

1  So, not surprisingly -- you know, they weren't -- they 
2  weren't soothsayers in Pennsylvania.  They couldn't 
3  predict the future.  So, when it got up here, there was 
4  a conflict between the provisions of the Pennsylvania 
5
6  this Court struck it down on that preemption basis. 
7
 Here it's quite different.  Arizona had 
8  before it the Federal statute.  It looked at this 
9  precise provision in the Federal statute.  It adopted 
10
11 
12
13  really the analysis that this Court laid out in its 
14  Whiting decision, which says that, in these kinds of 
cases, what you look for is whether or not the state 
15
16  scheme directly interferes with the operation of the 
17  Federal scheme. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I ask you something? 
18
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in that --
19
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito. 
20
21
 JUSTICE ALITO:  In that regard, we are told 
22  that there are some important categories of aliens who 
23  can't obtain registration -- cannot obtain Federal 
24  registration; and, yet, there are people that nobody 
25

would think should be removed.  I think someone with a

 How would Section 3 apply there? 
 MR. CLEMENT:  I think it probably wouldn't 

apply.  There's two provisions that might make it 

1  pending asylum application would fall into that 
2  category. 
3
4
5
6  inapplicable.  The first question you'd ask is whether 
7  that individual in that category would be subject to 
8  prosecution under 1304 and 1306.  And, if I 
9  understand -- you know, the Government's position, there 
are certain people where -- you know, they can't really 
10
11  get the registration document because of the narrow 
12  class that they are in. 
13
14  violation of either 1304 or 1306 to not get a 
15
16  one.  So you're not liable for the willful -- willful 
17  failure to get a registration document.  And, when you 
18  don't have a registration document to carry, you don't 
19  run afoul of 1306 in the --

4  can't be prosecuted for lack of a registration, if you 
5
6
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, if you're in -- no, if 
7  you're in the country lawfully, I mean, you can try to 
8  register.  And so somebody who enters illegally -- I 
9  mean, they are already guilty of one Federal misdemeanor 
10
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. 
11
12
 MR. CLEMENT:  But, at the point that they 
13  stay 30 days and don't try to register, then that's an 
14  independent violation.  And so maybe I need to fix what 
I said and say, look, if you're somebody who -- if you 
15
16  did go to register, would be told, you're fine, but we 
17  can't give you a registration document.  Then that

 Does that mean, in that situation, the 

Arizona law would not be preempted? 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think the mandatory 

which imposes civil penalties of up to $5000 a day on 
any official in the state of Arizona who is not 
following Section 2 or, as we read it, the rest of SB 
1070, to the maximum extent possible, does create a 
conflict.

1  illegally, they want to know about, and they want to do 
2  something about, in other words, different than the 
3  current policy.

6
7  character of the Arizona law and the mandatory character 
8  of the obligations it imposes, in -- especially as 
9  backed by this extraordinary provision in Section 2(H), 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  about Section 2 is to understand its relationship to the 
17  other provisions in the statute.  Section 2 is in the 
18  statute to identify the class of people who Arizona is 
19  then committed to prosecute under Section 3 and, if they 
20
21
22  question as the Chief Justice.  Suppose that the Federal 
23  government changed its priorities tomorrow, and it 
24  said -- they threw out the ones they have now.  And they 
25

said the new policy is maximum enforcement, we want to 

are employed, also under Section 5. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I have the same 

 But I do think the most fundamental point

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have any example 

where -- where enforcement discretion has the effect of 

1  know about every person who's stopped or arrested, we 
2  want -- we want to their immigration status verified. 
3  Would -- would the Arizona law then be un-preempted? 
4
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, I think it's still a 
problem, Your Honor.  These decisions have to be made at 
5
6  the national level because it's the national government 
7  and not -- it's the whole country and not an individual 
8  state that pays the price --
9
10
11  preempting state action? 
12
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I think we should 
13  think about Section 3 of the law, Your Honor.  I think 
14  it will help illustrate the point --
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22
23
24  here -- focusing for a moment on Section 3 -- the 
25

-- another case of ours where we've said that, 
essentially, the preemption of state law can occur, not 
by virtue of the Congress preempting, but because the 
executive doesn't want this law enforced so -- so 
rigorously, and that preempts the state from enforcing 
it vigorously. 

 Do we have any case that says that? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think the preemption 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm talking about another 

preemption here flows from judgments of Congress, from 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

judgments about how this law is going to be enforced --

to the Attorney General. 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  They -- they can make --

1  the registration system that Congress set up in Sections 
2  1301 through 1306, from the decision of Congress in 
3  Section 1103 in the law to vest the Secretary of DHS and 
4  the Attorney General with the authority to make the 
5
6
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, they do that with 
7  all -- with all Federal criminal statutes.  And you 
8  acknowledge that, as a general matter, states can 
9  enforce Federal criminal law, which is always entrusted 
10
11
12  they can engage in detention, in support of the 
13  enforcement of Federal law.  That's what the OLC opinion 
14  from 2002 says.  It does not say that they can prosecute 
under Federal law and make their own decisions.  That's 
15
16  a far different matter. 
17
18  what's wrong with Section 3 of this Act, in that --
19
20
21  to prosecute, but I don't see how Section 2(B) says 
22  anything about that at all.  All it does is notify the 
23  Federal government, here's someone who is here 
24  illegally, here's someone who is removable.  The 
25

that the Federal government has to have control over who 

discretion to prosecute for Federal immigration offenses 

 And it really goes to the heart, I think, of 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you say 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  So, apart 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's correct, but, with 

1  rests entirely with the Attorney General. 
2
3  respect to -- and I will -- let me address something 
4  fundamental about Section 2.  That is true, but I -- I 
think it doesn't get at the heart of the problem here. 
5
6
 The -- Section 1 of this statute says that 
7  Sections 2 and 3 and 5 are supposed to work together to 
8  achieve this policy of attrition through enforcement. 
9  And so what Section 2 does is identify a population that 
the state of Arizona is going to prosecute under Section 
10
11 
3 and Section 5 --
12
13  from Section 3 and Section 5, take those off the table, 
14  you have no objection to Section 2?
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  We do, Your Honor.  But, 
15
16  before I take 3 and 5 off the table, if I could make one 
17  more point about 3 and 5, please?  The -- I think --
18  because I think it's important to understand the dilemma 
19  that this puts the Federal government in.
20
21  they've -- and they're, by law, committed to maximum 
22  enforcement.  And so the Federal government's got to 
23  decide, are we going to take our resources, which we 
24  deploy for removal, and are we going to use them to deal 
with this population, even if it is to the detriment of 
25

 Arizona has got this population, and

 And what the state is saying, here are 

2(B). 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Here's the other 

1  our priorities --
2
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Exactly.  You -- the 
3  Federal government has to decide where it's going to use 
4  its resources.
5
6  people who are here in violation of Federal law, you 
7  make the decision.  And if your decision is you don't 
8  want to prosecute those people, fine, that's entirely up 
9  to you.  That's why I don't see the problem with Section 
10
11
12  half -- here's the other half of the equation, Mr. Chief 
13  Justice, which is that they say, if you're not going to 
14  remove them, we are going to prosecute them.  And that 
15
16  of why this needs to be an exclusive national power --
17
18  and Section 5. 
19
what you're talking about is taking somebody whose --
20
21  whose only offense is being unlawfully present in the 
22  country and putting them in jail for up to 6 months, or 
23  somebody who --
24
25

means that the -- and I think this does get at the heart 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Only under Section 3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

 For the notification, what could possibly be

find out if this person is here illegally because the 
Federal law says the Federal agency has to answer my 
question. 

1
2  forgive me.  6 months for employment. 
3
4  Right.
5
6  wrong, if Arizona arrests someone, let's say for drunk 
7  driving, and their policy is you're going to stay in 
8  jail overnight, no matter what, okay?  What's wrong, 
9  during that period, by having the Arizona arresting

individual cases in which the state can call the Federal 
government and say, is this person here illegally?

2
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  I don't think so, 
3  Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- I think the problem 
4  here is in that -- is in every circumstance, as a result 
5
6  section 2(H), the state official must pursue the 
7  priorities that the state has set, irrespective of 
8  whether they are helpful to or in conflict with the 
9  Federal priorities.  And so --

23  problem at the border --

every -- suppose every law enforcement officer in 
Arizona saw things exactly the same way as the Arizona 
legislature.  And so, without any direction from the 
legislature, they all took it upon themselves to make 
these inquiries every time they stopped somebody or 
arrested somebody. 

 Would that be a violation of Federal law? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, it wouldn't be,

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think there are three.

2  be released for being simply an illegal alien, what's 
3  wrong with that? 
4
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Taking out the other 
5
6  provisions, taking out any independent state-created 
7  basis of liability for being an -- an illegal alien? 
8
9  The first is the -- the Hines problem of harassment.
 Now, we are not making an allegation of 
10
11  racial profiling; nevertheless, there are already tens 
12  of thousands of stops that result in inquiries in 
13  Arizona, even in the absence of SB 1070.  It stands to 
14  reason that -- that the legislature thought that that

 And it -- given that you have a population 
17  in Arizona of 2 million Latinos, of whom only 400,000,

24  enforce them is still entirely up to you.  If you don't 
want to do this, you just tell the person at LESC -- if

7  it's -- oh, he's illegal.  Okay.  Thanks.  Good-bye. 
 I mean, why -- it is still your decision. 
8
9  And, if you don't want to know who is in this country 
10
11
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's correct.  But the 
12  process of -- the process of cooperating to enforce the 
13  Federal immigration law starts earlier.  And it starts 
14  with the process of making the decisions about who to --
who to stop, who to apprehend, who to check on.  And the 
15
16  problem -- the structural problem we have is that those 
17  decisions -- in the making of those decisions, Arizona 
18  officials are not free --
19
person is already stopped for some other reason.  He's 
20
21  stopped for going 60 in a 20.  He's stopped for drunk 
22  driving.  So that decision to stop the individual has 
23  nothing to do with immigration law at all.  All that has 
24  to do with immigration law is the -- whether or not they 
25

effort to -- to focus on the priorities of identifying 
serious criminals, so that they can be removed from the

 If that were the situation, and we said it 

had to be the situation, then what in the Federal

15
16  enacted in 1996, along with 1357.  And 1357 is the 
17  provision that sets forth the powers and authorities of 
18  Federal immigration officials. 
19
20
21  Attorney General, can deputize state officials, so long 
22  as they're -- they obtain adequate training, and they 
23  are subject to the direction and control of the Attorney 
24  General in carrying out immigration functions.
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think -- I understand 

the question.  And I think the answer is this:  1373 was 

 It contains 1357(g), which effectively says 

that Federal -- that the Federal government, the 

 Then the last provision, (g)(10), says that 

55

focus on cooperation. 

1  nothing that we've said so far should be read to -- to 
2  preclude informal cooperation, communication or other 
3  informal cooperation in the apprehension, detention, and 
4  removal of unlawfully present persons, but it's the 
5
6
 And I think you have to -- so I don't think 
7  you can read into 1373 the -- the conclusion that what 
8  Congress was intending to do was to shift from the 
9  Federal government to the states the authority to set 
enforcement priorities because I think the cooperation 
10
11 
in this context is cooperation in the service of the 
12 
Federal enforcement. 
13
14  question?  I think even I or someone else cut you off 
15
16
17  that a systematic cooperation is wrong -- you can see 
18  it's not selling very well.  Why don't you try to come 
19  up with something else?
20
21  to you, it's not that it's forcing you to change your 
22  enforcement priorities.  You don't have to take the 
23  person into custody.  So what's left of your argument? 
24
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  So let me -- let me just 
summarize what I think the three are, and then maybe I 
25

when you said there were three reasons why -- 2(B). 
 Putting aside your argument that this --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- please move more --
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  With respect to -- in 

Federal law, but not answerable to the Federal 
officials.

2
3  we think the harassment argument -- we think this is a 
4  more significant harassment problem than was present in 
5
6
7
8  addition, we do think that there is a structural 
9  accountability problem, in that they are enforcing 
10
11 
12
13  impediments, in that the -- the result of this is to 
14  deliver to the Federal system a volume of inquiries that 
15
16  priority persons are for removal. 
 So those are the three reasons. 
17
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General, you have 
18
19  been trying valiantly to get us to focus on Section 3, 
20
21
22  Justice. 
23
24  Section 3 is that we -- is that Section 3 is purporting 
to enforce a Federal registration requirement.  That's a 
25

makes it harder and not easier to identify who the 

so maybe we should let you do that now. 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

 The -- I do think the key thing about 

57
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And I do think -- I think it's very 

 The -- if you are -- if you have come into 

categories of people.  I think it's -- it is quite 
important to get clarity on that. 

1  relationship between the alien and the United States
 
2  government that's exclusively a Federal relationship.
 
3  It's governed by the terms of 1301 through 1306.
 
 And the way in which those terms are
 
4
enforced does have very significant Federal interest at 
5
6  its heart.  And there is no state police power interest 
7  in that Federal registration relationship. 
8
9  important -- Justice Alito raised the question of these 
10
11 
12
13  the country unlawfully, but you have a pending 
14  application for asylum, a pending application for 
temporary protective status, because you -- you would 
15
16  have to be removed to a country to which you can't be 
17  removed, because of the conditions in the country, if 
18  you have a valid claim for relief under the Violence 
19  Against Women Act based on your treatment, if you have a 
valid claim for relief because you are a victim of human 
20
21  trafficking, if you have a valid claim for relief 
22  because you are the victim of a crime or a witness to a 
23  crime, all of those persons are in technical violation 
24  of 1306(a).
25

 And -- and it seems to me.  They -- they are 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, maybe 1306(a) ought 

1  in violation of 1306(a), so my friend, Mr. Clement, just 
2  is not correct in saying that those are people who 
3  aren't in violation of 1306(a) and, therefore, aren't in 
4  violation of -- of Section 3.  They are in violation.
5
6  to be amended, then.  I mean, we have statutes out there 
7  that there a lot of people in violation of it and --
8  well, the Attorney General will take care of it.  Is 
9  that how we write our criminal laws?
10
11  situation in which no reasonable person would think that 
12  the individual ought to be prosecuted.  And, yet, very 
13  often, the states aren't even going to know, in fact, 
14  about asylum status.  They can't know because there are 
15
16  avoid retaliation against the person making the 
17  application. 
18
19  think, a very strong illustration of why the enforcement 
discretion over Section 3 needs to be vested exclusively 
20
21  in the Federal government. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Again, I ask you, do you 
22
23  have any other case in which the basis for preemption 
24  has been you are interfering with -- with the Attorney 
25

regulations that require that to be kept private, to 

General's enforcement discretion? 

59
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  But -- but it's a 

 And so, this -- so this is -- this is, I 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think what is 

they are doing it for a reason --

It's the Federal bank example --

Official 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, this is --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think that's an 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not criminalizing 

1
2
3  extraordinary basis for saying that the state is 
4  preempted.
5
6  extraordinary about this, actually, Justice Scalia, is 
7  the state's decision to enact a statute purporting to 
8  criminalize the violation of a Federal registration 
9  obligation.  And I think that's the problem here.  And 
10
11
12  anything that isn't criminal under Federal law. 
13
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  But -- but what --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's -- it's the bank. 
14
15
16
17
18  criminalizes the same thing that the Federal law does. 
19
20
21
 What they are doing here is using 1306(a) to 
22  get at the status of unlawful presence.  The only people 
23  who can be prosecuted under Section 3 are people who are 
24  unlawfully present in the country.  That's what the 
statute says.  And they are using it to get at that 
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- a state law, which 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think it's quite 

different. 

60
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And the immigration function is to try to --

over and over again.  And the point of this provision is 
to drive unlawfully present people out of the state of 
Arizona. 

1  category of people, to, essentially, use their state 
2  criminal law to perform an immigration function. 
3
4  to prosecute these people.  And, by the way, you can 
prosecute somebody, they can be put in jail for 30 days 
5
6  here.  But, under Federal law, a violation of 1306(a) is 
7  a continuing offense. 
 So the day they get out of jail for that 30 
8
9  days, they can be arrested again.  And this can happen 
10
11 
12 
13
14  well, assume these are two hypothetical -- two 
15
16
 First, the Federal government has said, we 
17  simply don't have the money or the resources to enforce 
18  our immigration laws the way we wish.  We wish we could 
19  do so, but we don't have the money or the resources. 
20
21
22  brief, didn't you? 
23
24  is that the state of Arizona has -- has a massive 
25

emergency with social disruption, economic disruption, 

That's the first -- just hypothetical. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You said that in your

other state wouldn't have? 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Of course, they have 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And can they go to their 

legislature and say, we're concerned about this, and ask 

1  residents leaving the state because of flood of 
2  immigrants.  Let's just assume those two things. 
 Does that give the state of Arizona any

14  the laws of general application that are on the books. 
15
16  that they are under no obligation to provide any state

 But I think, most importantly, they can --

19  think they are going to do in Arizona is something quite 
extraordinary, that has significant real and practical 
20
21  foreign relations effects.  And that's the problem, and 
22  it's the reason why this power needs to be vested 
23  exclusively in the Federal government. 
24
25

state says, well, that may be your priorities, but most 
of these people that you're not going after -- or an 
inordinate percentage of them, are here in our state, 
and we don't like it.  They are causing all sorts of 
problems.  So we're going to help you enforce Federal 
law.  We're not going to do anything else.  We're just 
enforcing Federal law. 

 They -- what they are going to do is engage, 

effectively, in mass incarceration because the

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well -- well, what I

relations problems. 

 And these problems are real.  It is the 

in Section 3 and in Section 5. 

 And so -- so you're going to have a 

1  obligation under Section 2(H), of course, is not merely 
2  to enforce Section 2 to the fullest possible extent at 
3  the -- at the risk of civil fine, but to enforce Federal

19  to be -- but these -- this Court has said, over and over

19  for 60 minutes before it takes the 10 minutes to process

21  minutes.  And --
22
23  wasn't sure about your answer to Justice Kennedy.

focused on people who are here illegally, as opposed to 

the call.  So the average time is 70 minutes, not 10 

GENERAL VERRILLI: 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 


Yes, and I --
-- figure out if 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I had a little --

 Is the reason that the government is not

While I'm at it, there is

 You suggested that if the -- every illegal 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, it's a little more 

that that would cause tensions with other governments. 

1  the other categories you were talking about, because of 
2  prioritization or because of lack of resources? 
3
4  alien that you identify is either removed or prosecuted, 
5
6  So I -- I don't understand if it's because you don't 
7  have enough resources or because you don't want to 
8  prosecute the people who are simply here illegally, as 
9  opposed to something else.
10
11  complicated than that.  I think the -- the point is 
12  this:  That with respect to persons who are unlawfully 
13  present, there are some who are going to fall in our 
14  priority categories.  There are those who have committed 
serious offenses.  There are those who have been removed 
15
16  and have come back.  And there are other priority 
17  categories. 
18
19  there are only so many beds in the detention centers and 
20
21  those priority categories, find them, remove them. 
22
23  individuals who are here in violation, technically, of 
24  1306(a), but who have a valid asylum application or 
25

application for temporary protected status or other --

 Because we have resource constraints and 

only so many immigration judges, we want to focus on 

 There is a second category, and that is, 

68
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And then there is an additional category of 

people who are not in the second category and not 

3, raises a significant foreign relations problem. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can't you avoid that 

1  and, with respect to those persons that we think 
2  would -- it's affirmatively harmful to think that they 
3  ought to be prosecuted. 
4
5
6  priorities, and the form and we think there, the idea 
7  that an individual state will engage in a process of 
8  mass incarceration of that population, which we do think 
9  is what Section 2(H) commits Arizona to do under Section 
10
11
12  particular foreign relations problem by simply deporting 
13  these people?  Free them from the jails --
14
15
16 
17
18
19  that?
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, a couple of things. 
20
21  First is I don't think it's realistic to assume that the 
22  aggressive enforcement of Sections 3 and 5 in Arizona is 
23  going to lead to a mass migration back to countries of 
24  origin.  It seems a far more likely outcome is going to 
be migration to other states.  And that's a significant 
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  This is a -- this is a --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the problem with 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Look -- I really think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And send them back to the 

countries that are -- that are objecting. 

69

 Beyond that, I do think, you know, the --

 In addition, we have very significant issues 

Mexico is in a central role in this situation. 

 Between 60 and 70 percent of the people that 

1  problem.  That's part of the reason why this problem
 
2  needs to be managed on a national basis.
 
3
4  it's worth bearing in mind here that the country of
 
5
6
7  we remove every year, we remove to Mexico.  And, in 
8  addition, we have to have the cooperation of the 
9  Mexicans.  And I think, as the Court knows from other 
cases, the cooperation of the country to whom we are --
10
11 
to which we are removing people who are unlawfully 
12 
present is vital to be able to make removal work. 
13
14  on the border with Mexico.  And, in fact, they are the 
15
16  that --
17
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So we -- we have to -- we 
18  have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please 
19  Mexico?  Is that what you're saying?

very issues that Arizona is complaining about, in

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It sounded like what you 

70
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Nothing in the law requires you to do that. 

1  an exclusive national power.  It's because the entire 
2  country feels the effects of a decision -- conduct by an 
3  individual state.  And that's why the -- the power needs 
4  to be exercised at the national level and not the state

6
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And your concern is 
7  the problems that would arise in bilateral relations if 
8  you remove all of these people -- or a significant 
9  percentage or a greater percentage than you are now.

11
 All it does is lets you know where -- that 
12  an illegal alien has been arrested, and you can decide, 
13  we are not going to initiate removal proceedings against 
14  that individual.  It doesn't require you to remove one

17
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right, but the problem 
18  I'm focused on -- we're focused on, Mr. Chief Justice, 
19  is not our removal decisions, but Arizona's decision to 
incarcerate, and the foreign relations problem that that

6  I haven't said anything about Section 5 yet.  And I 
7  don't want to tax the Court's patience, but if I could 
8  spend a minute on Section 5? 
9
10
11  fundamental point about Section 5 here is that, in 1986, 
12  Congress fundamentally changed the landscape.  Congress 
13  made a decision in 1986 to make the employment of aliens 
14  a central concern of national immigration policy.  And 
15
16  regime. 
17
18  that it may be a comprehensive regime for employers; 
19  it's not a comprehensive regime for employees.  And, 
therefore, it's -- there ought not be any inference here 
20
21  that the states are precluded from criminalizing efforts 
22  to seek or obtain employment in Arizona. 
23
24  The -- employment is one problem.  And Congress tackled 
25

 But I really think that's not right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- think field preemption; 

is that your argument with respect to this section? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  It's -- it's both.  I 

1  comprehensive decision, about this -- the sanctions it 
2  thought were appropriate to govern.  And Congress did, 
3  as Justice Ginsburg suggested, make judgments with 
4  respect to the circumstances under which employees could 
be held criminally liable, as well as the circumstances 
5
6  under which employers could be held liable. 
7
8  the judgments Congress actually made --
9
10
11
12  think we're making both a field and a conflict 
13  preemption argument here, Justice Scalia.  And the --
14  and the -- I think it's worth examining the specific 
15
16
 On the employer's side -- and, after all, 
17  this is a situation in which the concern here is that 
18  the employer is in a position of being the exploiter and 
19  the -- the alien of being the exploited -- on the 
employer's side, Congress said that states may not 
20
21  impose criminal sanctions, and even -- and the Federal 
22  government will not impose criminal sanctions for the 
23  hiring of employees, unless there's a pattern or 
24  practice.
25

 It seems quite incongruous to think that 

judgments Congress made in 1986. 

73
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 The -- in addition, Congress made clear in 

1  Congress, having made that judgment and imposed those
 
2  restrictions on the employer's side, would have left
 
3  states free to impose criminal liability on employees
 
4  merely for seeking work, for doing what you, I think,
 
would expect most otherwise law-abiding people to do, 
5
6  which is to find a job, so they can feed their families. 
7  So I think that's -- that's a significant problem. 
8
9  the law that the I-9 form could not be used for any 
other purpose than prosecutions for violation of the 
10
11 
Federal antifraud requirements.  And, if Congress wanted 
to leave states free to impose criminal sanctions on 
12 
13 
employees for seeking work, they wouldn't have done 
that, it seems to me.
14 
 So there, I think there are strong 
15
16  indicators in the text that Congress did make a 
17  judgment, and the judgment was this far and no farther. 
18  And it's reasonable that Congress would have done so, 
19  for the same kinds of foreign relations concerns that I 
was discussing with -- with respect to Section 3.  It 
20
21  would be an extraordinary thing to put someone in jail 
22  merely for seeking work.  And, yet, that's what Arizona 
23  proposes to do under Section 5 of its law. 
24

 Now, of course, there is an express 
preemption provision, but the express preemption

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

1  provision, as this Court has said many times, does not 
2  operate to the exclusion of implied preemption, field or 
3  conflict.  So we do think those principles apply here. 
 We think there's a reason why the express 
4
5
6  which is that, after DeCanas, laws had been enacted on 
7  the employer's side, and with -- Congress was making 
8  clear that those were preemptive, there were no laws on 
9  the employee's side at the time and, therefore, no

14

19  and may it please the Court:
 I'd like to start, briefly, with the 
20
21  enforcement issues and then talk about the other 
22  provisions.  The last thing I'll say about the 
23  enforcement provision, since I do think that the 
24  Government's rather unusual theory that something that's 
25

okay when done ad hoc becomes preempted when it's

 But I will say one thing, which is to just 

information on which to bring their enforcement 

turn out to be the most serious of offenders. 

 And so if you preclude officers, as happened 

1  systematic.  I think that theory largely refutes itself. 
2
3  echo that there is no interference with enforcement 
4  priorities by simply giving the Federal government 
5
6  priorities to bear.  And this is really illustrated by a 
7  point this Court made in its Florence decision earlier 
8  this month, which is that, sometimes, you pull somebody 
9  over for the most innocuous of infractions, and they 
10
11
12  in Phoenix, from communicating with the Federal 
13  government, the Federal government will not be able to 
14  identify the worst of the worst.  And if you want an 
example of this, look at the declaration of Officer 
15
16  Brett Glidewell at Joint Appendix 183 to 186.  He pulled 
17  somebody over in a routine traffic stop and was shot by 
18  the individual. 
19
20
21  guilty of illegal reentry into the United States.  He 
22  was stopped on three previous occasions and his status 
23  was not verified.  Now, if it had been, he certainly 
24  would have been apprehended.  In at least two of the 
25

wanted for attempted murder in El Salvador and was also 

stops, his immigration status wasn't checked because of 

 Now, the individual, it turns out, was

 Now, if the state, I submit, can do 

 As to Section 3, two points about that, one 
is, I respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General 

1  the city policy, city of Phoenix. 
2
3  anything, it can, at the state level, override those 
4  kind of local policies and say, that's not what we want. 
Community policing is all well and good, but we want to 
5
6  maximize communication with the Federal authorities.  So 
7  I think the enforcement policy and priorities argument 
8  simply doesn't work. 
9
10
11  as to whether the various things that he led off -- read 
12  off, the litany of situations where somebody is --
13  technically doesn't have registration would be a 
14  violation of 1306(a).
15
16  provision says a willful failure to register.  Now, 
17  maybe the prosecutors take the view that there is 
18  willfulness in those circumstances, but I don't think 
19  many judges would.  I think they would say that, if 
20
21  perfectly fine here and you don't need to register, that 
22  that would be good enough to defeat a finding of 
23  willfulness.  So I don't think 1306(a) covers this case. 
24

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, you may say we're 

1  talking about because what's going to happen, now, is 
2  that, if there is no statement by the Federal agency of 
3  legality, the person is arrested, and, now, we're going 
4  to have Federal resources spent on trying to figure out 
5
6  have this, whether they have that, whether they are 
7  exempted under this reason, whether the failure to carry 
8  was accidental or not -- I mean, you are involving the 
9  Federal government in your prosecution.
10
11
12  not because all we're going to show is -- what?  That we 
13  got a Federal call -- we got a Federal answer that the 
14  person wasn't registered?
 MR. CLEMENT:  No, we're going to say that we 
15
16  communicated with the Federal immigration officials, and 
17  they told us this is somebody who's perfectly fine and 
18  doesn't have to register.  The --
19
Confrontation -- no Confrontation Clause problem with 
20
21  that?  With relying on a call to a Federal agency and 
22  the police officer says, you're arrested, you're 
23  charged, it's not an illegal alien -- or it is an 
24  illegal alien.

get the records that show that this person is an illegal

3  I do want to be clear about --
4
5
6  it's an illegal alien? 
7
8  under Section 3 and then --
9
10
11  alien that's not authorized to be here? 
12
 MR. CLEMENT:  I --
13
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Who do they get it from? 
14
 MR. CLEMENT:  I think they would get it from 
the Federal authorities.  I think it would be admitted. 
15
16  There might be a challenge in that case.  I mean -- you 
17  know, this is a facial challenge.  I'm not going to try 
18  to address that potential Sixth Amendment issue. 
19
20
21  government keeps its records, so that there's lots of 
22  people that really should be registered, but aren't, I 
23  can't imagine that sloppiness has a preemptive effect. 
24
 The second thing I would say is that I do 
think, in thinking about Section 3 in particular, the

One, if there is some sloppiness in the way the Federal

1  analogy is not the fraud on the FDA claim in Buckman.
 
2  It's really the state tort law that says that it's a
 
3  violation of state tort law to not even seek the
 
4  approval that's needed under the FDA for a device.

 Now, states impose tort law for people that 
5
6  market a device without getting the necessary approval. 
7  And nobody thinks that's preempted because it serves the 
8  Federal interest.  It doesn't have a deluge of 
9  information.  It forces people to get FDA approval.
 And in the same way, this state law will 
10
11  force people to register, which is what the Federal 
12  government is supposed to want in the first place, so 
13  there is no preemption there.  There is no conflict. 
14

16
17  sentence. 
18
19  government was not agnostic about unlawful employment by 
aliens.  The employees were already covered, and they 
20
21  were subject to deportation.  So the government said, 
22  we're going to cover the employers for the first time. 
23  I can't imagine why that would have preemptive effect.
