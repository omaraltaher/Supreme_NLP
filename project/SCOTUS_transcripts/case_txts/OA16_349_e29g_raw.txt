CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next in Case 16-349, Henson v. Santander Consumer USA, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Incorporated. 

            

Mr. Russell. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act 

 

 

 

 

 

applies to debt collectors.  Debt collector is defined 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Act as the most relevant here to include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals who regularly collect debts owed or due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another. 

            

When Respondent Santander was originally 

 

 

 

 

hired to collect Petitioners' defaulted car loans, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no question that it was collecting the debt owed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or due another under anyone's interpretation of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term.  The question in this case is whether that changed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when Santander purchased an assignment of that debt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Fourth Circuit held that it did, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrongly, based on its interpretation of the key phrase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"owed or due another," which is used twice in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of debt collector, once in the principal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

definition, and again in the Clause (F) exceptions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

The problem with that interpretation is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it cannot be squared with the use of the same phrase in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Clause (F) exceptions, particularly with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause (F)(iv).  With the Court's indulgence, I would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

like to walk through that exception.  And it's found on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 4A of the appendix to the blue brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As I mentioned, this is an exception for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

somebody who otherwise qualifies as a debt collector 

   

 

 

 

 

 

under the main definition for somebody who is collecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a debt owed or due another.  And that same requirement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is repeated at the beginning of Clause (F).  It has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be somebody -- any person collecting or attempting to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect a debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another, and then it says to the extent such activity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meets one of four qualifications. 

 

 

 

 

            

And the one I want to focus on is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fourth, and that applies to somebody who's engaged in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity concerning a debt obtained by such person as a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secured party in a commercial credit transaction 

   

 

 

 

 

involving the creditor. 

 

 

            

Now, I think the parties agree with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

FTC's interpretation of this.  This is applying to a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation in which a company, like a car dealership, has 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

gotten a commercial loan from a bank and put up as

collateral the debts that it's owed by its customers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

say, car loans. 

 

 

            

The only circumstance in which that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity is ever going to be collecting on a consumer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt, which is required at the beginning of Clause (F), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that they've either foreclosed on the collateral, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which case under the UCC, they will send a notice to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the consumers saying we have been assigned this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt; start sending the debt to us.  And if the consumer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asks for it, they have to send proof of the assignment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Or if the assignment was given to them at the outset as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the secured credit transaction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The problem for Respondents is that in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either case, the bank is only ever going to be doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what a debt purchaser does, which is collecting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the consumers a debt that has been assigned to it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and keeping it on its own account. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Respondent's only answer to this is to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this -- no, no, this is a provision that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed at the bank that is simply holding the debts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as collateral.  But that can't be right, because at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very beginning of (F)(iv) -- or (F) -- and Congress made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear that the exception only applies to somebody who is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually collecting or attempting to collect a debt. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

And somebody who is simply holding a collateral is not

collecting or attempting to collect the consumer debts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, as a consequence, adopting Respondent's 

   

 

 

 

6 

interpretation that somebody who's collecting on its own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account through an assignment, as a debt purchaser does, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the commercial creditor does in the scenario we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just described, in our view, they're not collecting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt owed or due another.  And as a consequence, they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot be the person to whom Congress is referring in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection (F)(iv).  It is an exception that not only is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely surplusage and a null set, it's a -- an 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

exception that renders itself surplusage.  The beginning 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the -- the requirement makes it impossible to satisfy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the second set of requirements in (F) -- at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bottom of (F)(iv). 

 

 

            

            

Our interpretation --

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

understand that argument.  And I -- I think you're 

   

   

  

 

 

 

right.  It is -- is one that the Respondent has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address.  But going back a step earlier than that, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual text, I mean, your friend makes the point that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your reading gives a different tense to "owed" as it --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than it does to "due."  You read "owed" as referring to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the past; you read "due" as referring to the present, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that's -- that's unusual. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  I don't think it's that

unusual.  I don't think we would be surprised, for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, if this phrase read "debts owed or owing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another."  In that circumstance, it would be perfectly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

grammatical, and it would be clear that Congress was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about the "another," not about the time frame, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that the point of it was to exclude creditors who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are collecting debts that they originated themselves. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  "Owing" is not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

common word that's used in that context, though. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  But -- but exactly.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

why Congress would use "due."  Instead of "owed or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owing," it used "owed or due."  And we think that that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly a permissible interpretation. 

   

 

            

And once we reach that point, then it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes important, particularly when the same phrase is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used again in another part of the definition, to adopt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an interpretation that, while it may not be the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one that come to mind the first time it's used, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still need to have an interpretation that allows the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same words to do work when repeated later in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection. 

            

What we have here is, I think, fundamentally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is that the word "owed" is a participle that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous.  It is a participle that can both be a past 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

participle, referring to a prior time frame, or a

present participle, referring to the present.

This Court encountered a very similar set of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

words in Robinson v. Shell Oil where it was trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide whether Title VII, which prohibits an employer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from retaliating against its -- its employees, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that meant its current employees or could also mean its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

former employees. 

 

            

One of the things the Court did, although it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized that kind of on first blush you would think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current employees, is it looked at the statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of "employee."  And there, "employee" was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defined as an individual employed by an employer.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you had individual employed.  It's the same structure: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

A noun modified by a gerund -- or by a participle that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is in the past tense, but could refer either to somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previously employed or somebody currently employed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the Respondent in that case made the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same argument that Respondent makes in this case, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that it must refer to somebody who is currently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employed.  This Court unanimously rejected that 

  

 

 

 

 

assertion out of hand and ultimately went and looked at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the use of the word "employee" elsewhere in the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and concluded that it can refer to both. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that's all we're asking the Court to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case as well is to recognize --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Russell, do you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

few examples -- I -- I suspect you've thought of this --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just of sentences which use the word "owed" to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean what you want it to mean in this case, without any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

other context clues? 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  You can talk about somebody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

collecting a debt owed another.  And then the context 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

could make clear that it was a debt that had been paid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

off or discharged in bankruptcy. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  But you wouldn't 

  

  

 

 

 

think that, right?  I mean, I'm just wondering 

    

 

 

 

 

 

whether -- and I -- I understand that you have your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

superfluidity argument, which is, in your view, a kind 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of context clue.  But if you just look at the language, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- can you come up with any sentence which -- which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points toward your reading rather than towards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Shanmugam's? 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  So, I mean, we've given a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

couple examples in our reply brief.  You know, we can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speak of somebody who regularly collects debts that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created by somebody else and even in that context, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think you could refer to that as a debt owed. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Another -- I acknowledge that this maybe isn't the first 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation that leaps to mind, but I do think that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, when you encounter a phrase like this, it's

not unambiguous.  It can refer --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, usually, when we think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

about ambiguous phrases, you know, we can say, well, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could say this sentence and then it would mean X.  Or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you could say this sentence and then it would mean Y. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But my problem when I think about this word 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that I can never get it to mean what you want it to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, no matter --

MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I give you the example, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

if Congress had said a debt collector is somebody who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regularly collects debts owed or owing another, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would be a perfectly grammatical sentence.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Congress might not want to use "owing" because it is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awkward, archaic use. 

 

 

            

But I think, you know, when -- when you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

confront a -- a provision like this, you have to end up 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at the use in both contexts.  And the only way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to give the -- the Clause (F) any meaning is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret it in a -- what might be the less natural way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the first place. 

 

 

 

            

It's also a necessary way to interpret the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute to give meaning to the way -- or to -- to

respect the way that Congress has dealt with other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

assignees, because we recognize that Congress probably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't have the debt-buying industry in mind when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrote this statute.  But it did have other assignees in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind.  And particularly credit -- debt servicers, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

common in the -- the mortgage industry, for example, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing to be performed by somebody else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And Congress provided in Clause (F)(iii) 

 

 

 

 

 

that somebody who was assigned -- somebody who obtains a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt after it has gone in default is subject to the act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's -- it's very common for debt servicers -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody agrees that this a provision, (F)(iii), that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

about debt servicers -- it's very common for mortgage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicers to obtain assignments of debts after it's gone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into a default, precisely because they need it in order 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be able to enforce the debt in court, to file a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit to collect or to foreclose on a mortgage. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is this -- is -- as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case comes to us, we're not addressing the status of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Santander as a debt servicer, though. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  That's correct.  My point here 

  

  

 

 

 

 

is simply a structural one, and that is, that Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly contemplated that some assignees would be debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collectors, notwithstanding the fact that they are

collecting a debt assigned to them by somebody else, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

which is all that a debt purchase is, it's an assignment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the debt for value. 

 

 

 

 

            

And Congress said that if a -- if a -- a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mortgage servicer is assigned a debt after it's gone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

into a default, Congress intended for them to be treated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a debt collector.  But under Respondent's view, that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

actually isn't going to be what happens, because a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mortgage servicer, as soon as they obtain an assignment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under their view, they're collecting debt owed and due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves, not owed and due another. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so we end up with this situation with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause (F)(iii) provision.  And, actually, it only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

applies to a mortgage servicer who has a contract to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

collect a debt, but not if they've been assigned to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt.  And they're particularly likely, as I mentioned, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to be assigned a debt if they obtain it after default, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they need to have that assignment in order to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the things that their customer wants them to do for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, which is to file a lawsuit. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And I don't see a problem 

   

   

  

 

 

with -- with (F)(iii).  The -- the party is attempting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to collect a debt owed or due to someone else, and it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns a debt which was obtained.  And -- and if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtained, it doesn't mean owed.  You can obtain a debt

that you don't own.  I don't see any problem with 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(F)(iii). 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  So there's -- there's two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problems with that.  I -- I disagree with that reading 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

of "obtained."  I don't think it's a very natural 

    

   

 

 

 

 

interpretation of it.  But what it means, that -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the reading you're suggesting is that an assignee, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a debt servicer who has an assignment, would not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered if they are assigned that debt after default. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I think that does quite a bit of violence to how 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress intended the statute to operate.  There's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for Congress to have thought that it made a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference with respect to the risk that a servicer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

poses to consumers, whether they have been simply hired 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on a contract to collect a debt --

   

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would they not be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

covered if they acquired the debt before it went into --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm sorry -- after it went into default?  They would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collecting a debt owed -- owed or due to someone else. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And they acquired the debt after it went into default; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, they don't fall into (iii). 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  Well, in Respondent's view, 

  

 

 

 

 

somebody who is collecting on an assignment is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collecting a debt that is owed themselves.  So if the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion is that an assignee is not collecting a debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

owed itself --

 

 

14 

            

that? 

            

my limit. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where -- where do they say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. RUSSELL:  I mean, I've approached 

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  The (iv) is 

  

  

 

 

 

Mr. Smith owes some money to a Company Jones, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company Jones assigns the debt to a servicing company, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

all right?  And so the servicing company might have --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be -- it might be said, you can use it this way.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtained the debt from Company Jones. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so somebody might say that this assignee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is collecting a debt from Smith, that Smith owes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

another, namely Jones.  But we don't want to cover them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this statute.  We don't want to cover that kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt collector.  So they write (iv). 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And the same is true of (iii).  They write 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) because they don't want mortgage -- mortgage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicers to be falling within the statute, unless, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, the mortgage servicer is serving a dead 

   

 

 

 

 

 

mortgage.  Then why shouldn't they?  All right?  Now, 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

that reasoning doesn't seem, to me, illogical. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On the other hand, if we take your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasoning, you have to interpret this is, so I was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking of examples.  And I thought, well, what about

one of these companies that goes and buys up other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

companies, turns them around, and sells them.  When they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy a company, they buy the -- the receivables.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

while they own the company, they're going to collect the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receivables.  And so there they are.  You see?  On your 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition, those receivables were once owed the company 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they're bought.  So on your definition, that whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category of people falls within the definition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it seems to me, although you point to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems, they are not insuperable problems with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word "obtained."  Or if I accept your definition of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

"is," I get into a lot of difficulties.  Now, that --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that was where -- I'm not saying that's my final view of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  I'm just saying, how do you respond? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  So let me address your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

difficulties, and then let me explain why, I think, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems on the other side are greater than you seem to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that they are. 

 

 

 

            

The difficulties arising out of mergers 

 

 

 

 

 

or -- or buyouts of a company, I think, are -- are 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely separate from the issues here.  It's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of whether you would treat the -- the company 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that buys another company or merges with another company 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as obtaining the debt, or as simply a change in the --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the legal title of -- of the owner of the debt.

In addition, subsection (6)(B), specifically 

 

 

 

 

16 

addresses companies that are collecting debts that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owed to affiliate companies, and I think that that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably also a solution for that problem. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I think when you are talking about trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimize the problems on the other side, you seem to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operating on the assumption that it's possible to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that somebody who has an assignment of a debt, say a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt servicer, is not collecting a debt owed or due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another, or is -- I'm sorry -- is collecting a debt owed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or due another. 

 

 

            

And we know that that's not right for two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  One, textual specific to this statute.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the second is how assignments are understood to operate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the law, generally. 

 

 

 

            

First, if you look at the creditor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition, which is on page 2A, Congress defined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor to include the person to whom the debt is owed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then it created a special exception for assignees, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular kinds of assignees who -- who are assigned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the debt after it is put into default.  That assignee 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception would be unnecessary, unless Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

understood assignees, generally, to be collecting a debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that is owed to them. 

 

 

 

 

            

And that is consistent with the way

Alderson Reporting Company

17 

assignments work, in general.  So, for example, Article 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 of the UCC talks about negotiable instruments, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes a distinction between the person entitled to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

enforce the negotiable instrument, and the owner of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt. 

            

And it's the person entitled to enforce the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PETE, who has the authority to insist on payment, and if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment isn't delivered, to sue on the payment and to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect on it.  And then the PETE is the person, if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay them -- the assignee, if you pay them the debt, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extinguished, even if they don't pass that money on to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the person that hired them to collect it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So a servicer with an assignment is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

person to whom the debt is owed, in any meaningful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense, as Congress recognized.  And if that's so, then I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't -- and I do think they do have a serious problem 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to (F)(iii) with this --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why do you have to get into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assignments at all?  All -- all that's needed to defeat 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your argument with respect to (iii), is to think of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation in which a person or an entity is collecting a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt owed to another, and that person or entity obtained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the debt at a time when the debt was not defaulted.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- it's very easy to think of a situation like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, with respect to the classic debt collector that

does nothing but collect other people's debts, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"obtained" means getting that debt for collection. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. RUSSELL:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Your -- your answer is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's not a reasonable -- that's not the right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of "obtained." 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  So I --

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So that's what it comes down 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, right? 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  I have a couple other 

    

   

 

 

responses.  One is that's not a solution to (F)(iv), to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be clear, because --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I'm talking -- I'll take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them one at a time. 

   

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  Okay.  Sure. 

  

  

 

            

So with respect to (F)(iii), the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem is that it ends up -- the result is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicers with assignments are not covered by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute at all, but servicers with contracts are. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that's a very odd situation, to think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress intended servicers who are simply hired to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect a debt are -- if the -- if the debt is in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default, they are covered by the statute.  But if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're given an assignment in order to facilitate that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt collection, which is very common when the debt in

default already, they are not covered, because they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collecting a debt that's owed and due themselves, not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

another. 

            

In addition, I don't think, to the extent, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you know, we're looking at what Congress was trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do here, Congress thought that (F)(iii) was dealing with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicers, who they thought was a different category of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

people who required different treatment. 

 

 

 

 

            

There's -- but as you just explained, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito, that interpretation necessarily means 

 

 

 

 

 

that any debt collector who is hired to collect a debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before it goes into default, when it's merely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delinquent, which happens a lot, is entitled to this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception, and they escape regulation entirely.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there is nothing in the legislative history, and there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is nothing in the reasons people give for why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third-party debt collectors are covered by the statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which would lead Congress to want to provide them that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception. 

              

I would say, in addition, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

"obtained" is also used in the Clause (iv) exception, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, as I said, it's used in a way there that cannot be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referring to somebody who simply --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  As to Clause 

  

  

 

 

 

 

(iv), I'm not sure I understood what you said.  So let's

say your company is owed a debt by other -- to -- other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

people owe the company a debt.  They get a loan.  They 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

give the -- the party extending the loan a security 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in that debt, and now there's an effort to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect that debt. 

 

 

            

Who is owed that debt?  Is not -- is it not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still owed to the -- the original party?  It's not owed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the person with the security interest, is it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  So if -- just to be clear with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hypothetical, the -- the debt hasn't been -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

security interest hasn't been foreclosed on? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  Right. 

  

  

 

MR. RUSSELL:  So at that point, it's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrowers, the car dealership, in my example, who is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collecting the debt, not the secured party.  And the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Clause (F) exception only applies to the secured 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party.  Right? 

  

            

It says, obtained -- "concerns a debt which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

was not in default at the time it was obtained" -- I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry.  I'm reading the wrong provision -- "concerns a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt obtained by such person as a secured party in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial credit transaction." 

 

 

            

So it's only the bank.  And the only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance in which the bank is going to be collecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the consumer is if the -- the security interest has

been foreclosed upon. 

 

 

21 

            

And then it's also important -- so you could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, in that circumstance, well, maybe the bank is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to collect from the commercial borrower, from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

car dealership, but "debt" is a defined term in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, and it only applies to consumer loans. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the only time, under (F)(iv), any person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be collecting a consumer loan as a secured 

   

   

 

 

 

 

creditor, is when they have obtained an assignment of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that loan as a result of either foreclosing on that loan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of default, or because it was assigned to them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the first place. 

 

 

 

            

But in either case, they're doing exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same thing as a debt purchaser.  They are collecting 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a debt on their own account that was originated by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody else, and assigned to them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this situation -- I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

I mean, it's possible to think of situations that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fall within that.  It may be that they are not things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are -- they are not situations that are very likely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to come up in -- in the real world. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the strength of your -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

degree of absurdity that you have to show under (iv), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends on the ambiguity of the phrase due -- "owed or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due," and I mean, I think that's not just -- not the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

first way you'd read that.  It's not the fiftieth way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

you would read that.  It's just you're -- you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fighting -- you're really going uphill on that.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need something really strong to overcome that, I would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say. 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  Well, taking that -- that I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlikely to change your view about that, I think we have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified something pretty strong, because we now have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a provision that renders itself surplusage.  You know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it says, if Congress has enacted a statute that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulates taxis only to the extent they're driven by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

poodles, right? 

 

            

The first set of requirements cannot be met 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in any situation with the second set of requirements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Venn diagrams with circles that do not touch.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that that is a very serious problem.  At the same 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time, you know, in interpreting the -- the ambiguous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language of the statute. 

 

 

 

            

Now, if you don't think it's ambiguous in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either provision, I -- I don't know that I can do much 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

beyond trying to dissuade you of that.  But of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you do think that there's some room for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation here, I think it's important to look at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the underlying purposes of the statute, and the way that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has treated other similarly situated entities.

And the fact is, a debt buyer is much like a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

debt servicer with an assignment, which, I think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress clearly intended to be treated as a debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector when it obtained that assignment after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt was in default. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't dispute, 

  

 

 

 

 

I -- I take it, that this particular context, with this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular type of entity, is not what Congress had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before it when it passed the law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. RUSSELL:  I think that --

    

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The industry has 

  

 

 

 

 

evolved in a way that has -- has raised these sorts of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions. 

            

            

MR. RUSSELL:  I think --

    

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is not 

  

 

 

 

 

something that Congress was addressing. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  I think it probably -- I don't 

    

   

 

 

 

 

think it had this specific industry in mind.  It did, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though, have assignees in mind.  And all a debt buyer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, is somebody who has purchased an assignment, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed to having been given one as a servicer to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilitate collection.  And I don't think there is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

anything in the language of the statute that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguishes between them because, in both instances, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the assignee is the person to whom the debt is presently

owed. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true about -- I take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

24 

your -- I understand your point on assignees, I think. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, look at (iv).  Where is the word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"assignment"?  It's not there.  And what they are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking about is a person who takes a secured interest 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

in the debt, I suppose, or he lends some money to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor, and in return, he takes some kind of secured 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest; doesn't really say what kind.  And as part of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, the initial creditor might assign him the original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt.  It might not.  And what you've said is, oh, they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost always do.  Do they?  I don't know that.  How do 

    

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we know that? 

 

 

              

I mean, I remember, vaguely, commercial 

   

 

 

transactions.  And -- and I remember that there are all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of secured interest.  You could take a secured 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

interest in a car, you could take a secured interest in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

their house, you could take a secured interest in all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of things. 

 

 

            

So where did you get this idea that, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, a creditor with a secured interest who has 

   

   

 

 

 

 

taken -- you didn't say assignment? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But now, so where did this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

come from that we're only talking about assignees?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

it's important.  For if we're not always talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

assignees, but only some of the time, you can't raise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your objection except to a subset of the section (iv) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  And as -- if you were talking about a subset, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming you're right, no one writes statutes perfectly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You'll always under-include or over-include. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  So let me turn you back to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language of the provision, because I think, ultimately, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you don't need to know that much about commercial credit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions to be persuaded of our point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The beginning of (F) makes clear that all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Clause (F) exceptions, including (F)(iv), only apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to any person collecting or attempting to collect a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumer debt, right?  And so then you have to ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yourself, under what circumstances? 

 

 

 

            

And then (iv) only applies to the secured 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party, the bank, right?  Concerns a debt obtained by 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

such person as a secured party.  So it's only ever going 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be the bank.  And so you ask yourself, when will a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank be collecting on a consumer debt?  And the only 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance that anybody has proposed is when they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either been assigned the debt or it's been foreclosed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Very able counsel on the other side has not been able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come up with any of the examples that -- that people

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Counsel, before you --

  

 

 

 

 

26 

you sit down, you did make an alternative argument based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on 1692a(6); that is, you say, whatever else your person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here regularly collects or attempts to collect debts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owed or due to another, that's part of its business. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then it also is -- purchases a debt. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think you're making the argument that 

 

 

 

 

 

if -- if they include the servicing that you described, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of their business is that they are regularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collecting or attempting to collect debts owed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another, then even as to transactions that don't fit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that type, that they are -- well -- well, they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors themselves -- their whole business gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stamped with debt collection.  Is that right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  That's correct, because the 

  

 

 

 

 

main definition looks at the business model.  If you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualify by virtue of your servicing third-party debt as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a debt collector, you're subject to the Act under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive provisions with respect to all your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection activities, subject to the Clause (F) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions. 

            

And that's the important point in response 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to their argument that Congress couldn't possibly have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to regulate financial services industry --

27 

and you didn't raise that as a question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  We did not raise that as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate question.  I do think, because it is a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate to resolving the question presented it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairly before you.  But regardless, it is an important 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point about why their argument that -- that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial services industry couldn't have been --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why -- why is it a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate?  I read that part of your brief.  You said 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a predicate, it's necessary.  I don't understand 

    

   

 

 

 

why it's a predicate at all.  We can fully answer the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question presented without getting into that in any way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  I think it's -- it's an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

important part of our structural argument about why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their interpretation of "owed or due another" is not --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot be correct, because they say the financial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services industry is not what Congress had in mind here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we make the point that, look, on a plain writing of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the text, even under their interpretation of owed or due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another, financial services providers are covered.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

28 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The sole question presented by this case is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether an entity that purchases debts and then attempts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to collect them for its own account, qualifies as a debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector under the FDCPA on the ground that it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regularly attempting to collect debts owed or due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another. 

            

The answer to that question is plainly no, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because such an entity is attempting to collect debts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owed or due itself.  Now --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I just want to 

    

   

 

 

 

understand this.  Okay?  I thought the decision below 

    

  

 

 

 

 

had said that your other side's claim that this was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt collector entity failed because they didn't allege 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this was their principal business.  So let's assume 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the principal business of your client is to collect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debts that are owed to others. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Would your position be that they're exempted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the Act simply because this debt they own? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  No, we would not contend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that, Justice Sotomayor. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if your client, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they had pled it right and proven that the principal

part of your client's business was debt collection of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

debts owed to others, you would be covered. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So Petitioners concede that 

  

 

 

 

 

we do not fall within the principal purpose definition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I would note parenthetically that the principal purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition applies to any entity, the principal purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of whose business is the collection of any debts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regardless of to whom those debts are owed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I would also note parenthetically that, to 

 

 

 

 

 

the extent that Mr. Russell advances an alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument, this argument concerning Santander's alleged 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing activity, that that's also an argument under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the provision at issue here; namely, the "regularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collects" provision.  And with regard to the language of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the "regularly collects" provision, I don't think that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners really dispute that ours is the most natural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of that provision. 

 

 

 

            

As I understand Petitioners' arguments, both 

   

 

 

 

in their briefs and now at oral argument today, they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really making two principle arguments.  The first is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this argument concerning the exclusions; that our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation somehow renders certain exclusions from 

 

 

 

 

 

the definition of debt collector nonsensical.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

second is a policy argument, an argument that if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress had focused on this issue, Congress would have

wanted to regulate debt purchasers as well as dedicated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt collectors and servicers. 

 

 

 

30 

            

And I hope over the course of this argument 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to cover both of those points, but let me go directly to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this point concerning the exclusions, because I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that really was the focus of Mr. Russell's argument this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

morning. 

            

We believe that our interpretation not only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives meaning to those exclusions, which is all that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really required, but actually gives those exclusions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's intended meaning.  And let me start with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusion in Clause (F)(iv), which got comparatively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little treatment in Petitioners' opening brief, but now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears really to be the centerpiece of Petitioners' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument. 

            

We believe that that exclusion has meaning, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and indeed has Congress's intended meaning, with regard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a type of financing to which Mr. Russell alluded, so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called accounts receivable financing.  And these are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances in which a secured party could attempt to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect on debts even before they foreclose on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral because, of course, once a secured party 

   

 

 

 

 

 

forecloses on the collateral, it is essentially in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same position as a debt purchaser. 

   

 

 

 

            

Let's take Mr. Russell's example.  Let's

suppose you have a situation where a car dealership --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

31 

let's call it Sam's Cars -- comes to my client,


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Santander, and says, we'd like to borrow some money.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And Santander says in response, fine, what are you going


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to put up as collateral?  And Sam's Cars says, we're


  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to put up these accounts receivable that we have,


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we're going to give you, Santander, the entitlement,


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in order to pay off this loan, to collect some or all of


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money owed on those accounts receivable.


 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In that circumstance, Santander certainly 

 

 

 

 

could be said to have obtained rights in the debt.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the debt is still owed or due Sam's Cars in the relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense.  It's still owed or due Sam's Cars because in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that circumstance, the creditor retains an interest in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the accounts, it retains the right to demand payments on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those accounts as well. 

 

 

 

            

And this is a situation that Congress seems 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to have expressly contemplated.  And for those members 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Court who are interested in legislative history, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or might be tempted to be interested in legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history, I'd point to the Senate report at page 4 where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it says that this exemption targets, quote, "the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection of debts owed to a creditor when the creditor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is holding the receivable account as collateral for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial credit extended to the creditor."

And so Congress seemed to contemplate a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

circumstance in which the secured party would be engaged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in collection activity even before it foreclosed on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral.  And if you take a look at the sources cited 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in footnote 4 of Petitioners' reply brief, I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Petitioners essentially acknowledged that this was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

type of financing that is contemplated and that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially covered by this exclusion.  And the very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sources the Petitioners cite in the Uniform Commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code, again, contemplate the possibility that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secured party could be taking action even before default 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and foreclosure. 

 

            

            

And in particular --

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I think -- I might not have 

    

   

 

 

 

 

this right, but I think that they're replying to that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what happens in the situation that you mentioned is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the initial creditor who sold the car or whatever, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're going to give as collateral that.  They get --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the person who takes the collateral, say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Santander, takes an assignment of the debt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And they're saying taking an assignment of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the debt, once that happens, it isn't true that the car 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buyer owes anything to the car dealer.  But if I've got 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it right -- good bet, maybe, maybe not -- but if it's --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it's true -- that's true, then he is not collecting

the debt for another. 

 

 

 

33 

            

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Am I right about what you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think his reply is? 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I think that that is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Russell's reply.  And Mr. Russell really fixates on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this concept of assignment. 

 

 

 

            

But as you pointed out and as Justice Alito 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed out, assignment is neither here nor there with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regard to this exclusion.  The concept of assignment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears only once in the FDCPA, that is in the assignee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusion to the creditor definition, which I think both 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sides acknowledge is not dispositive of the inquiry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

              

I think that the dispositive consideration 

 

 

 

 

is whether the servicer in the context of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause (F)(iii) or the secured party in the context of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause (F)(iv) acquires complete ownership or acquires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something less than that. 

 

 

 

            

And I think that when Congress used the word 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"obtain" in both of these provisions, it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplating the full panoply of arrangements where an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity could obtain something less than full ownership. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so to move to Clause (F)(iii), and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the analysis is analogous under both Clauses,

34 

there are all sorts of ways in which an assignment --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excuse me -- a servicing arrangement could be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

structured.  And one of the ways in which it could be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structured is through a so-called assignment for 

   

 

 

 

 

collection, the type of arrangement that this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered, albeit in a quite different context, in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sprint Communications case where you have the original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity retaining equitable title, but passing legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

title to the entity that engages in collection.  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if a servicer had legal title but not complete title, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the servicer would, of course, come within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusion. 

            

And so, again, we think that with regard to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both of these exclusions, we're really giving these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusions their intended meaning, because Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to ensure that where you have a servicer or where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have a secured party that engages in collection 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity when either of those entities has not acquired 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

full ownership, that there is an exemption from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute in the context of servicers.  That exemption 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only applies to pre-defaulted debt, but in both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, the exclusions have meaning. 

 

 

 

 

            

And that's really all that is required when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- by far the more natural reading of the relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory provision is ours.

35 

            

And I do want to take just a minute to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

address that provision, because we shouldn't lose sight 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of it, because after all, it's what this Court has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked to interpret. 

 

 

              

I want to go directly to the hypotheticals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Mr. Russell has offered today, and they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypotheticals both of which appear in his reply brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and explain why the language of those hypotheticals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differs in critical respects from the language that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have here.  The first is the hypothetical -- and these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are both at page 4 of the reply brief -- of a statute 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that refers to a person who regularly creates debts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

created by another.  Now, of course, as we argue in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, we believe that the grammatical way to express 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that view would be to say a person who regularly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collects debts that had been created by another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

But even if you didn't agree with that, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that hypothetical is distinct in a very important 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  The act of creation is a discrete act, and it's an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act that, of necessity, has to have taken place in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

past.  It would be very odd to talk about regularly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collecting debts as they are being created.  You would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily think, well, that debt had been created at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some prior time. 

 

 

            

The word "owed", by contrast, refers to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

status of a debt.  And the current status of a debt may 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

be very different from the status of the debt at an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier time.  And so that language, again, I think, is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very different from the language we have here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With regard to Mr. Russell's other 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical, the hypothetical of the statute that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covers a person who regularly collects debts owed or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

owing another, we explain in our brief that "owed" and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"owing" are words that are essentially used synonymously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and have come to have the same meaning.  And so I do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that that would be a circumstance in which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress could be using a doublet that is essentially 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

superfluous, much like a phrase like "aid and abet" or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"cease and desist" or "null and void" and many other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples that this Court has cited in the past. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But, again, even if you disagreed with that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only reason why you would be saying that "owed" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- refers to a different tense is in an effort to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give meaning to that word. 

 

 

 

 

            

By contrast here, we have a phrase "debts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

owed or due another."  Again, we don't think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's much difference in meaning, if any, between the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words "owed" or "due."  And indeed, those words often 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appear together in various permutations, both in other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes and at common law.  It may very well be that

the words have a subtly different meaning because, as we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

explain in a footnote of our brief, it is possible to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk about a debt being owed, but not yet due. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so if I receive a credit card bill from 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

my credit card company and it says that I have to make a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment by May the 15th, that debt -- debt is indeed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presently owed, but not yet due. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But what you can't get from this statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language -- and, again, even if you agreed with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

98 percent of Mr. Russell's argument, I don't think you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can get over the last 2 percent.  You can't get from the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory language the fact that "owed" and "due" refer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to different points in time.  In other words, under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Russell's interpretation, it would be as if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute reached any person who attempts to -- regularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempts to collect debts that had been owed or are due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another. 

            

And the reason why Mr. Russell puts those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two terms into difference -- different reference points 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is simply because if both of those terms referred back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the point of origination, you really would have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

superfluidity problem with the statute.  At that point, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you would render the originator exclusion in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause (F)(ii) wholly superfluous. 

 

 

 

            

But the problem with the interpretation that

Petitioners now proffer is that, again, you have to take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this additional step of having these two words refer to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different points in time.  And even if you thought that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the use of the word "owed" could refer to two different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points in time, you wouldn't be able to take that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional step of saying that "due" refers to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different time from "owed." 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Shanmugam, it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

make much sense, though, does it?  I mean, take this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very case.  So your clients serviced this debt and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counted as a debt collector at that time.  And then your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client purchased the debt and all of a sudden is not a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt collector.  And I guess the question is:  What 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

happened in between the time when your client serviced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the debt and the time when your client purchased the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt that in any way changed its relationship with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrower such that Congress wouldn't be concerned any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer with its behavior? 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So, Justice Kagan, we don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concede that simply by virtue of the fact that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serviced Petitioners' debt and certain other debts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved in this case that that was sufficient to render 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us an entity that regularly collects or attempts --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let's assume that for the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the purposes of the question.

MR. SHANMUGAM:  But -- but I'm happy to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume that for purposes of the question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

            

The relevant inquiry is whether we were a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt collector at the time of the alleged violation.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you take a look at the substantive provisions of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FDCPA, provisions like 1692e and -f, they're all keyed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

off conduct engaged in by an entity that is a debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector.  And I think the fair inference is that you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to be a debt collector at that time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, notably, at the point at which we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquired essentially the remainder of Citi's auto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lending business, we really stepped into Citi's shoes in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a practically significant way.  At that point, we took 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over the business, and it was as if we were the original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor. 

            

And while this is not in the record, I hope 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court will permit me one liberty.  When we sent out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notices to borrowers, we obviously sent out those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noticers in -- notices in Santander's own name.  And at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that point, it was as if we had all of the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentives as the originator of the debt.  We certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had an incentive to ensure payment, but we also had an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive to maintain a business relationship with those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

customers.  And so --

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why is -- why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

is that?  I mean, you're -- you -- you were an entirely 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

different business than -- than the person that -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whose shoes you stepped.  I don't see that -- and -- and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- they've already got the loans.  I don't see why 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have the same incentives to maintain their goodwill. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I do think that we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

would have incentives to maintain their goodwill in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way that the sort of fly-by-night debt collectors that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was seeking to target 40 years ago, when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted the FDCPA, didn't.  We could have an incentive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to try to market other financial products to their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customers.  And, again, the only sense in which we were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from Citi, was that, first, as you say, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't originate the loans, and, second, we, again, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stepped into the shoes of the relationship at a later 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time. 

            

But to the extent that this argument really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes to the broader policy arguments that petitioners 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are making, and I think petitioners rely on the fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we were previously servicers, kind of as a door 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into those policy arguments. 

 

 

 

            

Again, we don't think that if Congress had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused on debt purchasers, it would have been concerned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about entities like Santander, precisely because --

Alderson Reporting Company

think that the definition of "creditor," in excluding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only those who have bought debt that's not in default, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells -- gives you a sign of who they are concerned 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

about? 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So I think both sides now 

   

  

 

 

 

 

recognize that the question of whether or not respondent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a debt collector doesn't in any way depend on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of whether or not respondent falls within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of creditor or not.  Those two provisions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

operate perpendicularly. 

 

            

But I would say that with regard to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of "creditor," we believe we would plainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fall within the definition of creditor, because we would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a -- a person to whom a debt is owed.  Indeed, as 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you'll be aware, Justice Sotomayor, in our brief, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely on the fact that that definition is expressly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framed in the present tense, as yet another textual cue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to why our interpretation is correct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think with regard to the assignee 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusion from that definition, I think that the one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing I would say is that Petitioners go to great length 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to suggest that we would fall within that exclusion, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that the gymnastics that Petitioners have to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through are much greater than any gymnastics we have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get -- go through to justify our interpretation.

Alderson Reporting Company

42 

            

Because if you take a look at page 49 of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's brief, they argue that we would fall within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the assignee exclusion, which refers to a -- a person 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

who receives an assignment or transfer of a debt in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default, solely for the purpose of facilitating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection of such debt for another. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To reach even a situation in which an entity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is collecting a debt for itself, their argument as to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why we would fall within that exclusion is that we would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be standing in the shoes of the originator; and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, when we are collecting the debt for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ourselves, we are collecting the debt for another, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other words, for an entity other than the originator. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so to the extent that Congress included 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that exclusion, it works perfectly well under our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation.  This Court need not address the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

definition of "creditor," because, again, the parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both acknowledge that the definition of creditor sheds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little direct light on the interpretation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of "debt collector." 

 

 

 

            

But in our view, the -- the assignee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusion in that definition covers situations in which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have either a sham transaction, or a situation in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

which the assignee, in fact, obtains full title to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt, but has a contractual obligation, once it

collects, to pay that money back to the counterparty to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the transaction. 

 

43 

            

There's nothing about that exclusion that 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests any intent on Congress's part to reach debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchasers.  And I think everyone acknowledges that 

   

  

 

 

 

Congress was not focusing on debt purchasers in 1977. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There was no direct reference to debt purchasers in any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the legislative history, of which we are aware.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really what Petitioners are asking this Court to do is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to extend the definition of "debt collector" to "debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchasers," based on these sorts of policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations.  And just --

  

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So he left that argument. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

What about the argument that was not made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the -- the question presented?  The -- what is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it?  1592(a)(6), the -- not -- not the principle place 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of business -- not the principle business, but what --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was -- what was the language? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes.  Justice Ginsburg, this 

  

  

 

 

 

is the argument. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Regularly -- yeah. 

  

 

 

 

Regularly -- the argument, as I understand it, is that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one who regularly collects or attempts to collect debts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owed to another.  But this particular category that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're dealing with, this person who regularly collects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

44 

or attempts to collect, is a creditor themselves. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

That doesn't matter, because if he regularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collects or attempts to collect for another, he is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stamped a debt collector, and everything that that debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector does will be --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So, Justice Ginsburg, we 

  

 

 

 

 

acknowledge that the question of whether an entity falls 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the "regularly collects" definition requires an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry into the entity's overall practices.  But what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners are attempting to do is to inject a quite 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different theory, both legally and factually, as to why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we satisfy that definition into this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you take a look at the question presented 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the petition, the question presented focuses on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether a company -- and I'm quoting from Roman numeral 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I, "Whether a company that regularly attempts to collect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

debts it purchased after the debts had fallen into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default, is a debt collector subject to the act." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Petitioners' alternative theory is that we 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow fall within that definition because of our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing activity.  And in particular, Petitioners 

  

 

 

 

 

point to one of our SEC filings for the proposition that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we engage in other servicing activity; namely, servicing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity of other debts for other entities. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that's not within the scope of the

question presented, and as Petitioners acknowledge in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

their reply brief, that argument was not made in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

body of the petition, nor was that the argument that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners made in the lower courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you take a look at both the Fourth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's opinion and the briefing in the Fourth Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and in the district court, I think that the most that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be said about Petitioners argument is that they made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an argument along the lines of what Justice Kagan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested.  They made an argument that by virtue of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that we serviced the very debts at issue in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, that there would be something inequitable, as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy matter, about saying that by virtue of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing activity, we're now no longer within the scope 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the statute. 

 

 

              

I think what Petitioners are trying to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, is quite different.  They are attempting to make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an argument that by virtue of, again, our other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing activity, that is sufficient to bring us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the ambit of the definition.  And there is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegation in the complaint, which you can see for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yourself in the Joint Appendix, to that effect, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has never been Petitioners' theory in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I would make one parenthetical note 

   

 

 

 

 

about that.  Even if you thought that as a -- a court of

first view, you could somehow take judicial notice of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

these SEC filings or anything else in an effort to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bolster this now long-forfeited argument, the relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry for purposes of the definition of "debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector" concerns our activities at the time we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged in the alleged violations, as I noted earlier. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Those violations are alleged to have taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place five years ago, and I can represent to this Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Santander's business was, in some respects, very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  And in particular, Santander had much less 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing activity in 2012 than it does today. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

All of this, of course, would be a matter to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be alleged in the complaint, if that were, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners' alternative theory as to how we qualify as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a definition of debt collector.  And Petitioners had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

every opportunity, in every court along the way, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advance that theory, and yet, they put all of their eggs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in one basket when they came to this Court, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempted to argue that we qualify as a debt collector 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solely by virtue of our purchases. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And under the more natural interpretation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relevant statutory language:  Such purchasers --

  

 

 

 

 

 

such purchases simply do not count toward whether or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an entity is engaged in regularly collecting debts owed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or due another.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wouldn't we, assuming 

  

 

 

 

 

we agree with you, have to leave open that -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of the character of the business, the sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

definition.  It's true it's not raised before us here, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but there might be another person similarly situated who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to ride with that argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Justice Ginsburg, I think 

   

  

 

 

that that is an issue that could be raised in another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  Our submission is simply that it can't be raised 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case, because it has been forfeited.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely contrary to the argument that Petitioners make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in their reply brief, they seem to suggest that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is something that we're advancing as an alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground for affirmance.  That is not correct.  This would 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be an alternative ground for reversal. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you were to give Petitioners another bite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the apple to pursue this theory, you would have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on that ground and allow Petitioners at this late stage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the litigation to amend their complaint in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide factual support for that argument.  And I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly not aware of any precedent for this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving a litigant that opportunity when they have had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

every opportunity to do so in the lower courts but have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet not pursued that theory.

At the point at which we moved to dismiss in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court on the ground that Petitioners had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not satisfied the element of liability that we be a debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector, that was the point at which you would expect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners to seek leave to amend if they wanted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursue a theory not within the four corners of their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint, and they can conspicuously did not do so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, nor did they ask the court of appeals for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity. 

            

            

Let me just say --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Court of appeals did 

  

 

 

 

 

address the issue, but it said even under this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"regularly collects," it would have to be a debt owed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- what are the magic words? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well, first tell me, am I right that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative argument that was not raised here was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised --

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I actually don't think that 

    

 

 

 

 

it was raised below or passed upon by the court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals.  I think the most that can be said about the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of appeals' opinion is that it passed on what is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively a policy argument, though it has a factual 

   

   

 

 

 

 

premise to it; namely, this argument that by, virtue of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that we serviced this relatively small number 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of debts at issue, that there would be something

inequitable about saying that we are no longer a debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector once we have acquired those debts.  That's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that the court of appeals is addressing at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages 18A to 19A of the appendix to the petition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

            

Now, I will note one thing about the court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeals' opinion.  I think that there is some 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

language in that carryover paragraph that seems to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggest that the question of whether or not an entity is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a debt collector focuses on the particular debts at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, and I think we would respectfully acknowledge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that that's not quite correct.  Under either the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

principal purpose definition, or the regularly collects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition, you certainly have to look at the entity's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overall operations. 

 

            

And as we explain in our brief, the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of whether a certain type of activity is sufficient to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give rise to regular collection has been the subject of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some discussion in the lower courts.  We think that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better view that this relies largely on district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinions because there's very little circuit authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on this, is that in assessing whether an entity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regularly collects debts owed or due another, you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to look at those debts in relation to the entities' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overall collection activities and determine whether that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection activity is a substantial part of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

entities' overall collection activities. 

 

 

 

50 

            

But that is an issue that would have to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved if Petitioners had relied on this alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing theory below.  And I would submit that this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court, if it were to give Petitioners another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity to pursue that theory, would probably have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say something about that, or at a minimum, leave that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue open for the lower courts.  And of course, our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broader submission with regard to this alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory is that it was not preserved before this Court at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cert stage, nor was it preserved in the lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts. 

              

I see that my yellow light is on, so I just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to say one last thing on this issue of the policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments, because I certainly don't want the Court to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

be left with the impression that if Congress had focused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on this issue, it surely would have wanted to bring debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchasers within the scope of the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Petitioners raise this suggestion of 

 

 

 

 

horribles that there are various diversified financial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institutions that are moving into the secondary market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for distressed debt.  I simply don't think that that's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

true as a factual matter, and I would encourage the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Court to look at the secondary sources that Petitioners 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite for that proposition at page 9 of opening brief and

page 16 of their reply brief.  There simply is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

evidence that the Goldman Sachs's and the Blackstones of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the world are suddenly engaging in the business of debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection. 

            

But the problem with Petitioners' 

 

 

 

 

interpretation is that it really would sweep in entities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like Santander.  And again, if you take a look at the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction at issue here, what Santander was doing was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not buying distressed debt on some secondary market.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was engaged in an arms-length, commercial transaction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where it essentially acquired the entirety of Citi's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auto lending business, both nondefaulted and defaulted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debts, and so in a very real sense, stepped into Citi's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shoes in that regard. 

 

 

 

            

And so while this may not have been a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction of the sort that Justice Breyer posited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you have an entity that's truly a successor in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest, it's a pretty close cousin to that source --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is Citi -- Citi out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

business?  It's no longer writing debts? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  My understanding is that 

  

 

 

 

 

Citi in very much still in business, but it's not in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auto lending business, and that Santander, in two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate transactions, acquired somewhere in the 

 

 

 

 

 

neighborhood of $6.5 billion worth of auto loans.

Citi, like many other large lenders, 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially got out of the auto lending business in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wake of the last financial crisis, and Santander 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquired this entire portfolio.  And so this case really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illustrates, I think, why Congress may not have wanted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to bring debt purchasers, or at least all debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchasers, within the ambit of the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And again, if you take a look at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

secondary market for distressed debt, which is a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

large market, most of the purchasers on that market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would qualify as debt collectors under the principal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose definition.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL 

 

 

 

 

 

             

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RUSSELL:  Thank you.  So let me end by 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

responding to Respondent's last point. 

 

 

 

 

            

We know that Congress would have intended to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sweep these financial services companies into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coverage under that because it did.  That's our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative argument; explains why, so long as these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

companies are also servicing debts for others, they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to the Act.  They are debt collectors subject to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Clause (F) exception. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

53 

            

So when they acquire portfolio debt, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause (F)(ii) exception -- (F)(iii) exception exempts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them with respect to all portfolio debts that were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current at the time that they obtained them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice Kagan, we give examples on page 4 of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

our reply brief of abuses, one of which is an applicant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who discloses every debt owed by a foreign creditor, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which I think would be ambiguous with respect to others 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owed in the past or owed in the current time frame. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think it's important here to keep in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind -- let me return to Clause (iv) just for a second. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Respondent's only argument, which is a new 

   

 

 

 

 

one that they've thought of in the interim before filing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the brief and doing this oral argument, is that (iv) is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about a circumstance in which somebody is collecting a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt based on collateral.  These are sometimes called 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

notification and non-notification accounts receivable 

 

 

 

 

financials, financial lending. 

 

 

            

Justice Breyer, I'm afraid I'm going to ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you to actually look at the UCC and to look at how these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things are -- are done, because they are always done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through an assignment.  There is an assignment of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt up front, and as a consequence, the person, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lender, is always collecting the debt on the basis of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assignment, on its own account, exactly like a debt

Their proposed solution to (F)(iv) simply

owed or due another. 

 

 

 

            

Last point I would like to make is their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation allows quite easy evasion, even by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third-party debt collectors who we know Congress wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to get at.  It allows, as I discussed with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito, a third-party debt collector to evade the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes so long as it is hired to collect the debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the debt goes into default, even once it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delinquent. 

            

It allows a servicer, who would otherwise be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

covered by the Act because they obtained the debt in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default, to avoid it so long as they simply receive an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assignment of the debt for collection purposes, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody who is assigned the debt is collecting a debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owed and due themselves, not owed and due another.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we don't think that Congress could have intended that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And even with respect to a small number -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

smaller number of third-party debt collectors who are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not falling under the Principal Purpose Clause -- can I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finish?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

55 

MR. RUSSELL:  All they have to do is change 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their contract with their customer to arrange for the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a purchasing of the debt that they've been hired to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect and arrange to give back 60 percent of what they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect by virtue of that assignment, and they would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evade regulation as well. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon, at 12:14 p.m., the case in the
