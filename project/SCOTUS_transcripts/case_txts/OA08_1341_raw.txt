 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’ll hear 

argument next in Case 08-1341, United States v. Marcus. 

(11:08 a.m.)

Mr. Miller. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The court of appeals erred in holding that 

reversal of Respondent's conviction was appropriate on 

plain error review if there was any possibility, no 

matter how unlikely, that the jury's verdict was based 

entirely on conduct predating the enactment of the 

statute. 

Under Rule 52(b), a defendant asserting a 

forfeited claim of error may prevail only by showing at 

a minimum a reasonable possibility that the error 

actually affected the outcome of the case.  In 

particular, the fourth prong of the Olano plain error 

test requires a defendant to show a serious effect on 

the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial 

proceedings.  That test calls for a case-specific, 

fact-intensive inquiry, and the defendant cannot satisfy 

it if there is no reasonable possibility that the error

affected the outcome. 

Official 

The decision of the court of appeals is 

inconsistent with this Court's cases applying prong four 

of the plain error test, Johnson, Cotton, and most 

recently Puckett from just last term.  Puckett 

established that the prong four inquiry is case-specific 

and fact-intensive and that a per se rule at prong four 

is inappropriate.  And that's exactly what the court of 

appeals adopted here, applying a per se rule that if 

there’s any possibility of prejudice, reversal is 

required. 

In addition, Johnson and Cotton made clear 

that when the error is one that affects an issue on 

which the evidence is overwhelming or essentially 

uncontroverted, the defendant has not shown a serious 

effect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation 

of judicial proceedings, and, indeed, reversal in that 

context on the basis of a forfeited error that didn't 

affect the outcome would undermine public confidence in 

the judicial system. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are there errors that 

are -- that are so basic that they would call for an 

automatic new trial?  You say this -- this is not such 

a -- such an error. 

MR. MILLER:  This Court has reserved the

question of whether, for example, a structural error 

would automatically satisfy the "affects substantial 

rights" component of the -- of prong three of the Olano 

test. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you mean by 

“structural”? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, the sort of error that, 

if properly preserved, would result in automatic 

reversal without an assessment of harmlessness. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but if you can be 

concrete, other than a reasonable doubt charge, what 

else would be structural? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, I mean in Johnson, for 

example, the Court had not yet decided Neder, and so in 

Johnson it was unclear whether the omission of one 

element, the failure to instruct the jury on one element 

of the offense, was a structural error.  And in Johnson, 

the Court said, even assuming that that's a structural 

error and even assuming that, therefore, the defendant has 

satisfied prong three, showing an effect on the 

substantial rights, nonetheless the court of appeals has 

to apply prong four and has to evaluate on the basis of 

the record and the facts in that particular case whether 

there was an effect on the fairness, integrity, and 

public reputation of judicial proceedings.

And in that case, the Court said that there 

wasn't, because the evidence on the point that was the 

subject of the instructional error was overwhelming, and 

essentially uncontroverted.  And that's, in our view, the 

sort of analysis, the sort of case-specific assessment 

of the facts the court of appeals should have undertaken 

in this case. 

The effect of the decision below is 

essentially to carve out a special rule of plain error 

review that’s applicable only to a particular kind of 

error; namely --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you this?  Prong 

three of -- of Olano looks to prejudice, right?  And 

then it's your position that prong four also looks to 

prejudice?  Where you have two prejudice inquiries, one 

is more searching than the other, perhaps? 

How do they fit together in that relation --

in that regard? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, that's -- that's right. 

We think that prong three in the case of a 

constitutional error requires at least a reasonable 

possibility of prejudice, and prong four I think demands 

at least that much and, in some cases, may demand more. 

One example of a case where a defendant 

could satisfy prong three but not prong four would be,

for example, a Melendez-Diaz kind of error.  If you had 

a drug possession case where the only evidence that the 

substance the defendant possessed was cocaine was a 

laboratory certificate admitted without confrontation, 

that would be a plain error under Melendez-Diaz, and 

that would -- the defendant would be able to show an 

effect on his substantial rights, because if that was 

the only piece of evidence, he would have been entitled 

to a directed verdict without it.  Nonetheless --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under three. 

MR. MILLER:  Under prong three.  But looking 

at prong four, the Court would say -- I mean, if, for 

example, the defendant had had an opportunity to subpoena 

the chemist, if he hadn't controverted the accuracy of the 

report, there would be no basis for concluding on those 

facts that there was a serious effect on the fairness or 

integrity or reputation of the proceedings. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You answered Justice Alito 

by saying there are cases in which your inquiry is more 

searching, more demanding, under four.  It might also be 

the other way around.  I mean, if you satisfy -- if, 

under three, you find that it hasn't affected the 

outcome, then I don't know where you'd go under four. 

MR. MILLER:  If, under three, the defendant 

fails, then you don't need to apply prong four, because

prong four -- prong four is essentially an 

implementation of the discretion conferred by the word --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes. 

MR. MILLER:  -- "may" in Rule 52(b).  In 

order for the court to have any authority to correct 

a plain error, it must be one that affects substantial 

rights.  So --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  There -- there is an 

overlap. 

MR. MILLER:  There is some overlap in the 

inquiries, but we think that, you know, as the Court 

made clear in Puckett, rule four requires a 

fact-intensive, case-specific inquiry. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So under -- under three, the 

court could conclude that the defendant has shown that 

it isn't clear beyond a reasonable doubt, for a 

constitutional error, that the error didn't affect the 

outcome, so the defendant would clear prong three, but 

in prong four, a defendant might still lose if it's 

fairly clear, but not beyond a reasonable doubt that --

is that -- that how it would work? 

MR. MILLER:  Or if, you know, as in the --

my Melendez-Diaz example, or if the nature of the evidence 

in the case shows that, you know, apart from the effect 

on the defendant's rights of that particular error, that

error, in the context of the case, doesn't undermine 

public confidence in the outcome. 

What the court of appeals did here was to 

create a special rule applicable only to those errors 

involving the failure to instruct the jury that they may 

not convict solely on pre-enactment evidence.  The court 

didn't give any reason why those errors should be 

treated differently from other kinds of errors. 

Instead, it was simply applying a line of circuit 

precedent that went back to cases predating Olano. 

And there is no reason for creating a 

special rule in that context.  To the contrary, Johnson 

emphatically rejected the proposition that there are 

errors that are not subject to Rule 52(b) analysis.  And 

the Court said that even errors implicating fundamental 

constitutional rights like the Sixth Amendment -- Sixth 

Amendment right to trial by jury in Johnson or the Fifth 

Amendment right to a grand jury in Cotton are also 

subject to the application --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't want us to do it, 

right?  You want us to remand it so that they can do it, 

right?  Is that --

MR. MILLER:  This Court's usual practice 

when there's an issue that wasn't passed upon below is 

to leave it to be considered on remand.  We think that’s

particularly appropriate because of the fact- and 

record-intensive nature of the argument in this case. 

So, if the Court does reach that issue, we 

would urge the Court to adopt the analysis of the 

concurring judges below, who said that, with respect to 

the forced labor conviction, Respondent's conduct in the 

pre-enactment and post-enactment periods were 

essentially identical, such that there is no basis in 

the record on which a rational jury could have concluded 

that he violated the statute in the pre-enactment 

period --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The point may be 

tangential, but if both counsel were aware of the date 

problem, that 2001 was the enactment of the statute, and 

the jury was later properly instructed, do you think 

that the government would find it important to introduce 

the evidence of the pre-enactment conduct, just to set 

forth scheme, plan, design, purpose, to tell the jury 

the story? 

MR. MILLER:  Indeed, it would.  In order to 

establish a violation of the forced-labor statute, the 

government had to show that Respondent had obtained 

labor services by threats of serious harm or by a 

scheme, pattern, or plan intended to cause the victim to 

believe that she would suffer serious harm.

And so, in this case, there was essentially a 

uniform course of conduct of the Respondent obtaining 

labor services, making threats of harm, and, indeed, 

brutally carrying out those threats.  And so the 

pre-enactment threats and pre-enactment acts carrying 

out the threats would certainly be relevant to show that 

the post-enactment threats were indeed genuine threats 

and that the victim could take them seriously as 

threats, and that they did indeed induce her to provide 

the labor or services. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the argument 

that was made that in the pre-enactment period the 

Web site was created, and that's when the -- that was the 

really hard labor, as compared to just keeping it up to 

date? 

MR. MILLER:  Well, there -- I mean, the 

statute refers to "labor or services."  And creating a 

Web site is a kind of labor or service, and maintaining a 

Web site is also a kind of labor or service.  And 

there's -- as the concurring judges in the court of 

appeals noted, there’s no basis on which the jury could 

have concluded that one satisfies the statute but the 

other does not.  They're both -- they both fall 

comfortably within the ordinary meaning --

this question?  We are construing Rule 52(b) here, not --

as construed in Olano, which has developed the four 

factors. 

In your view, does the character of the 

violation, in this case an ex post facto violation, does 

that ever make a difference?  Could a court ever think 

that one kind of constitutional violation is a little 

bit more serious than another, or are they all fungible? 

MR. MILLER:  I think in Johnson the Court 

quite clearly said that even very serious constitutional 

errors are subject to the same analysis under 

Rule 52(b).  And certainly there's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well -- well, but the same 

constitutional analysis includes step four, which is 

whether it undermines confidence in the result.  And 

don't you think that some constitutional violations more 

undermine confidence than others? 

MR. MILLER:  Absolutely.  And the test that 

would be applied would be the same, but the result of 

that test might be different.  For example, if the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would it not also be 

possible that some constitutional violations undermine 

confidence a little more than others? 

MR. MILLER:  Yes.  I mean, if the error were, 

for example, a biased judge -- I mean, that would be one

that would almost invariably undermine confidence in 

the integrity of the proceedings. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then why is the Second 

Circuit so wrong to say:  We think ex post facto 

violations are perhaps a little more serious than some 

others. 

MR. MILLER:  Well, because the error, the 

essential error in this case, was the failure to give 

the jury an instruction telling them that they could not 

convict on the basis of pre-enactment conduct.  And that 

is essentially analogous to the error that you had in 

Johnson, where there was a failure to give the jury an 

instruction telling them that they had to find 

materiality.  And there --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are all omissions in jury 

instructions fungible, then?  I'm -- here we have an 

omission in a jury instruction relating to the Ex Post 

Facto Clause.  Does -- the fact that it relates to the 

Ex Post Facto Clause doesn't give it any extra weight or 

any lesser weight in the analysis? 

MR. MILLER:  I think in the context of an 

error like this, there isn't any reason to attach extra 

weight --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose if the 

instruction told the jury in a criminal case that you

can find the defendant guilty if you think it more 

likely than not that he committed the crime, that might 

be different, don't you think? 

MR. MILLER:  Yes.  That very well might be 

different.  That's right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you agree that this is 

ex post facto, as opposed to a general due process 

violation? 

MR. MILLER:  No.  I mean -- that's right. 

The Ex Post Facto Clause regulates the content of the 

laws that Congress can pass, and there would be an ex 

post facto issue in the case if Congress had tried to 

make section 1589 retroactive, but it didn't.  And 

everyone agrees that section 1589 applies only 

prospectively. 

So the constitutional violation, if there is 

one, comes from the possibility that the defendant could 

have been convicted on the basis of Congress -- of 

conduct that did not violate the statute. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you -- you agree 

that there is a violation? 

MR. MILLER:  There is a violation in the 

failure to instruct.  And we think it's the 

Due Process Clause that is the source of the requirement 

that the defendant not be convicted on the basis of the

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and if it 

please the Court: 

We do believe there are errors that are so 

basic that they require a reversal automatically.  And 

certainly one of them is trying a person for conduct for 

2 years that violated no law.  It's almost 

unimaginable and it's unheard of.  There are very few 

cases that even come close to resembling --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, except that I think 

most trial judges would have admitted this evidence with 

the proper instruction to the jury, that it's background 

evidence so you -- you can't tell the jury the story and 

just begin in 2001, or it doesn't make much sense to 

them. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  That’s --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, I agree there was not 

a proper instruction here, there should have been an 

objection, and so forth.  But in an ordinary trial, this

evidence would have come in with the proper limiting 

instruction. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  What’s so important about 

that, if it please Your Honor, is that he couldn't have 

been convicted on that evidence.  The court would have 

instructed that this evidence was received --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of -- of -- of course, the 

jury would have to be instructed very carefully. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  But here, Your Honor, all 

this evidence came in, and he could be convicted and was 

convicted on the -- what we lend -- we think lends an 

awful lot of force to our argument here is that the 

government has conceded that he could have been 

convicted exclusively on the pre-enactment conduct 

alone.  That that was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Convicted, but not --

there was a possibility, but not a reasonable 

possibility.  That is, it's conceivable, but the 

government also is urging the reasonable 

possibility that it is not likely, given the character of 

the evidence in the post-enactment period. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, Your Honor, I 

understand that, but I certainly -- I’d like to say 

first, in terms of the concession that was made here, you 

are talking about 2 years of conduct that came into a

trial that is really quite extraordinary and terribly 

dynamic. 

The one -- last third of that, Your Honor, I 

think cannot -- even though it came post-statute, it 

cannot be used to legitimatize that first 2 years. 

And -- and the jury heard all of it, and -- and as a 

matter of fact, what we attach a great deal of importance 

to, the last question the jury asked of the judge:  We 

want to know what constitutes labor. 

And they put in their note the -- the 

largest task of all, the building and the designing of 

the Web site and then maintaining it.  And that was all 

pre-enactment; the threats were all pre-enactment. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And this was a long -- a 

long jury deliberation. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  It was out for 7 days, 

Your Honor.  Seven days the jury deliberated over this 

case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Justice Kennedy suggested 

that, even though the conduct was pre-enactment, it 

would have come in to show pattern, scheme.  So it's one 

-- one thing is to say the evidence, the jury would not 

have seen that evidence, would not have heard the 

evidence, and another to say the judge should have 

charged them:  Now, you cannot use this evidence that

you've heard for another purpose.  You cannot use it to 

determine his guilt or innocence. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  But -- but, Your Honor, I 

wanted to mention to the Court, of course, Rule 403 that 

says that if the prejudice of the evidence outweighs the 

probative value.  I think if we could take ourselves 

back to that trial court and a lawyer stood up and said, 

Your Honor, we want to put in 2 years of background 

evidence, I -- I think there’s a good likelihood that 

it would have been excluded.  I don't think you can 

say --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you can be pleased 

that I was not the trial judge. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Sorry to hear that, Your 

Honor. 

But in the -- in the course of taking in 

some evidence as background, I don't think it's ever 

been of this magnitude in a unique case where the 

evidence that’s coming in bears directly on the 

liability.  And I think the -- the question is terribly 

important because, obviously, it shows the jury was 

focused on the pre-enactment conduct, even with the

JUSTICE BREYER:  I assume you could make all 

that argument on remand, if we remand it.  But what's 

your argument -- apparently from what I've read in this 

case, the Second Circuit uses a standard of plain error 

that nobody else uses. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And it says that all the other 

circuits say:  This is our set of standards, and we've 

set them forth.  And the Second Circuit says:  No, it's 

-- you have to have a new trial if there’s any 

possibility, no matter how unlikely. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, nobody else uses that. 

It seems contrary to our cases, and is there any 

justification for their using it? 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because unless I can hear a 

justification, I would guess I would vote to say send it 

back and let them use the same standard anybody else 

does. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, one point you make, 

Your Honor, that I --

that is that we are seeking a retrial here.  You know, 

you speak in just genuine fairness that -- that the 

gentleman can be tried on that conduct that was 

post-enactment. 

But in response to Your Honor's question, I 

think, Your Honor, the -- the -- the difficulty is, in 

this whole case is, it all ran together in front of the 

jury, and they saw all of this proof with no 

instruction, with no demarcation, and -- and the --

the mere weight, the volume of the 2 years out in 

front of that had to have a --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So why don't you make 

the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Address the test used by 

the Second Circuit.  That's what we’re concerned about. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Oh, I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's what the 

question pertained to.  They’re using a test nobody 

else used, that does not comport with -- with our prior 

opinions.  Why shouldn't we send it back and tell them, 

you know, use the right test? 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Your Honor, I think -- and I 

choose my words carefully -- I think that this test 

under this circumstance was justified.  When the court 

saw the magnitude of the error here, they had to say if

there was any possibility that the jury 

relied exclusively --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The very magnitude of 

the error would argue for -- you’d win on any test. 

I mean, why does that say you have to use a special test 

that is specially designed to find when there is hardly 

any error?  Here there’s such a bigger error, 

according -- that you think that you would have won 

under any test. 

So that -- so why -- why do you do have to 

have this special favorable test?  That's -- that's the 

question that I'm thinking of.  I'm not thinking of 

whether you are right or whether you are wrong on the --

how much evidence there was and how awful it was. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  I think -- to answer Your 

Honor's question, which is a -- an incisive one, and 

that is because, Your Honor, it's only -- the court made 

it very clear, we’re only applying this test to ex post 

facto, and I think in this instance you are right, the 

magnitude of the error prompted them to say that if 

there was any possibility that this 2 years of conduct 

-- the jury could have based their verdict 

exclusively on that, we think we had to be granted a new 

trial.

question about the -- I -- I should know this, but I

colleagues referred to applied in ex post facto cases in 

other circuits? 

MR. FAHRINGER:  The -- the Olano test, Your 

Honor? 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, the possibility test has 

been used in the Third Circuit in the Tykarsky case.  It 

has also been used in several States --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Were those ex post --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- ex post facto cases? 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor. 

And --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So that it isn't 

necessarily a conflict between this case and all other 

plain error cases; it's a narrow category of cases 

involving ex post facto violations? 

MR. FAHRINGER:  In the -- in this very 

narrow category, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you call it an ex 

post facto violation, but I -- I -- I rather agree with 

the government; it's a due process violation. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Well --

22 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- what happened is 

improper evidence was admitted, because it concerned pre-

-- pre-statute conduct.  But it might have been evidence 

that was -- that was irrelevant for some other reason. 

That would be just as much of a -- a due process violation. 

What is special about the fact that the 

reason the evidence before the jury was incorrect was 

that it -- the conduct occurred before the -- before the 

statute? 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Your Honor, as I know, you 

are aware of the Marks case.  They held that the ex post 

facto concept applied to judicial precedent as well, and 

that was repeated in the Harris case in -- as well.  But 

I think, Your Honor, certainly the whole strength and --

and weight of the ex post facto law is present here. 

The Second Circuit said that it certainly involves ex 

post facto implications.  What you are doing is, you’re 

taking conduct that violates no law before the law is 

passed, and you're taking --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And when a State court 

allows pre-law conduct to uphold a conviction, that is an 

ex post facto violation, and we would reverse the State 

court judgment.  But that's not what occurred here. 

What occurred here is that the trial court let the jury 

consider evidence, as evidence bearing upon conviction,

which it should not have let the jury consider. 

And there’s a lot of evidence that a court 

should not have let the jury consider.  I don't see 

anything particularly special about fact that the reason 

this evidence shouldn’t have been before the jury was 

that it occurred before the statute. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it not only allowed 

the evidence before the jury, but it also told the jury 

it was sufficient to convict. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Your Honor, that's right. 

It -- it -- what is special about it is -- I think it's an 

extremely rare and irregular case that would allow 2 

years of conduct to come into a case --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the -- what if the 

period -- the -- the period that was charged started 1 

day before the statute took effect? 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, if it was -- Your 

Honor, my stand --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Would -- would the test 

be different?  Now, if you have 1 day of pre-enactment 

conduct, it's possible that the jury could convict based 

on that -- the evidence relating to that 1 day, isn't 

it?  And so, therefore, if the test is any possibility, 

the result is automatic new trial in that situation. 

Is -- is that where your argument leads?

MR. FAHRINGER:  My argument is, Your Honor, 

that no person in this country under our Constitution 

should be tried for 1 day on conduct that did not 

violate a law.  I -- I --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true.  And also no 

person should be convicted with a confession that was 

coerced.  And no person should be convicted with 

evidence given under torture.  And no person should be 

convicted with evidence unlawfully seized by the police. 

Now, for all those latter things, every 

court apparently uses the normal standard.  So why would 

we in this case use a special standard? 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Well, it's different, Your 

Honor.  In all of those cases, there was a law, at least 

giving the court jurisdiction, that was violated.  There’s 

a very serious question here whether there was 

jurisdiction when they came in.  Jurisdiction is derived 

solely through statutes that are violated in the 

criminal field. 

There were no statutes.  So there’s a 

serious question of whether there was even jurisdiction. 

But -- but what’s different is it seems to me if you 

have a law, a mail fraud law, and then there is some sort 

of a violation and a -- a suppression of evidence or 

whatever other arguments you’re going to make,

that's -- that's light years away from a situation where 

there’s absolutely no law to -- to violate.  And the 

conduct --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and, 

therefore, no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  I beg your pardon. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  There’s also no violation 

of the Ex Post Facto Clause, which is in Article I of 

the Constitution and which says no ex post facto Law 

shall be passed. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  But, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't have -- you don’t 

have an ex post facto law that was passed here. 

You have an incorrect jury charge.  You have 

the judge telling the jury that you could convict on the 

basis of this prior conduct when, in fact, you couldn't. 

That is not an ex post facto law. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  But, Your Honor, I -- I --

in all due respect, I invite your attention to your 

case in Marks and -- and the Harris case where they have 

said that we have extended ex post facto to obviously 

a -- a whole host of cases now that involve judicial 

precedent and -- and the actions of prosecutors 

and what not.

the concept of ex post facto to put in 2 years of 

conduct that is not in violation of any law, that 

certainly fits within the presiding spirit of the ex 

post facto concept that people shouldn't -- you know, if 

you want to go back to our very basics, and that's what 

unique about this case, the entitlement to notice of 

what conduct is to be avoided, a statute that tells you 

what conduct you have to avoid, and all those --

court upheld the State statute that -- you know, that 

made prior conduct unlawful, then I -- I think I could 

say that was an ex post facto violation through the 

Fourteenth Amendment. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  I think this comment is 

relevant to what you just said.  Our forefathers in --

in imposing an Ex Post Facto Clause -- it's one of the 

few that they imposed on the States as well as the 

Federal Government, and I think that lends it force in a 

sense that the States have an Ex Post Facto Clause as 

does the Federal Government. 

But we feel, under all those circumstances 

here, what -- all roads lead back to one very, very 

critical fact, and that is the enormity of the error 

here at being a -- a constitutional error, and we 

certainly think a structural error, structural error in 

the sense that it ran from the beginning of the case.  The 

grand jury should not have indicted on conduct that 

violated no law.  He should not have been arraigned.  He 

should not have been tried.  He should not have 

convicted.  He should not have been considered.  All of 

this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is your position 

that two concurring judges said that evidence should not 

have been -- not that it shouldn't have come in, but the

jury should have been told you can convict only on 

post -- whatever the date was?  But they also pointed 

out that one of the most severe incidents fell in the 

post-enactment period.  It was in April of 2001.  It 

was -- and that was vivid evidence properly --

properly used by the jury to determine guilt or 

innocence. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  I -- I understand that, and 

I think I know what you are referring to, Your Honor. 

I find much of the evidence in this case extremely 

distasteful, but we are operating under a land of laws 

and Constitution.  And it seems to me his rights are as 

important -- I know this Court appreciates that -- as 

any other person’s. 

And the truth of the matter is that much of 

this very unattractive evidence came in before the law 

was ever enacted.  And I think what happens is -- and this 

is a reality psychologically -- it all blends together, it 

all comes together.  And without any kind of 

instruction.  I -- my view would be, under ex post facto 

principles, it would have ordinarily been excluded.  It 

wouldn't have been brought in. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  This -- this 

evidence was improper because if the legislature had 

made that action punishable when it occurred before the

statute was enacted, that would have been a violation of 

the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Now, in fact, the legislature 

didn't do that, and, therefore, we have no real violation 

of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  But we do have the 

admission of evidence that shouldn't have been admitted, 

which is no different from evidence that should have not 

been admitted for some other reason. 

For example, where the -- where the court 

gives an instruction that permits evidence to be 

considered as evidence of the crime which, in fact, is 

irrelevant to the crime.  And the jury says you can 

find him guilty if you find that he held two fingers up 

in the air, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with 

the crime. 

Why is this any different from that?  It's 

just evidence that the jury should not have been allowed 

to use for conviction.  I don't see why there is 

anything special about the fact that the reason it 

shouldn't be used for conviction --

MR. FAHRINGER:  In all due --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- is because it occurred 

pre-statute. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  In all due respect, Your 

Honor, I believe the cases and Supreme Court cases have

judicial precedent.  And we cite those cases, Your 

Honor, in our brief. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I thought 

what we have said that it's just a violation of due 

process to convict someone for conduct that was not 

criminal when the conduct was -- was made.  It's --

it's -- it's just a due process -- it's a due process 

violation.  It just -- it's a serious due process 

violation. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  I think you’re right, Your 

Honor, in the sense that it's an ex post facto law being 

applied through the Due Process Clause.  But the impact and 

the force of that, I think, is still just as great and 

just as powerful.  And -- and -- and the error here 

factually is -- is absolutely enormous. 

And -- and what I think the very least a 

defendant in his position is entitled to is -- he’s 

suffering under a 9-year sentence.  I think he is 

entitled to have another trial where he is only confronted 

with the evidence that came after the statute.  And if 

they’re going to put in evidence that goes before that, 

they would have to justify that under one of a number of 

different concepts, Rule 404(b) or one of the others. 

And we would argue in that context -- none of 

this was ever done in court -- under 403, if it was too 

31 

Alderson Reporting Company

extensive, the prejudice outweighs the probative value. 

And I think that many judges would be sympathetic to 

that, for putting in a whole 2 years of conduct.  Some 

might come in --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Courtesy -- courtesy of 

Justice Kennedy, I have -- I have before me the Marks 

case.  And the -- the summary of the case at the 

beginning says:  “Petitioners were convicted of 

transporting obscene materials in violation of the 

Federal statute.”  “Held:  The Due Process Clause of the 

Fifth Amendment precludes retroactive application to 

petitioners of the Miller standards.” 

It was a due process case. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  And the only thing that I would 

think of immediately of that is, is the statute here.  He 

was -- there’s no question the -- the -- the conduct 

was forbidden by statutes in -- in time, but was applied 

in advance of those statutes, before --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, therefore, the Due 

Process Clause was violated when the court let that in. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  I don't have a quarrel with 

you on that.

persuade us that there is something special about a 

violation of the Due Process Clause that lets in

that let in other evidence that should not properly be 

used to convict the defendant.  And I frankly don't --

don't see why it's so special. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Your Honor, I'm endeavoring 

to pursue it, but somewhat unsuccessfully. 

This is not an evidentiary error.  It is in 

every sense a due -- an ex post facto error, but it is 

through the Due Process Clause.  I think that there we 

meet on common ground.  It's through the Due Process 

Clause that the Ex Post Facto Clause is made -- made 

effective in trial.  But the truth of the matter is -- I 

mean, the indictment here, which you start with, charged 

these crimes going all the way back to January of 1999, 

when the Act didn't come -- didn't become effective 

until October of 2000. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the conduct 

that -- we didn't have -- what if we did not 

have pre-enactment conduct?  What if we -- if this 

statute applies only within the United States, as I 

assume that it does, and all of the conduct that's now 

pre-enactment was conduct that took place outside the 

United States?  Would that -- would the case be 

different for these purposes?

JUSTICE ALITO:  Instead of having 

pre-enactment conduct, you have conduct in Canada, 

Mexico, someplace else. 

MR. FAHRINGER:  I -- I think it would --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  And the jury was 

instructed that he could be convicted on the basis of 

what had happened in Canada.  That would be the same? 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes, that's right.  And I --

all I'm suggesting is, wherever the evidence comes from, 

it shouldn't be admitted except under one of the very 

narrow exceptions, such as Rule 404(b).  And we would 

argue, under 403, it should be excluded, wherever the 

evidence came from.  And a judge would -- as I 

understand it, a judge would instruct the jury:  You 

cannot convict Mr. Marcus on any of this evidence 

whatsoever that is pre-enactment. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, of course, but the 

question is whether the mere possibility standard would 

apply in that case as well, or whether you think this 

mere possibility standard applies only in the case of 

pre-enactment conduct?

standard only applies to ex post facto statute

Honor.  I think it's a very narrow holding.  And I'm 

not urging that this would be the standard for other --

other than ex post facto cases, and I'm not urging this 

would be the standard in ex post facto cases where --

what this does, Your Honor, if you stop and think about 

it, it is, in a sense, a bright-line rule. 

What has gone on in the past is we have to 

measure.  We have to take, on the one hand, the post-

enactment conduct, and we take, on the other hand, the 

pre-enactment conduct, and we go through this, what I 

-- I'm of a generation -- I remember Betts v. Brady before 

Gideon came down, and it was always a constant citing in 

that context whether a person got able representation 

until you decided the Gideon case, Gideon v. Wainwright. 

Aren't we in the same position here? 

Wouldn't it be better to have a rule that said, where 

clearly you shouldn't be bringing in pre-enactment 

conduct anyway, if you bring in pre-enactment conduct 

and there is any possibility that the jury convicted on 

that, there will be a new trial?  It seems that's going 

to avoid all of that balancing and weighing and 

perennial -- perennial appellate review.  That's what I 

think is -- is commendable about the Second Circuit's 

decision.  I think that's where there is a great deal of 

sense behind it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So your position is, 

essentially, plain error doesn't apply in this area; 

it's just error because it involved evidence 

pre-enactment?  That error is enough; it doesn't have to 

meet --

MR. FAHRINGER:  I’m sorry, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It doesn’t have to meet 

the standard for plain error? 

MR. FAHRINGER:  Yes, absolutely.  And this 

doesn't affect that whatsoever.  I mean, I think there's 

a misconception among some people.  We -- the Second 

Circuit took the four Olano factors and applied 

them, one, two, three, four.  They didn't touch them. 

They didn't in any way alter them. 

What they did is, on the concept and the 

rule governing ex post facto adjudications, that was 

purely substantive, but the any possibility doesn't 

apply to plain error.  Those four prongs have been left 

intact.  And so they haven't disturbed that in any way 

whatsoever.  They set those four prongs out in the 

preamble of their opinion.  Obviously, what they found 

was, when you have a case of this magnitude of 

pre-enactment conduct of 2 years, they felt that that 

certainly affected the fairness and the integrity of the 

trial and the judicial reputation.

I say it myself.  It appeared on the front 

page of The New York Times:  Man convicted for 2 years 

of conduct where there was no law.  That, I would guess, 

would have an adverse effect on the reputation of our 

judicial process, whereas a ruling where a court held 

this man should go back and get a new trial on the 

conduct that violated the statute, and not on conduct 

that violated no law, would enhance the reputation of 

the courts. 

So applying that factor, we feel strongly 

and powerfully that the correct disposition here is to 

affirm the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  And 

we will go back and we will have a retrial on the conduct 

that violated the statute. 

If you have no other questions, I -- I thank 

you for your attention. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Fahringer. 

Mr. Miller, you have 16 minutes. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. MILLER:  Just very brief -- excuse me --

very briefly, I’d like to make two points. 

The first is that, essentially, the error in 

this case was the failure to give a limiting instruction

relating to the use of pre-enactment evidence, and 

that's the same sort of instructional or evidentiary 

error that can be considered in a case-specific analysis 

under prong four and should have been considered 

through that analysis. 

The second is that Respondent suggested 

there was a lack of jurisdiction in this case.  That 

argument rests on an understanding of jurisdiction that 

this Court rejected in Cotton, and we discussed that at 

pages 9 to 11 of our reply brief. 

If the Court has no further questions, we 

ask that the judgment be reversed and the case remanded. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
