CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’ll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-1301, Carr v. 

(10:09 a.m.) 

United States. 

Mr. Rothfeld. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

When Congress uses ordinary words in the 

statute, those words should get their ordinary meaning. 

In SORNA, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification 

Act, Congress did use ordinary words, and it used them 

in an ordinary way.  But the government proposes that 

those words be given a most extraordinary reading.  It 

suggests that Congress wrote one of the elements of 

SORNA's criminal offense in a sort of shorthand, and it 

should be taken to mean something quite different than 

what Congress actually said.  It proposes --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Rothfeld, I wondered if 

I could ask you about three interrelated points 

concerning your textual argument.  And if I could just 

lay those on the table and get your reaction to them, I 

would appreciate it.

Official 

The first is that it appears that there is a 

pretty universally accepted modern legislative drafting 

convention that statutes should be phrased in the 

present tense.  The Senate drafting manual, for example, 

says:  Always use the present tense unless the 

provision addresses only the past, the future, or a 

sequence of events that requires use of a different 

tense.  And the House manual is to the same effect. 

The second is that when the section that's 

involved here, 2250, was drafted, the drafters didn't 

know whether SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex offense 

convictions.  That was left up to the Attorney General. 

And so when they were drafting this, they had -- it was 

natural, perhaps, for them not to make a special 

provision for the possibility that there might be some 

pre-SORNA conduct involved.  If the Attorney General had 

determined that only post-SORNA convictions would qualify, 

then only -- then the only travel that would qualify would 

be -- would be post-SORNA travel.  It was only when the 

Attorney General decided that pre-SORNA convictions 

could qualify that the question that's presented here 

became a possibility. 

And the third is that once the Attorney 

General decided that SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex 

offense convictions, that necessarily meant that conduct

constituting a -- a SORNA -- constituting a qualifying 

sex offense could occur in the past.  And yet there are 

at least four provisions of SORNA that refer to the 

conduct that constitutes a sex offense and uses only the 

present tense, although in those instances it seems that 

those provisions have to be read as also covering past 

conduct, pre-SORNA conduct. 

These are all in 42 U.S.C. 16911, which is 

reproduced -- the relevant provisions are on 3a to 3-6 

of the government's brief.  I’ll just mention a couple of 

them to provide a flavor for this.  Under 42 U.S.C. section 

16911(3)(C), on 3a of the government's brief, an offense may 

qualify as a tier II offense if, among other things, it, 

quote, "occurs after the offender becomes a tier I sex 

offender."  But there "occurs" and "becomes" have to be 

read as applying to past conduct. 

42 U.S.C. 1691(4) on the same page says that 

an offense may qualify as a tier III offense if, among 

other things, it involves a kidnapping of a minor.  But 

"involves" there has to mean also “involved.” 

And the other two are subsection (7) on 5a 

and subsection (8) on 6a. 

So I wondered if you could comment on that. 

Maybe you have a reaction to it. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I’ll try to keep

straight each of the parts of the question.  A couple of 

reactions. 

First of all, I think that the ordinary 

assumption is that when the present tense is used in a 

statute that's creating a criminal offense, it refers to 

conduct that takes place after the statute was enacted. 

We are not aware of and the government has not cited any 

decision of this Court in which it has interpreted a 

present tense verb used in a criminal statute as 

attaching criminal consequences to conduct that took 

place before the Act -- before the statute was enacted. 

But before delving too deeply into the 

present tense question, I think it's helpful to take a 

look at how that fits into the other elements of the SORNA 

criminal offense, because there are a number of things 

about the statutory language that we think compel the 

conclusion that Congress had in mind only the attachment 

of criminal consequences to travel that took place after 

SORNA was enacted. 

For example, and to begin with, the first 

element of the offense, which provides that the 

defendant is required to register under SORNA, the 

government says, and we agree, that the elements of the 

SORNA offense have to be read sequentially so that the 

defendant is guilty only if he or she commits them in

order. 

Official 

The first element, as I said, the 

statutory text, is “is required to register” under SORNA. 

And it seems undeniable that a defendant is not and 

cannot possibly be required to register under SORNA 

until SORNA is enacted and is on the books.  And that is 

enough to dispose of this case because, as the 

government agrees, the elements are sequential.  The 

first element is that there is a requirement to register 

under SORNA. 

The second element, the travel in interstate 

commerce, has to follow the first element.  The travel, 

therefore, must follow the enactment of SORNA.  That we 

think is sufficient to dispose of this case.  The 

government's answer to that point is to say -- really, 

to candidly acknowledge that the statutory language has 

to be rewritten if they're to prevail.  They say when 

Congress said "is required" --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rothfeld, would you 

clarify one thing?  You’re not questioning the Attorney 

General's determination that the underlying sex offense 

can have occurred pre-SORNA? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  We are not questioning that. 

Congress specifically authorized in SORNA that the 

Attorney General had the authority to designate

pre-SORNA offenses as triggering the registration 

requirement. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that -- that's 

pretty unusual, isn't it, to have Congress say it's up 

to the Attorney General whether their laws apply 

prospectively or retroactively or --

MR. ROTHFELD:  It -- it certainly is unusual. 

I think it's not for us to comment on whether that was a 

sensible thing for them to do.  But we don't dispute 

here that -- that Congress did it and that the Attorney 

General was authorized to do what he did.  But --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's not as though he 

was authorized to make something a crime which wasn't --

which wasn’t a crime. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  That's absolutely right, 

Justice Scalia, and I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He was authorized to say 

you have to register. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  It's -- it's actually quite 

helpful to our argument in this case that Congress was 

aware of how to confer retroactive authority on the 

Attorney General for some things, which it did, the 

designation of pre-SORNA sex offenses as triggering 

the registration requirement. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought that the sequence

argument that the government was making was that the 

events have to occur in this sequence:  the conviction, 

the interstate travel, and the failure to register. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  That is their argument.  But 

the way that they reach that conclusion is to say that 

the first element of the offense, which is “is required 

to register” under SORNA, was really a shorthand by 

which Congress meant “committed a sex offense” that 

Congress --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they might be wrong 

on that.  And I understood that you agreed that the 

interstate travel has to take effect -- has to occur 

after the sex offense conviction.  It wouldn't --

you couldn't violate -- you wouldn't violate SORNA if 

there’s interstate travel, then the conviction, and 

then the failure to register. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  We -- we agree, but I 

think -- we do not agree, obviously, with the 

government's understanding of the first element of the 

offense.  It's not that the sex offense took place. 

It's that the SORNA registration requirement attached. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you’re saying it has 

to take place not just after the offense, but after the 

obligation to register. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  That's absolutely right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is what the statute 

says. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Which is what the statute 

says.  And, again, the government's only attempt to 

answer that point is to say that Congress actual meant 

something different when it wrote the first element of 

the offense. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, but they might be 

wrong that the sequence -- that the way these set out --

are set out in the statute dictates a temporal 

sequence --

MR. ROTHFELD:  They --

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- that you can argue that 

the temporal sequence that's necessary -- conviction, 

travel, failure to register -- follows from the purpose 

of this provision, which is to catch people who, after 

having committing a sex offense and being convicted of a 

sex offense in State A, move to State B.  It would 

follow from the purpose of the statute, not necessarily 

from the sequence of subsections in this provision. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, we of course don't 

agree with the government on everything, but we do agree 

that they are right about the sequence, for a number of 

reasons.  One is that it follows -- I think it's the 

most natural reading of the statutory language that one

is required to register, travels in commerce, and 

knowingly fails to register.  It explains why Congress 

put the interstate travel element second, which is 

somewhat a peculiar thing to do otherwise. 

And if that were not the case, it creates 

the problem of what we we've been calling the "Lincoln 

Tunnel baby."  If someone were an infant traveling and 

went through the Lincoln Tunnel from New York to New 

Jersey, lived in New Jersey for the rest of his life, 

committed a sex offense at age 50 -- if sequential 

fulfillment of the elements was not necessary, that 

person would be subject to criminal prosecution under 

SORNA.  So --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that makes -- that 

makes a lot of sense.  But you can get that from the 

purpose of the statute, rather than from the sequence 

in which these elements are listed.  Is it -- is it 

usually the case in a criminal statute that sets out 

a number of element that they have to be satisfied in 

some kind of temporal sequence?  I'm not aware of that. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  I think sometimes it is and 

sometimes it isn't.  It's certainly not a universal rule 

that it has to be.  But, again, the language here makes 

that a sensible rule. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, assuming it does

depend on the purpose of the statute, what would the 

purpose -- it wouldn't cover his transportation as an 

infant.  What does he have to be, 20 years old? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  No.  I --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or 15 years old? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Looking for --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or is it 20 years before 

the offense or 25 years before the offense?  I guess 

we could make it up, couldn't we? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  You would have to make it up, 

but if one were to depart from the text of the statute, 

which says "is required to register under SORNA."  So, 

necessarily, the travel took place after SORNA was 

enacted. 

And I think the statutory language disposes 

of the case.  There’s no reason to look beyond that to 

broader purposes.  But if one does look to the purpose 

of SORNA and what Congress had in mind, the interstate 

travel requirement and attaching that the travel took 

place after SORNA was enacted is what Congress wanted 

to do.  It accomplishes the purpose.  Congress wrote 

SORNA because it was concerned that there was divergent 

approach to registrations that were taken by -- by States, 

that they had inconsistent applications of registration 

programs.  This was creating loopholes that allowed sex

offenders who were unregistered not to register, and the 

congressional response to that was to create a uniform 

universal system of registration that it hoped all the 

States would enact that would facilitate exchange of 

information between the States and with the Federal 

Government. 

And the purpose of the SORNA criminal 

provision in that context is that it was designed to 

discourage people from traveling, unregistered sex 

offenders from traveling, after SORNA was enacted to 

evade the new SORNA registration requirements.  For 

that purpose, travel before SORNA is immaterial.  It’s 

travel after SORNA is enacted that -- that brings into 

effect the congressional purpose that they were trying 

to accomplish.  Congress wanted to keep out of the 

channels of interstate commerce unregistered sex 

offenders who were trying to evade the SORNA 

requirements.  That’s necessarily prospective. 

As to people who were unregistered sex 

offenders who either had never traveled in interstate 

commerce at all or who had traveled before SORNA was 

enacted, they are identically situated for SORNA's 

purposes. They are outside the system.  They are not 

registered.  No one knows where they are.  They are not 

attempting to evade SORNA at that point.  They are

subject to prosecution, not by the Federal Government, 

but by the States under the new, more punitive regime 

of criminal punishments that Congress tried to induce the 

States to enact as part of the States’ --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But which the States didn't 

enact. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  And States have 

generally -- States have not complied with SORNA. 

Almost universally, they have not complied with SORNA. 

But one thing many States have done is, in fact, enact 

these new, more punitive criminal provisions for people 

who have failed to register, as did, for example, Indiana, 

the State in which Petitioner here was not registered. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's compare two cases. 

We have this case, where you have conviction, interstate 

travel, SORNA takes effect, failure to register.  We 

change that.  That's case A.  Case B is just like this 

case except the sequence is different.  You have 

conviction, SORNA takes effect, interstate travel, 

failure to register. 

Now, why would Congress have treated those 

two situations differently? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  I think Congress had in 

mind -- as I say, it was addressing a particular 

problem.  It was concerned that people were evading

registration requirements because the States had 

different diverging systems, and it was allowing some 

people in some States simply not to register, not 

because necessarily they were evading State registration 

requirements, because the State didn't require them 

to register.  States had very different systems as to 

what offenses triggered registration requirements. 

And so the congressional reaction was to 

say:  We want the States to enact these new, much more 

comprehensive and intrusive and elaborate registration 

requirements.  And they are so -- so elaborate and 

intrusive that the States are refusing to do it.  But --

but that was the congressional goal, that the States 

would enact these -- these regulatory regimes; people 

would then register under them.  Everybody was now going 

to have to be registered, or they would be in violation of 

some State law, State registration requirement. 

And if people after that were trying to get 

off the grid, disappear by moving in interstate 

commerce, the SORNA criminal provisions would come into 

effect at that point.  For people who stayed put, people 

who had committed a sex offense before SORNA was enacted 

and just stayed there, they are identically situated, as I 

said, to someone who never traveled in interstate 

commerce at all, and they are subject to prosecution by

the States.

Clearly, Congress did not intend that it was 

going to federalize the entire regime of prosecuting 

people. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what is the basic 

purpose of this statute?  I'm having a hard time with 

it.  Is it -- is the purpose of the statute to try to 

get a lot of people to register who haven't registered 

at all?  Or is the purpose of the statute to get the 

people who had registered in one State and then moved, 

and make sure they register in another State? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  I think that the purpose was 

generally to encourage registration of sex offenders. 

Now, of course, when -- when Congress wrote the statute, 

as -- as has been pointed out, it was not apparent to 

them that it was going to apply to people who had 

committed sex offenses before SORNA was enacted at all. 

That turned upon the Attorney General's subsequent 

determination. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I mean, if they are just 

trying to get people to register in general, and they 

are not particularly worried about travel, then they are 

using this travel as a kind of jurisdictional hook.  And 

if they are using it as a jurisdictional hook, they’d 

like to get everybody, as many as possible.  That

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, two points --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I have a hard 

time seeing just what they’re aiming at. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, it -- it's -- to -- to 

be honest, I think it's not entirely clear that Congress 

had anything specific in mind beyond a reaction to the 

prior regime in which there were inconsistent approaches 

being taken by the States. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Basically, at the time they 

passed this --

MR. ROTHFELD:  At the time they --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- most States didn't 

require registration. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  All States did require 

registration of some sort or another, but they had 

different registration systems and different 

requirements in their registration systems.  There 

were -- there were inconsistencies in them. 

The one thing which appears from the 

legislative background of SORNA is that Congress was 

concerned about loopholes in various State registration 

regimes, and it wanted to have a much more 

comprehensive, universal, uniform system of 

registration.  So to address your point

specifically about the jurisdictional hook, I think 

there are two reactions to that. 

One is, even if it were a jurisdictional 

hook, it is an element of the offense.  No one denies 

that.  It has to be interpreted as written.  It says 

interstate travel, as we read it, after SORNA was 

enacted.  So I think that answers the -- the question. 

But -- but it -- but it was, I would add, 

more than a jurisdictional hook, because Congress had in 

mind this particular problem of -- of people who, 

post-SORNA, were going to be evading these new, more 

comprehensive requirements by simply disappearing.  Not 

that they were complying with State regimes which --

which didn't require them to register, but they would 

simply cross State lines to vanish. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That begs the question. 

They were concerned with people who had disappeared, but

who disappear prospectively as opposed to the people who 

have already disappeared and have failed to -- that's 

basically the -- the government's argument, which is: 

One of the main purposes of the statute is to capture 

those people who have disappeared.  And so why limit it? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, that's -- that's right. 

The government's argument is -- is an appeal to what it

sees as the gestalt of SORNA, rather than the statutory 

language. 

But I -- I -- but I think the answer to 

your -- your question specifically, Justice Sotomayor, 

is that they were -- they -- that when Congress passed 

the statute, it -- it had in mind this division of 

responsibility in -- in criminal enforcement.  It --

it expected that the States, in order to comply 

with SORNA, were going to enact these new and much 

more -- more punitive criminal regimes to punish people 

who did not register.  And so far as SORNA was 

concerned, people who never traveled in interstate 

commerce and people who traveled in interstate commerce 

before SORNA was enacted are identically situated. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem is that the 

people who had traveled previously and failed to 

register would no longer be subject to any -- either any 

registration process or presumably any punishment 

either, because they were no longer in the State in 

which the conviction occurred, so any change in that 

statute wouldn't affect them. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, that -- under the --

the new regime that Congress anticipated would -- would 

be put in place, every State would enact, would have in 

place a -- a criminal punishment.  And these were --

these States don't punish people simply who committed a 

sex offense in that State and failed to register.  They 

require registration of sex offenders who committed sex 

offenses anywhere. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And do -- do they 

generally require registration even if the offense was 

committed before the registration act was passed in the 

State? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Yes, they do.  So -- and in 

that sense mirroring the current interpretation of SORNA 

by the Attorney General. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So what you’re saying is 

that, even under your interpretation, there is going to 

be registration in at least one State? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Absolutely. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Would you say this at the 

moment -- you may not know, but I think it would be 

helpful.  At the time this was passed, would you say 

almost all States had some kind of registration act? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Okay. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  All States --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, thinking of that --

thinking of that set of registration acts in virtually 

every State, did most of those or none of them or a few

of them or how many made it required that a person 

register who had committed a crime, a sex crime, in a 

different State and had moved to that State?  Most, all 

of them, none of them? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I believe that 

universally --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Universally. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  -- they did not distinguish 

based on the location of where the sex offense took 

place.  So --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So -- so, 

therefore, every person who has committed a sex offense, 

or almost everyone, would have been subject to a 

requirement to move when he committed the offense and 

would have been subject to a requirement to register 

when he moved under some law.  Now, Congress's purpose 

then must have been just to try to get uniformity here. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, the -- the various 

registration -- State registration laws that existed 

pre-SORNA, that -- all the States had registration 

requirements, but -- but they differed in a number of 

respects.  Which sex offenses would trigger the 

registration requirement, for example. 

So -- so, there were people who -- who may 

well have been sex offenders in -- in the broadest sense

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And would that be the case 

after SORNA, that some States would have less extensive 

coverage than others? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  It is possible after SORNA 

that -- that States will enact criminal regimes that 

don't -- that don't mirror the SORNA -- the SORNA 

definition, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, unless that could be 

the case, then I don't see what is achieved by -- why 

you worry about somebody moving to another State in 

order to evade the registration. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, SORNA --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, if the new State 

requires you to register just as much as the old one, 

what are you worried about? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, under the SORNA regime 

if the States all implemented SORNA as Congress 

anticipated that they would, if they all enacted these 

statutes, I think that there wouldn't be -- the only 

concern would be that people would simply fail to 

register, they would then disappear --

MR. ROTHFELD:  -- altogether.  That's right. 

And I think that is what SORNA is directed at.  SORNA is 

directed at people -- they are now all subject to 

registration requirements.  SORNA is directed at the 

concern that people simply won't register.  And -- and 

it's designed after SORNA goes into effect, and there are 

these new requirements on the books.  The people --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't the concern that the 

State of conviction knows that an individual who has 

been convicted of a sex offense has been released from 

custody and, if that person is a resident of the State, 

presumably knows that the person is likely to still be 

in the State, but if the person moves to another State, 

the State to which the person moves doesn't know that a 

sex offender has moved into the State, and that's the 

reason for the Federal law that imposes a penalty for 

failing to register in the new State after having 

traveled across interstate lines? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  That's -- that's -- that's 

quite right.  And SORNA addresses these problems by 

saying, first of all, the States all have to -- have to 

pool their information and exchange them. 

Secondly, when the -- when the sex offender 

moves from one State to another, he or she is required

to register in the new State, has to notify both -- both 

the State and Federal authorities.  So it is designed --

SORNA itself is designed to be a comprehensive response 

to this problem, encouraging State cooperation.  And 

that is why if we are looking at the policy and -- and 

just not paying attention to the language for the 

moment, the focus was on post-SORNA activity, because 

Congress has put in place this new regime which is 

supposed to address the problem of missing sex 

offenders.  People who are taking steps after SORNA goes 

into effect, you know, offenders, to evade their 

registration requirements are now subject to these new, 

more comprehensive Federal penalties as well as State 

penalties. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I think that I 

remain a little bit confused by the question one of my 

colleagues answered, and I'm not sure if this last 

answer by you is helping me understand it, which is if 

SORNA now -- if every State is supposed to pass 

legislation which requires sex offenders who have been 

convicted elsewhere and moved to their State to 

register, why do you -- I think that's what you -- that 

you answered affirmatively for Justice Kennedy, correct? 

SORNA requires every State to pass laws that obligate 

people who have been convicted in other States to

MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that's right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So why do you 

need SORNA?  Why can't those States that the individual 

has moved to simply prosecute the person for a failure to 

register?  Why do you need SORNA? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Those States could do that. 

And I -- as to why we need SORNA, why Congress thought 

that SORNA was a good idea, I -- I think there are a 

couple of reasons.  One is that there are Federal 

offenders and Congress, I think, believed that it was a 

special Federal responsibility to -- to make sure that 

Federal sex offenders were registered.  And in addition, 

Congress regarded the problem of -- of unregistered sex 

offenders as a Federal problem, and it was one that, 

after SORNA was enacted and this new systematic regime 

was put in place, was more appropriate for Federal 

prosecution.  But I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Perhaps Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you think part of it 

is there was a -- SORNA requires a lot more information 

than was required under the State statutes? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Yes.  SORNA is much more 

expansive both in -- in the type of information that's 

required and in the mechanism, in requiring in-person

be as active in prosecuting violations as the Federal 

Government would be. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that is -- that's 

possible, too, and again that is a prospective focus. 

And, of course, I -- my final point is that discussion of 

the purpose I think illuminates this to some extent, but 

the language itself is absolutely clear.  There is no 

reason to go beyond the plain text of the statute.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Petitioner's offense under 18 U.S.C. 2250(a) 

occurred when he failed to register as required by SORNA 

well after SORNA was enacted.  As Justice Ginsburg 

elucidated, he does not dispute that the first paragraph 

of SORNA can be triggered by a pre-SORNA conviction, and

adopting his construction of paragraph (2)(B) would 

create a serious structural anomaly between the Federal 

offenders, with whom there is no requirement that they 

engage in any post-SORNA conduct other than the failure 

to register, and the State sex offenders, who are the 

majority of the missing sex offenders that Congress 

intended to capture by enacting the new registration 

regime and ensuring that there would be a serious 

Federal penalty that would encourage offenders who had 

used interstate travel to evade their registration 

requirements to get back on the registration rolls. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. -- Mr. Carr, was 

in violation of the law the instant it was passed, 

right? 

MR. GANNON:  We don't think he was in 

violation of the law the instant it was passed for 

purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause; under cases like 

Tranbarger and Samuels, we think that he did have a 

reasonable period of time to comply with the new 

obligation.  This is a problem that would occur with all 

sorts of Federal criminal statutes based on a status 

that somebody was in at the time something was made 

criminal. 

In the -- in the case prohibiting possession 

of handguns by persons who had been convicted of 

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, that this Court 

upheld that statute last year, when that statute came 

into effect, if somebody had the relevant conviction on 

the books and possessed a handgun, they would have been 

guilty at the instant the statute came into effect, but 

they would have been allowed a reasonable period to come 

into compliance.  That's the reasoning that the Court 

used in Tranbarger and in Samuels; somebody who acquired 

alcohol legally before a statutory prohibition provision 

came into effect would be given a reasonable period of time 

to divest himself of possession. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's -- an obvious 

question.  What’s the government's view on what a 

reasonable time is? 

MR. GANNON:  Well, it's going to depend upon 

the facts of the individual case, as the Tranbarger 

Court recognized.  In -- in the context of this 

statute, where somebody is typically allowed only 3 

business days to update their registration, we think it 

would be a fairly short period.  It's something that --

that -- that may depend on all sorts of circumstances. 

If Petitioner -- or if a defendant, a sex offender, was 

in the hospital for a long period of time and unable to 

make it to the registry, that would provide him with an 

-- an affirmative defense under the text of 2250(b).

he's in the hospital and he has got a defense there, 

so --

MR. GANNON:  Well, that -- that's right, 

and -- but I -- but we do think that it is a background 

principle in -- in all of these cases that if somebody 

is literally unable to avoid the criminal consequences 

of their pre-enactment conduct, that that would raise the 

concerns that the Ex Post Facto Clause is intended to 

solve.  And in cases like --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But no -- but as far 

as a reasonable time goes, nobody's literally incapable 

of doing it the same day the law passed. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Unless they meet one 

of the other exceptions. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, this -- I mean, this is 

-- that's -- we -- we think that somebody does need a 

reasonable time to come into compliance.  It doesn't 

need to be a long time.  But this is an issue that --

that exists in the statute completely separate from the 

travel requirement here.  The Federal offenders who 

are -- who are covered by paragraph (2)(A) -- there’s no 

requirement, there’s no actus reus for them under 2250, 

other than the fact that they have a previous 

conviction, which can be pre-SORNA. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where -- where -- where? 

(2)(A)?  Which is where? 

MR. GANNON:  This is in 2250(a)(2)(A).  It's 

on page 1a of the government's appendix.  And so 

paragraph (2) is divided between (A) and (B) --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.  “Or” --

MR. GANNON:  (A) applies to sex offenders 

who -- who are sex offenders by virtue of a conviction 

under Federal or tribal law.  Federal law --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And they don't have to 

travel in interstate commerce. 

MR. GANNON:  They don't have to travel in 

interstate commerce because of the "or" between (A) and 

(B).  The only thing they have to do --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 

MR. GANNON:  -- is then knowingly fail to 

register or update a registration as required by SORNA 

in paragraph (3).

for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause here is not 

something that the Court can -- can sidestep by deciding 

that interstate travel needs to occur after the statute 

was enacted.  And, indeed, if somebody were traveling on 

the day the statute was enacted, there would still be a 

question about whether they had a reasonable time to 

comply. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you happen to know what 

Indiana law provided at the time?  Within what period of 

time after moving to Indiana was the Respondent required 

to -- rather, the Petitioner required to register? 

MR. GANNON:  It -- it was a few days at the 

time.  He was also required under Alabama law -- when he 

registered and signed a sex offender registration form 

in Alabama in 2004, it said that he was required to 

notify the law enforcement authorities in the 

jurisdiction of his new residence within 10 days of his 

arrival there.  And the Indiana law was -- was I believe 

a period of 7 or 10 days at -- at the time. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, should the reasonable 

time -- should the period under SORNA, which isn't 

specified by statute, be the same as the period under 

the law of the State into which the person moves?

MR. GANNON:  And it does require in -- in 

16913(c), that somebody update the registration after a 

change in residence within 3 business days of -- of 

coming to the new residence.  And so we -- we do think 

that that would be relevant in evaluating what would be 

a reasonable time period to come into compliance here. 

This is the sort of thing that -- that after the statute 

already comes into effect, that it would -- it would require 

somebody to comply within 3 days.  If they moved a 

year later, then -- then that should be a reasonable time 

period to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you clarify --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How long ago --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you clarify what you 

mean by “the statute comes into effect”?  Because if I 

understand correctly, there’s only one State and one 

Indian tribe that are in compliance. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, that's -- that’s partly 

true, Justice Ginsburg.  Since -- since the press 

release that's cited in the briefs, another Indian tribe 

has come into substantial compliance.  But what's 

32 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

important here is that that's just a question of whether 

the State is in substantial compliance with SORNA's 

requirements for purposes of receiving Federal funding 

under -- under the Byrne program. 

And here even if a State has not come into 

substantial compliance -- and Indiana has not yet been 

certified as having come into substantial compliance --

it still had a functioning sex offender registry that 

would take most of the information that SORNA required 

Petitioner to provide, things like his name, his 

physical characteristics --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that would be what 

their --

It wouldn't be -- you have -- SORNA is in effect, but what 

the State is implementing is the pre-SORNA State law, right? 

MR. GANNON:  It's true that, especially 

before SORNA was enacted, that that's all the State was 

doing, if the State has amended its law since then, and 

Indiana did update its law in 2006. 

But to the extent -- so the State may well 

accept Congress's invitation to restructure its 

registration system to match what SORNA requires, but

doubt that someone like Petitioner can go in and 

register.  He was supposed to be registered, and, indeed, 

after he was arrested in a -- in an incident in 2007, he 

did register under Indiana law, and he provided the 

information that Indiana was willing to take.  And so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what do you 

do with Mr. Rothfeld's hypothetical about someone who 

travels in interstate commerce as a young child and, 

20 years later, is covered by SORNA? 

MR. GANNON:  Well, we think that that's not 

covered under the sequencing argument that we’ve made, 

which -- which partakes of the purpose of the statute 

that Justice Alito was talking about and -- and the 

order in which the relevant acts occur. 

As long as somebody is already a convicted 

sex offender of the kind that SORNA requires to 

register, and they are within the time period within 

which SORNA would require them to register -- and 

Petitioner here is a tier II sex offender, so he would 

be required to register for 15 years after his 2004 sex 

offense conviction.  As long as he is within that period 

when he engages in the travel, then we think that it’s 

within the heartland of what Congress was concerned 

about, which is a sex offender who is engaging in 

interstate travel --

to the child traveling and then 20 years later is --

MR. GANNON:  Is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- is because it's 

-- you have to require under SORNA before the travel? 

MR. GANNON:  It's -- no, it's -- you have to 

have been convicted of a sex offense, because that --

that's what brings you within the category of persons --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know where you get 

that from.  I can understand how you can say, which is 

what Mr. Rothfeld says, that it has to follow the 

requirement to register.  That's the way the statute 

reads:  Whoever, one, is required to register, not 

whoever has committed an offense that -- that would 

later justify registration.  It seems to me you are just 

making up the -- the prior act that -- that triggers the 

interstate travel requirement. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, I don't think that we are 

making it up, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what text do you base 

it on?  (1) says "is required to register," and the 

position of the Petitioner is:  After you are required 

to register, you must travel in interstate commerce. 

And you say:  No, it's after you commit the offense that

you must travel in interstate.  Where do you get that 

from? 

MR. GANNON:  Well, we get that from the 

facts -- from the context here, from the anomaly that 

would be created, the structural anomaly about the 

differential treatment between Federal and State sex 

offenders.  The fact that the purpose of the statute is 

to recapture missing sex offenders, which are persons 

who engaged in interstate travel to elude the 

registration requirements that already apply to them as 

sex offenders.  And so we think that when Congress 

invoked the -- its powers to regulate travel and 

interstate commerce, in order to give that element 

meaning, we think that it makes sense to apply it to 

persons who already have the type of sex offense 

convictions that SORNA requires them to register for. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your answer to 

Justice Scalia is that you don't get it from the 

language?  You get it from the anomaly; you get it from 

the purpose. 

MR. GANNON:  We get it from the context. 

That's right.  And we know that the plain language of 

the statute can't completely control this inquiry, 

because the Congress changed the language that existed 

earlier in the drafting process of the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what about going back 

to the purpose?  There's a section on page 26 of the House 

report where they go in some length to saying that the 

purpose is this is going to help with 100,000 missing 

people.  Don't worry; if you can't remember, it doesn't 

matter.  What they say is there are 100,000 missing. 

What they do is they travel, let's say, from Alabama to 

California and they don't register.  Now, this statute 

is going to help with that. 

Well, how does it help with that?  They are 

already supposed to register in California.  And I 

thought, well, maybe the way it helps with that is that 

it imposes some new information requirements, so that 

Alabama, if it were complying, would now have a lot of 

information about the sex offender, and it would have an 

obligation -- it could more easily track him down, or at 

least California could or somebody could more easily 

track him down, because he has to give information to 

Alabama, and Alabama has a registry up. 

Is there something like that in this? 

MR. GANNON:  Well, there is something like that, 

but that's not all that’s going on.  On page 26 of the 

House report --

Justice Breyer, it specifically says that sex offenders 

who fail to comply will face felony criminal 

prosecution.  And this -- this was a way --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but that’s -- that’s 

true of everybody whether they have moved or not moved. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, it's --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That is, what I’m --

the reason I brought up the other is because if this 

is just a jurisdictional hook, I can see why Congress 

might be trying to get as many people as they want 

to register. 

But this -- this also serves some purpose, 

like we’re going to make Alabama get some information, 

makes it easier to catch these people, that purpose 

wouldn't be served when the travel takes place before 

this takes effect because Alabama wouldn't have kept the 

information then. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that Congress did 

pass the statute for -- for multiple reasons in -- in 

order to encourage there to be a more effective, 

comprehensive nationwide registration scheme.  And one 

of the things that that required was -- anticipated, was 

standardization among the States. 

But it was also -- these -- Mr. Carr was 

required to register both by the law of Alabama and

by the law of Indiana at the time when he committed his 

sex offense and when he moved from one State to the 

other.  Congress considered that type of regime as 

being inadequate.  Congress obviously thought that 

the State violations that were occurring with 

100,000 sex offenders who had eluded registration, 

gone underground, was a problem they wanted to solve. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So Congress passes 

this statute.  And how does it help specifically with 

that? 

MR. GANNON:  Well, it -- it first of all 

imposes a Federal registration requirement.  So in --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So the person who 

hasn't registered in California --

MR. GANNON:  -- in 16913 --

JUSTICE BREYER:  He’s afraid of the Feds. 

He didn't -- he wasn't afraid of the California police, 

but he’s afraid of the Feds.  Okay.  I've got it.  I've 

got that.  Any other thing? 

MR. GANNON:  It's -- it's not just that he’s 

afraid of the Feds when they can come with 

prosecutorial powers under section 2250.  It is also, as 

you say, that there are several aspects of SORNA that 

will encourage there to be much more cooperation among 

jurisdictions in standardizing this information,

notifying different jurisdictions when somebody moves 

from one to another --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  As far as I can read 

that page, it seemed to me, insofar as what you’ve just said 

is true, that would happen only after this statute is 

passed.  And, therefore, the fact that he had moved 

before the statute is passed would not trigger the 

cooperation.  It might trigger the Fed prosecution part, 

but it wouldn't trigger the cooperation part. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, that -- that's true, but 

we already know that this is true without regard to 

post-SORNA travel for persons who have Federal sex 

offense convictions. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The only reason I bring it 

up is if this is a very close case.  That tends to cut 

somewhat against you; namely, that the thing applies 

full-force in terms of its purposes to people who travel 

after, but it only applies as sort of this weak thing to 

people who travel before. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, I think, to the extent 

that the committee report identified 100,000 missing sex 

offenders as the most significant enforcement problem in 

the sex offender context, 10 years after every single 

State and the Federal government had passed a panoply of 

sex offender registration requirements, shows that they

sex offender registry rolls.  And that this provision, 

if it is -- if it is read to treat Federal and State sex 

offenders more consistently, which is to require them 

both -- to subject them both to potential Federal 

prosecution if they knowingly fail to register after 

SORNA comes into effect --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but -- but it doesn't, 

because if you haven't been -- if you are convicted of a 

Federal offense, you are automatically in, but if you 

are convicted of a State offense, you’re in only if you 

travel in interstate commerce after that offense.  So 

you don't resolve the inconsistency between (A) and (B). 

There is still going to be some inconsistency between 

the two. 

MR. GANNON:  There is going to be some 

inconsistency --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly. 

MR. GANNON:  -- but we think that it's 

dramatically lessened, and it's important in this 

context to --

powerful point.  There is inconsistency between (A) and

JUSTICE BREYER:  Have you been able to 

find -- when in doubt about the purpose, let's turn to 

the language.  Is it the case that you found any other 

statute, any other statute, where Congress phrased a 

jurisdictional hook in the present tense? 

MR. GANNON:  I think that lots of 

jurisdictional hooks referring to travel and interstate 

commerce are phrased in present tense.  There are --

there are a handful that -- that are -- are specifically 

tailored and have extra language, like the one we cite 

dealing with gambling devices that have been transported 

in interstate commerce after the effective date of that 

particular statute.  But, for the most part, I think 

that they are phrased in present tense and --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you find anywhere where 

they’re both phrased in present tense and it was 

pretty clear that Congress intended to catch activity 

that was -- at least where the jurisdictional part took 

place before the statute took effect?  You find that 

good an analogy anywhere?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I tried to find

in -- in the Code, and in each of those cases that I 

found it's always -- it looks like it's -- it's linked 

directly to the activity that's meant to be covered,

activity that's against the law. 

MR. GANNON:  That's -- that's true.  In

travel element, that's true.  In some -- in 

some cases like the -- the statute at issue in the 

Trupin case about possession of -- of stolen goods 

that have traveled in interstate commerce, that --

that's -- that's -- that's an invocation of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, where -- where it 

means prior travel, it says so, use of a firearm that 

has traveled in interstate commerce.  They use the past

traveled vis-à-vis the act that was in question there. 

And -- and here -- neither side is contending that --

that the travel can happen after the failure to register 

and somebody immediately then becomes guilty of the 

offense. 

We think that the sequencing requirement 

makes sense on both ends, that somebody needs to have 

the sex offense conviction before they travel, and then 

they need to fail to register after they have -- they 

have engaged in the travel, because that's the concern 

that Congress was trying to get at, persons who were 

able to use the fact of interstate travel to evade 

registration. 

And the reason, Mr. Chief Justice, why I 

think that Congress didn't include a purpose requirement 

there is because Congress didn't want sex offenders to 

be able to take advantage of the fact that they had 

another good reason to travel.  If my employer transfers 

me from one State to another, and then I take advantage 

of that situation to go underground and not re-register, 

that’s one of the 100,000 missing sex offenders that 

Congress was concerned about, even though I would have 

had a good defense to the charge that I had traveled with 

the purpose or for the purpose of evading sex offender 

registration requirements.

Justice Sotomayor, I think you were asking a 

question about -- about why the -- what the purpose 

would be served here if States would already have the 

underlying offense that would be made criminal by SORNA. 

I think that there are a couple different answers to 

that. 

Mr. Rothfeld acknowledged that Congress may 

well have intended there to be extra force that would 

come from the -- from the Federal prosecution itself. 

But separately I think it's important to note that --

that States were given time to comply with SORNA, to 

come into substantial compliance with SORNA.  And -- and 

even though no State at this point has said that they 

don't intend to come into compliance with SORNA, 

Congress couldn't necessarily have expected States to 

adopt the particular offense that they -- that 

they were concerned about.  And I think that -- that --

that here Congress did want to -- to cover that 

situation. 

One other factual point that’s associated 

with the -- the effectiveness there that was brought up 

in the briefs and hasn't come up today is the question 

of -- of when the prior Wetterling Act offenses were 

repealed. 

And I -- I -- in section 129 of SORNA, the

Wetterling Act offense was repealed effective 3 

years after the date of SORNA's effective date, even 

without regard to the 1-year extensions issued by the 

Attorney General, notwithstanding a point in the 

Petitioner's reply brief, simply because section 129 

doesn't incorporate 124(B), which has the extension 

provision for the Attorney General. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- understand some of 

the delay Congress may have in passing a law with 

specifics about how things are done.  Are you worried at 

all under Lambert whether or not there might be a due 

process violation in all the indeterminate provisions of 

this law?  Where do you -- yes, you’re supposed to 

register, but States don't have a place for you to 

register, and now you are supposed to know that you are 

supposed to register under the old systems, and you 

don't know how much time to do it in. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I think here that 

there -- the question of notice and knowledge has not 

been an issue because it’s --

offender registry. 

Official 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Absolutely --

MR. GANNON:  And -- and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but they don't have a 

SORNA place to register. 

MR. GANNON:  Well, it's the same place. 

What SORNA requires is that you provide the following 

types of information to the relevant officials that run 

the sex offender registry for the jurisdiction.  And 

“jurisdiction” is defined to include the State. 

And, so, in -- in -- in these cases, even if 

the State hasn't changed the name on the door to SORNA 

registration facility -- it's just sex offender 

registration facility under, you know, Zachary's Law, 

which is the name of the Indiana sex offender registration 

law, as opposed to Megan's Law -- there is -- they are 

still required by SORNA to register, which requires them 

to give information to the relevant officials in the 

relevant jurisdiction. 

And the jurisdiction is there; the officials 

are there.  They are taking the information.  As long as 

the officials will take the information, the failure to 

do that is a violation of 2250. 

And there’s one -- one other point that 

Petitioner was making in the reply brief was that there 

47 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

seemed to be some confusion about -- about whether there 

was an offense under SORNA when States had not yet come 

into compliance or whether that would have been an 

offense only under the pre-SORNA Wetterling Act. 

And -- and the reason that there isn't a 

SORNA violation there, if -- if a State has not yet 

decided to accept things like digital palm prints or 

whatever the extra information is that SORNA would 

require, the -- the defendant is still required to 

provide that, what information the State will accept. 

And the affirmative defense in 2250(b) would only be 

applicable in circumstances where the State wouldn't 

take that extra information. 

So it's only those aspects of SORNA that are 

above and beyond what the State will allow the offender 

to do, that he's excused from complying with by the 

affirmative defense, that it's uncontrollable circumstances 

that he -- that he can't provide a DNA sample or a palm 

print in a particular State that doesn't do that yet. 

But as long as the State is taking the rest of the 

information, he needs to give that. 

And this is a case where Petitioner utterly 

failed to give any of the information to Indiana once he 

arrived there at the end of 2004 or beginning of 2005. 

So, there's -- there's no dispute that the State would

have taken that information had he been in compliance 

with that law.  Once SORNA later came into effect, he 

probably wouldn't have been in violation of SORNA at 

that point. 

But -- but that -- there's nothing unusual 

about the fact that he could have engaged in pre-enactment 

conduct that would have prevented him from being in 

violation, just as the person convicted of a misdemeanor 

possession -- misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, if 

he doesn't possess a gun before the -- the new provision 

in 922 comes into effect, then he hasn't committed the 

offense.  If somebody doesn't acquire the alcohol before 

the statutory prohibition comes into effect that was at 

issue in Samuels before that law came into effect, then 

he hadn't committed the offense. 

So, there’s nothing unusual about saying 

that he could have complied with SORNA effectively in 

anticipation of its being enacted, even though it 

didn't yet exist. 

The -- the -- the question here is whether 

he knowingly failed to register as required by SORNA 

after it came into effect.  And -- and we think that --

that -- that he did, because he had already engaged in 

the interstate travel after he had been convicted of a 

sex offense.

up any of your rebuttal time, but this is sort of by way 

of unfinished business.  Justice Alito asked three 

questions at the beginning of this interesting exercise. 

I think you only answered the first.  I don't even

second, which mentioned other provisions in this -- in

MR. ROTHFELD:  The -- those all appear in 

the civil registration provision, not in the criminal 

provision.  And my answer to Justice Alito's question is 

that we are not aware of any case in which the Congress 

has used a present-tense verb in a criminal statute to 

attach criminal consequences to conduct that took place 

before the statute was enacted.  And --

MR. ROTHFELD:  That is correct.  At the time 

that Congress wrote those civil provisions, this

offenders had to register.  It did not give him any

is that "travels" is in the present tense, and that 

means present and future.  But there are provisions of

past conduct.  So why doesn't that knock the legs out 

from under your textual argument?

argument.  That's one of our arguments, and the 

argument which I think is dispositive.  Given the way 

that the Attorney General -- the Solicitor General 

has presented the case relates to the first element 

of the offense, which is that the action -- the 

offender is required to register under SORNA, which, as 

we have said, has to take place after SORNA is enacted. 

I think Mr. Gannon candidly acknowledged 

that basically, that has to be read to mean something 

different.  It has to be read to mean "is a sex 

offender," and that is simply not a plausible reading of 

the statute.  Not only because of the plain words "is 

required to register," but the provision of the offense 

which addresses Federal sex offenders sets out three 

elements as to them.  As to a Federal sex offender, it 

must be someone who is required to register. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Gannon may have 

made an argument that’s not helpful to his position, 

but you can accept that the first provision means 

exactly what it says:  "is required to register."  And 

that takes effect on day when SORNA is enacted. 

There’s nothing in the statute that says 

that those three events have to take place in -- in a 

temporal sequence.  It doesn't say "is required to 

register and thereafter travels in interstate commerce."

It doesn't say that.  In fact, an earlier version did 

say that, and it was taken out, wasn't it? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  An earlier version said 

"travels thereafter."  I -- that was dropped, I would 

suggest, as superfluous, because the present-tense 

language encompasses that.  But it -- it would not make 

sense to say -- if one disregards the temporal sequence, 

that brings back the Lincoln Tunnel baby.  It would mean 

that someone could have traveled as an infant, and that 

satisfies the SORNA travel requirements. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It doesn't if that results 

from the aim of the statute, rather than the order in 

which those elements are set out in the statute. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  But I'd suggest, 

Justice Alito, that requires an extensive rewriting of 

the language of the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't.  He said, first 

the crime has to take place, before the travel. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  And one has to -- one would 

have to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And, moreover, there’s a 

statutory limitation, because after a certain period of 

years, you don't have to register anymore.  So the 

hypotheticals about the infant and 20 years ago are out, 

because the longest it could last is 15 years.

MR. ROTHFELD:  But one has to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then you wouldn't have 

committed the crime as an infant, so there we are. 

But it's still a long time, 15 years, I grant you. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, and even so, one has to 

read into that limitation as to where -- why it is that 

there is that limit on -- on the --

language "is required to register" to "has committed 

a" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, you don't have 

to -- you don't have to do that.  I guess my problem 

with your argument -- you say, "is required to register 

under SORNA."  But you can be required to register under 

SORNA before SORNA is enacted to the extent that SORNA 

is retroactive.  You ask someone:  Why are you 

registering?  Well, SORNA tells me I -- I have to. 

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I’d suggest that that’s 

a peculiar reading of the term "is required to 

register," that, as written, it seems to me as a present-

tense requirement.  You are now currently required to 

comply with the terms of the statute.  It does not say: 

You are required -- you are a sex offender within -- as
