 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 07-1125, Fitzgerald v. Barnstable 
School Committee.

 Mr. Rothfeld.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you.  If it please the 

Court:

 The court of appeals in this case -- excuse 

me, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you raise the 

podium?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Actually, I have never used 
this before, so it's a learning experience for me, Your 
Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's enough.
 MR. ROTHFELD:  Okay.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  We can't see you.
 MR. ROTHFIELD:  That -- that may be an 

advantage, Your Honor.
 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we can hear you.
 MR. ROTHFELD:  If -- if I should modify it,

please -- please let me know.

 The court of appeals in this case made two 
fundamental and separate errors, each of which should 
require reversal of its decision.  First, all agree that 
the question whether Title IX precludes the use of 
Section 1983 to enforce the Constitution is a matter of 
congressional intent.  Yet, the court of appeals 
entirely disregarded all of the ordinary indicia of 
congressional intent:  The statutory text, the statutory 
background structure and evolution, the unquestioned 
legislative purpose.

 Each of these considerations points 

conclusively towards a single outcome:  Congress did not 
mean Title IX to preclude the use of Section 1983 to 
enforce the Constitution.

 Second, rather than consider any of this 

direct and compelling evidence of what Congress actually 
had in mind in Title IX, the court of appeals applied 
what it thought to be a presumption that the 
availability of Title IX's implied right of action to 
enforce Title IX's own statutory prohibition of gender 
discrimination somehow should be taken to mean that 
Congress meant to preclude the use of Section 1983 to 
enforce constitutional rules against discrimination.

there is a little bit of an air of unreality about all 
this, because, of course, Congress didn't provide a 
cause of action in Title IX to start with.  And the 
reason they don't have all these limitations and 
restrictions is because they didn't put in the cause of 
action.

 We implied it from the statute, and so it 

seems kind of awkward to say:  Well, there are no 
limitations, as I said, when there was no cause of 
action.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I guess there --
there are a number of points that I -- I can make in 
response to that, Your Honor.  First of all, I think 
what -- what you say is absolutely right.  Congress did 
not expressly provide a cause of action in Title IX.
 And so since -- since the question in a 

preclusion case, the question whether or not Congress 
meant to preclude the use of Section 1983, is whether 
there is a clear indication of congressional intent to 
do so, that there -- as a matter of definition, that 
can't be present here.  But -- but before --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe the question ought to 

be whether this Court intended to have the Title IX 
action which it invented preclude 1983.  Why don't we 
look to the intent of this Court?

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I think not, Your 

Honor.  I think that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you agree that this 

Court invented the cause of action?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  No, I -- I don't agree with 

that.  I -- I do think -- and -- and I -- this is not my 
principal point, but I do think it's quite clear that if 
we are talking about what is the clear intent of 
Congress regarding preclusion of use of Section 1983, 
that the Congress did not expressly create a -- a 
private right of action at all bears very significantly 
on that.

 I don't at all disagree that Congress 

intended and expected that the courts would recognize 
the right of action under -- under Title IX.  But 
Congress actually in Title IX specifically I think 
addressed the preclusion question that we have here.

 There is a clear statutory test that answers 

the question in this case in -- in several respects. 
First of all, when Congress enacted Title IX, it 
specifically provided that -- it specifically 
contemplated that there would be continued, private 
constitutional litigation challenging -- to end 
discrimination.

 It specifically authorized the attorney

general to intervene in private litigation "whenever" --
and I am here quoting from the text of the statute --
"whenever suit is initiated in any court of the United 
States to assert rights, deprivation of equal 
protection, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the 
Constitution on account of sex."

 Congress, therefore, specifically 

contemplated when it enacted Title IX that there would 
be -- there would, in fact, be constitutional litigation 
challenging gender discrimination on account of sex. 
And Congress surely knew that that litigation would 
proceed under Section 1983.  Respondents --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did we rely on that 

provision in implying the right of action under Title 
IX?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  The -- the Court did not.  I 
mean there, the -- the Court looked at what it took to 
be the general -- the manifest congressional intent when 
-- when it enacted Title IX.  But it did not 
specifically rely on -- on that legislation.  The 
legislation, of course, goes to whether or not Section 
1983 suits were available, not whether there is a Title 
IX implied right of action available.

 And, as I say, in that -- in that 

legislative language Congress made expressly clear that

it intended -- and intended actually to facilitate by 
allowing the attorney general to intervene in --
continued Section 1983 litigation to enforce allegations 
of -- of gender discrimination.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rothfeld, I follow 
your argument entirely, and then in the civil rights 
area there are a lot of overlapping statutes.  You can 
sue under Title VII.  It doesn't take away your right 
under 1981.

 But in this case, as we get down to what 

this case is about, we have a determination by a court 
that the school district acted reasonably in relation to 
these complaints.  And then you say:  But we have 
constitutional claim.  A constitutional claim requires 
you to show deliberate, intentional conduct if it's an 
individual; if you are talking about an institution, 
some kind of not just one incident, but a custom, a 
pattern.

 What, when you get down to the merits, is 
different about those?  In other words, is it on the 
wrong track to talk about precluding a statute?  Instead 
of talking about just plain old issue preclusion, what 
is different about 1983?

 Yes, you have two claims; but if you lose 

under IX, you are going to lose under 1983 as well.

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, that -- that is right, 
Your Honor, to the extent that the claims are identical 
and that they have actually been adjudicated.

 The -- the First Circuit in this case 
resolved the Title IX claim focusing on deliberate 
indifference in response to the peer-on-peer sexual 
harassment.  To the extent that there is a federal 
constitutional claim growing out of that conduct of the 
same sort and to the extent that the elements of that 
claim are identical, then we agree that at that point 
that would be precluded.  But we think that there is 
more to this case than that one issue that has been 
resolved.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What more?  What more is 
alleged in the complaint?  I thought the complaint just 
spoke about deliberate indifference.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I guess there are 
-- are two points in -- in response to that, Your Honor. 
First of all, I think that the complaint can be taken to 
allege in addition more generic --

(Banging sound.)
 MR. ROTHFELD:  I hope I am not responsible 

for that.

MR. ROTHFELD:  And I -- I assure you I will 

-- I will use them, Your Honor.

 The -- the complaint, we think, should be 

taken also to be generally in response to complaints of 
-- of misconduct by individuals within the school, but 
in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Spell that out -- spell 

that out practically.  I know you used --

MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think -- for example, 

Your Honor, we think that one thing that -- that could 
be developed and explored further is disparate treatment 
of complaints; for example, the treatment of 
complaints of bullying by boys more favorably perhaps 
than by girls, believing testimony of boys rather than 
believing testimony of girls.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there was no 
allegation at all of that kind in this complaint.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I -- I agree that that 

was not set out specifically in the complaint.  The 
complaint did say in a -- in a general sense that 
Jacqueline Fitzgerald was denied equal access to the 
benefits of education.  It says that the discrimination 
she suffered included but was not limited to sexual 
harassment.  It asked for relief, injunctive relief, to 
bar unconstitutional treatment not only of Jacqueline

Fitzgerald but of all female students in the school, 
which I think --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, could you have 

brought a claim that they didn't let the female students 
play hockey under your complaint?  I mean, that's 
additional discrimination.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Didn't it have to be 

related to the particular facts?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Yes, that's right.  I 

think --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And you talked about you 
wanted some additional discovery.  What?  What is it 
that you could go to a district judge now and say, 
Judge, I have a basis here for asking for discovery on a 
different but related theory?  What words would you use? 
What would you write in that request?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, there are a number of 

points I should make in response to that, Your Honor.  I 
think one is, just as a general matter, we think that 
that's something -- this entire set of questions are 
things that are better resolved by the courts of 
appeals -- on -- the court of appeals on remand.  I 
think that there are -- there are unresolved 
constitutional --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The reason I ask is 

obviously if this case happens to be a case in which, 
because of the finding that there was no intentional 
discrimination and the school board behaved properly, 
that if that's the finding and therefore you have no 
claim under 1983 in respect to that, it becomes very 
theoretical to say that they went too far and said you 
might have no other 1983 claim because you would have 
some other 1983 claim, but we should dismiss this as 
improvidently granted and wait until somebody does this 
again.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, certainly -- I --

certainly, I understand that suggestion, Justice Breyer. 
And let me give you two responses to that.  First a 
specific response to why it could happen on remand. 
This is not a theoretical possibility.  There was 
actually discovery that was requested concerning 
additional complaints, concerning additional 
disciplinary action against other students, concerning 
requests for bus monitors, as to which could have been 
developed that there was disparate treatment as to 
those.  The Respondents declined --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I still don't follow. 
What disparate treatment?  Did you have to have that 
they treated girl's complaints one way and boy's

complaints another way?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that would be one way 

in which --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And as far as this record 

shows, there has just been this one incident of 
harassment.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Again, Your Honor, I think 
one of the problems is that this case sort of went off 
the tracks at the earliest possible stage, at the -- at 
the time this motion for dismissal was granted.  And it 
could have developed in quite a different way.

 For example, discovery was requested on 
these subjects that I -- that I mentioned to Justice 
Breyer, which -- which could have been used to develop 
that, in fact, requests by boys were treated more 
favorably than requests by girls; complaints by boys 
were responded to more -- more favor --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that request here in the 

record?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Excuse me, Your Honor?
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that request here?
 MR. ROTHFELD:  The discovery request?
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Do I have the request in 
the joint -- in the a -- do I have it in the appendix 
here?

MR. ROTHFELD:  No.  No.  It --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So, we don't have it in 

front of us?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  You do not have it in front 
of you.  But I can tell you that the request was made, 
the Respondents declined to respond it to it for, among 
other reasons, the -- their assertion that it would not 
lead to the discovery of relevant evidence or admissible 
evidence.  After the 1983 conclusion ruling, and because 
of the conclusion ruling, that was not followed up 
because it would have been futile to try to develop 
additional argumentation in that -- in that direction.
 Had the case not hopped the track at this 

point, if the complaint could have amended -- could have 
been amended, additional individual defendants could 
have been added, the case could have gone on in quite a 
different direction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Rothfeld, we were -- we 

were warned about all these problems in the brief in 
opposition, weren't we?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That is correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Didn't that focus almost 
entirely upon the fact that there is no 1983 cause of 
action anyway?

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And we nonetheless 

granted -- granted cert?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Precisely the same arguments 
that were made in almost identical language in the brief 
in opposition are now being made as an argument as to 
why this Court should decide the merits of the 1983 
claim or dismiss as improvidently granted.

 The Court -- I don't presume to tell the 

Court what it was thinking when it granted review of the 
case, but it did presumably reject those arguments at 
that point, and there is no reason that they are any 
additional basis now.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  What I understand, Mr. 

Rothfeld, that if you win on the question presented, you 
would agree that the -- the arguments the other side 
makes on this, on whether there's a cause of action 
under equal protection and so forth, that would remain 
open on remand?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Absolutely.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And you may still lose the 

lawsuit even if you win here?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That is -- that is absolutely 
correct.  The constitutional arguments were made on the 
merits to the district court and to the court of 
appeals.  They were not addressed by either.  Those

courts cut it short and threw the case out on conclusion 
grounds.

 And I -- I think the way in which the court 

of appeals decided the case actually suggests that it 
was of the view that there was more to the case than 
simply the Title IX claims that had been rejected, 
because one would have thought that if the court of 
appeals was of the view that there is nothing to the 
case beyond the Title IX peer-on-peer harassment claim 
that has been reject, it would have ended its discussion 
at that point.  It would have said:  We reject your 
Title IX claim; there is nothing more to your 1983 
constitutional claim; that's the end of the matter.

 But it didn't do that.  It decided the Title 

IX claim on the merits, rejecting it.  And it then 
separately went on to address the Section 1983 
constitutional claim and said:  We are not going to 
address those merits at all; we are going to say that 
those claims are precluded as a matter of per se Title 
IX law, that Title IX is preclusive.  And, therefore, 
one would think that the court of appeals had it in mind 
that there was more that could have been decided about 
the merits --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we find that out on 

remand.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What you're saying is 

they made a basic legal error.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You may have a losing 

case under 1983, but let the First Circuit decide that?
 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that is absolutely 

correct.  That is our --

JUSTICE BREYER:  How do we know that the 
First Circuit wasn't just thinking about the facts of 
this case in front of it when it said that there's no 
1983 action.  I mean, they didn't think there was no 
1983 action for search and seizure.  They must have had 
some idea of what the limitations of their saying no --
no -- no 1983 action was.  So why do we know that they 
went beyond what they had in front of them in this case? 
I'm not saying they didn't?  I am just wanting to know 
what we -- how we know that?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I think one of the 

problems is, of course, we don't know for sure what --
what they were thinking, and therefore, it makes sense 
to think that this Court, in the regular course of its 
practice could decide the question presented and to send 
the case back down to the lower courts --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But you see, the question 

presented, I guess is -- I'm trying to get the exact 
words, but it's whether the Title IX replaces the --
what is it, it's whether -- I'm sorry.  You have it 
right in front of you there.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Whether Title IX precludes 

the assertion of constitutional claims for gender 
discrimination in schools under section 1983.  The --
the -- the reason that I think --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You think they're --

they're referring to all of Title IX, no matter what the 
claims, whether they are overlapping or not?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I think that that is the 

language that the First Circuit uses.  The First Circuit 
says, in so many words, that Title IX is the exclusive 
avenue for the assertion of claims of gender 
discrimination arising out of -- arising from schools.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, because they were 
relying on case where we did say that a very detailed 
scheme was pre-emptive?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  They were relying on one case 
in which the Court said that, in Smith v. Robinson, the 
only time in 140 years that Section 1983 has been on the 
books that this Court has ever said that Congress meant 
to preclude its use to enforce a particular

constitutional right.  And I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It did that because if 
you could use 1983, then the very elaborate mechanism 
that Congress had set up, who would use it?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That's -- that's absolutely 

right.  But I -- I -- I add parenthetically that 
Congress promptly responded to the Court's decision in 
Smith by restoring the remedy --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Just on that one issue on 

attorneys' fees.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think that the 

language used is actually broader in the -- in the --
legislation.  But that, as I said, is a parenthetical 
point.

 I -- I think that something that we have 

here which was not present in Smith at all -- and as you 
said, Justice Ginsburg, it is absolutely right that 
there was a much more elaborate, involved administrative 
remedial scheme in the statute considered there, there 
is nothing remotely like that in Title IX.  But before 
you could even get to that point, there is this 
expressed evidence in the statutory text of Title IX 
that Congress did not mean to preclude.  This is Section 
1983.

 First there is the provision that I

mentioned regarding the attorney general, which -- which 
expressly contemplates there will be continued Section 
1983 constitutional gender discrimination after the 
enactment of Title IX.  I think that in and of itself 
was positive and tells the Court all it needs to know.
 But beyond -- there is -- there is more. 

Beyond that, there is the language of the 
antidiscrimination provisions of Title IX, which was 
borrowed directly, is identical to the language of Title 
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Congress dropped 
the phrase "race, color and national origin" that 
appears in Title VI and substituted "sex" in Title IX.

 And, so, the Court has recognized that 

Congress expected and intended that Title IX would be 
interpreted just as -- as had been Title VI.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Have there been any 

decisions on Title VI and 1983?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  There -- there had been a 

myriad of such decisions.  There had been, as we cite in 
our brief, as the American Bar Association cites in its 
amicus brief supporting us, the American Civil Liberties 
Union cites in its brief, there have been almost two 
dozen cases decided before the enactment of Title IX in 
which courts allowed the simultaneous assertion of 
statutory discrimination claims under Title VI and

section 1983 discrimination claims under Title IX. 
There had not been a single suggestion by any decision 
that there might possibly be preclusion.  And so, at the 
time that Congress used the language of Title IX, it 
knew that that language had been uniformly, widely 
construed across the country to allow the simultaneous 
assertion of those claims, not the preclusion of Section 
1983 claims for discrimination.

 And so it's when Congress -- when 

legislative language has been the subject of judicial 
construction, as the Court has said many times, and 
Congress repeats that language in a new statute, its 
expectation and intention is that the judicial 
construction is going to be taken as well.

 And so that I think that is also dispositive 
of the question in this case, because the Congress chose 
language that it necessarily knew had been understood 
not to preclude the use of Section 1983.

 And I will mention as well, just to throw in 

the suspenders along with the belt, an additional 
consideration that the court of appeals ignored here was 
the manifest legislative purpose of section -- of Title 
IX, which was to expand and strengthen protections 
against discrimination in schools.

Title IX is Spending Clause legislation, and that, under 
our precedents, imposes certain limitations on how we 
interpret it that would not be applicable under Section 
1983.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Absolutely correct.  And I 

think that there are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the point is 
that that would then allow 1983 actions to circumvent 
those limitations on the Title IX remedy.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I think not, for a 

couple of reasons, Your Honor.  First, as I say, there 
is this direct evidence of what Congress had in mind. 
It specifically referred to constitutional litigation 
under the Fourteenth Amendment when it enacted Title IX, 
and, therefore, by definition it could not have been 
concerned about evasion in that sense.  But I think that 
their -- "evasion" is not the word to use here because, 
on the one hand, there are statutory rights created by 
Title IX; on the other, there are pre-existing 
constitutional rights.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And those constitutional 

rights have negated -- I think it might be -- it's at 
least arguable that it would be harder to win a 1983 
case, given that, as to the individual, you have 
qualified immunity, and, as to the institution, you have

to show a custom or practice.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, the only availability 

for individual liability is under the Constitution, 
because Title IX, at least as construed by the lower 
courts, does not permit suits directly against the 
individual, only against the institution, which I think 
is a significant distinction between the two and 
supports the argument that Congress could not have 
intended to preclude because, as the Court has 
recognized repeatedly, the availability of individual 
liability greatly adds to the deterrence, the effect of 
deterring constitutional violations.

 And the suggestion that, when Congress 
enacted Title IX it would have -- meant to have the 
perverse effect of allowing a school, by accepting 
federal funds, to insulate school policymakers from any 
personal statutory liability, you know, for even the 
most blatant and obvious acts of unconstitutional sex 
discrimination, would turn Title IX on its head.  It's 
inconceivable that Congress could have had that in mind 
when it enacted a statute that was clearly designed to 
expand and strength protections against sex 
discrimination.

 I'll make sort of two additional points, 

Your Honor.  As I suggest, I think the direct evidence

in the statutory text, as well as the legislative 
purpose, is dispositive here and the Court need not go 
beyond that to answer the question here.  That leaves 
the question of how the court of appeals got the matter 
so far wrong.  And I think that the reason that they did 
is, ignoring the text, they applied what they thought to 
be a presumption derived from this Court's decision in 
cases like Smith v. Robinson and the Palos Verdes case 
that the creation of a new statutory right and a new 
statutory remedy necessarily reflects a congressional 
intent to preclude the use of Section 1983 to enforce 
overlapping constitutional remedies.  There has never 
been such a presumption.

 The Court has said repeatedly, I think, as 

was suggested earlier in the discussion, that when 
Congress creates new statutory rights and new statutory 
remedies, they are presumed to overlap with and to 
supplement existing statutory rights and remedies, 
unless the two are positively repugnant to one another, 
unless they are inconsistent and can't be reconciled. 
That certainly is not the case here.  The Section 1983 
constitutional claims and Title IX supplement and 
complement each other.  The two statutes are by no means 
coterminous in who can be sued.

 The Court has certainly never presumed that

the creation of any statutory right or statutory remedy 
bars the use of Section 1983 to enforce the 
Constitution, as suggested by Justice Ginsburg's 
question.  The Court has only once in well more than a 
century that Section 1983 has been on the books held 
that availability of the constitutional remedy had been 
precluded.  As I say, Congress promptly responded by 
providing that remedy.

 The Palos Verdes decision, which was the 

fulcrum of the court of appeals decision, I think 
suggests what's wrong with its analysis.  Palos Verdes 
involved a new statutory right, a new statutory action 
to enforce that right.  The statutory action was limited 
in significant respects, and the Court concluded, as a 
matter of common sense, that one could infer from that 
situation Congress intended that the new right with the 
new remedial system would be exclusive, otherwise 
plaintiffs could immediately go to court and render that 
system a dead letter.

 But, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his 

opinion for the Court, that remedy had no effect 
whatsoever on section 1983.  It meant that Congress had 
placed the new remedy outside of section 1983's remedial 
framework, but that claims that were available prior to 
the existence of that new right, prior to the creation

of that new right, remained available under section 
1983.  And that is exactly the situation that we have 
here.  Plaintiffs are not trying to allege a new 
statutory right that is outside the section 1983's 
remedial framework; instead, they are asserting 
fundamental, pre-existing constitutional rights.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I take it they don't 

have to bring these actions together.  They can sue 
under Title IX; if they lose, then they can start a 
whole new lawsuit under 1983?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think that to the 

extent -- as was suggested by Justice Ginsburg's point 
in questioning, to the extent that the claims are the 
same, then they would preclude it.  If the 1983 has the 
same elements, the same cause of action, it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It would be a different 

claim, but there would be issue preclusion.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Issue preclusion.  That's 

right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even if you have 

different -- I guess would you have a different set of 
defendants, right?  You would have the school in the 
Title IX case, the individuals in the 1983 action?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I think, to the extent that 
the suit was initially brought against the school under

Title IX for a type of claim that could have been 
brought as a parallel claim against the individual under 
section 1983, and the Title IX claim was rejected, to 
the extent that the elements are the same, presumably 
there would be a defense of collateral estoppel.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the official -- it's 

the plaintiff who would be precluded.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That's right.  That's right.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the plaintiff has had 

a full and fair opportunity to argue those issues.

Clause.  Therefore, having Title IX preclude section 
1983 Equal Protection claims does not deny petitioners 
in this or any other case availability --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you go over that 

again?  I didn't understand it.  You said Title IX 
provides --

MS. HODGE:  Title IX --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- against sex 

discrimination than the Constitution does.

 MS. HODGE:  Correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Explain that to me.
 MS. HODGE:  The Title IX prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of sex.  The Equal 
Protection Clause or section 1983 and the Equal 
Protection Clause require that additional intentional 
discrimination that this Court found in Personnel 
Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney.  We would 
suggest to the Court that Title IX actually covers a 
broad range of circumstances that may not involve that 
very specific intent required to perfect a 
constitutional violation.  And clearly -- if you look at 
the cases, the cases clearly involve a variety of 
instances which would not be sufficient under, say, a 
constitutional evaluation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Give me an example.

MS. HODGE:  An example would be the 

situation such as this particular situation.  We are 
told this is a case of peer-on-peer, student-on-student 
harassment.  In this situation, the standard as decided 
by this Court in Davis is deliberate indifference.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what would the 

standard be under 1983?

 MS. HODGE:  The standard under 1983 is also 
deliberate indifference, but it requires then that the 
deliberate indifference be shown to be not just the act 
of a school administrator who does not do what they 
should do in order to pursue a particular complaint; 
but, rather, there needs to be the specific intent to 
discriminate or -- or specific intent to choose boys 
over girls or girls over boys in that decisionmaking 
process.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but if you lose under 
-- under Title IX, a fortiori, you would lose under the 
Constitution, I would think.

 MS. HODGE:  I -- I believe -- and that is, 

in essence, the position that the Barnstable School 
Committee and Superintendent Debra are arguing in this 
case; that is, that because deliberate indifference is 
the standard that is applicable both under Title IX and 
also under the Constitution, that it is -- it is --

having lost the issue of deliberate indifference before 
the First Circuit, that finding of the First Circuit 
precludes any further controversy between the parties in 
this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they didn't go on the 
issue of preclusion.  If they had done that, it would be 
a different case.  They said that Title IX is preemptive 
of 1983.  And they cited the cases where -- like Smith 
against Robinson where that is what the Court held.

 MS. HODGE:  I believe, Your Honor, that we 

have a situation in which you have both claim 
preclusion -- both preclusion under Smith v. Robinson as 
well as issue preclusion, which makes it somewhat 
complicated.  But I would suggest in this case under 
these circumstances, because the issue was deliberate 
indifference and because there was a finding both as a 
legal matter as well as a factual matter of deliberate 
indifference, that essentially the two sort of collapsed 
into one.

 With regard to Smith, I would point out that 

under the Smith theory constitutional claims can be 
precluded if the -- under the statute under review it 
has comprehensive, remedial schemes.  And we would argue 
that there is a comprehensive remedial scheme, and that 
this Court has, in fact, sort of found that and even

added to it in the development -- have found that 
Congress intended to add to the remedial scheme an 
implied right of action.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- you must, I 

think, recognize that the elaborate scheme that Congress 
set up under the Education of the Handicapped Act is 
quite different from what this Court did.  It just said 
there is a private right -- right of action.  There is 
an implied private right of action.

 It didn't set up any administrative 

mechanism.  It didn't set up any regime for going to --
to an agency first and then coming to the court, none of 
that.

 MS. HODGE:  There is not.  But I would 

suggest that that is appropriate under the 
circumstances.  And I would also suggest that there is, 
in fact, an administrative scheme.  The regulations 
that, in fact -- that have been promulgated by the 
Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education, 
in fact, have a number of prerequisites and 
requirements.  They impose upon --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You are not arguing 

that the agency regulations have the effect of 
precluding the 1983 action.

-- we are arguing that some of those steps are 
illustrations of sort of a -- the -- the scheme that was 
created.  But there is a remedial -- the -- the remedial 
scheme leads to the potential loss of federal funding --
of --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you saying -- are you 

-- is this what you are saying:  We imagine that we have 
a institution that is receiving Federal assistance, 
okay?  And we also imagine that somebody is claiming 
that on the basis of gender they have been excluded from 
participating in, or denied the benefit of, or have been 
subject to discrimination.

 Are you saying that it is impossible for 
anyone to imagine a circumstance in which it would be 
held the defendant did not violate Title IX, but in 
which the court held it did violate the Equal Protection 
Clause?  There is no such circumstance; no one can 
imagine one.  Is that what you are saying?

 MS. HODGE:  Your Honor, what I am saying is 

I cannot imagine one.  And I don't believe --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You cannot imagine one. 
And you think no one can imagine one.  So the obvious 
question on rebuttal is, since we have limited it to 
that universe, it would be the other side must imagine 
one?

MS. HODGE:  I believe that that is true.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's simple.
 MS. HODGE:  And I would point out that in 
response to the Petitioners' argument today, they have 
attempted to suggest that there may be some issues that 
were not discovered; that were not, in fact, fully 
reviewed by the court below.

 And I suggest that the First Circuit did, in 

fact, look at specifically that issue.  And the First 
Circuit said in their decision that, in looking at the 
equal protection claim in particular, that the 
petitioners offer -- or in that case, they offer, the 
plaintiffs offer -- no theory of liability under the 
equal protection clause other than the defendants' 
supposed failure to take adequate actions to prevent 
and/or remediate the peer-on-peer harassment that 
Jacqueline experienced.

 And I suggest to you that that is exactly 
the issue that -- that that is exactly the issue.  The 
issue is whether or not, if you look at the complaint, 
the claim that is being brought under Title IX and the 
claim that is being brought under Section 1983 in the 
Constitution are virtually identical, which is a second 
problem of the Smith test:  If there is a comprehensive 
remedial scheme.  Again, it's a remedial scheme.

And, second, the question is:  Are the 

claims virtually identical?  And I would suggest to you 
that the First Circuit found that they were virtually 
identical.  And I would suggest that that is what leads 
to preclusion.

 Now, that doesn't mean that there aren't 

other claims that could be made with regard to others. 
But for the institution, it -- I -- the -- it is very 
important.  Congress established this particular scheme 
under Section 19 -- under Title IX, and it would be our 
view that Congress specifically and intentionally 
focused -- fixed the responsibility for sex 
discrimination on the institution and on the 
institutional recipient of Federal financial assistance.
 And that if you were to allow Section 1983 

claims, that enforcement would not be nearly as 
equitable.  We would point out that it's obvious, but it 
is important to consider that recipients of Federal 
financial assistance include not only municipalities 
that include public schools; they include State entities 
which under this Court's decision -- under this Court's 
prior decision in Wills versus Michigan are not subject 
to suit under Section 1983 and private entities that are 
not subject to 1983 at all.

claim violate section -- Title IX?

 MS. HODGE:  There -- there --it is not 100 

percent clear except for the following, and I would 
suggest this:  Title IX prohibits discrimination.  If it 
were determined that a policy or other practice led to a 
denial of equal access to the benefits in -- in -- and 
participatory activities of an individual student based 
on their gender, I believe it is covered; and I believe 
it is discrimination; and I believe it is prohibited.

 And the fact of the matter is, though, that 
under the law as developed by this Court and the Equal 
Protection Cause, the fact of the matter is that it 
would not cover disparate impact, because this Court has 
held that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you have any case in 
all of Title IX that -- that fits that abstract picture 
that you have just described?  I mean you have to have a 
pattern and practice of what -- a pattern and practice 
of discrimination -- to get -- to get under the 
Constitution or under 1983?

 You have to have deliberate indifference to 

what:  To the gender harassment, to the gender 
discrimination?  So can you describe to me that --
anything, any Title IX case, that has a disparate 
impact?  We really didn't want a Feeney type of case.

We really didn't want this to happen but we had a test, 
and it came out that way.

 MS. HODGE:  Well, I believe --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you describe a Title 

IX case that's like Feeney in that respect where we 
didn't want this diverse impact to occur; we really 
didn't want it at all, but it happened?

 MS. HODGE:  I believe that the fact that it 

happened is sufficient discrimination to come under 
Title IX.  I would point out to Your Honor that the 
Cannon case, in fact, involved essentially the -- a 
disparate-impact type case.  It dealt with admissions 
policies and the effect of the admissions policies on 
individuals.

 And, consequently, I believe that it is not 
ethereal.  It is quite real.  But the difference is that 
the question becomes one of whether or not an 
individual, based on their gender, is being denied the 
benefits of, and participation in, available --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  On the basis of gender.
 MS. HODGE:  On the basis of gender -- on the 

basis of gender, but I don't believe the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And Feeney says it wasn't 

on the basis of gender.  It was on the basis that she 
wasn't a veteran.

MS. HODGE:  But you see, I believe that the 

impact, which would have been an individual would not 
have been allowed to participate, may be an additive 
factual conclusion which would go to the general 
discrimination issue.  The position that -- the argument 
we are making to this Court includes the fact that since 
Title IX is as broad, if not broader, and I would 
suggest the following through a visual picture.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is -- you are 

leaving out something quite glaring in that respect. 
For example, single sex schools, military academies, 
admissions to elementary and high schools, are not 
covered by Title IX.

 MS. HODGE:  Oh, you are absolutely correct, 

Your Honor, and under those circumstances, we would 
suggest that as this Court found in Mississippi v Hogan, 
that those institutions would then be subject to section 
1983 review, but on the highly constitutional standard 
which requires intentional discrimination; and second of 
all, we believe that that is -- that Mississippi is an 
illustration of the reason why the argument of 
Petitioner regarding 2000h of Title IX, which deals with 
the fact that -- that when they passed Title IX, they 
also reserve the opportunity for the Attorney General to 
become involved in a case under 1983, that the intention

of that language was not necessarily to preserve 1983 in 
cases against recipients who are in fact covered, but it 
would have been to reserve the right of the Attorney 
General to -- to intervene in cases in which either the 
institution was not covered -- because you are 
absolutely right, there are institutions which are not 
covered -- and as you decided in Mississippi v Hogan, 
they would be subject to section 1983; and/or 
individuals that the First Circuit recognized might, 
because they -- if they are -- if they are State actors, 
that is not the case you have here, which was 
peer-on-peer harassment -- but if you is had a situation 
where for example, a teacher or an administrator was in 
fact the alleged harasser, that a 1983 could be brought 
against the individual, and indeed the Attorney General 
could intervene in those cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If it's an individual, 

under Title IX you can't bring the suit.

 MS. HODGE:  Correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But you could 

under 1983?

 MS. HODGE:  Correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
 MS. HODGE:  But --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So your point then is --

38 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

and that's why I have had trouble with this case -- is 
that if you look at the First Circuit opinion, it sort 
of seems to say, "if there is a difference, of course 
you can have a 1983 suit, but if there is no difference, 
you can't."  I mean, everybody here seems to agree to 
that, I guess.

 So I'm not certain what to do, because Selya 

started his opinion by saying this isn't a case where 
Title IX doesn't apply; it does apply; they have the 
funding; but he doesn't talk about the exemptions and he 
doesn't really talk about the -- a difference between 
suing an institution and suing an individual.  So maybe 
what we should say is, maybe he meant it, but he didn't 
say it.

 MS. HODGE:  Well, I would argue -- I would 

argue to the Court that I would hope that this Court 
would take -- would affirm the First Circuit opinion, 
but I would say to -- to -- to Your Honor the following: 
that with regard to the individual defendant in this 
case, who is the superintendent of schools, who as we 
argue, the question presented only deals with the 
institutional recipient; but nevertheless the First 
Circuit found that the individual was acting only in 
their official capacity.

 And once again, that -- that issue is not

before this Court.  And having decided that they were 
acting in the individual's official capacity, we would 
argue therefore that the individual would not be sued, 
because the claim and all of the facts --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So you were saying if it's 

an individual acting in his official capacity, you 
cannot sue him under Title IX?

 MS. HODGE:  To the -- yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Okay.
 MS. HODGE:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Then their answer to that 
which is now say, look, we want to sue an individual in 
his official capacity; that's why we want to bring our 
1983 suit.  And then you reply, but there are bars here 
of collateral estoppel.  Claim preclusion, whatever it 
is.

 MS. HODGE:  Issue preclusion.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  They all have new names.
 (Laughter.)
 MS. HODGE:  Okay.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  The -- the -- okay, so 

that's your argument.

 So why don't we just send it back, say 
that's right; this suit is not precluded by 1983; 
indeed, that's the only place can you bring it; it's not

precluded by Title IX, and now court, you go decide 
whether claim preclusion exists, or whatever they call 
it.  Collateral estoppel, or -- you understand what I 
mean.

 MS. HODGE:  Your Honor, I believe that they 
did decide that in the language I did quote to you just 
a moment ago from the First Circuit opinion, which is 
found at the appendix 23a or the decision.  Essentially 
they are -- they are saying that -- that there was --
that because no theory of liability was offered other 
than this, that there isn't any further claim available.

 With regard to sending this case back, we 

argue, based upon the deliberative difference standard, 
which I think is indisputably -- the standard falls 
under Title IX, and the standard under the Equal 
Protection Clause -- that that deliberative difference 
standard and -- and the fact the First Circuit found 
that -- that there was -- that the Barnstable School 
Committee acted reasonably and without deliberative 
difference, precludes -- there is no issue in 
controversy anymore.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yet the other side says 

that there may be, and I don't know why we ought to get 
into that.  Why can't we just send it back and let them 
figure that out?  And -- and -- and decide what we took

this case to decide, namely, the split that now exists 
in the Federal courts over whether Title IX precludes 
the use of 1983.  That is an important question.  It's 
why we took the case.  Why can't we decide that issue 
and then for all these loose ends, send it back to the 
court of appeals?

 MS. HODGE:  Because there must be an issue 
in controversy for this Court to send any -- there must 
be an issue in controversy here and also --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  He says there is an issue 

in controversy, that's good enough for me.

 (Laughter.)
 MS. HODGE:  Well -- well, with all due 

respect, I would suggest that what you have to look at 
is the complaint, and you have to look at the argument, 
you know, what was in fact argued.  And I would 
suggest --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- I'm sorry, so 

you seem to be saying that they were right, that 1983 
actions are not always precluded, depending on whether 
there is a difference in the issues that are presented 
or whatever.

 So you should never say that Title IX 

precludes an action under 1983.  In fact, you should say 
that sometimes the issues that are litigated under Title

IX may result in the fact that you don't have 
available -- you don't get relief under 1983, but there 
is still a cause of action.

 MS. HODGE:  I don't -- I don't believe that 
that is -- that that -- that that should -- that should 
be the result of your decisionmaking.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's kind of odd to 
say that -- as I understand what you are saying, you are 
saying that whenever there is issue preclusion, the 
consequence is that 1983 is precluded in the sense that 
actions were precluded in Smith.  Well why -- I guess 
I've gotten -- maybe I am repeating the question.  Why 
do we have to decide that, and we would just say there 
is a 1983 action, but you may not be able to pursue it, 
I guess is the way to put it, if your claims are 
precluded or the issues result in the fact that you 
don't recover.

 MS. HODGE:  I -- I believe that that would 

be satisfactory.  From our point of view because we 
believe the issue preclusion applies that would be 
satisfactory because we --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- but that doesn't 
cover the situation in which a plaintiff says, I don't 
want to proceed under Title IX; I want to proceed first 
under 1983.  Then there is going to be no question about

whether 1983 is -- is unavailable because of issue 
preclusion.  He is starting with 1983.

 MS. HODGE:  There is no question, but in 

those circumstances then as to an institution --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is your position on 

that --

MS. HODGE:  Our position is that as a 

recipient of Federal -- if the institution involved is a 
recipient of Federal financial assistance who is covered 
by Title IX --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can't proceed under 

1983.

 MS. HODGE:  Cannot proceed under 1983.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you are disagreeing.
 MS. HODGE:  Yes, we are.  Yes, we are 

disagreeing, and I would suggest that the difficulty 
that this Court is having, or at least as I experience 
it, the difficulty with regard to issue preclusion and 
claim preclusion turns in this case on the fact that 
this perhaps being a peer-on-peer harassment case --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Isn't it quite clear we 

can forget about issue preclusion and assume as 
Justice Scalia did, the client brought an action under 
1983 and did not rely on Title IX at all, and just sued 
the school board, you would say he can't do that?

MS. HODGE:  Correct.  Correct.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And that's your issue, 
whether that's right or wrong.  We don't have to talk 
about issue -- issue preclusion to decide that issue.

 MS. HODGE:  That is correct, except that as 
we argue -- what we have argued before the Court is that 
under Smith the question is, is there a comprehensive 
remedial scheme, and we would argue that there is; but 
then have you to determine whether the claims are 
virtually identical; and we would argue that here the 
claims are virtually identical.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wouldn't your reasoning 

apply to, say, a race discrimination case in employment? 
We have got title VII and you have 1981.  Title VII has 
a lot of accoutrements, a lot of text to go through; 
1981 is plain and simple.  So therefore, title VII ought 
to preempt 1981, right?  So you -- in the area of race 
discrimination and employment, title VII would end any 
access to 1981.  It would be the same kind of argument, 
wouldn't it?

 MS. HODGE:  I believe that -- that there is 
that argument, but to be honest, I'm not in a position 
right now to reflect on exactly -- I believe that that 
would be certainly the direction, however, there are 
unique aspects of race.  And I believe that that is yet

another basis on which I would quarrel with the 
Petitioner with regard to suggesting that Title VI 
and -- and Title IX ought to be treated exactly the 
same.  The history of sex discrimination versus race 
discrimination are quite different in scope.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What does that have to 

got to do with what you are arguing is that if you have 
an elaborate mechanism, which you said you have under 
Title IX, I think that is debatable?  But that was 
certainly the picture in Smith, and it's the picture in 
Title VII, Title VII versus 1981.  That -- that fits 
your -- the -- your description, Title VII and 1981, 
much better than Title IX and 1983, I think.

 MS. HODGE:  I guess I -- I don't agree.  It 

is our -- it is our view that 19 -- that in this 
particular instance -- and I -- and I think I may have 
misspoken if the view is, is that it's the 
administrative schemes that get compared.  I -- I 
believe under Smith, the issue is whether or not there 
is a comprehensive remedial scheme, and here you have 
the remedy -- both an administrative remedy as well as a 
private right of action, which we would argue should 
preclude the 1983 claims.

 Moreover, we would also look with regard to 

the fact that this is a constitutional claim to the --

to Bivens -- to the line of cases under Bivens which we 
cite in our brief, the fact that when Congress provides 
a remedy for a particular area -- in a particular area, 
that that remedy can preclude an independent action 
which even is based on the Constitution.  And we would 
suggest that that would be -- that that is something 
that we would urge this Court to consider --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's because 
we're still in the business of implying rights of action 
under Bivens.  And it's different to say -- you know, if 
you say we are applying it, but as soon as Congress does 
something, we are not going to do that.  That's quite 
different than construing a provision like 1983 which 
Congress has enacted.

 MS. HODGE:  Well, that is correct, except 
that this Court has, in fact, applied its preclusion 
doctrine by looking at whether or not Congress has made 
any statement in the statute, then if you want to take 
it statute to statute, then what you would be looking at 
is you would be looking at essentially Rancho Palos 
Verdes.  And as -- as this Court did in -- when it 
decided Rancho Palos Verdes, it remanded for 
consideration communities of equity, which is a Title IX 
case for reconsideration by, I believe it's the Eighth 
Circuit under the Rancho Palos Verdes decision.

And while that case ultimately did not come 

back to this Court, but the circuit court determined 
that it treated -- it treated the issue differently, and 
we would argue that that is a part of this split, and 
that that is -- and that is not the appropriate 
resolution.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was no 

constitutional claim in -- what was it -- Palos Verdes.

 MS. HODGE:  Exactly.  There was no 

constitutional claim in Rancho Palos Verdes.  However, 
this Court did cite Smith and did cite Smith in its 
decision and -- and favorably so.  But moreover, we 
would argue that -- the question is really a different 
-- comparing a statute to statute, which is Title IX to 
section 1983.  Congress allowed for actions in 1983, 
Congress allows for actions under Title IX, or whether 
or not you are looking at the issue of Title IX versus a 
constitutional claim.

 Now, I want to just make the point that 
preclusion makes sense.  Congress really did put the 
focus in Title IX on the institution, and Congress is 
also seeking to have equity of enforcement.

 Further, as set for in the amici in support 
of the Respondents' position, we would point out that if 
section 1983 claims are not precluded, that it would

require the expenditure of funds by -- by recipients of 
federal financial assistance on a variety of issues that 
are totally unnecessary including qualified immunity.

 And on the peer-on-peer harassment case, I 

think it's very important to focus on what this case is. 
It is a peer-on-peer, student-on-student harassment 
where, what you would have is, if you were going to 
allow additional claims under section 1983 against the 
institution, it would -- it would intrude and interfere 
with the school's processes of disciplining students.

 And I would also suggest that it might also 

interfere in the classic manner in which --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask you one sort of 
anomaly that keeps running through my mind in this case. 
If you have two school boards, one of -- two schools, 
state schools, one gets federal funds and the other does 
not, does this preclude -- no 1983 remedy against one, 
but there is a 1983 remedy against the other, that's 
your view, isn't it?

 MS. HODGE:  It is exactly our view because 
the recipients would be subject to the remedial scheme 
set forth in Title IX.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is it anomalous to think 

it --

believe the reverse is anomalous, because what you would 
be suggesting if you do not preclude section 1983, you 
would suggest that the recipient could have both the 
1983 and a Title IX, whereas the nonrecipient would have 
just section 1983.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would it prove the same 

facts in both cases?  I mean, the case of it would 
involve the same evidence, same alleged wrongdoing, and 
then one case you can rely on 1983 and the other you 
can't?

 MS. HODGE:  I believe under those 

circumstances, Justice Stevens, that what we would be 
talking about would be the situation where a -- under 
Title IX there is -- there's actually an easier path to 
recovery, if you will, because it does not require the 
specific intent required by Massachusetts v. Feeney, 
which we believe sets a slightly higher -- a bar and a 
higher level of intentionality.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought you just said 

that a deliberate indifference under both statutes, 
under 1983 and Title IX.

 MS. HODGE:  Your Honor, it is -- deliberate 

indifference is the standard.  However, in order to 
prove a constitutional violation, you must also have the 
specific intent for invidious discrimination that we --

that this Court has not imposed and did not impose in 
Davis for violations of peer -- for peer-on-peer 
harassment cases.

 So, while the discrimination needs to be 
intentional under Title IX, it is not required that 
there be the specific intent to favor one over the other 
or one protected status over the other.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then you wouldn't have 

gender discrimination.

 MS. HODGE:  But you -- excuse me, I'm sorry. 

You would have gender discrimination if you have a 
typical -- in the peer-on-peer harassment cases, the 
question is whether or not the institution was or was 
not deliberately indifferent in the manner in which it 
responds.  In -- in a deliberate indifference --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Response to what? 

Response --

MS. HODGE:  To a complaint about sexual 

harassment.  If the institution fails to respond 
appropriately, the lower courts have found that that can 
be gender discrimination under Title IX.  They do not in 
any way look to ensure that -- look to determine whether 
or not there is that specific invidious discrimination 
that we would argue this Court has imposed in its cases 
under the Equal Protection Clause.

harassing you, you would not have a case under 1983?

 MS. HODGE:  If you were a municipality and 
your boss was harassing you, in a school setting by a 
recipient of federal financial assistance?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You were saying the 
constitutional standard is different, so I am just 
giving you a case.  It could be a school, it could be

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I 

will try not to use my extra ten seconds.

 Two principal points.  First on the proper 
disposition of this case.  The First Circuit's holding, 
and I'm reading from 24a of the petition appendix:  the 
comprehensiveness of Title IX's remedial scheme 
indicates Congress saw Title IX solely as vindicating

the constitutional right to be free from gender 
discrimination perpetrated by educational institutions; 
it follows that the plaintiff's equal protection claims 
are precluded.

 That was not a holding that had to do with 

claim preclusion, issue preclusion, title estoppel; it's 
a holding that constitutional claims simply cannot go 
forward.  So there were constitutional claims were 
advanced below, argued to both courts, that have not 
been discussed by any court at any point, and I think 
the proper disposition here is, the most regular course 
in a case of this sort to is decide the question 
presented, send the case back.

 It certainly is not the case -- it's a 

commonplace that the Court has threshold questions that 
are presented to it.  There are remaining issues that 
have to be resolved on remand, it's certainly not the 
Court's usual practice to decide whether or not 
plaintiffs can -- can prevail on those claims on remand 
before deciding the threshold question on which cert was 
granted.  I think that's the appropriate approach for 
the Court to take here.

 On the merits, very quickly.  Again I think 

we have to -- the gold standard of evidence as to 
preclusion, we have expressed statutory text that deals

with it.  Learned colleague suggested that the Attorney 
General intervention provision somehow limited the cases 
involving claims by schools that do not accept Federal 
funds are somehow not subject to Title IX.  That is not 
the language of the provision.  The provision says 
whenever -- whenever it is claimed, it is initiated, in 
a court of the United States asserting deprivation of 
rights essentially on account of sex, the Attorney 
General can intervene.  Clearly Congress had it in mind 
that there would be such claims, and this was enacted as 
part of -- Title IX was enacted as part of the statute 
that creates rights against discrimination by schools 
receiving Federal funds.  It makes no sense to suggest 
that Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, does that provision 

apply only when there is a Title IX cause of action?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  No.  No.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh well, if it doesn't, 

then it -- then it has validity whether or not you agree 
with your position.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That's true but I think it 
answers the preclusion question that it suggests that 
Congress has it in mind that there would in fact be 
section 1983 constitutional litigation involving gender 
discrimination.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They thought only in cases 

where there is no Title IX action.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  They said whenever there is a 

claim of unconstitutional gender discrimination.  I 
think it's a blanket suggestion Congress made --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, you don't think they 

mean whether there is a valid claim?  Even when there is 
a claim that isn't allowed under the law?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I am suggesting that the 

language says that whenever a claim of gender 
discrimination is advanced under the Constitution, the 
Attorney General can intervene.  I think what we can 
draw from that is Congress imagined, it said there would 
be constitutional litigation involving gender 
discrimination after they enacted the law.  And because 
that provision was added to the law as part of Title IX, 
Congress surely contemplated that these suits would 
involve gender discrimination involving schools.

 The other sort of clear textual indication 
which again, again my learned colleague has not really 
discussed, is the Title VI history of enforcement prior 
to the enactment of Title IX, which would absolutely --
that there are almost two such dozen decisions, which 
this Court incorporated into the canon, which suggests 
it is not only appropriate, it's realistic to think that

when Congress was aware of at the time it enacted Title 
IX.  Those decisions clearly indicated there was no 
preclusion.  The language of Title VI and Title IX is 
identical.  There can be no doubt, I think, that 
Congress would have had it in mind, which, if it is not 
appropriate in this context as well.

 One final, very quick point.  This is an 

implied right of action; to suggest that Congress meant 
to preclude the use of the Constitution to enforce --
preclude section 1983 to enforce the Constitution while 
leaving it to the courts to imply the alternative 
remedy, to devise the contours on and the limitations on 
that remedy, would require -- hypothesize a remarkable 
leap of faith on the part of Congress.

 It also would require the most extravagant 
and speculative reading of Title IX, to understand that 
it's not only to include private rights of action but to 
preclude the assertion of express rights of action 
created by Congress by a language in another statute.
 If there are no further questions, Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
