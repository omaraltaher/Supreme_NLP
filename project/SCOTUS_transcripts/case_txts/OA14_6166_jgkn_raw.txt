CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­6166,  Taylor  v.  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

Mr.  Jones. 

 

            

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  DENNIS  E.  JONES 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  Hobbs  Act  has  two  elements.  The  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  that  the  accused  to  obtain  property  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  by  either  extortion  or  robbery.  The  second  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jurisdictional  element,  in  that  the  consequence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  the  extortion  or  the  robbery  creates  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interference  with  commerce. 

 

 

            

The  effect  on  commerce  is  the  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  the  crime,  and  like  all  elements,  it  must  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proven  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  through  the 

   

 

 

 

 

introduction  of  particularized  evidence  necessary  to 

 

 

 

 

 

establish  this  element. 

 

 

            

In  the  case  ­­ in  this  case  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  required  to  prove  the  effect­on­commerce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element,  which  ultimately  resulted  in  the  conviction  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Taylor.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  One  of  the  things  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  your  brief  is  that  you  were  not  even  given  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity  to  show  that  the  victims  dealt  exclusively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  home­grown  marijuana. 

 

 

            

If  you  ­­ if  you  had  that  opportunity,  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  you  have  shown  that  this,  the  marijuana  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  was  grown  in  Virginia  rather  than  some  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place,  some  other  State? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  Your  Honor,  they're  ­­ in  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

likelihood,  I  would  either  call  as  a  witness  a  retired 

   

   

   

 

 

 

DEA  agent  or  an  ATF  agent  or  a  retired  local  police 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  who  had  years  of  experience  in  that  field 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualifying  that  person. 

 

 

            

Virginia  is  ­­ is  a  State,  like  all  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  States,  that  has  the  ability  to  grow  marijuana 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in­State.  It's  been  going  on  for  years  and  years  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years.  There's  not  necessarily  ­­ we  ­­ we  cited  in  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  not  only  the  DEA  statistics  for  a  time  period 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  shown  not  only  the  amount  of  marijuana  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  the  eradication  plan  of  DEA  in  Virginia  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  a  couple  of  local  news  articles  and  events  where  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Botetourt  County,  I  think  the  most  current  one  was  2013, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  time  we  were  before  the  Fourth  Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  that  could  show  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  could  have  been  grown,  but  you  could  say  that  for

every  State  in  the  Union.  But  you  made  that  ­­ you  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  wanted  to  submit  proof  that  the  victims  dealt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively  in  home­grown  marijuana,  and  since  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  State  also  has  marijuana  dealers,  how  could  you  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  could  you  show  exclusively,  that  this  marijuana  came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively? 

            

MR.  JONES:  We're  ­­ for  one  thing,  it  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  cross­examined  him  on  ­­ on  that  point.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  the  motion  in  limine,  I  think  trial  counsel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  that  point  believed  that  he  ­­ he  was  precluded  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  going  into  that  area  with  ­­ with  the  victims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  Mr.  Jones,  suppose  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

had  been  able  to  show  this.  Suppose  you  had  been  able 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  show  that  it  was  a  dealer  who  dealt  in  intrastate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana  exclusively.  What  difference  would  that  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

made  under  the  terms  of  the  Hobbs  Act? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  Under  the  ­­ under  the  terms  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Hobbs  Act,  the  government  would  have  borne  the  proof 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  going  forward  and  ­­ and  showing  an  effect  on  ­­ on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interstate  commerce  with  ­­ with  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  you  see,  that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thing.  I  mean,  I  don't  think  that  the  Hobbs  Act 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

requires  the  government  to  show  an  effect  on  interstate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce.  As  you  said  in  your  opening  statement,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hobbs  Act  only  requires  an  effect  on  commerce,  and  then

commerce  is  defined:  Commerce  means  all  commerce  over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  United  States  has  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  for  sure  the  United  States  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  interstate  commerce,  but  under  Raich 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  also  has  jurisdiction  over  intrastate  drug 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trafficking. 

            

And  so  if  you  just  sort  of  put  the  pieces  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statutes  together,  it  seems  to  make  it  completely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrelevant  whether  the  drug  trafficking  was  intrastate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  interstate,  because  in  either  case,  it  was  commerce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  which  the  United  States  has  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  I  think  the  difference 

    

 

 

 

between  ­­ I  think  what  Hobbs  addressed  ­­ excuse  me  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Raich  addressed  was,  of  course,  the  Controlled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Substance  Act. 

 

            

Controlled  Substance  Act  is  ­­ is  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  regulation  of  ­­ of  interstate  commerce  and  not  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  ­­ did  not  address,  as  a  ­­ as  a  separate  issue, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  effect  on  ­­ on  commerce. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  the  Hobbs  Act  in  our  view  addresses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  effect,  not  so  much  the  regulation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A  ­­ a  reading  of  ­­ of  the  Raich  case,

the  United  States  has  jurisdiction  over  intrastate  drug 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trafficking? 

            

            

MR.  JONES:  It  does,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  why  isn't  that  enough? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Because  this  statute,  again,  does  not  require  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  an  effect  on  interstate  commerce.  It  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affects  ­­ it  requires  that  there  be  an  effect  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce  as  defined  in  the  statute.  And  as  defined  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute,  all  it  says  is  that  the  commerce  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  a  kind  over  which  the  United  States  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  And  Raich  says  the  United  States  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  even  intrastate  drug  dealing. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  Raich  does  say  that,  but  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plain  language  of  the  Hobbs  Act  and  the  ­­ the  essence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  crime  itself  is  the  effect.  The  word  "effect"  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  in  the  Hobbs  Act. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  even  if  ­­ if  you  ­­ by  the  regulation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  commerce  does  not  in  and  of  itself  have  an  effect  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  commerce. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  then  you  could  make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  argument  if  it  was  conceded  that  these  drugs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  an  interstate.  You  say,  oh,  well,  you  still  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  show  an  effect. 

 

 

 

            

Is  that  what  you're  saying?

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Based  on  your  answer  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Justice  Kagan,  doesn't  make  any  difference  whether  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

local  or  interstate.

MR.  JONES:  Your  Honor,  there  was  no  proof

robbery  of  goods  in  interstate  commerce,  that  it  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  on  an  economic  expert  to  show  that  there's  an  effect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  interstate  commerce  when  there's  been  a  robbery. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

That's  your  position? 

 

 

MR.  JONES:  No,  Your  Honor.  Not  ­­

MR.  JONES:  In  ­­ in  the  numerous  cases  that

cleaner  in  the  Portsmouth/Virginia  Beach  area  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virginia.  I  think  it  was  about  $40  taken  in  that

The  Hobbs  Act  prohibits  robberies  that 

 

 

 

 

 

affect  marijuana  trafficking,  whether  the  marijuana 

 

 

 

 

 

trafficking  is  interstate  or  intrastate. 

 

 

 

 

            

Do  you  agree  with  that?

Raich  says  commerce  includes  both  interstate  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intrastate  marijuana  trafficking.  So  the  Hobbs  Act 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prohibits  robberies  that  affect  marijuana  trafficking 

 

 

 

 

 

generally,  whether  it's  interstate  or  intrastate. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

What's  there  to  disagree  with  in  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  JONES:  I  ­­ I  agree  from  the  standpoint 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that  the  Controlled  Substance  Act  under  Raich  regulates. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  beyond  that  point,  what  the  Hobbs  ­­ if  Congress  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  use  the  word  "regulate"  rather  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"affects"  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  ­­ Congress  could  very  easily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  done  that. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  but  I  said  ­­ I  used 

   

   

  

 

 

 

the  word  "affects."  I  didn't  use  the  word  "regulate." 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  said  the  Hobbs  Act  prohibits  robberies  that  affect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce.  Commerce  is  either  interstate  marijuana 

  

 

 

 

 

trafficking  or  intrastate  marijuana  trafficking  under 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definition  in  this  statute.  So  you  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  has  to  show  that  a  robbery  affected  some  kind 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  marijuana  trafficking.  It  doesn't  matter  what  kind. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wouldn't  you  agree  with  that?  I  mean,  it  just  seems  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  Yeah.  I  ­­ I  ­­

    

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ it's  the  current  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  plus  Raich. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR.  JONES:  Right.  It's  ­­ it's  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

commodity  that's  the  subject  of  the  robbery  that  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ has  to  affect.  And  if  ­­ if  Congress  ­­ if  ­­ if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Hobbs  Act,  in  the  plain  language  of  it  ­­ and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  we're  talking  about  the  very  last  phrase,  commerce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  regulated  by  Congress,  in  ­­ in  that  situation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  commodity  itself  is  a  standalone,  if  that's  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  the  statute,  then  commerce  is  affected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  ­­ by  the  taking  of  ­­ of  the  commodity  subject  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it's  regulated,  nothing  more. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  guess  this  goes  back 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  Justice  Kennedy's  question.  I  mean,  seems  to  me 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  self­evident  that  a  robbery  of  a  business  affects 

   

   

 

 

 

 

a  business.  Wouldn't  you  think  that  that's  right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  Yes  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  mean,  I  don't  think  that 

    

   

 

 

 

the  word  "affects"  is  doing  a  whole  lot  of  work  here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  course  a  robbery  of  a  business  affects  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

business,  right? 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  Yes,  ma'am. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  So  ­­ so  it's  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

really  "affects"  that's  the  problem  here.  The  problem 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  be  that  you're  resisting  the  notion  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  could  be  entirely  intrastate. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  what  I'm  suggesting  is  that  the  terms  of

the  Hobbs  Act  itself,  given  Raich,  make  clear  that  the

commerce  here  doesn't  say  "interstate  commerce."  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says  "commerce  over  which  the  United  States  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction."  And  because  of  Raich,  we  know  that  the

businesses  with  an  effect  on  interstate  commerce  or

And  it's  not  so  much  the  element  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation,  but  it's  the  element  of  the  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense.  And  when  you  have  the  element  of  the  criminal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense,  then  I  fall  back,  or  it's  our  view  that  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fifth  and  Sixth  Amendments  of  the  Constitution  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent.  And  if  Congress  has  not  provided  for  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  in  there,  then  we  believe  that  ­­ that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  is  the  place  to  have  that  addressed.

jurisdictional  element  has  to  be  proven.  That's  not  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue. 

            

The  issue  is  the  meaning  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  element.  And  if  the  jurisdictional 

  

 

 

 

 

element  means,  as  interpreted  in  Raich,  and  it's  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  it's  a  controversial  area  of  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

law,  but  it's  a  precedent  and  you're  not  challenging 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ so  the  jurisdictional  element  as  interpreted  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case  is  anything  that  has  an  effect  on  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  ­­ any  purely  ­­ any  local  activity  that  is  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  type  which,  if  taken  in  the  aggregate,  would  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  effect  on  interstate  commerce,  that  falls 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  Commerce  Clause. 

 

 

 

            

If  the  jury  is  instructed  in  that  way,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  basically  the  way  I  think  it  was  instructed  here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  they  have  to  find  is  that  there  was  a  theft  of  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  robbery  of  drugs,  and  it  had  some  effect  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  supply  of  drugs. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  In  this  case  I  think  they  were 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

instructed  that  our  ­­ our  view  of  that  instruction  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  a  per  se  or  strict  liability  instruction; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  ­­ if  ­­ because  in  that  instruction,  it's  my

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yeah,  well,  that's  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ that's  what  Raich  ­­ that's  the  interpretation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Commerce  Clause. 

 

 

            

Do  you  want  the  jury  to  decide  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commerce  Clause  means?  It  would  be  an  interesting  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  those  who  ­­ who  think  that  juries  once  upon  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  had  the  authority  to  decide  legal  issues.  Do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  them  to  decide  whether  the  majority  or  the  dissent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  correct  in  ­­ in  Gonzales? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  No,  sir,  I  would  not.  What  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ what  I'd  like  to  have  an  opportunity  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  was  to  address  what  we  typically  see  as  facts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  constitute  whether  you're  a  drug  dealer  or  whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not.  And  in  this  case  there  wasn't. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  ­­ if  you  take  ­­ if  you  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  was  ­­ that  was  produced,  it's  ­­ it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  embellished.  But  ­­ but  the  plain  reading  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  ­­ for  example,  in  the  Lynch  case,  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  showing  that  ­­ that  the  ­­ that  they  had  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  engaged  in  a  drug  dealing  enterprise.  It  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

rumored  that  a  person  had  been  robbed,  not  Mr.  Lynch  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  person  had  been  robbed  at  some  point  in  time  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

past,  I  think  of  20  pounds  of  marijuana. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  ­­ in  the  Worley  case  it  was  ­­ it  just

no  showing  in  the  evidence  of  this  case  that  you  even

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  that  seems  to  me  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  kind  of  argument  that  you're  making  now.  Now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not  saying  that  the  question  is  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana  that  was  being  dealt  was  intrastate  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interstate.  Now  you're  suggesting  that  what  you  really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  prove  was  that  this  person  wasn't  a  dealer  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all;  is  that  correct? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  That's  ­­ that's  ­­ that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  where  we  got  here  on  this  case,  was  ­­ was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absence  of  particularized  evidence  as  to  what  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  was  taking  place  here.  And  we  weren't  able  to, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  the  rulings,  we  simply  were  not  able  to

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Wasn't  there  evidence

he  was  a  drug  dealer.  But  that's  not  the  question

Congress's  Commerce  Clause  power. 

 

 

 

            

Petitioner's  robberies  targeted,  first,  the 

 

 

 

 

inventory  in  a  commodity;  two,  that  inventory  belonged 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  commercial  participant;  and  third,  it  was  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  participant  in  an  established  interstate 

 

 

 

 

 

market  in  marijuana  that  is  a  Federally­controlled 

   

 

 

 

 

substance  over  which  Congress  has  exercised 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  if  it  weren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  aspect,  then  you  wouldn't  ­­ you  wouldn't  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  would  have  to  demonstrate  jurisdiction  beyond  a

MR.  YANG:  No.  I  think  there  ­­ what  ­­

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  get  out  of  the  commercial  sphere,  the  courts  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  have  drawn  a  distinction  between  robberies  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

businesses  that  are  engaged  in  commerce,  as  the  victims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  here,  and  true  individuals  who  just  get  robbed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  the  courts  have  fairly  uniformly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  that  the  ­­ while  the  robbery  of  a  business 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  kind  of  economic  in  nature  and  more  directly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicates  Commerce  Clause  concerns,  when  there's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

robbery  of  an  individual,  the  links  are  much  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attenuated  and  there's  a  longer  chain  of  causation  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  to  commerce. 

 

 

            

And  so  in  those  contexts,  even  within  the

matter,  robberies  of  individuals  just  don't  fall  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Commerce  Clause.  But  what  we  have  here  is  the

regulates  the  trade  in  marijuana.  It's  in  the  marijuana 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trade. 

            

It's  difficult  to,  I  think,  come  to  any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

other  conclusion,  that  the  robbery  of  such  marijuana 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  marijuana  dealers  engaged  in  trade  over  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce  has  jurisdiction  is  not  a  robbery  that  affects

MR.  YANG:  Well,  what  you  do  need  to  show  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  robbery  affected  commerce  over  which  the  United

this  type  of  context.  But  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  end  of  the  day,  there  is  no  doubt,  it  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainty,  that  Congress  has  jurisdiction  over  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana  trade.  And  so  when  you  rob  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes,  I  ­­ I  suppose 

   

   

  

 

 

it's  a  ­­ maybe  an  academic  question,  but  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  that  Congress  has  jurisdiction  over  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana  trade  is  based  on  a  different  standard  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

proof  than  the  criminal  one. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  yes,  you  can  say  of  course  Congress  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  here,  but  that  has  been  established  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under,  I  guess,  a  rational­basis  standard.  But  now  you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

have  to  show  Congress  has  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  more  daunting  standard  of  proof. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  We're  not  shying  away  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  of  proof.  But  what  ­­ as  we  explained,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  whether  a  robbery  affects  interstate

commerce  has  both  legal  elements  as  well  as  factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements. 

            

The  factual  elements,  as  we  explain  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  in  this  case,  involve:  Did  the  robbery  occur? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Were  they  robbing  and  targeting  the  marijuana  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana  dealers? 

 

            

 

But  the  legal  question  ­­ which  judges  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day  instruct  juries  under  what  the  law  is,  and  Gaudin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teaches  us  that  juries  must  follow  those  instructions  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legal  conclusion  is  that  the  United  States  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  the  entire  marijuana  trade. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  there  would  be  strange  anomalies  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juries  were  allowed  to  relitigate  Raich  in  every  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is  there  an  affect  ­­ you  know,  does  Congress  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  intrastate  commerce?  Juries  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

coming  up  with  divergent  results  over  the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  Congress  has  jurisdiction  over  intrastate 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana  trade,  contrary  to  Congress's  own  decision  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  decision  of  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

            

That  is  a  purely  legal  question.  It  is  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  prove  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  jurisdiction  over  the  marijuana  trade  by  looking  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Raich.  That's  a  legal  question  ­­

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  what's  ­­ what's  the

MR.  YANG:  Not  on  that  point.

judge  charge? 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Well,  the  judge's  instructions,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think,  could  have  been  more  clear.  This  case,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  is  a  challenge  to  the  sufficiency  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  not  the  jury  instructions. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  what  was  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  But  the  jury  instructions  are  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  basically  on  page  8  of  our  brief.  We've  replicated 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  most  relevant  portions  of  the  charge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  you  know,  there  are  the  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  about  the  government  has  to  show  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  element  beyond  a  reasonable  ­­ beyond  a

in  this  case.  And  in  fact,  given  Raich,  the  judge,

inter­ or  intrastate,  has  already  been  decided  by  Raich. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Correct.  I  mean,  this  is  no

marijuana.

Mr.  Yang:  From  marijuana  dealers. 

  

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  it  seems  to  me  the  defendant  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  no.  I  was  targeting  a  home  grower.  You  know,  the 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  person  from  Raich.  I  just  ­­ I  was  growing  this 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana  for  myself.  I  had  no  intention  of  ever 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling  it. 

 

            

At  that  point,  you  wouldn't  be  robbing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  who  was  engaged  in  commerce,  right?

upon  is  one  thing,  but  if  you  have  somebody  who  is

The  Hobbs  Act  governs  robberies  that  have  an  affect  on

There's  some  question  whether  just  growing  marijuana  for

MR.  YANG:  This  is  not  new  in  the  law, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  I  mean,  juries  are  instructed  on  the  law.  They

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what's  your

consider  to  be  the  element  of  the  offense  and  how  you

What  we're  ­­ what  we're  saying  is  the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  have  to  find  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  element  was  met.  But  just  as  if

Statute  18  U.S.C.  10,000­something,  that  prohibits  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  says  the  jurisdictional  element  of  this  case  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  robbery  ­­ is  that  the  robbery  has  to  target

scope  of  its  power.  And  so  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Does  the  government  have 

  

 

 

 

 

to  prove  anything  in  this  case  different  from  what  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  to  prove  if  this  was  a  charge  of  robbery 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  State  law? 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Well,  yes.  I  mean,  a  robbery 

    

   

  

 

 

under  State  law  wouldn't  be  relevant,  at  least  under  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory  of  the  jurisdictional  ­­ it  doesn't  matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  marijuana  or  whatever.  It  would  just  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

robbery  of  an  individual  within  the  definition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

robbery.  But  here,  in  order  to  ­­ the  additional  proof 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  relevant  to  the  jurisdictional  element  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  robbery  targeted  the  marijuana  of  marijuana  dealers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  by  the  nature  of  the  targeting  of  a  commodity,  the

whole  Federal  investigation  here,  if  you  remember  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  was  an  investigation  into  the  Southwest  Goonz, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  was  a  gang  that  was  engaged  in  particularly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violent  and  dangerous  robberies  in  Roanoke.  The  DEA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tracked  about  30  home  invasions  to  this  gang.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  other  prosecutions.  This  particular  defendant  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  bit  of  a  tagalong,  and  he  was  prosecuted.  But  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

main  participants  in  this  endeavor,  which  ­­ you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  DEA  was  contacted  by  local  law  enforcement  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  this  is  becoming  a  serious  problem  in  Roanoke,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DEA  came  in  and  busted  this  gang.  This  is  just  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  defendant. 

 

            

20  years. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  tagalong,  he  got 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  YANG:  Well,  and  he  was  involved  in  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  serious  crimes.  Actually,  I  think  30  home 

   

  

 

 

 

 

invasions.

ladies  and  gentlemen  of  the  jury,  if  you  find  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incidents  that  have  been  considered  in  this  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred  on  the  high  seas,  then  the  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  is  satisfied. 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Yes.  And  you'd  probably  have  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

define  what  the  high  seas  were  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Pardon  me? 

  

 

 

MR.  YANG:  You'd  also  have  to  define  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  high  seas  were  for  the  jury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Okay.  Then  in  this  case, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

it  suffices,  in  your  view,  if  you  say  if  you  find  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  robbery  of  a  drug  dealer,  then  the  jurisdictional 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

element  is  satisfied? 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  We  think  it's  a  little  easier 

   

  

 

 

 

 

than  that  in  this  case.  If  you  find  that  there  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

robbery  targeting  the  inventory,  the  marijuana  of  a  drug 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealer  engaged  in  the  trade  of  that  marijuana,  then

effect  on  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  the  only  defense

the  ­­ that  the  drugs  were  not  involved?  The  defense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  show  that  drugs  were  not  involved. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  They  could,  and  that  would  target

MR.  YANG:  I  think  that's  right  in  this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

particular  case  because  that's  the  only  factual  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  really  relevant. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  maybe  the  person 

  

 

 

 

 

wasn't  a  dealer. 

   

            

MR.  YANG:  Yes,  that's  ­­ yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  Did  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

concede  that  earlier,  that  it's  not  covered  by  the  Hobbs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  if  the  person's  not  a  dealer? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Well,  I  didn't  concede  it.  What 

   

  

  

 

 

 

I  said  is  you'd  have  to  have  a  different  theory. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You  said  it  was  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

different  thing. 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  It  was  a  different  thing.  And  it 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

supports  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  it  would  be  a  much 

   

  

 

 

 

 

harder  thing. 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  It  would  be  harder. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  it  would  be  at  least  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awfully  good  argument  by  the  defendant  that  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  was  not  a  dealer,  it's  not  affecting  commerce  in

MR.  YANG:  Well,  there  ­­ there  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  I  think  that  there  are  arguments  to  be  made 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  go  beyond  the  arguments  that  we're  making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  and  we're  not  pressing  those  today  for  various 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  I  think  as  the  Court  has  recognized,  this  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  area  of  some  difficulty  at  times.  Lopez  recognizes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  commercial  power  is  necessarily  one  of  degree,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Court's  decisions  have  not  provided  precise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formulation  in  the  nature  of  things  it  cannot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  what  we're  ­­ the  Court  ­­ I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry  ­­ but  the  Court's  taken  an  incremental  approach, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we're  doing  something  similar  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  asked  Mr.  Jones  whether 

    

 

 

 

 

the  Hobbs  Act  exercises  the  full  measure  of  Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commerce  Clause,  an  authority  which  I  thought  a  number 

   

   

 

 

 

 

of  cases  have  said.  Do  you  agree  with  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  It  does.  It  does.  Not  only 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

that,  but  I  think  ­­

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Because  then  you  do  run  into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  limitation  ­­ in  the  search  for  a  limiting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle,  which  you  seem  to  be  addressing.  So  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  prohibit  and  has  prohibited  a  person  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

possessing  even  a  very  small  amount  of  marijuana,  right,

marijuana  cigarette  from  another  person,  robs  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  of  one  marijuana  cigarette,  that's  a  violation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Hobbs  Act? 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Well,  there's  a  different 

   

  

 

 

argument  there,  and  let  me  tell  you  why.  The  pure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possession  ­­ and  we're  not  talking  about  the  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trade  in  marijuana  but  just  the  personal  possession, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  raises  different  questions.  That  was  addressed  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Raich.  Now,  there  is  an  argument  that  could  be  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  would  fall  within  the  Hobbs  Act.  At  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It  falls  within  the  Commerce 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Clause,  doesn't  it? 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  It  falls  ­­ certainly  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

possession  is  something  that  Congress  can  regulate  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Raich  teaches.  Now,  whether  the  robbery  of  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

possessing,  that's  yet  additional  ­­ an  additional  link 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  Commerce  Clause  inquiry.  And  what  I  can  say  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  courts  of  appeals  have  recognized,  as  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has,  the  ­­ in  a  search  for  the  outer  limits  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Commerce  Clause,  the  courts  have  pulled  back  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've  suggested  that  when  you're  robbing  just  a  mere

We're  ­­ we're  not  actually  taking  that  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case  because  we  don't  think  we  have  to.  What  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  in  this  case  is  robbery  of  the  commodity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana,  from  people  engaged  in  its  trade  when  we

which  the  United  States  has  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Suppose  someone  robbed  the 

  

 

 

 

 

farmer  in  Wickard  v.  Filburn  of  the  wheat  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

farmer  was  growing  for  personal  consumption.  Would  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  violation  of  the  Hobbs  Act? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Wickard  is  a  little  bit  more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

complicated  because  it  was  personal  consumption  but  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  context  of  a  commercial  enterprise,  right?  He  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

growing  wheat  for  his  animals  and  growing  wheat  ­­ he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  grew  wheat  for  sale.  So  ­­ but  the  wheat  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  talking  about  is  the  wheat  that  he  was  growing  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  own  use  in  his  business.  I  think  there  would  be  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stronger  argument  there  than  what  you'd  have  if  you  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  to  stumble  upon  someone,  you  rob  them,  and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picked  up,  you  know,  some  wheat  or  a  marijuana  cigarette 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  their  house.

Again,  we  don't  deny  that  there  are,  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fringes,  difficult  questions  that  this  Court  may  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  at  some  point.  But  we're  talking  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  is  your  understanding 

  

 

 

 

 

of  what  the  defendant  wanted  to  ­­ the  evidence  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  wanted  to  introduce? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  I  think  the  defendant  wanted  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

introduce  evidence  that  not  all  marijuana  in  Virginia  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming  from  out  of  State.  And  that's  not  legally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  to  our  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Was  there  any  challenge  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  status  of  these  victims  as  dealers? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  I  think  there  might  have  been 

    

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly  through  cross­examination,  but  what  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  here  is,  remember,  is  an  attempt.  This  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  ­­ the  Hobbs  Act  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  understand  that. 

    

 

 

MR.  YANG:  ­­ not  only  ­­ not  only  covers  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  was  an  attempt  against 

  

 

 

 

 

 

persons  who  were  in  the  drug  trade? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  And  at  least  at  a  minimum  who  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants  believed  were  in  the  drug  trade,  and  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  what  the  relevant  question  is  here.  Because  if,

facts  as  they  ­­ as  they  understood  them.

these  individuals  had  the  understanding  that  the  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victims  here  were  drug  dealers  that  were  engaging  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Yang,  I'd  like  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  you  to  explain  to  me  what  the  difference  in  charges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  between  this  robbery  and  a  regular  robbery,  let's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  of  a  business.  Because  as  you've  noted,  there  are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  circuits  that  say  if  you  just  rob  a  person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individually,  that's  not  a  Hobbs  Act  robbery.  But  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  rob  a  business,  it  is.  So  how  does  a  judge  charge 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  regular  Hobbs  Act  case  and  this  kind  of  case? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Well,  it  will  depend,  I  think,  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

part  on  the  government's  theory  of  the  case.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  makes  charging  decisions  and  presents  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory,  and  the  judge  would  have  to  charge  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  understand  the 

    

 

 

charges,  counsel.

that  all  the  courts  of  appeals  have  accepted  are  as  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  depletion­of­assets  theory  case. 

   

 

 

            

Now,  in  those  types  of  cases  when  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  the  robbery  of  a  business,  the  government  puts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  evidence  ­­ this  could  be  any  type  of  business  pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  ­­ that  the  business  engages  in  some  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interstate  commerce.  That's  kind  of  showing  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

particularized,  just  like  here  you're  showing  it's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana  dealer. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Engages  how,  either  by 

  

 

 

 

 

buying  goods  in  commerce  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Buying  goods  from  out  of  State, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling  to  out­of­State  customers,  buying  equipment  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  State,  all  types  of  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Let's  assume  that  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

true. 

            

MR.  YANG:  Uh­huh. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Is  the  jury  charged  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  particular  robbery  had  to  affect  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Yes,  because  what  they  end  up  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  theory,  the  depletion  of  assets  theory,  which  again, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  has  been  established  in  all  the  courts  of  appeals

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 

  

 

MR.  YANG:  ­­ what  you're  doing  is  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  ­­

 

            

            

depleting  the  assets  of  an  enterprise  that  is  engaging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  interstate  commerce.  And  so  by  doing  that,  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hindering  its  ability  to  engage  in  interstate  commerce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  a  prospective  basis. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  ­­ so  the  jury  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged  to  make  that  determination,  that  this  act  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

robbering  the  money  hindered  the  commerce  in  some  way? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Or  has  the  potential  to. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  how  is  that  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

than  his  argument,  your  adversary's  argument  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Oh,  I  think  that  that  is  his 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  I  think  he  accepts  in  his  brief  the  depletion 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  assets  theory  and  says  that  the  government  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  this  marijuana  moved  in  interstate  commerce, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  that  the  dealers  sold  to  people  out  of  State,  which  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  note  parenthetically  is  a  little  difficult  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

we're  talking  about  an  attempt,  and  we're  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  trade  in  marijuana.  They  don't  always  ­­ are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  always  forthcoming  in  their  admissions  to  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement,  but  that's  his  theory. 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  position  is  that  is  not  necessary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  know  already  ­­ although  that's  one  means  of

showing  an  effect  on  interstate  commerce,  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  means.  And  the  theory  here  is  that  the  robbery 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affects  commerce  over  which  the  United  States  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

We  know  that  commerce  of  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  jurisdiction  includes  the  inter­ or  intrastate  trade 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  marijuana,  and  that,  therefore,  in  this  theory  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  different,  it's  a  different  way  of  proving  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  jurisdictional  element  ­­ that  under  our  theory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  the  evidence  was  sufficient  because  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  evidence  to  show  that  these  ­­ the  Southwest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goonz,  including  Petitioners,  were  targeting  these  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victims  because  they  expected  to  gain  marijuana  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  who  they  thought  were  drug  dealers.

Taking  the  extension  that  my  friend  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting  here,  if  we  read  the  last  phrase  of  the  Hobbs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act,  it  says,  "All  other  commerce  over  which  the  United

it  has  no  limits  on  ­­ on  this  element  of  interstate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce,  then  the  answer  to  that  is  if  a  person  comes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  and  ­­ and  robs  an  individual  of  a  single  joint  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marijuana,  it  could  possibly  trigger  a  Hobbs  Act 

   

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  because  it's  "all."  It  encompasses  "all." 

  

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  don't  think  that  under  any  interpretation 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  the  Hobbs  Act  has  it  ­­ has  it  been  discussed

Hobbs  Act  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That  isn't  this  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

This  case  is  a  robbery  of  a  drug  dealer,  correct? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  JONES:  That's  correct.  And  what  we're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

saying,  Your  Honor,  is  that  in  ­­ in  the  robbery  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  dealer,  it  still  requires  an  independent  finding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  whether  or  not  there  was  this  effect  on  commerce.
