CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next today in Case 08-1175, Florida v. Powell. 

(11:15 a.m.) 

Mr. Jacquot. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH W. JACQUOT 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. JACQUOT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

As courts have recognized, Miranda warnings 

protect Fifth Amendment rights and promote voluntary 

confessions, confessions important to seeking truth, 

solving crimes, and securing justice.  Yet the Florida 

Supreme Court erred in two ways to suppress a voluntary 

confession relied upon for Kevin Powell's conviction. 

First, the Florida court misapplied the 

analysis.  Rather than evaluating the warning under a 

reasonably conveyed standard for the right to an 

attorney, the court strictly parsed the warning, seeking 

certain words in a certain order. 

Second, the court incorrectly found the 

warning to be misleading.  The court ignored the 

totality of the warning.  The court overemphasized the 

order in which the rights were given, and furthermore, 

the court applied a hypertechnical analysis of the

Official 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you agree that it --

suppose we accept your position and the case is 

remanded.  The Florida Supreme Court could say:  Well, 

that's very nice, but we have a Florida Constitution 

with a counterpart to the Fifth Amendment, so we're just 

going to have the same opinion, but we are putting it 

under -- squarely under the Florida Constitution. 

They could do that? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Your Honor, the Florida court 

theoretically could, but the Florida court would have to 

do that on State grounds, and in this case, they relied 

on Federal grounds to reach this decision. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, that's what I meant. 

They could do it on State grounds. 

MR. JACQUOT:  Theoretically.  But this Court 

found in Evans v. Arizona that just because of the 

theoretical possibility that a court could write its 

opinion differently on State grounds, this Court still 

had jurisdiction because the original opinion rested on 

Federal grounds. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are the Florida Supreme 

Court elected?  Are they elected judges? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Your Honor --

MR. JACQUOT:  Your Honor, the Florida 

Supreme Court members are first appointed, and then they 

are subsequently elected. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How -- how long is their 

term?  There’s a retention election when? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Correct.  There is a retention 

election every 4 years. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Every 4 years.  And they'd 

have to run for their retention election on the ticket 

that "We've expanded Miranda for Florida purposes," 

right?

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, Your Honor, they are 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Has the -- has the Florida 

Supreme Court ever explicitly interpreted -- what is it? 

Article I, section 8, of the Florida Constitution more 

expansively than -- and explicitly so -- and explicitly 

so, than Miranda? 

MR. JACQUOT:  No, Your Honor.  The Florida 

Supreme Court has said that the possibility is there, 

but in its decisions it has found -- particularly in 

the case before you --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, they did it in this 

case, didn't they?  Under your view, they –- their

ruling goes beyond Miranda, and they said that the 

Florida Constitution requires this result. 

MR. JACQUOT:  No, Justice --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So they did do it in this 

very case. 

MR. JACQUOT:  No, Justice Stevens.  The 

court specifically relied on Federal law.  It just got 

it wrong. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it also cited the --

the Florida Constitution, did it not? 

MR. JACQUOT:  It cited the Florida 

Constitution --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  And did it not also say 

that this was a violation of the Federal -- I mean, of 

the Florida Constitution? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Yes, Your Honor, it mentioned 

the Florida Constitution.  However, in those same 

sentences, it interwove Federal law.  It would say: 

Under the Florida Constitution and according to Miranda. 

And this Court in Michigan v. Long has found that 

opinions that interweave State and Federal law are 

appropriate for this Court's jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  One of your amici -- one 

of the amici suggested that the Florida courts cannot 

read the Florida Constitution more expansively than the

Federal requirements.  Are you rejecting that 

proposition? 

MR. JACQUOT:  We do indeed, Your Honor.  The 

Florida court in Powell read the warning to -- in line 

with Miranda. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And it's a different 

question.  One of the amici suggests that the Florida 

Constitution and Florida case law says that they can't 

read the Florida Constitution more broadly than it is 

read under Federal law. 

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, Your Honor, the past 

cases have said that the Florida court could, but they 

haven't.  And in this case they particularly did not. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So this could be a 

first, if we were to start from the proposition that 

Justice Ginsburg did? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, Your Honor, under 

Michigan v. Long the test is to look at the clear face 

of the opinion, to look for a plain statement that this 

case relied on adequate -- adequate and independent 

State grounds, and that is not there. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do -- do you see a 

conflict between the language of our decisions where we 

often say that Miranda rights have to be clear and those 

decisions that say that whatever is said has to

reasonably convey the essence of the Miranda warnings? 

Is there a difference between those two 

statements, and which of our cases or statements would 

control? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Your Honor, in Miranda the 

Court did use the terms "clearly inform."  However, this 

Court has gone on in Prysock to use the term "adequately 

inform" and Duckworth uses the word "reasonably convey." 

So, yes, although the rights are consistent from Miranda 

on --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you would suggest 

that if something is not clear and it's ambiguous, that 

that's enough?  Or -- or is there a difference between 

reasonable and clarity?  That has to be read in a 

certain way; otherwise an ambiguous warning --

MR. JACQUOT:  No, Your Honor, I would say 

that this Court has said that clarity is judged by 

whether the warnings reasonably convey the rights under 

Miranda; that's the standard. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did Miranda itself -- I 

mean, it set out the four requirements, but there was a 

charge -- I mean there was a warning involved, am I not 

right?  Well, didn't they cite the then-FBI warning?  It 

has been improved considerably, but there was an FBI 

warning cited in Miranda itself, was there not?

MR. JACQUOT:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and 

that warning conveyed only the right to attorney.  It 

did not have the specific --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It also said you have a 

right to keep silent. 

MR. JACQUOT:  Correct.  But on the right to 

attorney warning at issue here, it said only that the 

suspect has the ability to consult counsel.  It did not 

go into the specific -- detail, the explicit nature of 

spelling out the terms "present" and the terms "during" 

that the Florida Supreme Court required.  And that's the 

real issue here before the Court, is whether the Florida 

Supreme Court applied a standard that is significantly 

different than the standard that this Court has 

required. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It told them:  You are 

entitled to confer with counsel before answering 

questions, right? 

MR. JACQUOT:  What warning, Justice Scalia? 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wasn't that -- wasn't that 

the warning given -- given in this case?  You are 

entitled to consult counsel before answering questions? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Yes, the warning in this case 

said you have the right to talk to a lawyer before 

answering any of our questions.  And, furthermore --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, "any" –- just 

to make sure; you've said two different things.  It says 

"any of our questions," right? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the 

warning said, "You have the right to talk to a lawyer 

before answering any of our questions."  And then the 

warning went on to say, "You have the right to use this 

right at any time during this interview." 

We would argue that this expresses all the 

rights required under Miranda. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about the right in 

Miranda that says -- in Miranda -- "We hold an 

individual held for interrogation must be clearly 

informed that he has the right to consult with the 

lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during 

interrogation."  Okay? 

Where does it say that?  Interpret it any 

way you want.  You know, we are used to grand juries. 

In a grand jury, he can go consult with a lawyer, but he 

doesn't have the lawyer with him.  So, where does it 

tell him that? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, Your Honor, the standard 

being “reasonably convey” --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm just asking you to 

point to the words that tell him that. 

MR. JACQUOT:  The right to talk to a lawyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Don't have you a right to 

talk to a lawyer at a grand jury? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Yes, but a -- Your Honor, a 

grand jury operates very differently than a criminal 

interrogation. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, correct.  And so 

aren't you supposed to tell this person, that unlike a 

grand jury, you have a right to have the lawyer with you 

during interrogation?  I mean, it isn't as if that was 

said in passing in Miranda.  They wrote eight paragraphs 

about it.  And I just wonder, where does it say in this 

warning you have the right to have the lawyer with you 

during the interrogation? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, Justice Breyer, I would 

have three responses to that.  First, under Miranda the 

FBI warning did not use the terms "present," did not use 

the terms "with you," and --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't use the word 

"present," Miranda?  It says right here:  "We hold" --

it says -- "not just prior to questioning, but also to 

have counsel present during any questioning."  That's

what Miranda says.  And then Miranda, after discussing 

it for five pages, goes on to use the words I just said. 

You have to tell him he has the right to have counsel 

with him.  So it does use the word "present." 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It -- it used it in 

determining -- in -- in stating the obligation of the 

State, but it didn't use those words in setting out the 

warning that the FBI then gave. 

MR. JACQUOT:  Correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It said, this is what --

States, this is what your obligation is, what you must 

say to the defendant is.  And I think the Florida court 

is the same way.  It said:  You are entitled to the help 

of a lawyer.  Then it spells it out in that opinion, but 

-- but what it said had to be communicated was not the 

-- the full range.  Just you're entitled, I think it 

was, to the help of a lawyer. 

So there’s -- there’s a confusion, I 

think, between what Miranda spells out and many other 

cases spell out as the State’s obligation, what the 

State must do, and the statement that must be made to 

the defendant to communicate that. 

MR. JACQUOT:  Justice Ginsburg, let me be 

very clear and answer Justice Breyer with the three 

points I began.  Miranda requires that law enforcement

effectively communicate the fact that you can access 

your right to an attorney present and during an 

interrogation.  However, in the Miranda opinion they 

approvingly cited the FBI warning that only had the 

terms -- the generalized warning:  Consult with counsel. 

Furthermore, the ability to talk to your 

lawyer, which is at issue in this warning, is the first 

natural step to getting your attorney. 

And, third, as this Court has held in 

Minnick, that it’s the representation that matters in 

custodial interrogations --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what FBI are we 

talking about?  Because the FBI advice of rights says: 

"You have the right to have a lawyer with you during 

questioning."  Were they -- and -- and I was taken by 

the fact, "We hold that an individual must be clearly 

informed." 

And so, is there some other case that 

says -- or some other FBI statement that they give 

people that doesn't use the words "with you," that says 

you don't have to say "with you during," or doesn't have 

to say "present during"?  Was there some other case that 

said that? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Your Honor, the current FBI 

warning does have that.  However, there have been

several cases in the circuits that have held generalized 

warnings to be sufficient, warnings that say only the 

right to an attorney.  And one of the issues --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the warning that 

Justice Breyer has just referred to -- that’s long after 

Miranda itself, and it was not the warning that the FBI 

gave at the time of Miranda. 

MR. JACQUOT:  Correct, Your Honor.  And --

and that is the issue, is what is, first, the standard 

that courts must currently apply in terms of whether a 

warning reasonably conveys.  That is not the standard of 

analysis that the Florida court applied. 

And secondly, when evaluating that warning, 

the -- the Florida court incorrectly finds that this 

warning was misleading.  Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have a difficulty in 

terms of this argument about burdening law enforcement. 

This is a preprinted form that the police made up, 

correct? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what's the added 

burden by making the form absolutely and abundantly 

clear or conforming the form to the statements in 

Miranda?  What's the cost to the State?  They’re going 

to print the form anyway.  They are telling their

officers to read from the form anyway.  What's the added 

cost? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Your Honor, there are three 

reasons why the Florida Supreme Court's explicit 

standard is problematic.  First, the same standard 

applies to written warnings as to verbal warnings.  So 

you’ve had situations where you have a law enforcement 

officer who doesn't have his card in the field; there’s 

a verbal error; there’s an inconsistency in 

translations.  If a suspect is asking questions trying 

to get clarity, the law enforcement officer is going 

outside of the card to provide that clarity.  Those are 

situations that may not meet the explicit express advice 

standard of the Court. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, there is a 

question about how much the subjective intent of the 

questioner should be involved in this process or not. 

There are cases where it appears the plurality of 

our Court has said it should always be an objective 

standard, and others where certain members have 

expressed a question about subjective. 

But if we are dealing with a printed form, 

why wouldn't the intent of the entity at issue be placed 

in question?  Meaning, you could have -- the police here 

could have chosen to be explicit, but instead they chose

to be -- to obfuscate a little bit and be less explicit. 

Shouldn't we assume that that’s an intent to deceive or 

perhaps to confuse? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Absolutely not, Your Honor. 

The Tampa Police, in having this warning drafted, is 

attempting to reasonably convey the warning, and there 

is good public policy reasons why. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why?  The -- the 

easy solution is to do what 90 percent of the 

jurisdictions are doing:  Copy Miranda. 

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, Your Honor, we would 

claim that this warning falls within the 97 percent 

cited by amici because it has the word "during" in the 

warning.  The Florida court ignored the totality of the 

warning.  It chose to place the order of the warning's 

rights in a way that this Court in Prysock and Duckworth 

has found is not the proper analysis. 

Furthermore, this court used a 

hypertechnical approach.  It took the words "before 

answering any of our questions," turned that into an 

exclusive statement to say, "only before questioning" 

and then, as a result of that, attempted to discount the 

last sentence of the warning.  That's the kind of 

parsing, that's the kind of precise formulation, that's 

the kind of construing warnings like a will or defining

terms like an easement that this Court has rejected. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the danger 

that Tampa, if you should prevail, will go back to the 

old way?  Now, it has a clearer form -- whether this 

form was adequate is one thing.  But now, it has the 

form that the -- like the one the FBI currently uses. 

If you prevail, then Tampa can go back to what it had 

before? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Your Honor, you are correct, 

in that Tampa has a new form now that does have the 

words "present" and "during" in a different formulation. 

However, there’s no indication that they 

would go back to the other form, for several reasons. 

One, law enforcement has an incentive to have Miranda 

rights properly given because they desire there to be 

confessions and for those confessions to be admissible. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, once we say this is 

properly given, my goodness, here's -- here's an 

instruction approved specifically by this Court.  I 

mean, I think they should use that, don't you? 

I mean, the other one they are going to have 

to guess about, but this one is approved in a case 

involving Florida by this Court.  So you -- it's pretty 

attractive to use that one.

enforcement agencies will look to courts for approval of 

this -- of their warnings.  The warning at issue in 

Powell --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you have to say it's 

okay.  You are arguing that it's perfectly okay, so why 

do you hesitate when you are asked, you know, could the 

State go back to doing it?  You should say, yes, of 

course, they -- they might; we don't think it's likely,

Isn't that your position? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, Justice Scalia, as a --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not your position? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Justice Scalia, they 

theoretically could, because the warning was reasonably 

conveyed.  It was sufficient.  However, it’s unlikely 

they would.  Law enforcement agencies modify their 

warnings when they become issue.  So when a litigation 

begins on a warning, they often modify it at that point. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me -- let me ask you 

one question.  Isn't it the case that this particular 

warning is used in one judicial district, and the 

warning that was approved in Traylor was used in the 

rest of the State?  And so there is an interest -- the 

Florida 

Supreme Court has, in effect, required the same warning

throughout the State.  And if you prevail, there may be 

one standard warning in one judicial district, and the 

other districts may continue to use the one they have 

used in the past.  Isn't that right? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, Justice Stevens, it is 

not true that every jurisdiction in Florida uses this 

same warning.  There are varieties of warnings. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's true, but if you --

if they all followed the Florida Supreme Court in this 

case, then they all would use the same warning? 

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, Justice Stevens, if they 

were all following the Florida Supreme Court here, they 

would have to explicitly state certain terms in their 

warning.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Which most of them do 

MR. JACQUOT:  Well, not necessarily.  In --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Not all, but some. 

MR. JACQUOT:  Some -- some do, some do not, 

and one of the fears in having an express advice 

standard is that you will have continuing terms that are 

required.  For instance, the term "before" is lacking in 

30 of 90 jurisdictions in Florida. 

There is nothing to stop the Florida Supreme 

Court, if this Court was to allow an express advice

Standard, from then requiring the term "before 

questioning" in addition.  That's the kind of danger in 

having an analysis that is much stricter, that 

essentially looks at words that should be in a warning, 

rather than looking at whether the right to attorney is 

reasonably conveyed to the suspect.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. O'NEIL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

I’d like to go directly to Justice 

Ginsburg's question about what would happen if this 

Court affirmed the warnings in this case, and I think 

Respondent's amici make the argument that it will 

somehow promote a race to the bottom. 

And I think that history and experience are 

the best answer to that question.  Respondent's amici, 

who have carefully studied this issue, have found that 

some police officers have attempted to evade Miranda by 

interrogation techniques, but there is no indication

that police have tried to accomplish that purpose by 

changing the language of the warnings, and that is not 

because they couldn't do so.  For the last 20 years, 

Duckworth and Prysock have been on the books, and have 

made clear that no standard formulation of the warnings 

is necessary and that variant warnings will be upheld. 

And if it were true --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except that Justice 

Scalia just pointed out, if we approve the language of 

this, then -- of this particular warning, it becomes the 

new sort of floor. 

And if we make it the new floor, it --

doesn't it provide an incentive for police departments 

to move away from the explicit warnings that say “during 

and” -- “before and during” interrogations; now we're 

saying -- you know, generalize them more. 

MR. O'NEIL:  Well, Justice --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Aren't we encouraging 

that? 

MR. O'NEIL:  Justice Sotomayor, I have two 

responses to that:  The first is that this Court upheld 

the warning in Duckworth, which said, we have no way of 

providing you an attorney, but one will be provided if 

and when you go to court.

and if changing the warnings were an effective way to do 

that, we should have seen every jurisdiction adopt those 

warnings. 

In fact, of the 900 warnings that are 

included in the survey that Respondent relies heavily 

on, only 5 have that formulation.  Second, four 

circuit courts have held --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How many after 

Duckworth?  Do you know? 

MR. O'NEIL:  I don't -- it doesn't indicate 

when they were adopted, but I think it's fair to say 

that, if police did have that incentive, that we would 

have seen at least some jurisdictions adopt that 

warning.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your case has to be 

that, if we adopt the Petitioner's petition, it's 

perfectly fine for every jurisdiction in the country to

MR. O'NEIL:  They can, and we think that’s 

unlikely, and if the concern here is that it will 

destroy the uniformity that the Federal government 

thinks is a good thing as a matter of policy, we think 

that that concern is simply not warranted.  But, yes, we 

do agree that these warnings adequately convey the 

substance --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Excuse me.  You think lack 

of uniformity is a good idea? 

MR. O'NEIL:  No, we think that affirming 

these warnings will not disrupt the uniformity that 

seems to be in place around the country, and -- for 

exactly the reason that I said, Justice Kennedy, because 

Justice Sotomayor mentioned general right to counsel 

warnings, that if we upheld a general right to counsel 

warning, that jurisdictions would begin to drop the more 

specific language that’s contained, for example, in the 

FBI form.  Well --

29 of our brief. 

Official 

And I think, Justice Sotomayor, it’s 

significant that four circuit courts have upheld general 

right to counsel warnings of the kind that were in the 

FBI warnings in 1966.  But the police departments in 

those jurisdictions have not abandoned the more specific 

language that is contained in the FBI formulation.  In 

New York City, the Second Circuit has held in Lamia --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- how do we deal 

with the fact that, if the purpose of Miranda is to give 

clear warnings, and your adversary says -- not your 

adversary -- your co-counsel -- Petitioner's counsel 

says that means -- "clear" means does it reasonably 

convey? 

We've got a split of circuit courts and 

State courts on whether this reasonably conveys or not. 

Shouldn't that be enough of an ambiguity for us to 

conclude it can't reasonably convey, if there's this 

many courts holding that it doesn't? 

MR. O'NEIL:  No, Justice Sotomayor.  This is 

not like a qualified immunity inquiry, where grounds for 

debate among reasonable jurists would invalidate the 

warning. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you calling the 

Florida State Supreme Court majority unreasonable

Official 

MR. O'NEIL:  No, I think -- I think the 

problem with a standard that permits of no ambiguity is 

that, as Florida just said, this standard will apply, 

not just to printed forms -- and it is easy enough to 

create a printed form in advance that includes more 

specific language -- but it will also apply to 

inadvertent departures from the standard forms as a 

result of mistake. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What happens now is that 

we are dealing with the exception rather than the rule, 

and -- but this was the rule, meaning this was the form 

that they were reading.  And if it has some significant 

ambiguity in it, sufficient for at least one court to 

say it wasn't sufficiently clear, it wasn't explicit 

enough, should we worry about the exception as an 

exception? 

MR. O'NEIL:  Well, I think -- I think the 

exception is -- needs to be captured within the rule 

that this Court adopts as -- as the standard. 

I -- I also think that it -- it is -- it's 

simply not the case that if this Court, as I said, 

adopts a standard that permits a less explicit, less 

precise warning than the FBI wants --

MR. O'NEIL:  Justice Stevens, I'm not aware 

that Florida had two printed forms.  I mean, each 

jurisdiction used its own form, and this was the form 

that was in place --

MR. O'NEIL:  Well, every jurisdiction

JUSTICE STEVENS:  And isn't it -- isn't it

the State? 

MR. O'NEIL:  It is.  The government believes 

it is wiser to do that, and the Federal law enforcement 

agencies do that because it avoids --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the Constitution 

requires it, right? 

MR. O'NEIL:  Well, no, the Constitution does 

not require the precise words of Miranda.

summarily rejected exactly that argument.

devote one minute before you finish –-

MR. O'NEIL:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- to the question of why 

these are adequate?  If you remember my question, I 

tried to explain why I thought they might not be

MR. O'NEIL:  Justice Breyer, these warnings 

state three rights:  The right --

One is to have during, in the presence of, the right to 

have a lawyer during the interrogation, in the presence

MR. O'NEIL:  Absolutely. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, that's one of 

the four.  That's one of the things they devote two 

pages to Miranda, and they repeat it when they summarize 

what you have to say.  I just want to know where in this 

statement does it say that?

during this interview would infer the unstated 

restriction that he can talk to an attorney but only by 

phone or only remotely --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Really?  I guess anybody 

who has had prior experience with the law, as this man 

might have done, might be familiar with a grand jury 

proceeding. 

MR. O'NEIL:  But for the same reason we 

don't ask whether the suspect has sufficient knowledge 

to supplement the information he needs. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  But I tell 

you:  Here's your right to talk to a lawyer before 

questioning. 

MR. O'NEIL:  Well, it --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, you then repeat, you 

can assert that right whenever you want, to talk to him 

before questioning. 

MR. O'NEIL:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And my question is, how 

does that tell him he has a right to have a lawyer with 

him during questioning, that the questioning he has a 

right to have take place from beginning to end in the 

presence of a lawyer, a matter that the Miranda Court 

repeated three times in the summary and wrote eight

full paragraphs about why that was important? 

MR. O'NEIL:  Well, first, as Justice 

Ginsburg noted, Miranda went out of its way to -- to 

specifically approve an FBI warning that said, quote --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where does it say it 

approves that? 

MR. O'NEIL:  It said this pattern of 

warnings is consistent with the decision that we 

announced today.  And I think --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It wasn't though, actually. 

MR. O’NEIL: -- it couldn’t have been 

clearer. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It isn't -- it isn't 

consistent with it.  That's interesting. 

MR. O'NEIL:  Well, that argument was made by 

Justice Clark in dissent, and the Court did not agree 

with that.  And I think it is clear that the Court 

thought that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  They didn't say anything 

about during. 

MR. O'NEIL:  Well, no, they didn't. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So anyway -- then they 

don't need to mention “during” at all because if that's 

right, the FBI warning at that time, J. Edgar Hoover's 

letter or whatever it was, just talked about telling

you, you have a right to counsel.  It doesn't say 

anything about “during.” 

MR. O'NEIL:  Well, I think that's exactly 

the point, that you don't assume that a suspect is only 

capable of understanding --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So then you think that, in 

fact, going by that warning, that there is no 

constitutional right to have them say a word about 

during.  This would be okay if they said nothing at all 

about it. 

MR. O'NEIL:  I think a -- a -- advice of the 

right to counsel or, as the Court put it in a different 

place in the Miranda opinion, the right to obtain the 

services of an attorney of his choice, that would be 

constitutionally adequate.  The Federal Government does 

not use those warnings because they create a list -- a 

risk of litigation. 

We think that's the correct reading of 

Miranda, but that, of course, is not guarantee that 

other courts would read it that way.  And, indeed, 2 

years after Miranda, the Fifth Circuit had gone the 

other way and decided that, in fact, a right to counsel 

warning is not sufficient. 

But, Justice Breyer, I think that the answer 

to how these warnings convey presence is that a suspect

to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney, the 

services of an attorney; and that you have the right 

to -- or any -- any statement you make will be used 

against you.  So they just didn't go far enough in the 

FBI warnings. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I would say that 

it's not consistent with Miranda.

to a point, but it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  And just as if -- and --

counsel. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, while you’re 

looking at whether it would be an undue burden on law 

enforcement, it was -- it has a burden that’s consistent 

with the ones that Miranda required expressly. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  I'm sorry.  The --

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Correct.  It's -- it’s 

not any more burdensome by adding in the -- an 

additional requirement. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What it says is that 

the respect for the rights of the individual followed 

in the FBI is consistent with. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Uh-huh.  The rights of 

the individual, right. 

And the -- the Miranda Court just made sure 

that they’ve added in the additional requirement, and 

the FBI did change their warnings, and has continued to 

modify and change their warnings to be consistent with 

Miranda. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The bottom line in my 

mind -- the question is, whether these warnings are 

substantively or otherwise different than the FBI 

warnings that some believe were approved in Miranda. 

Are these equivalent? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  I don't -- I believe 

that -- that requiring the presence of counsel during 

the interrogation goes a little bit -- a lot further. 

And it -- it is not equivalent to the FBI.

Miranda ever said we -- it's consistent with, but they 

never said, we approve.  They never said, we are 

adopting that language.

it seems very clear that they intend you to have to say 

that the counsel has to be -- is present with you. 

Present, okay?  Now the FBI warnings, which they did say 

is consistent, don't say that.

talk, even though he was told he could consult an

questioned. 

There -- there -- we are not talking 

about reasonable lawyers or reasonable justices; we are 

talking about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, how about the 

reasonable defendant in this very case?  Powell's lawyer 

questioned him and asked him:  "You waived the right to 

have an attorney present during your questioning by the 

detectives?" 

Answer:  "Yes." 

This is at appendix page 80.  So, 

apparently, counsel understood the warning to have 

conveyed the right to have an attorney present during 

questioning by the -- by the detectives.  Counsel 

understood that? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  No, counsel --

in order to get to his -- his argument that his 

statements were coerced. 

But she was never giving up the argument 

that she had made previously to that -- that testimony 

that -- that the waiver was knowing and intelligent. 

She just had already lost that argument in front of the 

judge, and now she was addressing the jury. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was she asking her client 

a legal question?  You waived the right to have an 

attorney present during your questioning by detectives, 

is that what you are telling the jury? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Yes.  Well, he did waive 

his rights, but he didn't knowingly and intelligently 

waive his rights, and he did sign the form.  Because

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  I think they would focus 

on the “before.” 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you think that a 

suspect would think, now, I'm in this custodial room, 

they want me to stay put, that they’re going to have me 

hopping in and out of the room to talk to my lawyer? 

Wouldn't the assumption be, I'm stuck in this room, they 

are holding me here, and if I have a right to talk to a 

lawyer, it's got to be there and not my walking in and 

out of the holding room. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  And a right -- but they 

never told him that he’d have the ability to talk to a 

lawyer during the interrogation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there -- is there 

any -- I'm not sure this is pertinent -- but is there 

any malevolent reason Tampa police would adopt this 

warning?  I mean, someone says, well, here's what the 

FBI uses.  And they say, well, I tell you what, if we 

just say you have a right to an attorney before 

answering any questions and then later say you can 

exercise this right any time, maybe we'll be able to

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  It's -- it's hard for us 

to be able to delve into the minds of the Tampa Police 

Department and the people who create these forms. 

However, in the Thompson case, which is before you in 

the briefs, in 1984, they had it right.  They said you 

have the right to talk to an attorney beforehand and to 

the presence of an attorney during interrogation.  This 

was in a death case, and there was something wrong with 

the right to free counsel.  They either didn't give it 

to them or not. 

So why they went and changed the part to the 

right to an attorney before -- before the questioning, 

and then during questioning, we don't know. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- and you can't 

think of any bad reason they might have done it. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Well, Professor Leo 

could, and there is a memo he attaches at the end of his 

appendix in the amicus brief, but I -- I would just say 

that it doesn't really matter what the motives are, and 

that it all depends on how the defendant or the person 

in custody is -- is perceiving these warnings and 

whether he's getting the information he or she needs to 

be --

dealt with the right to appointed counsel and the 

suspect was not explicitly told that he had a right to 

appointed counsel at the pre-arraignment stage.  It said 

something about a court would give you --

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Right.  The -- the 

language in those cases had something to do with -- you 

know, the idea being that, it was almost 

informational -- too much information, additional 

information as to when you’re going to get your 

counsel.  But the four core --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You wouldn't have to have 

any additional information; you just tell them, you have 

a right to have a -- have counsel now.  That would be 

fewer words. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Well, they -- in Prysock 

it was a matter of the order, but in Duckworth it was, 

we can't get one for you at this moment kind of thing. 

And no State is obligated -- or agency -- to provide 

counsel on demand. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Didn't one of them say 

"court," and the suspect was not in court at the time? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Was not in court?

sometime in the future.  But -- but they did -- but they 

did tell them that if you’re going -- if you’re going to 

be questioned, you have the right to counsel with you at 

that time.  And that was the important thing.  Even if 

we had to wait, they couldn't question him until he had 

his attorney with him. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If this warning is read the 

way we might -- lawyers might read a statute or a 

contract or something like that, then I don't know why 

saying, "You have the right to remain silent," isn't 

potentially misleading.  It says you have the right to 

remain silent.  But once you break your silence, there 

is nothing in there that says you have the right to 

resume your silence. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  No. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you agree with that? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Except for that -- that 

catch-all phrase that they used at the bottom, which is 

you have the right to use any of these at any time. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that is 

defective, too? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Well, I think that it --

it's probably okay as far as reinforcing the right to 

remain silent and informing him that any of your answers 

can be used against you, but I don't think it salvages a

right that's not there, which is the right to presence 

during interrogation. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So once you break your --

you have the right to remain silent, but once you break 

that right, the fact that you have that right to use 

that right to remain silent in the future doesn't mean 

you can stop answering questions. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Well, the -- the 

catch-all phrase might inform them that they could stop, 

but, clearly, if they had the right to presence of 

counsel with them, that might --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We could write that down. 

It could be the next case. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Right.  And I do -- I 

also contest the language that the opposing counsel uses 

that says that we have somehow locked in everybody with 

-- with what the -- what the decision below said. 

The decision below held that, and I quote at 

541, "We hold that Powell should have been clearly 

informed of his right to the presence of counsel during 

the custodial interrogation."  It's not magic language. 

It's not so -- so written in stone that -- it's not 

explicit language.

what this -- this Court has said.  The reasonable 

language, the clearly informed language.  It isn't 

locking everyone into these exact words down the line. 

And there are hundreds of ways that this could be said. 

So -- and then the court noted that the catch-all phrase 

did not effectively convey to Mr. Powell his rights to 

presence before and during and that the last sentence 

could not effectively convey a right that he was never 

told he had. 

As far as whether or not this case should 

even be here, even though the Florida Constitution and 

the Florida court has gone along the same road, traveled 

a parallel road with this Court, and it hasn't seen a 

need to deviate, they -- they may see a need to deviate 

here, should this Court disagree with what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, they are -- they 

are free to do that.  I mean, politically, they might 

consider it risky, but if we say that the charge was 

good enough, the Florida court could say, but it's not 

good enough under our Constitution. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Correct.  And -- and I 

believe they would.

Long --

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- in that case. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  -- the Florida Supreme 

Court must have referred to its constitutional 

provision, Article I, section 9, at least five times. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And in each time, it said 

that it was by extension from Miranda.  It always linked 

it, and that was the question that was presented in the 

State court --

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Right.  And the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- that it certified. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  It's almost like Miranda 

is being used as a generic concept for warnings -- you 

know, we’re complying with Miranda --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's the whole reason we 

have jurisdiction, so that Miranda will not be confused, 

and so that it won't be a hazard on the landscape when 

people say "Miranda" and they mean something else. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Right, but -- you know --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it's not at all clear 

that the Washington -- that the Florida Supreme Court

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's -- maybe in some 

other case.  Not necessarily in this one, because Long 

leads to -- to the contrary. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Well, in -- in Traylor, 

which is the court that -- it’s the case that the -- the 

Florida Supreme Court and the decision below relied 

heavily upon, they said that we are the ceiling and the 

court is the bottom, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you have no case in 

which the Florida Supreme Court has explicitly said that 

we have a warning that is more strict, more rigorous 

than what Miranda requires?  You have no case? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  No, and they -- they 

didn't feel like they had to -- to deviate, because they 

felt like their definition of presence of counsel, which 

was the right to consult with an attorney before and the 

right to have counsel present during the interrogation, 

was consistent with the holdings in Miranda.  So they 

didn't feel the need to deviate. 

But they did say that that is our definition 

as we set forth in -- in Traylor, and that is --

were answering a certified question, which was simply 

whether this -- this warning complied with Miranda. 

That was the only certified question. 

So when it goes back, I assume they, having 

said no, will now have to say yes.  Can they go on and 

say:  Oh, and by the way, even though it doesn't violate 

Miranda, we think it violates the State Constitution? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  I believe they can, 

because as long as they are not going below what this 

Court mandates --

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Right.  And they --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's really not --

that's really not quite accurate, because they used the 

term "Miranda warnings" generically --

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Generically, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, except the words 

that it quoted from the lower court opinion -- that is, 

we are talking about the -- the Fifth Amendment, and by

kept repeating it.  They didn't have to.  If they were 

just going to say, oh, by the way, our Constitution

are stressing the fact that they have set a line in the 

sand as far as what they're interpreting the right to 

presence --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the question asked: 

Does the failure to provide express advice of the right 

to the presence of counsel during questioning vitiate 

Miranda warnings? 

Okay?  That's the question.  They have a 

footnote after Miranda, which reads, “Miranda v. 

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436.”  I take that to mean that the 

question is whether this warning violated Miranda. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  And, of course, if they 

did violate the baseline, the minimum standard set forth 

in Miranda --

Traylor and the Florida constitution kept making --

because they didn't have to really get to what the 

bottom or the baseline or the minimum standard was, as 

long as Florida had set forth a standard. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's true, but --

but if they -- if they felt the authority to go beyond 

Miranda, wouldn't they have had to say no to this 

question, if we find that way, and then go on to say: 

But it does violate our own?  And that's beyond the 

question that they -- that they -- that was certified to 

them. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  And I believe the idea 

that they didn't think it was deviating from the Miranda 

case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  I --

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  But if this Court finds 

that it does, then they -- they will probably -- and I 

feel confident that they would fall back on the 

constitution -- of the Florida constitution. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they did say over and 

over again -- one was the certified question; another 

was the issue before the court is whether the failure 

to provide express advice of the right to the presence 

of counsel during custodial interrogation violates the 

principles espoused in Miranda, with the citation.

I mean, they said many, many times that the 

question was -- what did Miranda mean was the issue, not 

what -- what did Florida's extension of Miranda. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Well, they do have a 

section in looking at, you know, other circuit courts in 

the Federal system, and all -- what our Florida courts 

are doing, and -- which is when they get into the 

concept of -- well, they start out talking about Traylor 

and our constitution at the beginning, and they -- they 

repeat it at the end because they believe it is 

consistent with.  They believe it is following along. 

But they never say that -- that our 

constitution isn't insignificant or that it's not 

important.  If they did, they wouldn't have felt the 

need to cite Traylor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think you would have 

had a much weightier argument if it hadn't been for 

Michigan v. Long.  If you could have said --

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  It -- it would have been 

nice. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We could have then 

remanded to ask the Florida Supreme Court:  Was it 

independently ruling under its constitution? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  I -- I will keep that in

mind. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  The -- the idea of clear, 

reasonably clear -- whichever the standard is, 

Justice Sotomayor, I believe the Florida Supreme Court 

used the correct standard and used the one by saying 

that it was clear -- you know, whether or not Mr. Powell 

was clearly informed. 

So no matter which standard you use, as far 

as functionally equivalent or whatever, I believe that 

this falls within the four corners of that. 

The obligation -- let's see, I'm looking to 

see what other cases -- general cases. 

They -- the opposition cites to the 

fact that there’s this great conflict going on among the 

circuits.  I don't believe that such a conflict is –-

whatever those cases were deciding, I don't believe they 

would have approved of this language. 

This language, because of the "before" 

limiting language and excluding the "presence during" 

language, became misleading.  And the -- the general 

cases that like -- just the plain language, you have the 

right to the presence of counsel, they -- they are not 

inconsistent with -- with what Florida has required. 

They -- they would not disagree that there --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you said that the 

average person wouldn't take this warning to mean --

to -- wouldn't envision a procedure like the grand jury 

procedure.  What does it mislead the average person to 

think? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  That he -- that once 

questioning starts, that he -- he has no right to 

consult with a lawyer anymore, and it certainly 

doesn't -- and tell him that he has the right to the 

presence of an attorney with him in an interrogation 

room, where the coercion takes on a highly new meaning. 

I mean the coercive practices that are --

that are --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But the latter part of that 

is the grand jury question.  You have a right to consult 

an attorney, but you don't have the right to have an 

attorney present. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  I don't -- I don't 

believe -- any -- any of the normal reasonable suspects 

are -- would probably be even aware of what the grand 

jury proceeding was about. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  So then your argument 

is that this -- that what -- what a normal -- an average 

person would take this to mean is that you -- you can 

talk an -- to an attorney before starting to answer

questions, but not once the questioning begins.  That's 

what you take it to mean? 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Correct, and I'm not the 

only one.  There were five supreme court justices, a 

majority on the second -- the majority of the second 

district judges in Powell and seven judges on the second 

district level, who all found that to be the case, and 

we’re talking someone who doesn't have that level of 

intelligence. 

And he may have had a prior record -- he did 

have a prior record, but that doesn't mean --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, all of those people 

are lawyers, and lawyers are known to read legal 

documents very precisely.  The average person may read 

them very differently. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Correct, and in this 

case --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sometimes, a little 

knowledge is a dangerous thing. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  Yes. 

And I do believe that, if this Court were to 

reverse, that would set a new floor for these forms and 

that there would be the danger of the fact that -- I 

mean, if -- if the Tampa public -- police department is

always changing its forms -- which they have shown to be 

the case -- they have changed these forms in the past --

why wouldn't other agencies decide to change their forms 

and make things more --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- you think 

it's a good thing, though, that they changed their forms 

to track the FBI form after -- after this litigation 

started. 

MS. BRUECKHEIMER:  I -- I -- yes.  I do 

believe that, when they changed the form to comply with 

the decision below and with what's going on in 97 

percent -- or 96 percent of the jurisdictions -- it 

doesn't have to be exact language; it just has to be 

there.  Then -- then the -- then the system runs 

beautifully. 

I can't tell you the last time I had a 

Miranda warning case, and I have been doing this for 

almost 30 years. 

There is no litigation when it's done 

correctly, and it's mostly done correctly. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Counsel, you have a minute remaining.

MR. JACQUOT:  Mr. Chief Justice, let me make 

three brief points, after responding to a question that 

Justice Stevens asked. 

In terms of independent and adequate State 

grounds, in our brief, we relied on the Florida court 

citing Miranda, the case, not Miranda, as the 

phraseology, that the Florida Supreme Court interwove 

the Federal law based on Miranda, the case itself, and 

there is no plain statement to the otherwise. 

Three quick points:  There is no 

manipulation behind this warning.  This warning is the 

result of litigation in Thompson v. State.  That was a 

1991 decision by the Florida Supreme Court. 

The -- the Tampa police had changed its 

warning.  The previous warning had 148 words.  This 

warning is simpler, with 79 words.  The previous warning 

had arcane and redundant language.  This language is 

more straightforward. 

Those are the reasons behind the change in 

the warning, not any kind of inference, as amici makes, 

towards manipulation. 

Second, what Respondent is asking for is 

exactly what this Court chose not to do in Prysock. 

It told the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
