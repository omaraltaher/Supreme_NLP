 Formality is indeed essential to testimonial 

utterance.  So said this Court in Davis, which dealt 

with two related situations:  On-the-scene questioning 

by police officers and questions by 9-1-1 operators. 

This Court noted that such questioning may often lack 

the formality essential to testimonial utterance, as 

officers called to investigate need to know whom they 

are dealing with in order to assess a situation, the 

threat to themselves, and the potential danger to 

possible victims.

 The question here is whether those same 

assessing questions -- what happened, who did it, where 

did it happen -- asked by police officers who, upon 

receiving a radio report of a man shot, found a wounded 

man lying on the ground next to a car at a gas station, 

bleeding, visibly in pain, and having trouble talking -­

were made in a formal context sufficiently similar to a 

magisterial examination so that the answers by the dying 

-- by the dying victim are testimonial. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it can't all 

be the formality of the context.  I mean, if the police 

came in and said, well, has this person -- Rick, I 

guess -- sold you drugs before, what was the -- what was 

the quantity, and all those sorts of questions, the 

answers to that would be testimonial, despite the same 

lack of formality. 

 MS. PALMER:  Which is where the ongoing 

emergency test from Davis comes into play.  The 

questions need to be -- the primary purpose needs to be 

to meet an ongoing emergency.  So assessing the risk, 

assessing the danger to others.  And any questions 

16 

beyond that could arguably be testimonial, while -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do we -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Forget about formality, in 

19 

other words.  Formality or no formality has nothing to 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

do with it. 

 MS. PALMER:  Well, under Davis, you said 

that was how you tested the formality.  If -- the Davis 

test is a gauge of formality.  If there are questions 

that respond to ongoing emergency, then this Court has 

said that that is an indicator that it lacks the

formality.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do we tell that? 

Because it seems to me, here, if you want to know what 

happened, you'd ask the very same questions.  You're 

saying the questions are relevant also to securing the 

situation.  But what -- what different questions would 

you ask if you wanted to find out what happened?  What 

was the past -- what were the past events? 

 I mean, I'm trying to understand how you 

take these questions and say we can put a label on them 

here that says, well, this is to control an emergency 

situation versus we want to know what happened 

historically. 

 MS. PALMER:  Well, I think that what you 

have to do is look at the -- I mean, obviously, things 

can have dual purposes and often will.  You need to look 

at the primary purpose here.  And you said in Davis it's 

an objective -- what would an objective person 

viewing this test -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But whose primary 

21 

purpose is it? 

22

23 

24 

25

 I mean, the victim here knew that the 

incident hadn't happened there.  There was nothing he 

had to share with the police, because they could see he 

was bleeding from his stomach and he had been shot.  He 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company

apparently didn't fear any threat, or there doesn't seem 

to be any circumstances suggesting an immediate threat 

to him.  He had driven away.  Rick didn't know where he 

had gone.

 So what's the ongoing emergency to the 

6 

victim? 

7

9 

10

11

12 

13 

14 

15

 MS. PALMER:  Well, I think here -- which is 

why in Davis you said is the primary purpose of the 

questioning, is what you look at in Davis.  And we're 

not asking you to overrule that. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, wait a minute. 

What is the primary -- isn't -- doesn't -- isn't there a 

footnote that says the primary purpose of the declarant 

is what is at issue?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is -- that is what it 

16 

says. 

17

18

 MS. PALMER:  What -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's the -- it's the -­

19 

it's the purpose of the declarant, not of the 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

questioner. 

 MS. PALMER:  But the formality indicators 

that the Court delineated in Davis did not include 

whether the answers to the questions were for the 

purpose of establishing past events, but whether the 

primary purpose of the questions were for those ends. 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 The -- the question is one of context, not 

2 

content, as you noticed in -- as you said in Crawford. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, in Davis, the 

4 

issue is why was the declarant talking?  What you were 

5

6 

7 

8

trying to do was to figure out whether the declarant was 

seeking help or attempting to get someone arrested. 

That's how I read the situation. 

 The questions provided context for that. 

9 

Are you seeking immediate ongoing help or are you 

10

talking about an event, attempting to get the police to 

11 

intercede and arrest the person? 

12

13

 Isn't that a fair reading of that case? 

 MS. PALMER:  Yes.  And in Davis, you said 

14 

also that there comes a point where courts can tell when 

15

the questioning takes on a different tone and the 

16 

answers might become testimonial.

 When the questioning seeks answers that go 

beyond meeting the emergency, then courts can properly 

find there's a point where the nontestimonial statements 

end and the testimonial statements -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  In a situation like this, do 

you think it's meaningful to ask what the primary 

purpose of the victim was when he responded to the 

police and said who shot him?

 You have a man who has just been shot.  He

has a wound that's going to turn out to be fatal, and 

he's lying there on the ground bleeding profusely, and 

he says:  My primary purpose in saying this is so that 

they can respond to an ongoing emergency.  No, but I 

also have the purpose of giving them information that 

could be used at trial, but it's a little less -- that's 

a little bit less my purpose than responding to the 

ongoing emergency. 

 It seems like it's totally artificial.

 MS. PALMER:  Yes.  And I think it -- any 

time you ask the courts to delve into the subjective 

intent of someone who is not present and cannot testify 

and cannot tell you, it necessarily complicates things. 

And I think it would -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What possible response to 

an ongoing emergency could he have had in mind?  What 

possible response to an ongoing emergency? 

 MS. PALMER:  He did ask for EMS -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He was bleeding to death, 

and he could have said, you know, I'm bleeding to death. 

Now, that statement would -- would be, you know, 

suggesting an ongoing emergency. 

 But giving the name of the person who shot 

24 

him, where he was shot, what does that have anything -­

25

how does that have anything to do with an ongoing

emergency?

 MS. PALMER:  Well, the police, upon 

responding to the scene, don't know that this emergency 

is limited -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But he does. 

 MS. PALMER:  -- to that person. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But he does. 

 MS. PALMER:  Which is why you have to look 

9 

at the entire context.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He knows -- he knows that 

his -- that the person that shot him is nowhere near 

there.  He knows that -- that he drove, what -- how far 

away was it?  Six blocks or -- a good distance from 

where the shooter was.  He knows all of that.

 The only reason he could be giving the name 

of the person who shot him is so that person could be 

apprehended and punished. 

 MS. PALMER:  And yet that subjective mindset 

19 

doesn't affect the formality.  It doesn't change the 

20

fact that this is an informal situation.  You don't have

then the prosecutor says, I want to introduce this 

evidence against Bryant.  Would you say that, yes, it's 

nontestimonial, so it comes in? 

 MS. PALMER:  He would have to be unavailable 

for it to come in. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why, if it's 

7 

nontestimonial? 

8

 MS. PALMER:  Well, under -- the way the 

9 

current jurisprudence is, he would have to be 

10

unavailable.  If it's not testimonial, I do not think it 

11 

would offend the Confrontation Clause for it to come in.

emergency situations.  So I'm saying:  Would that carry 

over to the man survives and the prosecutor says, I 

don't need to put him on the stand so he can be 

cross-examined; I've got nontestimonial evidence that I 

can put in? 

 Would it become testimonial, then, if he 

survived? 

 MS. PALMER:  No, I don't think it would 

change the nature of what happened at the time.  I do 

think, though, that is why we have said the 

Confrontation Clause is not some sort of super-hearsay 

rule and that we will allow the Government -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then -- then your 

answer is that if we typed it as nontestimonial in my 

trial scenario, it would be nontestimonial; it comes in. 

 MS. PALMER:  As long as it was not somehow 

barred by the rules of hearsay, which I believe it would 

6 

be.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm confused of 

what -- what Davis focuses our inquiry on.  Is it the 

purpose of the interrogators or is it the purpose of the 

declarants? 

 We say the statements are testimonial when 

the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no 

such ongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of 

the interrogation is to establish or prove past events. 

The -- the focus seems to be on the purpose of the 

interrogation, which seems to be the question of what 

the police thought, not what the -- the person dying 

thought. 

 MS. PALMER:  That's correct.  And I 

understand there is the footnote stating that, 

obviously, the declarant's statements are at issue.  If 

there were no declarant, then -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, I mean -­

 MS. PALMER:  -- there wouldn't be an issue.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what the

12 

13

footnote -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what the 

footnote says is, in the final analysis, it's the 

declarant's statements, not the interrogator's question, 

that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.

 So which -- I guess, which is it? 

 MS. PALMER:  Well, I think what happens is 

the -- the interrogator's statements are not what are 

going to be determined to be testimonial or 

nontestimonial.  They provide a glimpse into the context 

so we can determine whether those statements that are at 

issue are testimonial or nontestimonial.  They are one 

way to determine the formality of the situation. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  One way to evaluate those 

14 

statements is what they are made in response to.  If 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22

23 

24 

25

they are made in response to a certain type of police 

inquiry, they are more likely to be testimonial.  And 

another kind -- you know, are you dying?  They are more 

likely not to be testimonial.  But it is ultimately the 

statements that -- that we have to evaluate, whether 

they are testimonial or not. 

 MS. PALMER:  Correct.  But as -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then, how does 

that apply?  The officer says, what happened?  And 

the -- the declarant says, Rick shot me.

 Now, is that testimonial or not?  Because 

12

the declarant knows he's 6 miles away.  It's not going 

to help them solve an emergency, but the police don't 

know that. 

 MS. PALMER:  Right, which is why I think you 

look at the purpose of the questioning -- here, to 

respond to an ongoing emergency.  The police don't 

know -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if it was an

 MS. PALMER:  I don't -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  To ask what happened is to 

ask the declarant to describe past events, which is 

testimonial.

 MS. PALMER:  I don't think that you can make 

that kind of bright-line rule.  I think here when you 

have a man bleeding out on a sidewalk and you don't 

know -- is there an assailant behind him; is there -­

are there victims somewhere else; is, you know, this a 

wanted felon -- I think there is an ongoing emergency

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you -- you do not know

 MS. PALMER:  Right.  But -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you can -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if you're worried about 

that, do you run immediately over to the person lying on 

the ground or do you examine the gas station first, 

rather than expose yourself to the -- to the shooter 

that you think is still in the gas station? 

 The -- the behavior of the police here gave 

no indication that they thought they were in danger 

immediately and were interrogating this person in order 

to assess the danger to them.  That wasn't what they 

were after. 

 MS. PALMER:  Well, to be fair, this was 

before Crawford was answered.  The questions were asked 

were to determine whether this was an excited utterance, 

and the questions that we would like to know now were: 

What did you do for your safety?  How were you worried? 

What were -- that was not at issue, and that was not 

asked. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm not -- I'm not 

sure that policemen should read Crawford before they 

perform their -- their peacekeeping duties.  The -­

no -- no one questions the right of the police to -- to 

ask these questions and to use the word either "happens" 

14

or "happening" or "happened." 

Official

5

 The question is whether the -- the answers 

are later admissible.  Those are two different 

inquiries.

 MS. PALMER:  Correct.  And I was simply 

6 

saying the record would have been available to check -­

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And, of course, Crawford 

8 

rejects reliability as a criteria. 

9

10

 MS. PALMER:  Yes.  So our position here 

simply is that you cannot evaluate an ongoing emergency 

11 

from hindsight. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 When police -- you know, arrive on a scene 

and find a wounded man bleeding, they don't know the 

circumstances until they can find out what happened, who 

did it, and where did it happen, and try to assess the 

risk of harm, as you said in Davis, to themselves, to 

the victim, and to others. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But what does that have 

19 

to do -- we're back to the reliability test, really, 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

because they didn't do anything wrong.  They were trying 

to assess the situation.  But that's what they do when 

any report of criminal activity occurs.  That's a 

different inquiry than the inquiry of why should that 

statement be permitted to be introduced at trial?

 It goes to the very essence of reliability.

Was the statement made under circumstances that would 

suggest an intent to testify?  That's really what you're 

getting at, isn't it? 

 MS. PALMER:  No.  No.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you are, because 

you're trying to pigeonhole yourself into an ongoing 

emergency that suggests that in those situations, 

whatever the person is saying is okay because it was 

done to assess an emergency situation and not done for 

10

purposes of catching somebody, primary purpose of 

11 

catching somebody.

 MS. PALMER:  Which is what this Court said 

in Davis, and said that that was not related to 

reliability but to formality there, and that that was 

not a formal thing akin to magisterial examinations. 

 We're not trying to question or in any way 

change the test already set forth by this Court in 

Davis.  We agree with that test.  We simply disagree 

with the application by the lower court of that test 

here and the limitation it put on it. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So are you saying that 

the rule would be that whenever the perpetrator may be 

in the vicinity, then the police are pursuing an urgent 

emergency situation, rather than trying to find out what 

had -- the nature of the crime?

 MS. PALMER:  We're not saying that any time 

there is a perpetrator at large, there is automatically 

an ongoing emergency until that person is caught. 

 What we are saying is that preliminary 

inquiries on the scene to try to determine who the 

perpetrator is and where it might be would be -- would 

be nontestimonial -­

What kinds of crimes would qualify? 

 MS. PALMER:  I think, obviously, violent 

crimes raise ongoing emergencies, emergencies to 

which -- more than others.  There could also be contexts 

in which it would apply to other crimes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So at least whenever the 

police come upon somebody who has been the victim of a 

violent crime, whatever interrogation they conduct could 

plausibly be to -- to make sure that the person is not 

still nearby, and that testimony will always be 

admissible? 

 MS. PALMER:  It is preliminary questions 

designed to assess the risk to themselves, the public, 

and -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no, no.

 MS. PALMER:  So, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Strike "designed to assess 

the risk."  You don't know what they're designed to do. 

These policemen didn't say we're assessing the risk. 

They just asked the questions.  And that's what is going 

to happen in future cases. 

 And you're saying, whenever policemen come 

upon a victim of violent crime and said who did it, 

what's his name, all of that will always be admissible 

because they -- they could be assessing the risk, right?

 MS. PALMER:  I think if the context shows 

that's the primary purpose, then, yes, that will often 

be the case. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you mean?  How 

14 

could it possibly be admissible?

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

 First, there has to be a degree of 

formality, as the Court held in Hammon, sitting in the 

kitchen; and, second, it has to satisfy State hearsay 

tests.  So unless it's an exception to the hearsay rule, 

it is not admissible.

 MS. PALMER:  Well, here, for instance, it 

21 

was admitted as excited utterance. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, of course, there are 

exceptions.  There could, in fact, there could be a 

co-conspirator exception.  There could be a dying 

declaration exception.  But what we're talking about is

whether the Constitution keeps it out, even though State 

law -- because, say, it's a co-conspirator exception -­

would permit it in. 

 So the answer is no, it's not the case that 

whenever you come across a victim of a crime and ask him 

questions, it's going to be admissible.  It depends. 

The State hearsay law, the exception, and whether 

there's a degree of formality, as there was in Hammon. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Only when he's excited, 

right?  Only when the victim who has been the object of 

11 

a violent crime is excited.

 Or if State law doesn't apply and we're 

dealing with a Federal crime and Federal officers, 

right, and trial in Federal court?  And in that case, 

what Justice Breyer just said would not apply. 

 MS. PALMER:  That's correct.  And I -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It would not apply?  There 

are -- there isn't a Federal hearsay rule?  And there 

are not exceptions that you have to satisfy?

 MS. PALMER:  Your -- I -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought there were, in my 

22 

copy of the Federal Rules of Evidence. 

23

 MS. PALMER:  Yes.  And I did misspeak.  What 

24 

I meant to say was that it would be nontestimonial, not 

25

that it would always be admissible.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER, 

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

 MS. KRUGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 As we understand the rule of 

Davis v. Washington, it is a rule that focuses on the 

primary purpose behind police interrogation, because 

it's designed for a particular purpose:  Not to provide 

a comprehensive definition of the term "testimonial," 

but rather to identify those statements that are 

testimonial because they are made in response to police 

interrogation. 

 When the objective primary purpose of that 

interrogation is to enable police to meet an ongoing

emergency, rather than to collect evidence for future 

possible prosecution, the statements that are given in 

response to that interrogation are nontestimonial.  That 

was -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you distinguish between 

collecting evidence for a future prosecution and 

collecting evidence in order to pursue and arrest the 

felon?  Do you distinguish those two? 

 And you can say these police -- these 

policemen weren't collecting evidence for a future 

prosecution; they just wanted to know who the shooter 

was and where he was so they could go get him.  Would 

that -­

 MS. KRUGER:  Well, I think that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you say it has to be 

for the purpose of a future prosecution.  Just -- just 

in order to an arrest and bring into jail the person who 

committed this crime, that doesn't qualify? 

 MS. KRUGER:  I think that what would qualify 

under the Davis test is if police need to apprehend the

person, not for purposes of bringing the person into the 

criminal justice system, but rather to neutralize an 

ongoing threat that they present to the community at 

large, as is often the case when somebody has just 

proven themselves both capable and -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  When does that not exist in

about a -- an act of violence like a shooting, somebody 

who has used a weapon that's capable of inflicting 

deadly harm on multiple victims in a short period of 

time, or someone who has used their fists, like the 

alleged perpetrators -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So if you use a gun, 

a knife, or a machine gun, whatever the victim says gets 

admitted into evidence, because the police could -­

could be not -­

fatally.

12 

situation -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who did it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's always the case. 

That's such a phony evasion of what the purpose of the 

testimonial rule is.  That's always going to be the 

case, at least when there's a violent crime. 

 MS. KRUGER:  Well, I think -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you may as well take 

Crawford and throw it out, in -- in the majority of 

serious cases, if that's going to be your rule.

 MS. KRUGER:  I don't think that that's the 

23

case at all, Justice Scalia.  I think it's actually very 

much consistent with what this Court said in Davis. 

 It may very well have been that the 

4 

subjective purpose of the 9-1-1 operator was also to 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

bring the perpetrator in that case to justice.  But this 

Court, I think quite properly, recognized that in an 

emergency situation, the attention of both law 

enforcement and the declarant is quite properly going to 

be focused on dealing with the emergency at hand and is 

10

not going to be made of the kind of focused 

11 

understanding of -­

12

13 

14 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The crime was ongoing in -­

in Davis when -- when the woman was on the phone with 

the operator.  It was ongoing.  She was seeking help 

from the emergency that was occurring to her at that 

16 

moment.  There's nothing like that here.

 MS. KRUGER:  It's true that that is a 

factual distinction between this case and Davis, but we 

don't think that it's one that makes a dispositive legal 

difference. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did the police know that 

that was the case when they began the questioning?  Did 

the police know that this man was not on a rampage, that 

he was not going to act in self-defense when they came 

after him?

 MS. KRUGER:  That's correct.  They had no 

way of knowing that.  And neither, for that matter -- I 

think it's important to emphasize -- did the declarant. 

The fact that he was able to escape the scene and 

managed to drive himself six blocks away in no way 

indicates that he had any -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Will they ever know that? 

 MS. KRUGER:  I -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, is that -- is that 

14 

likely not always to be the case when -- when you come 

15

upon a person who has been the -- the victim of a 

16 

violent crime? 

17

20

21

22

25

 You could say it all the time.  No, they 

didn't know where the -- where the offender was, so 

whatever this person says comes in as evidence in a 

trial. 

 MS. KRUGER:  Well, I think it's important to 

emphasize that what we're arguing for is not a rule that 

would say, as long as there's a violent perpetrator at 

large, as long as he is at large, any questions that 

police ask of -- of potential people who have 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

information about the crime will necessarily be 

nontestimonial.

articulated in Davis, which is when the primary purpose 

of a police interrogation is to obtain information 

that's necessary to enable them to meet an ongoing 

emergency -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, how do you know 

that?  Because they would ask the same very questions if 

what they wanted was testimonial evidence.  So you 

can -- you can characterize that set of questions either 

way.  What would lead us to pick one rather than the 

other?

 MS. KRUGER:  I think it's actually not the 

case, Justice Ginsburg, that they would have asked the 

very same questions.  We know from reading the trial 

testimony that the officers, as they appeared on the 

scene in response to the police run of a man being shot, 

asked the same question over and over again.  Each 

officer, as they approached him, said:  What happened? 

Where did it happen?  And wanted to know how to 

recognize the shooter so when they proceeded to the 

scene, they would know who they were dealing with and 

how to safeguard themselves.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's say that we -- let's 

say that we agree with you that there was an emergency 

and the police were asking questions in order to 

mitigate the emergency. 

 What would be the rationale for admitting 

9 

this statement, then?  Is it more reliable?  Because if 

10

we say that, then we're undercutting Crawford, which 

11 

says reliability is not the key. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 What is the reason for that?  Is it because 

the police likely have less motive to manipulate the -­

the statements and to ask loaded questions?  That in 

itself, it seems to me, is a reliable -- but what's 

the -- assuming we adopt your distinction, what's the 

rationale for the distinction? 

 MS. KRUGER:  We think that the principle 

19 

that this Court announced in Davis and we're asking the 

20

21 

22 

23

Court to apply again today reflects two principles that 

underlie the Confrontation Clause as this Court 

interpreted in Crawford. 

 The first is that testimony is typically 

24 

characterized by the kind of focused understanding by 

25

the declarant that the person is providing information

for potential use in a future prosecution.  It's -- the 

petitioner in Davis, I would note, made an argument to 

this Court that whenever a person calls 9-1-1, they do 

so with an awareness that the information they provide 

may be used for prosecutorial purposes. 

 But this Court rejected that argument, 

because it understood, I think quite rightly, that 

there's a difference between providing that sort of 

information to law enforcement with a sort of vague 

awareness that that might be its potential use, and 

doing so with a kind of focused understanding that has 

been characteristic of the testimonial statements this 

Court has so far identified, like Sylvia Crawford's 

stationhouse interview in Crawford or Amy Hammon's 

interview with the police officer from the safety of her 

kitchen that resulted in the execution of a formal 

affidavit in the Davis case. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we look to the 

19 

specific situation?  I mean, one of the officers zeroed 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

in on the victim.  No one was looking around to see if 

anybody was lurking in the bushes.  Then, as far as 

protecting the public, do we take into account that this 

was between 3:30 and 4:00 in the morning when there are 

not likely to be many members of the public around?  Or 

do we just say you find someone who looks like he has

been the victim of a violent crime, doesn't matter 

whether the public is around or not, we -- that's 

enough, the victim of a violent crime can be asked these 

questions?

 MS. KRUGER:  To take your first question 

first, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the trial 

testimony is not quite as clear on the question of what 

fears the officers had as I think Respondent has 

suggested in his brief.  If you look at Joint Appendix 

page 136, Officer Stuglin testified that he was, in 

fact, afraid for his safety when he got to the gas 

station.  I would note that all of the officers, when 

they left the gas station after EMS arrived, they 

proceeded immediately to the location of the shooting, 

the location that Anthony Covington had identified for 

them.  When they got there, they took a tactical 

position, they waited for back-up, and they did so 

because they were afraid that a shooter was in the 

house, and they wanted to proceed very cautiously in 

making sure that they neutralized the threat that 

21 

shooter posed to the public safety, including their own. 

22

23 

24 

25

 I think that in examining the exigencies of 

a situation a court would be justified in looking at the 

circumstances in which the crime occurred, and could 

very well take into account the fact that the crime 

29

3

occurred at 3 o'clock in the morning as opposed to 5 

o'clock in the afternoon.  But I think that we would 

expect any reasonable police officer to do precisely 

what the police officers in this case did, which was 

proceed directly to the scene, not use their interview 

with Anthony Covington as an occasion to execute an 

affidavit or otherwise engage -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but then you're

saying that the focus is on the police officers.  I

mean, after all, we're not saying that police officers 

can't do this; we're just saying the testimonial aspects 

can't be admitted into evidence or that's what your 

friend is arguing for.  I still have trouble figuring 

out is the issue the purpose of the interrogating 

officers or the purpose and intent of the declarant? 

 MS. KRUGER:  I think that the test that the 

Court set out in Davis is one that focuses on the 

purpose of the interrogation because of the limited 

context in which that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  And what do 

you do with the last sentence of footnote 1.  It's the 

one that says -­

 MS. KRUGER:  In the end it's the declarant's

statement that the Confrontation Clause requires us to 

25

examine. 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right, right. 

 MS. KRUGER:  We read footnote 1 to be an 

acknowledgement that answers given in response to police 

interrogation do not constitute the universe of possible 

testimonial statements, that testimony can indeed be 

volunteered as was Lord Cobham's letter, for example, in 

Sir Walter Raleigh's treason case.  But in the end 

Davis, I think, quite properly focuses on the primary 

purpose of the interrogation.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER JON VAN HOEK 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 When Anthony Covington made his statement to 

the officers at the gas station, not just once but 

several times, he reasonably understood that he was 

providing the police information as to events which had 

concluded a half hour earlier at a location six blocks 

away, with an understanding that that information would 

assist the police in locating, apprehending, and 

potentially prosecuting the person he felt was 

responsible for his injury.

likelihood that, like Sir Walter Raleigh or Cobham's 

affidavit, it is going to be introduced per se into the 

trial as a form of evidence that there was -- why would 

we want to keep it out?  That's the part that I do not

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Okay.  The reason, Your 

Honor, that the Confrontation Clause is the 

fundamental -- part of the fundamental law of the 

country, and what this Court, I believe, decided in 

Crawford and then applied to those situations -- similar 

situations in Davis and Hammon, is that where you have a 

statement from a witness to a police officer as part of 

a questioning and that statement is the functional 

equivalent of testimony that witness would have given 

had he or she appeared at trial and been subject to 

cross-examination, then the admission of that statement 

at trial even under a hearsay exception without 

cross-examination effectively allows the police to 

present -­

mean that the individual is thinking this may be used -­

there's a certain formality to the situation; it may be 

used at trial?  Or it may just happen to turn out?  I 

mean, what is the relevance of the formality of the 

situation?  When I looked into history I thought -- I'm 

not an expert in history, and I'm also -- I understand 

there have been situations where the Court's gone back 

to prior cases and looked at footnotes and said it 

doesn't express things precisely clearly and changed it 

a little bit.  I think that that goal could be open to 

us. 

 So I want to know what the basic reason is 

that there -- that would justify keeping out, let's say, 

an investigation.  There's an investigation of a crime, 

and a policeman comes across a confederate who makes 

some statements just generally that help the 

investigation; therefore, it would come in under -- as 

co-conspiracy, okay? 

 What in the Constitution, what functional 

19 

principle, is there that says we should keep that out of

Court said in Crawford and Davis is that is the primary 

test.  That is what our Constitution requires to allow 

the reliability, the believability, the trustworthiness 

of that evidence to be evaluated by a jury.  We don't

that.  What is the constitutional rationale?  I joined 

Crawford, but I have to admit to you I've had many 

second thoughts when I've seen how far it has extended 

as I have written it.

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Well, I would have to say the 

constitutional justification for that is the reason why 

the right of confrontation is, isn't it, in the 

Constitution, where you had a situation in English 

common law, as we said, where magistrates were allowed 

to go out, interview witnesses, come into court, and

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So now you've just got what 

I'm looking for.  What I'm looking for is I can go into 

Blackstone a little bit and look back and see what this 

was after, was the problem of Sir Walter Raleigh's trial 

and the Marian judges.  And now what I need is a line. 

Because if I can't find a line, then what we've done, 

which seems just as wrong to me, is suddenly bar 

virtually all hearsay exception evidence, of which for 

400 years, or 200 years anyway, there has been quite a 

lot in the courts. 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  I certainly don't think 

Crawford and Davis bars all hearsay exception -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What, in your view, is the 

17 

correct line and why, most importantly why? 

18

 MR. VAN HOEK:  I believe this Court in

situation like this where it is the response of a 

citizen to questions from a police officer, that you 

look primarily, as footnote 1 indicates, to the content 

of that statement.  If that's -­

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Well, this Court certainly 

has suggested that in Giles, that a dying declaration 

might be an exception to Crawford as an exception that 

existed at the time of the framing.  We don't have to 

deal with that question in this case because this is not 

a dying declaration. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why not? 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I understand -- I understand 

that, but assume -- assume for the sake of argument that 

it would be consistent with Crawford if it were a dying 

declaration, which the Court has suggested.  What does 

that tell you about the understanding of the scope of 

the confrontation right at the time when the Sixth 

Amendment was adopted?  Because a dying declaration may 

very well be testimonial under -- is likely to be 

testimonial under the Crawford test. 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Yes.  And I think that the 

19 

dying -- maybe the dying declaration as being in that 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

situation is an indication.  What's different about 

dying declaration from all these other hearsay 

exceptions is that, at the point the statement was made, 

it's an understanding that that witness is never goint 

-- will not be testifying, that there -- that there is 

no potential that that witness will appear in court in

person.  There's -- the police officers in any of these 

situations speaking to a witness -- when a police 

officer arrives at the scene they have no way of knowing 

what's going to occur months later at trial.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought -- I thought the 

rationale for dying declaration admissions was that they 

are inherent reliable -- inherently reliable.  You can 

certainly question that.  But I thought that that was 

the rationale that the courts gave.

 MR. VAN HOEK:  I think that's correct. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On your death bed before 

you're going to meet the maker, you're not going to 

lie -- I think that was the test.  So it was a 

reliability component, correct?

 MR. VAN HOEK:  That's true.  And I think 

that's -- that's also the -- the background of most 

hearsay exceptions is that for the circumstances that 

there's some degree of inherent reliability to that 

statement which excuses the absence of cross-examination 

if the witness is unavailable.  But -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, suppose that there is 

a universe of instances that we can identify as 

questions in order to alleviate and stop an emergency to 

prevent a crime from becoming aggravated and continuous. 

Let's suppose we can have a universe of those questions. 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is -- is there an argument 

that responses made for that purpose are more reliable? 

Is that what -- is that what underlies the so-called 

emergency exception, do you think? 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  I don't believe so.  I don't 

believe that -- that a -- a statement by a witness that 

is a narrative of past events -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it -- so -- well -­

and, of course, Davis certainly does not rest on 

reliability -- or Crawford, rather, doesn't rest on 

reliability. 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  No. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But isn't that really the 

only way to explain the 911 exception?

component that underlies this whether we like it or not?

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. VAN HOEK:  I don't believe so.  I don't 

think that the fact that someone calls 911 and makes a 

report, whether they're talking about an ongoing 

situation or reporting a past event, makes that somehow 

inherently more reliable than if they used another 

medium.

 I think the distinction made in Davis is 

that the beginning of the 911 call that Ms. McCottry was 

making to the case was not relating past events.  It was 

a declaration of emergency.  It was a call for immediate 

assistance. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But isn't -- isn't the 

reason we accept that is because it's reliable?  It's an 

excited utterance.  It's an account of an ongoing event. 

It's a contemporaneous observation.  Therefore, it is 

reliable. 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  I don't -- no, I don't think 

that was the basis on which this Court held it was 

nontestimonial.  I think this Court held it was 

nontestimonial because it was not what a witness does 

during a trial.  It was -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's go back to this 

17 

case. 

18

19

20

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Excited utterance was -­

the prosecutor thought that was his best shot, and he -­

21 

and he prevailed, except that the -- Davis intervened. 

22

23 

24 

25

 I asked Ms. Palmer, suppose we were back 

there at the trial and the prosecutor knew that excited 

utterance wouldn't work.  Could he have raised dying 

declaration?  She said absolutely yes. 

40

 So my question to you is:  Just assume that 

we should hold the Confrontation Clause is applicable. 

Shouldn't the prosecutor then have a chance to say, 

well, if I realized that, I could have made a dying 

declaration plea here.  So it would only be fair to 

allow the prosecutor to try to establish that this 

testimony was a dying declaration? 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Well, in -- in this case, 

9

evidence, at the preliminary exam, when it met a hearsay 

objection, the prosecutor at that point argued that it 

was admissible under Michigan evidence rules as either 

an excited utterance and/or a dying declaration. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then she did argue dying 

declaration. 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Well, they argued dying 

declaration.  The judge sustained the objection and said 

he had not established the foundation for either one of 

those.  The prosecutor at that point established a 

foundation solely for excited utterance.  The judge 

ruled the evidence admissible and specifically said 

admissible only as excited utterance. 

 At that point, the prosecution abandoned any 

24 

attempt, throughout the State court proceedings, to say 

25

this was a dying declaration.

to the prior question to say that I conceded that, I'm 

not saying that.  I'm saying when I was first asked the 

question about dying declaration, I pointed out that 

this Court in Giles indicated that that may be an 

exception to the Confrontation Clause.  And I agree -­

the -- that the purpose of the killing was to get rid of 

the witness's testimony.  Giles made the statement maybe 

dying declaration is an -- is an exception to our 

Crawford's jurisprudence. 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Yes.  And as you said, this 

Court has not reached that question directly, and -- and 

there's no need to reach that question in this case 

because this is not a dying declaration case. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it hasn't been reached, 

24 

if it is not an established exception to the 

25

Confrontation Clause, there is no basis for saying,

therefore, the Confrontation Clause pertains only to

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can there be a situation in 

which the primary purpose for a statement or for the 

question that elicits the statement is to respond to an 

ongoing emergency rather than to gather evidence for 

subsequent use in a legal proceeding when the statement 

relates to something that has occurred, perhaps just a 

few seconds before, but it relates to something that has 

44

here who is coming to threaten you or threaten other 

people?  They may be able to get some background 

information to put that in context, but we don't have 

anything like that in this case. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand, but we 

need to know where to draw the line.  So, you concede 

that the line is not between a statement about he's 

hitting me with a baseball bat as opposed to he just 

finished hitting me with a baseball bat and is headed

drawn if those were the only statements, he's hitting me 

with a baseball bat versus he -- he just hit me with a 

baseball bat and he just left.  I think the line is 

clearly drawn in Davis between -- the hitting me with a 

baseball bat would be nontestimonial -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, no.  I really would like 

24 

a clear answer to this.  Is -- can there be an ongoing 

25

emergency where the statement relates -- where the 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company

statement recounts something that has occurred, not

5

11

any current, ongoing, imminent danger, if the witness

events, then it's not a showing of -- of an ongoing 

emergency. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what do you do -­

what do you do with the statement the guy in the gas 

station shot me?  Is that purely past, or is that an 

ongoing emergency? 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  That statement standing

now in the gas station.  That is a statement of a

declaring some type of emergency, some sort of imminent 

harm and requesting the police to render assistance to 

alleviate that, to protect him -- him or her. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose they get a 

9-1-1 call.  There's -- a man has just been shot on the 

corner of Fifth and Main.  They go to Fifth and Main; 

they find a man there; he's shot; he's bleeding 

profusely; he's in shock; and they know nothing more 

about what's happened.  And they say, well, what 

happened?  Well, he shot me.  Who shot you?  It's John

a shooting spree; this is just the first of numerous 

victims.  Maybe it's a gang fight.  He's shot one member 

of an opposing gang; now he's going to go shoot another 

member of an opposing gang. 

 How can they -- how can you answer that 

question, what's the primary purpose there?  I just 

don't understand it. 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Well, I would think -- in 

that situation, nothing about the Davis rule, nothing 

about the Confrontation Clause precludes the police from 

taking that information and asking those further 

questions -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you -- you were the 

one that drew the line between a past event and an 

ongoing event.  Suppose the sniper says, I've shot you 

now, and I'm going to shoot three other students, 

good-bye.  That's a past event.

the verge of shooting other people because he just shot 

someone, I would say that's certainly a declaration of 

an emergency and certainly would be nontestimonial under 

the -- under the test of Davis.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any -- I'll try 

this -- I think you're just -- you don't like my -­

where I'm coming from, but -- and so you might not have 

an answer to this. 

 But -- but in my mind, I see a line, and 

that line is dividing what I think of as the 

Confrontation Clause, Sir Walter Raleigh situation, 

which I have in my mind as people going into a room and 

saying, now write out your testimony, and they write it 

out in the form of an affidavit, or they send in a 

letter, and they say "bye," and then they walk next door 

to the trial and introduce it.  I mean, that's Walter 

Raleigh, in my mind. 

 And then, on the other side of the line, is 

19 

an -- evidentiary rules that are basically in State 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

cases run by the State.  And they sometimes let hearsay 

in, and they sometimes don't, and they make reliability, 

et cetera, judgments in developing their -- their 

decision as to how hearsay exceptions will work.  Okay? 

 Now, why don't I like emergency to draw 

that?  The reason I don't like the word "emergency" is I 

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

think police do lots of things other than handle 

emergency and develop testimony. 

 There's a range of things that you would 

4 

describe as investigating the circumstance.  There's no 

5

6 

7

11 

12 

13

danger.  There have been a string of robberies.  They go 

around and ask the grocery store people and everything 

what happened.  Now, I don't know why we should keep out 

evidence that, say, is given in that situation by a 

confederate.  It turns out he was the assistant -- why?

 And if I don't like that, I don't like the 

emergency rule as doing the -- as doing the work there, 

and I'm looking for something else. 

 Now, you have my whole train of thought.  If 

14 

you want to say, Judge, there is nothing but the 

15

emergency rule, you are perfectly free to say it.

when -- when the police are investigating a reported 

crime and getting statements from witnesses, whether the 

victim or another witness -­

arrest someone and see what the situation is.  And 

they're getting narratives of past events from 

witnesses, and they're acting on that.  And nothing 

about this rule prevents them from doing that. 

 But the admissibility -- for them to be able 

to come into court, and they alone to come into court, 

and say this is what this witness told me and this is 

what this witness told me and this is what this witness 

told me -- and by the way, defense counsel, those 

witnesses aren't going to be here today, and you're not 

going to be able to ask them what they meant by that or

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes, but in the past 

that situation you are describing arose only where there 

was a hearsay exception.  I would imagine most likely it 

would be the case of a confederate, someone who was part 

of the conspiracy.  So if I think if that's going to be 

the case, that probably will be admissible where this 

has bite.

was about 25 years old or so when Crawford was decided, 

yes, hearsay was your protection, and that was it.  But 

if by what you mean is in the past, Crawford examined 

the past, and its conclusion as to what the past said is 

quite different from what Justice Breyer now says, 

although he joined Crawford. 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Yes.  I -- and as you said, 

in Crawford this Court looked at that and thought that 

the protections of the hearsay rule, and the focus under 

the Roberts standard of whether a statement fell within 

a firmly established hearsay rule, was not sufficient 

under the Constitution, under the Confrontation Clause, 

to -- to alleviate the fact that there -- there's no 

cross-examination. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Many -- I mean, like many 

cases there is language that takes -- that can take us

far afield from the subject matter before us.  And I 

will admit that I did not foresee the scope of Crawford. 

So I'm really asking about that scope and, in 

particular, whether, looking to the past or to reason or 

to whatever you want, there is a good reason for keeping 

out the testimony of, say, a co-confederate, a 

co-conspirator, where it was elicited, not with intent 

to introduce it into the courtroom, but it was elicited 

in the course of an ordinary investigation of a crime.

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Well, I'd have to go back to 

my answer that the Confrontation Clause is the primary 

law of the country, not State hearsay evidentiary rules. 

Many of the examples -- the co-conspirator -- the 

co-conspirator exception is not going to be applicable 

in many cases because those statements aren't made to 

police officers; they're made between co-conspirators in 

the course of a conspiracy.  That's the foundational 

requirement. 

 It's not going to eliminate hearsay rules. 

Statements made to private citizens, statements made in 

a lot of different circumstances are still going to be 

evaluated solely under hearsay rules because they're not 

going to be defined as testimonial, because they're not 

the product of police -- police questioning.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm still trying to 

54
 

Alderson Reporting Company

understand your conception of the scope of the ongoing 

emergency doctrine.  Would it be fair to say that your 

idea is that the police have to have specific evidence 

that there is an immediate threat of physical violence 

that they want -- they need to respond to, in order for 

6 

the ongoing emergency doctrine to apply? 

7

8

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Yes.  Yes.  They have to -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And in a case of doubt, they 

9 

can't do it.  So if they don't know whether there is an 

10

immediate threat or not an immediate threat, then that 

11 

doesn't fall within that exception.  That's your idea? 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 MR. VAN HOEK:  My position is that where the 

witness has not provided any information to the police 

indicating that there's an immediate threat, either 

volunteered to the police or in response to questions 

from the police saying is there a threat?  Where -- in 

this case, no questions were asked, where is Rick? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, they can always do 

19 

it.  You -- you don't say they can't do it.

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. VAN HOEK:  No, not at all. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They can always ask the 

questions.  The only issue here is not whether they can 

ask the questions, but whether, after they ask them, the 

answers can be introduced at trial.

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Yes, and if the answers -- no

matter what questions they asked, if the answers all are 

a narrative of past events, then that qualifies as 

testimonial because it is the -- the equivalent -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought you just said that 

wasn't the test, past versus present.  Didn't you say 

that about 10 minutes ago -- it's not the difference 

between something that's taking place and something that 

has taken place? 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  No.  No.  I think my answer 

was that -- that if the witness is declaring an 

11 

emergency and telling the police that there is a -­

12

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The witness has to say there 

13 

is an emergency?

go and they find two students lying on the ground.  One 

is dead, and the other is severely wounded.  And they 

ask the one who is wounded:  Who did it?  It's John 

Jones. 

 Now, does that -- is that an ongoing

point of the police officer asking him:  Is John Jones 

here?  Is he threatening you?  Do you know where he is 

right now?  Do you know what he is intending to do?  And 

the answers are:  Yes, he has a gun.  He's right over 

there.  He's going to shoot someone else.  He said he 

was going to shoot someone else.

 That's different.

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Well, certainly if the police 

come on the scene and there's multiple students who have 

been shot, you would think that if their primary 

purpose -- if the primary purpose, if you take that as a 

test, that their primary purpose of questioning the 

witness is to determine whether there's an emergency, 

they're going to ask those questions. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would they ask his name? 

9 

God, it's really important for us to know, four students

 MR. VAN HOEK:  No. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They'd say:  Where is he?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Of course that -- of course 

that's the emergency because how are they going to find 

the person that they -- that they're looking for if they 

don't know who it is?  What if he's thrown away his gun? 

Of course, if they come upon him and he has his gun in 

his hand, then it's not a question.  Bu what if he has 

disposed of it?  They have to know who to -- who to go 

for. 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  And they can ask all of those 

24 

questions.  As Justice Scalia said, there's nothing in

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But I still -- I'm totally 

puzzled now as to what you -- when you think there's an 

ongoing emergency and when there isn't.

 MR. VAN HOEK:  I think there's an ongoing 

emergency -- that a statement relates -- would become 

nontestimonial relating to an ongoing emergency when 

there's some indication from the statement made by the 

witness that such -- that there's some immediacy. 

There's some request for assistance -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It has to be made by the -­

by the declarant?  It can't be inferred from the 

circumstances? 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  No, I don't think just from 

the circumstances, because if you -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, sure it can.  If 

he says the principal did it.  It's -- it's 10 o'clock 

in the morning; you assume the principal is at the 

school; and he says the principal did it.  You can infer 

from the circumstances that he's referring to an ongoing 

21 

emergency. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. VAN HOEK:  I don't -- I don't agree.  I 

don't agree because if that's the case, any report -- as 

Justice Scalia I think said previously, any report of a 

past crime certainly raises the potential that a 

59

subsequent crime will occur.  If that's the case, then

guy driving by, or something like that.  If he says the 

principal did it, it's at 10 o'clock, it's in the 

school -- that suggests to me more, not that the dying 

student or the wounded student wanted to make sure that 

the principal was convicted, but that there's an 

emergency, something is happening. 

 MR. VAN HOEK:  Well, again, I think that if 

all it is that the principal shot someone before, that 

basically is I think the -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't think there's

them from immediately running into the school and

the underlying principle, as this Court has said

22 

23 

24

repeatedly in Crawford and in Davis, is formality, and 

that's what the purpose of any inquiry should be in 

looking at -- at the scene, whether there's an emergency 

or not, or declarant's view or not.  It all comes down 

to formality akin to a magisterial examination.  And I 

would also -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's go to formality. 

It can't be that you arrive at a scene of a crime and 

everything a victim tells you is admissible.  There has 

to be some emergency.  That's what we've said.

 MS. PALMER:  Right. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Correct?  So the issue 

here is how do you define that dividing line between 

emergency and non, when the police officers are just 

asking questions that by their nature are always going 

to be testimonial, because they are going to use or try 

to use whatever is said later?  So, in discerning the 

primary purpose, I think your adversary is saying you 

can't go by what the police officers are asking because 

they are going to be asking dual motive always.  You 

have to look to what the declarant tells you.  And is he 

16 

or she telling you something that suggests an emergency? 

17

18

 MS. PALMER:  Well -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's really the 

19 

difference between the two of you, I think.

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MS. PALMER:  Well, even if -- even if you 

take that view, that it's the declarant's purpose, 

objectively viewed, that controls, I think here it's 

difficult to see how Covington's purpose could have been 

to provide evidence any more than the 9-1-1 call in 

Davis.  I think he was in shock from a bleeding wound. 

62
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

He didn't call the police.  They came to him.  You know, 

this wasn't even a 9-1-1 call where he sought them. 

They came to him.  It's not clear who called, but it was 

not him.

 So even taking it from his point of view, 

it's -- it's difficult to see here how the purpose would 

have been anything other than, as he said, when is EMS 

coming to help me. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what 

you're saying.  You mean he has to intend to provide 

evidence that he knows will be used at trial?  I don't 

think that's the test. 

 MS. PALMER:  I don't agree with that, and -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's intending to accuse 

somebody. 

 MS. PALMER:  Well, I think here he's 

intending to seek help because he has been mortally 

wounded. 

 Thank you.
