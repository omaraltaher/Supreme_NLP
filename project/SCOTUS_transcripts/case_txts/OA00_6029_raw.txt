CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 00-6029, Tracy Ragsdale v. Wolverine World


Wide.


Mr. Sutter.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LUTHER O. SUTTER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SUTTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The FMLA guarantees much more than 12 weeks of


absence from work.  The FMLA guarantees a specific bundle


of statutory rights that an employer must grant eligible


employees.  In many cases, the company's leave plan, as is


the case here, may provide different rights from the


bundle of rights that the FMLA grants eligible employees.


825.208 and 825.700(a) implement the statute in an


important way.


Under the regulations, 825.208 and 700, if the


employer wants a period of absences or leave to count


against a worker's annual FMLA entitlement, the employer


must do three things.  First, the company must decide to


grant the worker this bundle of rights that the FMLA


grants him or her.  Second, the employer must tell the


employee that they have these benefit rights, and third,

the employer must tell the employee that the employer has


elected to count this period of leave against the FMLA.


QUESTION:  Does the act require the posting of


some general notice in the place of employment about the


Family Leave Act?


MR. SUTTER:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, it does.  29


U.S.C. 2619 provides that each employer shall post a


general notice in the form that the Secretary shall


prescribe, so Congress painted it in broad brush strokes


and intended that the Secretary had the ability to provide


what information is provided to employees.


QUESTION:  Well, can the Secretary then provide


that it has to be done by personal communication?


MR. SUTTER:  Well, Your Honor, that is just --


as this Court noted in the FDA case, just simply because


the Secretary has spoken and required posting in this


instance does not mean that the Secretary cannot fill the


gap, as it were, and require personal notice if the


Secretary determines that such notice is reasonably


necessary to implement the act.


In this case, Justice O'Connor, I think all


would agree that it is difficult to exercise a right that


one does not know that one has, and in this case the


Secretary decided that the employer must first choose


to -- that the FMLA -- that the worker will get the FMLA

rights, and then tell the employee, and this regulation


promotes communication, communication between the employer


and the employee.


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutter, may I ask if -- in this


case, as I understand it, the employee initially did not


qualify for the FMLA leave because she hadn't been there


long enough.  The FMLA is 12 weeks.  Her initial weeks,


the first 4 weeks had to be under the company policy


because there was nothing else, so is the thrust of your


argument that therefore she is entitled to a minimum of 16


weeks, even assuming notice at the time that FMLA comes


active?


MR. SUTTER:  Justice Ginsburg, the thrust of my


argument is, is that the FMLA is more than just 12 weeks. 


The FMLA is a specific bundle of rights --


QUESTION:  Yes, well, that's a separate


question, but let's assume that there's no difference in


the rights under each, and in this case I don't know that


that bundle that you describe is any different under the


company plan as far as continuing the insurance and the


pension payments, but is it your contention that she would


therefore, because she didn't have enough to qualify for


the FMLA leave, she would get 16 weeks --


MR. SUTTER:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- and not 12?

 MR. SUTTER:  Yes, Your Honor, because the act


provides that only eligible employees are entitled to FMLA


leave, and eligible employees must have worked for that


employer for 12 months, and at the --


QUESTION:  So it's a little odd that when she


didn't qualify she gets extra time than if she had already


been there long enough to qualify, in which case it would


be only 12 weeks.


MR. SUTTER:  Well, I can see where one might


believe that it is a bit odd, but again, Justice Ginsburg,


the company leave plan in this case did not provide her


with all of the FMLA bundle of rights.


QUESTION:  Why didn't it?


QUESTION:  Why didn't it?


MR. SUTTER:  Because the leave plan in this


case, for example, did not allow her to have intermittent


leave.  Section 2612 --


QUESTION:  She wasn't able to have intermittent


leave anyway, as I understand it.  The doctor didn't allow


her to go back to work even intermittently until the


period was over.


MR. SUTTER:  Well, Justice Scalia, the doctor


only had two options.  Because the employer elected on the


front end not to allow Ms. Ragsdale her bundle of FMLA


rights, the doctor had two options.  Either Ms. Ragsdale

quit, or she cannot work for 30 days.  There's a third


option that would have become involved had the employer


given the employee notice of a right to --


QUESTION:  You mean the doctor skewed his


medical advice and told her you can't work at all only


because the employer hadn't told her she could work


intermittently?  I can't imagine that.


MR. SUTTER:  Well, it's --


QUESTION:  The problem I have with your case is


not -- not the rule that the employer has to give notice. 


That's a perfectly reasonable rule.  The problem I have is


the remedy that is provided if the rule is violated.  Now,


under that provision of the act which imposes a penalty


when the employer fails to comply with the provision of


the act, what you're entitled to is damages, what you


would have lost, what you've lost by reason of the


employer's noncompliance.


In this case, I don't see anything at all that


she lost, and the penalty under the regulation that is


imposed for noncompliance with the notice is an entire


free additional 12 weeks.  It goes beyond any damages she


suffered at all.


MR. SUTTER:  Well, Justice Scalia, we -- it is


difficult, looking 3, 4 years later, to determine whether


or not Ms. Ragsdale would have been able to work

intermittently.  We contend that she would have been. 


However, having said that --


QUESTION:  Well, but under the damage provision


of the act you have to prove that.  Why isn't it


reasonable to say the employer has to make her good for


any damages she suffered, and if you could show that she


suffered something because of it, fine, but what this


regulation says is, she gets a whole nother 12 weeks,


whether in fact she could have made use of that notice or


not, and as I read the facts I don't see anything she


could have done if she had gotten the notice.  I think she


would have been in the same position she's in now.


MR. SUTTER:  Well, certainly the district court


did not address the issue of prejudice.  However, the


Secretary could have reasonably determined that monetary


penalties were appropriate.  However, the Secretary


decided that the FMLA is not simply money to be bought or


to be sold or exchanged.  The FMLA is a specific bundle of


rights that the employee has different rights and


obligations under.  If the employ -- the -- Ms. Ragsdale


in this case never got FMLA leave because the employer


never designated it as FMLA leave.


QUESTION:  But as Justice Scalia points out, the


employee under your view gets even more than she's


entitled to under the act under certain circumstances.

Suppose that the notice isn't given, and she takes leave,


and medical benefits are not paid.  I assume the employer


has to pay for medical benefits.


MR. SUTTER:  Right.


QUESTION:  And also give 12 additional weeks. 


That seems -- it seems to me that you're having it both


ways.


MR. SUTTER:  No, Justice Kennedy, I do not


believe that we are, because in this case, while the


statute explicitly requires 12 weeks of leave in any


period, 2612(b)(1) also allows employees to extend that 12


weeks over a calendar year using intermittent leave, so


looking at this case as simply a calculation of weeks is


inaccurate.


QUESTION:  But I put you the case in which she I


would think would be entitled to back -- to compensatory


damages for not having been paid her medical benefits, and


in addition, so that during the period that she took off


the Government counts that for purposes of monetary


liability, but it doesn't count that for purposes of


accrued leave, so she's entitled to monetary compensation


for the benefits that weren't paid during that unnoticed


leave period, and she's entitled to an additional 12


weeks.  That just doesn't make sense.


MR. SUTTER:  Well, Justice Kennedy, the specific

issue here is what happens when the employer provides the


employee with less rights than the FMLA bundle of rights


provides.  When the --


QUESTION:  And the answer is that she ends up


with more than what the Family Leave Act would have


provided.


MR. SUTTER:  In this case, Justice Kennedy, in


terms of time I believe the Court is correct.  However, in


terms of the specific bundle of rights, the issue for this


Court to determine is whether or not the Secretary has


acted reasonably when, in circumstances such as these, the


employee receives less than what she is entitled to


specifically.


QUESTION:  I don't -- well, I don't agree that


that's the issue.  I don't think you've established that


she was deprived of any right that she would have been


entitled to under the act.  You're simply asserting that


she -- had she received the notice she might have worked


intermittently, but as far as the medical advice is


concerned she couldn't have worked intermittently.  Don't


you think you have some obligation to provide that she was


deprived of some of the benefits of the act?


MR. SUTTER:  The Secretary may have reasonably


required that this analysis occur after the need for


intermittent leave arose.  However, the Secretary, to

avoid just these types of misunderstandings, required the


designation to be on --


QUESTION:  It's a prophylactic rule that the


Secretary has adopted, even though the statute itself, in


the provisions that it sets forth for where the employer


has failed to comply with the act, does not adopt a


prophylactic rule.  It says you give the employee the


damages that the employee is entitled to.


MR. SUTTER:  Under either a Morning prophylactic


rule, or the interpretive powers granted the Secretary


under Chevron, we believe the regulation is entirely


appropriate because the issue of notice is not addressed.


QUESTION:  Well, may I go back to the question


of what the damages are?  On your view, or on the


Secretary's view, does the employee get another 12 weeks


of leave if the employee does not need another 12 weeks of


leave?


MR. SUTTER:  If the employee does not need --


QUESTION:  Let's assume the employee is cured. 


Does the employee then have the right to enjoy 12 weeks


off?


MR. SUTTER:  Not unless, for example, she is


involved in a serious car accident, another serious --


QUESTION:  Well, no, but my hypothesis is that


whatever the reason for the leave was, sickness or

pregnancy, be whatever, it's over, so that I take it that


the additional 12 weeks, or only an additional 12 weeks,


if the person still has some medical or social need for


the leave.


MR. SUTTER:  That's exactly correct, Justice.


QUESTION:  As I understand what Judge McGill


said in the Eighth Circuit, he did say that he -- there


could be cases where it would be appropriate for this


regulation to apply if she could show that she was


disadvantaged by not being given the option, so he left


that door open if there were some disadvantage.  He said


he saw none here.


MR. SUTTER:  Yes, and that's an entirely


reasonable interpretation, a reasonable alternative to


what the Secretary did here, but that is not the -- Judge


McGill did not give the Secretary the appropriate


deference that she is entitled to in promulgating this


regulation.  This regulation says that determination


should be made when the intermittent leave may or may not


be needed.


QUESTION:  But his reason, I understand, was


that Congress said 12 weeks, and to interpret that statute


that says 12 weeks to mean 24 weeks, or in this case even 


more than that -- because the company leave was 30 weeks,


right?

 MR. SUTTER:  The company granted 4 weeks pre-


FMLA eligibility and 26 weeks post.


QUESTION:  So his view was that the regulation


conflicted with the statute.


MR. SUTTER:  Well, and as this Court recognized


in the FDA case, you cannot read one statute in isolation. 


You have to also look at not only 2612(a), which says


specifically 12 weeks of leave in any 12-month period,


thereby leaving it open for, as the Secretary has done in


this case, identifying four different ways to calculate 12


weeks.  For example, it could be backward-looking.  You


can -- the employer can look back 12 weeks if it chooses


to do so, or it can look forward.


For example, if I have a broken leg -- if I have


a broken leg, and then I recover from that, and then I


have another serious health condition, you can actually


look forward to the forward-looking 12 weeks, the 12-


month period, so if you take 12 months out of a calendar


you can actually, depending on how you calculate it, have


24 weeks of leave, depending on how they may calculate it.


Now, I would urge the Court to read 2612(a) in


conjunction with 2612(b)(1) which allows intermittent


leave, which can extend FMLA leave over a period of 24


weeks if they work half-time, 36 weeks if they work three-


quarter time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Secretary of Labor has determined that an


employee can derive the maximum benefit from the FMLA only


if he has accurate information concerning the act,


including the fact that his leave will count against his


12-week FMLA entitlement.  To implement that determin --


QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, do you think that that


can be met by just posting some general notice saying that


any leave taken by an employee is going to require taking


FMLA leave first?


MR. STEWART:  No, we don't, Your Honor.  The


statute itself requires that an employer post notice in


such form as is directed by the Secretary.  The Secretary


has addressed the type of notice that must be posted for


the workforce generally, but the Secretary has also


determined that, although the general posting requirement


is helpful, an employee who is actually on the point of


taking leave for an FMLA-covered purpose needs additional

information concerning the rights and responsibilities


under the act, so the employer couldn't comply with the


regulatory requirement simply by posting a notice for the


workforce generally, and the intention here is not to


penalize the employer for noncompliance with the


regulation.  Rather, the Secretary's determination is that


a precondition to effective exercise of FMLA rights is


full and complete information concerning the dictates of


the act, including the fact that the leave will count


against the 12-week entitlement.


QUESTION:  That's fine, but where the employee


has no FMLA rights, that is to say, where the leave that


the employer provides gives the employee everything that


the employee would have under the FMLA, why should the


employee get another 12 weeks?


MR. STEWART:  First, it's not --


QUESTION:  The problem is not the requirement --


to my mind is not the requirement of notice at the


beginning of the leave.  It's the penalty that the


Secretary chooses to impose when that notice is not given.


MR. STEWART:  Well, first it's not clear in many


cases, and it's not clear in this case, whether in fact


the leave that the employer provided complied with all the


requirements of the act.  That is, Mr. Sutter has argued


that the employer's plan doesn't contain a right to

intermittent leave.  Now, there's a further question of


whether this particular employee could have effectively 


utilized the FMLA right to intermittent leave if she had


known she had it, but the thrust of the --


QUESTION:  Well, I agree that those are


questions, but it seems to me those are questions that


have to be answered by the person who is seeking to impose


a liability on the employer.


MR. STEWART:  But the thrust of the Secretary's


regulation is that it is better to have a bright line rule


than to require the courts to engage in after-the-fact


speculative inquiries regarding what might have been done


months or years earlier if the requisite notice had been


given and this, to the extent this is harsh, it is harsh


in the same way that a statute of limitations is harsh. 


Clearly, when a plaintiff with a meritorious claim has his


suit dismissed because he's missed the statutory


limitations period by a small number of days, there's an


element of unfairness there, but the justification for


having a bright line rule is, first a bright line rule is


likely to produce --


QUESTION:  The statutes of limitations are not


imposed by regulation.  They're imposed by statute.


MR. STEWART:  Certainly, statutory -- statutes


of limitations by definition are imposed by the

legislature, but there are instances, and we've cited one


in our brief, in which an administrative agency that is


given authority to resolve complaints under an act may be


authorized to promulgate reasonable procedural regulations


to implement that directive, and that might include the


requirement that a claim be filed within a certain number


of days.


QUESTION:  What case is --


QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart --


MR. STEWART:  This is on page 24 of our brief in


footnote 6.  We've cited Rennie v. Skerrett, which is a


Seventh Circuit case that discusses predecessor versions


of the current EEOC regulations which provide that Federal


employees claiming discrimination under title VII must


present their claims to the agency within a specified


number of days.


QUESTION:  But here there's something really


strange about it.  That is, they couldn't give the notice. 


When she started on leave she wasn't entitled to anything,


so here's an employer being more generous than the Federal


law requires in that he's covering her although she's


worked less than a year, so there's no question of giving


the notice when she's put on leave because she's not


entitled to any Federal leave, isn't that so?


MR. STEWART:  Well, first the regulation -- she

was not entitled to FMLA leave at the time of her first


request, but in fact the DOL regulations specifically


require that if an employee requests leave for an FMLA-


covered purpose but is not yet eligible for the


protections of the FMLA, the employer is required to


notify the employee of the time when she will become


eligible, and second, at any rate, when the employee made


her first request for extension of leave she had passed


the 12-month period and she was eligible for the


protections of the act, and it's true that in terms of the


sheer number of weeks of leave that it was willing to


give, the company was more generous than the act required,


but the fact that an individual or a business goes beyond


the requirements of the law in some respects doesn't


excuse its noncompliance with other aspects of the law.


QUESTION:  I don't see any noncompliance.  You


said about the intermittent, that's fuzzy, but they --


their leave policy covered the health insurance, covered


the pension payments.


MR. STEWART:  Well, the intermittent leave is


itself important, and again there may be a substantial


question as to whether this particular employee could have


made effective use of the FMLA right to intermittent leave


had she known she had it, and the Secretary might, as the


Eighth Circuit suggested, have adopted the regulatory

approach under which that would be the dispositive


inquiry, but instead the Secretary has chosen to


promulgate a bright line rule.


QUESTION:  A prophylactic rule, which the


statute itself does not do.  I mean, section 2617(a)(1)


requires that when an employer violates section 2615 he


has to pay damages equal to the amount of, and then it


goes through, any wages he lost, salary he's lost,


employment benefits he's lost, and the Secretary comes up


with this new rule in which it doesn't matter whether the


employee's been damaged at all, we're going to impose a


prophylactic rule.  I don't know any other situation in


which an agency is authorized to do that.


MR. STEWART:  Well, in this case the statute not


only gives the agency general rulemaking authority but


also provides that it will be a violation of the act for


an employer to interfere with or restrain an employee in


her exercise of FMLA rights and, by its nature, that


language presumes that there will be instances in which


employer conduct is not in terms prohibited by the act,


but is likely to have the practical effect of dissuading


or preventing employees from effectively exercising their


statutory --


QUESTION:  But if she had no rights, he's not


guilty of that.  I mean, what this regulation is saying

is, whether or not the employer in this particular case


restrained her exercise of rights, whether or not she


could have taken intermittent leave, he's going to have to


give her another 12 weeks.


MR. STEWART:  Well, under the NLRB, under the


NLRB's approach to implementation of the NLRA, the


question of whether employer conduct has interfered with


or restrained the exercise of protected rights is not


resolved by asking whether particular employees were, in


fact, deterred from engaging in protected conduct.  It's


whether the employer conduct is of a nature that could


reasonably be expected to have that effect, and the


Secretary's determination is that failing to inform the


employee that her time is being counted against the 12-


week FMLA entitlement and then dismissing her while she


still has the serious health condition will have the


practical effect of interfering with, or is likely to have


the practical effect of interfering with or restraining


her exercise of protected rights.


And again, the Secretary could have chosen an


approach under which a more case-specific evidence would


be offered as to the actual use the employee might have


made of the information, but the Secretary was not


required to do so, and again, this is comparable to the


situation in a statute of limitations situation where, if

a suit is filed --


QUESTION:  Well, under the statute of


limitations, if a district judge throws out a suit because


a 2-year statute has run and then the appellate court said


no, you -- there was 3 weeks available there and it was


filed on time, we don't give them a whole new 2 years. 


That's what you're doing.


MR. STEWART:  Well, the analogy to the statute


of limitations is really that, if the statute of


limitations has expired, we don't ask whether the


defendant could have done anything differently, or whether


the defendant was prejudiced by the absence of notice


within the 2-year period.  The -- for purposes of your


hypothetical, though, the situation might also be compared


to a tolling provision in a statute of limitations that


says the statute will not begin to run until the potential


plaintiff has received a particular item of information.


If that were the situation, then the statute of


limitations simply doesn't begin to run until the


plaintiff knows that, and we don't ask whether the


plaintiff would have done anything differently had she


received the information sooner.


And again, this is not intended as a penalty or


even as a penalty for the employer's noncompliance with


the regulatory requirement.  Rather, the gist of the

Secretary's determination is, in order to make effective


use of FMLA rights, this sort of information is a


precondition, and therefore it's a natural approach to


say, until the employee has that information the 12-week


period will not begin to run.


QUESTION:  Mr. Stewart, suppose somebody has


worked for 5 months but the company has leave that kicks


in that early, and then 7 months later would qualify for


the FMLA, but -- or has already had much more than the 12


weeks of leave, hasn't been given notice because there


wasn't any eligibility, what happens then?


MR. STEWART:  May I answer?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. STEWART:  There's a separate provision in


the statute that makes eligibility for FMLA benefits


contingent upon having worked 1,250 hours in the preceding


calendar year and, therefore, it's likely that an employee


who had worked only 5 months and then had been on leave


for 7 months would fail to satisfy that requirement.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Stewart.


Mr. Bennett, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. BENNETT


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. BENNETT:  Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,


may it please the Court:

 The employer notice regulations the petitioner


and DOL are defending here today allow employee -- they're


premised on -- their arguments are, Your Honor, are that


they allow employees the right to, quote, plan leave, to


communicate with each other.  What they have done to


this -- these regulations is elevate this right, this


perceived right to plan leave -- if it's a right, it's an


implicit right in the statute, Your Honor.  It's not an


expressed right, if it's a right at all, and they have


elevated this right above the expressed right in the


statute to have leave limited to a total of 12 weeks of


leave.


What they have in essence done through this


regulation is what the most skilled and persuasive


legislative body in this country could not do, and that


was entitle employees to leave for more than 12 weeks of


leave.  Congress clearly attempted to do that.  This leave


went through a number of forms before it was eventually


passed by Congress.  The first piece of legislation


providing for family medical leave in 1986 provided for 36


weeks of leave for employees for these conditions, and


that bill did not pass Congress.  The 100th Congress came


back with a leave for 26 weeks leave over 24 months, and


again that deal couldn't pass Congress.


It was only when Congress limited the leave to a

total of 12 weeks of leave over a 12-month period of time


that they were able to pass this particular piece of


legislation.  Congress specifically spoke in the statute


and in, more abundantly in the legislative history


surrounding this particular statute, that their primary


intent and focus was to limit leave to a total of 12 weeks


of leave, to grant employees this minimal leave right.


QUESTION:  Suppose -- I suppose that the


Government didn't think of what it was doing as giving an


extra 12 weeks of leave.  They didn't see it that way.  I


imagine the way they saw it is that we think the employee


has to have notice at the time that this counts as his


FMLA leave, and what happens if he doesn't get it?  If he


doesn't get it, it doesn't count as FMLA leave.  That's a


very simple requirement and a very simple remedy, and it


has the consequence you spoke of, but if that isn't the


simple remedy, they shouldn't have done that simple


remedy, what, in your opinion, should they have done,


assuming the problem?


MR. BENNETT:  Again, the issue, as Justice


Scalia has pointed out, is not the requirement --


QUESTION:  That's what I'm assuming.  I'm


assuming that they come across a real problem.  The real


problem is, no, or very few employees, or not many


employees notice what's going on until the moment that

they have to go for the chemotherapy.  At that point they


worry about leave, and so the agency says, employer, if


you want it to count as FMLA leave, tell them


specifically.


Now, we all agree that's fine, and then what


happens if you don't?  Well, they say, it doesn't count. 


That's all.  Now, you think that part is wrong.  Now, I


want to know, if you think that's wrong, what should, in


your opinion, the agency have done there instead?


MR. BENNETT:  Congress specified a monetary


penalty.  In the statute itself, Congress said you shall


post a notice advising employees of what their rights are. 


If an employer, Your Honor, does not post a notice at all,


doesn't in any way advise their employees of what their


rights are under the statute, completely ignores the


statutory provision to post this notice, all the


employer -- all -- the only penalty the employer gets is a


monetary penalty --


QUESTION:  In your opinion, it would have been a


better remedy if the agency had said, and if you don't


tell them, you have to pay them $10,00 cash.  That, in


your opinion would have -- I imagine a few employers might


have objected to that.


MR. BENNETT:  I think the -- some employers


might object to the amount of the penalty, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  Oh well, let's say $5,000.


MR. BENNETT:  I believe --


QUESTION:  $5,000 cash to any employee because


the notice provision wasn't given, and all small


employers, large employers, any time they fail to -- now,


would you have -- you would have preferred that remedy. 


Do you think most employers would have preferred that


remedy?  What amount do you think it should have been?


MR. BENNETT:  Well, aside from constitutional


issues as a penalty, I believe you have to look at what


Congress intended.  Congress intended that employees get


the notice, and where -- excuse me, get the leave, and


Congress specifically provided where -- a notice provision


within the statute, and that notice provision, Congress


said, if you don't give it, a penalty is appropriate.  DOL


has now come up with a whole new penalty that far exceeds


in this --


QUESTION:  I'm just trying to make -- to try to


understand, to put you in the position of the agency. 


They're trying to do something, and they're trying to find


a remedy for not doing it, and you say it should have been


like $5,000 payment, and I want you to see that a lot of


people might have thought that was much worse than simply


saying, don't count it as leave.  Some might have thought


it was better.  So doesn't the agency have a range where

they can choose what's reasonable?


MR. BENNETT:  I believe the agency does have a


range to choose what's reasonable, Your Honor, but I don't


believe --


QUESTION:  Could the agency choose a monetary


penalty?  Could the agency as a matter of administrative


discretion impose a penalty, or would that have to come


from the -- is that even within the realm of choice that


the agency would have?


MR. BENNETT:  Well, again, one of the


contingents we raise, Your Honor, is that Congress


specifically spoke to notice, all the notice that's


required under the statute.  We contend that the DOL does


not have the right to come in and promulgate a regulation


that an employer notify an employee specifically and


prospectively that they're using leave, but to the extent


that they do, to the extent that there's some perceived


gap in there where they do have the right to do that, they


can't do that where it's manifestly contrary to the


statute.  In this statute, the primary focus --


QUESTION:  But the question is, let's assume


that it would be permissible for the Secretary to say,


give them notice that the leave counts as this -- for this


purpose, that that would be permissible.  That was an


assumption that Justice Scalia was making.  Then what does

the Secretary have in her arsenal to put teeth behind


that, if not the extension of the period?


MR. BENNETT:  Again, the Secretary can exercise


the discretion to determine a -- fashion a reasonable


remedy for the company's failure to provide this notice,


but that remedy, Your Honor, cannot exceed --


QUESTION:  Well, what would be reasonable?  The


fine question maybe a question whether the Secretary has


authority to do it.  What, other than saying the period


doesn't run if you don't give the notice, could the


Secretary have done?


MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, I believe the penalty


that the Secretary should have granted in this particular


case, or authorized under this regulation, would be a


monetary penalty.  Congress said $100 for not telling the


employees at all.


QUESTION:  Would there ever be an instance in


which the Secretary, on a case-by-case basis, could say


that we are ordering you to grant additional family leave? 


I.e., suppose the employee knows that his wife is going to


have a difficult pregnancy and he says, I'm going to take


some time off under the company plan at the early stages


and I'll save my family leave for later, and he makes a


mistake, and the mistake is compounded by the fact that


there was no notice.  Assume that notice is required, and

that that's valid.  Would there ever be an instance in


which additional leave would be an appropriate remedial


step?


MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, I'm not sure that


there would be. The statute provides that an employer


cannot interfere or restrain.  Where an employee feels


that, indeed, because the employer didn't notify, that


they've interfered or restrained, the statute provides a


cause of action for that, for the courts to determine, and


I suppose they could file a claim with DOL, and in that


situation they may be able to step in and fashion a


remedy, but they'd have to show that, indeed, they somehow


interfered with --


QUESTION:  Well, could that remedy ever consist


of granting additional leave?


MR. BENNETT:  I suppose, in those situations --


QUESTION:  Assuming the employee was prejudiced


in a case that's -- on a case-by-case basis.


MR. BENNETT:  We contend, Your Honor, they could


not.  The statute provides for leave.  You would look in


that case the same as you would, Your Honor, under the


Fair Labor Standards Act for minimum wage.  You look first


to see whether or not the basic benefit of the statute was


granted.  Under the Fair Labor Standards Act for minimum


wage, for instance, you first look to see if the employee

is paid minimum wage.  The employee may file a complaint


because the employer failed to adequately notify the


employee that they were paying them minimum wage.  They


didn't note it on their check stub, and the employee


couldn't tell they were being paid the wage.


The first thing you make a determination of was


whether the employee received the minimum wage.  If they


do --


QUESTION:  Yes, but minimum wages, all we're


talking about is the dollars.  Here we're talking about


time as well.


MR. BENNETT:  Correct, Your Honor, but if,


indeed, the employee --


QUESTION:  And that's the currency the agency


has to deal with, and you say under no circumstance may


the Secretary, however reasonable the employee's reliance


was, however faulty the notice was, under no circumstance


may they ever give additional leave.


MR. BENNETT:  Provided the leave already granted


by the -- provided the employee had already been given 12


weeks of leave under the conditions contained within the


statute, Your Honor, that is our contention.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm not sure it's incumbent


upon you to write a regulation for the agency.  I gather


your point is that whatever the remedy provided by the

agency, it has to be a remedy that is attached to the harm


that has been caused.  I gather your main point is, no


harm, no foul.  If the employee has not been deprived of


anything he's entitled to under the statute, there's


simply no basis for remedy at all.


Now, what the remedy might be had the employer


shown that the employee could have had intermittent leave,


or if there's something else that the employee could have


done with notice, that's not the case that you're arguing


to us, is it?


MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, that's not our


specific case, that's correct.


QUESTION:  Well, but it might be the case if we


stipulate that in some instances additional leave must be


granted.


MR. BENNETT:  It could be the case --


QUESTION:  If we stipulate that.


MR. BENNETT:  Correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Then what the agency, what the


Government is going to say, Department of Labor is, well,


since in some instances you grant leave it's just


administratively simpler for us to do it this way and you


always get the leave.


MR. BENNETT:  Again, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  So it does make a difference in

answering the question whether or not leave can ever be an


effective standard.


MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, again, under the


statute, you read the statute, you look at the legislative


history surrounding the statute, prior to the enactment of


this statute Congress specifically noted in the


legislative history that the United States stood alone in


the industrialized world as not having leave for these


particular types of conditions.  Prior to the enactment of


this statute, employees in this country didn't have the


right to take 1 week of leave.  Congress was looking to


provide that the employees could get the leave.


For an employee who receives 12 weeks of leave


even if the employee doesn't understand that the leave is


standing medical leave, what Congress was attempting to do


under the Family and Medical Leave Act, Your Honor, will


have been satisfied, again assuming, Your Honor, that the


leave was for the four conditions that they provide in the


statute and that the employer at least granted them 12


weeks of leave, held their job open for 12 weeks of leave,


did not in any way take away benefits that they had prior


to taking the leave, and they helped maintain their health


insurance.  That was what Congress --


QUESTION:  I think there was one argument in the


brief that she could have initially had the company leave


32

when she wasn't eligible yet, and then she could have said


at that point, 4 weeks later when she became eligible for


the FMLA leave, she could say, okay, company, stop the


company leave.  Now I'm taking my 12 weeks of Federal


leave, and when I finish that, I'll go back and pick up


the rest of my company leave.  That she couldn't do here. 


That one argument in the brief for petitioner was to that


effect, and how do you respond to that?


MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, we -- that is a good


point that Your Honor makes.  What -- DOL has taken the


statute out of context, and what they are creating is a


separate category of leave specifically coded as, quote,


FMLA leave.  The statute doesn't mention that FMLA leave


was to be in addition to any company leave.  As a matter


of fact, the statute and the legislative history is


replete with references that Congress was well aware that


employers out there such as my client had more generous


leave policies.  They put a provision within the statute


and said, we do not intend by the enactment of this


statute to discourage you from retaining those benefits or


even providing even more generous benefits.  What we're


trying to do -- and they also provided in that very same


statute, Your Honor, that employers cannot craft a


regulation, or craft leave policies that go below.


What they intended to do was, where an employer

had a leave policy that provided for leave, under these


circumstances, if an employer had a policy that in all


intent and circumstances would allow an employee off for


leave for the four conditions they prescribed, if the


leave was job-protected, health insurance was maintained,


an employee didn't lose any other benefits while they were


out on leave, but the employer's leave was only for 10


weeks, all this act did was cause -- was augment that


employer's policy to require the employer to provide the


employee an additional 2 weeks of leave.  This act wasn't


meant to require the employer to grant the employee an


additional 10 weeks on top of the 10 they already --


excuse -- 12 weeks on top of the 10 they already had. 


Congress could have said that in the statute.


QUESTION:  What if the employer's leave doesn't


precisely mirror the statutory requirements?  For example,


what if the employer's leave does not allow intermittent


leave?  It says, you've got to take your 12 weeks in one


big lump.  You can't work, you know, half a week here,


half a week there.


MR. BENNETT:  The statute deals with that, Your


Honor, in the section dealing with interference.  In that


case the employee makes a request that they need


intermittent leave, which they have a right to do under


the statute.  Congress specifically granted that.  Then,

indeed, the employer's policy, to the extent they did not,


they would be found -- the leave would not be consistent


with family medical leave and you've now interfered with


the employees' leave, and then the question becomes the


remedy for that interference.


QUESTION:  But of course the employee has to


know about the -- that particular right in order to invoke


it.


Going back to Justice O'Connor's question of


your opponent, did your client give the statutory -- post


the statutory notices?


MR. BENNETT:  Yes, Your Honor, we posted the


statutory notices, and as a matter of fact, because my


client has its own company-provided leave policy, this was


within a collective bargaining agreement, and it's also


within the employee's handbook, so the employees were


aware of it through the collective bargaining agreement,


through the employee handbook which was handed out along


with the collective bargaining agreement to all employees. 


The employer, my particular client, Your Honor, has a 5-


day orientation process, and on one of those days they


specifically go over with employees what their leave


rights are on -- for -- with the company, so this employee


has notice provisions.


QUESTION:  But that notice described the

collective bargaining agreement.  Did it also describe the


statutory requirements?


MR. BENNETT:  I do not believe there was any


specific reference to the FMLA notice posting, Your Honor.


I -- the employees are shown the bulletin board where all


those notices are posted, title VII, wage and hour, and


FMLA, but no, they're not specifically -- there's not a


specific discussion --


QUESTION:  So that to the extent that there may


have been a difference between the statutory requirement


and the company policy, they would not have been advised


of the statutory requirement.


MR. BENNETT:  Not by the company, Your Honor,


but the statute doesn't require that.  Congress said,


here's the way employees should get notice.  Congress


could have crafted another way for employees to receive


notice, but they said notice to the employees shall be


made in this manner, and a general employer notice be


posted to all employees, the same as the Congress has done


for many of our other labor employment law standards. 


They have said that's the method we find the best to


notify employees of their rights.


Employees are notified of their rights under the


ADA in the very same manner.  That statute is much more


complicated than this particular statute, where an

employee who has a disability that could prevent them from


working at all, not just for a few weeks but at all, has


to know that they have to request an accommodation before


an employer has a right to grant you one.  That notice is


merely a notice posting on the bulletin board for the


employer, for the employee to know what their rights are


in this statute, and this one is no different, Your Honor.


DOL has crafted a whole new regulation.  This


regulation adds a whole new requirement on receiving


leave.


QUESTION:  If the requirement was so difficult


to deal with, one would expect there would have been some


comment to that effect.  This is with notice and comment


rulemaking, and as I understand it there was no comment by


employers about the requirement that notice be given that


the leave is counting as family leave.


MR. BENNETT:  I believe there was a notice on


these regulations when they came out initially, and then


they issued final regulations, and I can't speak directly


as to the comments that were -- all the comments that were


made about this one particular regulation, but I believe


the DOL in their brief does mention that there was not a


objection --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. BENNETT:  -- specific objection by employers

to that, and I believe that to be accurate, Your Honor,


but I don't believe -- and I can attest for my client's


purpose that we did recognize from reading that that what


we were going to have to do was grant additional leave,


additional leave, that we're not going to be able to grant


additional leave, that we're going to have to grant


additional leave over and above what we've given them. 


We've given 30 weeks already for --


QUESTION:  But why wouldn't they recognize that,


because that's what the regulation said.  The regulation


wasn't trying to disguise that that would be --


MR. BENNETT:  No, Justice Ginsburg, it was not. 


I just do not believe that employers fully understood that


that was the penalty provision under this particular


regulation.  It's now become very obvious that that's


the -- that's a very steep penalty for employers who fail


to provide the specific prospective notice to employees.


The statute says, employer, if you get -- if an


employee lets you know that they have -- they need leave


for one of these four conditions, you're to look at that,


make a determination whether or not the leave they are


asking for falls within one of those four issues, whether


it's a serious health of themselves, or family, or a birth


or adoption.  If it does, then employer, your obligation


at that point is to grant the leave, and you grant the

leave under these conditions.  You must make sure you give


them at least 12 weeks, you must make sure their job is


protected, you must make sure that you continue their


health insurance, and you must make sure that their other


benefits are not diminished during the term of the leave. 


That's what Congress said all you have to do, employer, in


granting the leave.


DOL has now crafted a regulation that says, oh,


hold on, in addition to that you've got to specifically


notify them in advance you can do all of those things. 


You can give them leave for all of those purposes, 30


weeks in our case, but the leave doesn't count.  Now,


that's clearly inconsistent with Congress' stated purpose


in providing a leave, what Congress said, what type of


leave would qualify for leave under this --


QUESTION:  Well, are you therefore saying that


even the notice provision is beyond the Secretary's power?


MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, we have taken the


position that the statute --


QUESTION:  No, but I thought that's what you


were suggesting a moment ago.  Is that what you meant to


suggest?


notice?


MR. BENNETT:  The notice --


QUESTION:  The Secretary cannot even require a

 MR. BENNETT:  Correct, Your Honor.  I think the


statute has spoken to that.  They talk about notice.  That


statute provides that the employee is to notify the


employer of the need for leave.  The statute goes on that


once the employer receives the notice, the employer is to


provide the notice.  Congress used the term, notify, in


regard to employee, and did not use the term notify in


regard to the employer in that particular case, so you


can't argue that Congress didn't consider notice.  They


clearly considered notice, and because they used notice in


one particular portion of the statute and left it out in


another particular portion of the statute, there's a


presumption, Your Honor, that Congress did that


purposefully and intentionally.


QUESTION:  What if the employer's leave does not


comply with all of the conditions, all right, that are


required by the act, and the employee goes off on that


leave, and there's no notification that the employee could


get more, could have the benefits continued or what-not. 


What happens in that situation?  Does that leave count? 


It doesn't count as statutory leave, does it?


MR. BENNETT:  If the employee was given the


leave, Your Honor, I believe that the leave counts.  Then


the issue becomes whether you've interfered with their


rights under the statute.  Did you -- for instance, if you

didn't hold their job open, let's just say you gave them


the 12 weeks --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. BENNETT:  -- but you didn't hold their job


QUESTION:  Then the damage provision would cut


open --


in.


MR. BENNETT:  Correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  12 --


MR. BENNETT:  The leave, it's not like, as if


the leave doesn't count.  They gave them the leave.


QUESTION:  The leave --


MR. BENNETT:  They gave them an additional 12


weeks plus damages for not giving them their job back. 


They just have to provide them their job back and any lost


pay for failure to do that.  But this regulation --


QUESTION:  But here there was a requirement that


went beyond what the Federal act requires.  That was the


monthly recertification by the doctor that she still had


this disabling condition.  For the FMLA you don't need to


have that monthly certificate, do you?


MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, the regulations


promulgated by the Department of Labor provide that if an


employer -- excuse me.  If a physician certifies that an


employee needs leave for more than 30 weeks -- excuse me,

for more than 30 days, say this employee's going to need


to be absent for 60 days, or 90 days, the employer can't


require during that initial certification that they


recertify unless they have some other reasons to think


they need to.


But in this case, the doctor's certification


that was provided to the employer was 30 days, and the


statute says where the doctor doesn't provide for a longer


certification, an employer can require that an employee on


a -- provide certification on a reasonable basis no sooner


than every 30 days, which --


QUESTION:  Well, wasn't the 30-day period chosen


in this case because the employer's regulation says we'll


only do it for 30 days at a time?


MR. BENNETT:  That is true, Your Honor.  That


is -- that was the company's policy to require the


certification every 30 days.


The legislative history again surrounding this


statute shows that Congress clearly intended to limit


leave to a total of 12 weeks leave.  The length of this


leave is the single most contentious issue Congress was


faced in enacting the legislation.  Indeed, there were


those in Congress who wanted a more expansive leave, and


there were those who wanted no federally protected leave


whatsoever.

 QUESTION:  So you're saying it's a false


question as to whether, when the employee takes leave,


he's taking FMLA leave or employer's leave, that there


aren't two categories?


MR. BENNETT:  No, sir, that's correct,


Justice --


QUESTION:  So that you don't have to give the


notice in order that the employee can know which of the


two leaves he's taking.  He just takes leave, and if the


employer doesn't give him all of the benefits that the


FMLA requires on that leave, then there's a damages


provision in the act.


MR. BENNETT:  That's correct, Your Honor, there


is no requirement in the statute that the employee notify


the employer that they're taking leave.  The only


notification -- the only -- the provision that DOL is


bootstrapping their argument to, or their regulation to,


is 2612(b)(2), which says if you're going to do paid


leave, if you're going to provide the employee with paid


leave, which is not the case here, this was unpaid leave,


if you're going to provide the employee with paid leave --


which is not the case here.  This was unpaid leave.


If you're going to provide the employee with


paid leave, Congress said, then you've got -- you can


elect -- employer, you can to require them to use paid

leave, or the employee can use it if they don't have


the -- if they need to take paid leave as opposed to


unpaid, they can use that, but at that point the employer


provides the leave.  There's no provision that Congress


said, if it's unpaid leave, you have to designate or


substitute it for company-provided leave.  Clearly


explicit is that unpaid leave, as long as it meets these


conditions, is FMLA leave.


QUESTION:  Well, there's no provision, but


neither is there any clear answer to the question, and I


suppose one of the arguments in favor of the Secretary's


regulation here is that it really was a gap-filling


regulation with respect to unpaid company leave.  We've


got to have a kind of default provision to know which --


whether it counts or whether it doesn't count, and that's


what the Secretary's reg addresses.  What's your response


to that?


MR. BENNETT:  Your Honor, I believe the statute


itself creates a default rule.  In that case --


QUESTION:  For un -- when the company's leave is


unpaid?


MR. BENNETT:  For the unpaid.  It creates --


QUESTION:  What is the default rule?


MR. BENNETT:  In 2612(c) and 2612(d)(1), the


statute specifically talks about unpaid leave, leave shall

be unpaid.  (d)(1) provides that if you're going to


require the employee to use paid leave and it's less than


the 12 weeks, then the additional amount between the paid


leave and the statutory 12 weeks is unpaid, up to a total


of 12 weeks, so the statute says 12 weeks is all we're


requiring.  If it's not paid, then the remainder of it is


unpaid.  Now then -- and section (d) creates an exception


to that.


QUESTION:  No, but that -- as I understand it,


that addresses the issue of the character of leave, if


there isn't a full 12 weeks provided, but as I understand


it also there is no clear default provision when we have a


situation in which there could be concurrent -- in which


the leave could be seen either as unpaid company leave or


as leave under the act.  That question, is it under the


act or is it under the company's plan, is answered in the


case of paid leave but it's not answered in the case of


unpaid leave.  Am I missing something?


MR. BENNETT:  That's true, Your Honor.  There's


no specific provision about that.  The statute itself


talked about paid leave.  It didn't mention the


substitution of unpaid leave.  Back again to the point I


made earlier --


QUESTION:  And their argument is that because


the statute didn't talk about that, there has -- or it is

reasonable for the Secretary to come up with a rule that


tells us whether it counts against the act or whether it


doesn't in the unpaid case.


MR. BENNETT:  Their assumption is that there's a


gap and that it's reasonable for them to step in.


QUESTION:  That's right.


MR. BENNETT:  Our position, Your Honor, is that


Congress specifically decided not to require that.  They


talk about in the statute a total of 12 weeks of leave. 


The statute doesn't say a total of company -- or paid


leave or unpaid.


QUESTION:  Well, Congress may not have required


it, but at the end of the 12 weeks there's still the


question, did this count under the statute, or didn't it


count under the statute, and if the statute was silent, it


would seem to be that that would be a subject for the


Secretary's regulation.


MR. BENNETT:  But Justice Souter, the statute is


not silent.  The statute says, if you provide leave for


one of these four conditions to one of your employees and


you provide these benefits to them, these basic


protections to them, then that leave is family medical


leave.


QUESTION:  You're saying all leave counts under


the statute.

 MR. BENNETT:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  All leave counts --


MR. BENNETT:  All leave.


QUESTION:  -- under the statute.


MR. BENNETT:  Paid or unpaid, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And if you haven't provided in


connection with the leave everything that the statute


requires, such as a person can come back to the same job


and so forth, there's a damages provision.


MR. BENNETT:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Which is in the statute.


MR. BENNETT:  In the statute, that's correct.


QUESTION:  And on that assumption, what was the


purpose of having the special provisions with respect to


whether it counts as statutory or company when the leave


is paid?


MR. BENNETT:  There are many employers out there


who -- such as my client who have more generous leave


policies.  Congress wasn't concerned about those when they


enacted this statute.  It was those unenlightened


employers, as Secretary Robert Reich called them in his


testimony before the Congress on this issue, those who


didn't see the need to have leave of any sort, or


inadequate leave, that this act was sought to benefit.


Those employers who had paid leave said, okay,

we provide unpaid, but what about our paid leave, can


we -- what do we do about that, do we have to provide them


the 12 weeks of unpaid leave in addition to our paid


leave, and Congress specifically addressed that in the


statute.  If you have paid leave, and paid leave and


vacation time and other personal time not necessarily for


a serious health condition, Congress said, if you've got


that, employer, if you're a generous employer that's going


to provide that, we will allow you to substitute that


leave for the unpaid leave we're requiring under this


statute.  You can require that, employer, that an employee


take their paid leave, and then you just make up the


difference.


Again, Congress clearly thought 12 weeks was 12


weeks.  They were looking to accommodate the legitimate


interests of the employer in this regard, not to burden


the employer by requiring them to provide more than


12 weeks of leave in this statute, but at the same time


balancing the reasonable needs of employees to have at


least -- at least 12 weeks of leave for family and medical


conditions.


Your Honor, I appreciate your time and attention


this morning.  Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LUTHER O. SUTTER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SUTTER:  The company never gave the doctor


the option to allow Ms. Ragsdale to work intermittently. 


On the joint appendix at page 63 and 64 the company form


only asks whether the worker needs sick leave.  It doesn't


ask, like the certification required by the Department of


Labor, whether or not the worker can work intermittently,


and the form does not allow the doctor to certify more


than 30 days.


In fact, the actual policy at issue in this


company, at issue here allows the company doctor to make a


determination about whether or not Ms. Ragsdale was able


to qualify for this leave.  29 U.S.C. 2613(e) prohibits


that specifically.


The question before this Court --


QUESTION:  There's a damages provision for that,


I assume.


MR. SUTTER:  Yes.  Yes, Justice, but there is


also a provision for appropriate injunctive relief such as


reinstatement and other -- and relief as the court may


deem appropriate, and I would submit to you that, as one


of the Justices recognized, this is not simply about


money.  This is a bundle of rights that you must know


about before you can exercise them, and the company, as

counsel candidly admitted, would interfere with those


rights once Ms. Ragsdale asked for them and the company


refused to give them.


The question then becomes, then, how is Ms.


Ragsdale, or did the Secretary act reasonably when it


required the company to tell Ms. Ragsdale about her rights


to intermittent leave, her rights to extended leave more


than 30 days, her right to be reviewed by a doctor that


does not have a regular relationship with the company, as


required by 2613(e), as well as her right to substitute


paid leave.  Ms. Ragsdale in this case had a week of paid


vacation.


Now, whether or not Ms. Ragsdale was prejudiced


is a post hoc analysis.  The Secretary has reasonably


determined that these determinations should be made on the


front end.  All the employer has to do is make the


election.  It's in the employer's power --


QUESTION:  Well, of course, you couldn't really


do it on the front end here because she wasn't eligible


originally for FMLA leave.  It had already happened.


MR. SUTTER:  Well, that's true, Justice


O'Connor, but the regulatory scheme provides that the


employer should have given her a date by which she would


have been eligible for FMLA leave.  Under the collective


bargaining agreement this employer had to grant her this

leave.  This is not a situation where it is out of the


company's generosity.  This agreement was extracted from


the company by the union.


QUESTION:  Well, that's true of most agreements,


isn't it?


(Laughter.)


MR. SUTTER:  And that is why -- that is why


Congress required the FMLA --


QUESTION:  But it is somewhat unusual that a


union wouldn't advise the employees, its membership about


their statutory rights.


MR. SUTTER:  Of course it is, and it might be


entirely reasonable for me to stand up here and substitute


my judgment for the Secretary's, but it is also equally


reasonable that the company be allowed the benefit of


making this determination, and to say that the requirement


that employees communicate is infirmed, we disagree,


because you see, 2612 -- 2611 requires communication for


planning when intermittent leave is required. 


Communication is the sine qua non -- I'm sorry, we don't


speak much like that in Arkansas, but --


(Laughter.)


MR. SUTTER:  except where you all can understand


it, but --

 MR. SUTTER:  -- information is the key to


exercising these rights, and if you don't know that you


have them, you can't exercise them, and Justice Scalia,


that is the interference here, and when there's an


interference --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Sutter.


MR. SUTTER:  Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
