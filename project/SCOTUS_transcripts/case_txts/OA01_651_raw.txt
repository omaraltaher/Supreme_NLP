CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-651, JPMorgan Chase Bank v. Traffic


Stream.


Ms. Reid.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH L. REID


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. REID:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it please


the Court:


The alienage diversity statute provides that the


Federal courts have original jurisdiction in civil actions


between citizens of different States and citizens who are


subjects of a foreign State where the matter in


controversy exceeds $75,000.  The question presented today


is whether respondent, Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure


Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the


British Virgin Islands, qualifies as a subject of the 


United Kingdom within the meaning of that statute. 


Petitioner, JPMorgan Chase Bank, submits it clearly does.


It is well-settled that the term, citizens and


subjects, applies to corporations and not just natural


persons.  It is also not controversial that a subject is


one who owes allegiance to and is under the protection of


a foreign State.

 QUESTION:  Is this a question of Federal law?


MS. REID:  In terms of looking to the matter of


the subject?


QUESTION:  In determining who is a citizen or


subject of a foreign State, or whether a corporation in


this instance is a citizen or subject?  Is that a Federal


law question?


MS. REID:  Yes, Your Honor, we would submit it


is in the first instance, but in saying that we must then


look at the nature of the relationship and look at the


foreign State which is asserting the sovereignty, and


certainly that is a matter that we should consider


carefully.  In this case, the United Kingdom has clearly


expressed its sovereignty over respondent and over the


other residents and corporations of its overseas


territories.


QUESTION:  When you say the United Kingdom has


expressed its sovereignty, Ms. Reid, do you mean that


you're looking at their statutes, or that their diplomatic


representatives have made a representation?


MS. REID:  Both, both the fact that they have


intervened as an amicus in this and in other cases, but


also, particularly in the case of respondent, if one looks


at the BVI constitution enacted in 1976, it is enacted as


a result of the act of parliament and the order of

parliament, and it reserves expressly all power to the


Crown ultimately, and it is only from the Crown that the


law is then delegated to the elected legislative council. 


Each member of whom must swear allegiance to the Crown and


to the Queen.


The United Kingdom reserves the right to review,


approve, and ultimately disapprove any statute that is


enacted in the British Virgin Islands, which is a right


that they do exercise.  In this case, therefore, the


enabling or enacting statute which, under which respondent


is incorporated, is a direct result of the authority


granted from the Crown, so I would argue it is not just a


matter of the diplomatic relationship and the fact that


the United Kingdom is the external face for the British


Virgin Islands in terms of matters of defense and


international relations, but also the fact that all law is


derived ultimately from the Crown.


QUESTION:  Ms. Reid, every corporation must be


formed under the law of some sovereign, and if that's


right, a corporation just can't generate itself.


Is there any corporation that is formed under


the law of some sovereign other than the United States not


included within 1332, or is this just a very simple case


where every foreign corporation of course is organized


under the law of some State, and therefore would qualify.

Does your case involve anything more than that?


MS. REID:  I would say, Your Honor, in 99


percent of the cases, that you're right.  I suppose it is


conceivable that you would have corporations organized by


someone who declares they are sovereign of some island


somewhere, but no one recognizes them as a sovereign, and


the United States would say, we know nothing of this


person, and know they can't be --


QUESTION:  Then the United States would also say


that that's not a corporation.


MS. REID:  Right, exactly.


QUESTION:  So I think you could say in 100


percent of the cases if we acknowledge it as a


corporation, it will have been formed under the law of


some State.


MS. REID:  I would agree, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And I suppose even as to natural


persons in this sort of eccentric island in the real


world, if we did not recognize their claim to individual


sovereignty or nationality, in the real world I assume


they would be subject to some other national sovereign and


they'd by that virtue, by virtue of that be swept up under


the term, citizen or subject, wouldn't they?


MS. REID:  I would agree.


QUESTION:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  Let's assume -- and I'm not sure that


this is an actual proposition of international law, that a


subject of a sovereign has a special duty to obey the laws


of that sovereign.  A United States citizen in China has a


special obligation to obey the laws of the United States


that a British subject does not.  Does this corporation


have a special obligation to obey the laws of Great


Britain in any greater degree than it has the obligation


to obey the laws of any other sovereign to whom it might


become --


MS. REID:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- subject?


MS. REID:  An analogy, though, not completely


perfect, but it -- you know, JPMorgan Chase is a


corporation organized under the laws of the State of New


York.  It obviously has to follow the laws of the State of


New York, but it also has obligations that it has to


follow under our Federal law.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. REID:  Similarly, a corporation set up under


the laws of applicable overseas territories in the first


in stance, of course, must follow the laws of their


legislative district, but they must also abide by agreed-


upon laws and conventions of the United Kingdom, and that


is specifically an issue in the Caribbean, where there are

certain financial disclosure, which is mandated in part


through the relationship, constitutional relationship


between the United Kingdom --


QUESTION:  Where can we document the proposition


that you've just stated?  What do I look to? 


MS. REID:  To a certain extent, the treaty,


that -- for example the Narcotics Enforcement Treaty. 


There are also the United Kingdom -- the one I'm thinking


of is their recent overruling on the homosexuality, which


we cited only to a newspaper article in our brief, will


demonstrate that.


The best sites are the web sites for the BVI and


for the United Kingdom, which detail the relationship


between these two entities, also the white paper we cited


to Your Honor written in, I believe, 1999, goes into great


detail about the relationships between the overseas


territories and the United Kingdom, what the authority and


sovereignty the United Kingdom has --


QUESTION:  No more established authority like


Blackstone, or --


MS. REID:  Not that we have cited to Your Honor,


though in many ways there are parliamentary debates that


you can access concerning -- which are referenced in the


white papers -- concerning the relationships between the


overseas territories and the Queen, which were quite

reminiscent of the debates before the American Revolution


in terms of virtual representation and --


QUESTION:  If we were dealing with a private


individual rather than a corporation, do you think there


could be a stateless person who wouldn't fit under this


statute?


MS. REID:  In very, very rare instances, and


those instances are where the individual had either


renounced their citizenship, which has on occasion


occurred, or where they have been, you know, exiled, and


have not yet acquired citizenship somewhere else, and we


would submit that the cases cited by the Matimak Court


deal with those kinds of statelessness.


QUESTION:  Suppose that kind of person that


Justice O'Connor and you just discussed, a true stateless


person, is temporarily in a port of Australia, San


Francisco, or Monterey, Mexico, can it be said


consistently with the statute here in question that they


are at least temporarily subject to the laws of Australia


while they are there, because they're stateless and they


have no other higher obligation, so they're then


subject --


MS. REID:  No.  I would submit that what subject


to you must mean is that you have an allegiance to a


sovereign, and the sovereign in turn has an obligation to

you, including protection.


QUESTION:  It's not subject to. 

The phrase is


subject of, isn't it?


MS. REID:  Yes, of a --


QUESTION:  Everybody living in a country is


subject to the laws of that country, and presumably to the


Government of that country, but they are not necessarily a


subject of that country.


MS. REID:  That is true, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So there can be stateless persons who


are not within the clause.


MS. REID:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And the reason you take that


position, I take it, is that the impetus for the


constitutional grant was in effect to keep countries from


getting mad, rather than for purposes of extending


jurisdiction as such to everyone who one might want to sue


in a Federal court.


MS. REID:  Right.  I mean, we have argued that


there were two impetuses.  One is the prevention of


foreign entanglements by providing a neutral Federal


forum, and the other was the promotion of commerce.


QUESTION:  I must say, I didn't understand what


you mean by foreign entanglements.  Are you talking about


the foreign entanglements that George Washington warned us

against?


MS. REID:  The --


QUESTION:  I mean, like alliances with France,


or things like that?  What --


MS. REID:  No.  The foreign entanglements, when


one looks back at the Framers' discussion, seem to


envision that if the British debt could not be collected


we might find ourselves back in another war.


QUESTION:  We don't want to make them mad.


MS. REID:  We didn't want to make them mad.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MS. REID:  That, I think, was the entanglement


that they were worried about.


QUESTION:  It's a strange term for it, then.


MS. REID:  And just briefly on the issue of the


promotion of commerce, I wanted to make the point that


JPMorgan Chase Bank and the financial market, you know,


considered the Matimak decisions as ones who have


potentially very deleterious effects on international


commerce.


QUESTION:  Well, why?  Aren't New York courts --


this is not a question of saying for our corporation you


can't enter U.S. court.  They can enter a New York State


court, and those courts are pretty savvy about commercial


matters, are they not?

 MS. REID:  Absolutely, and I practice before


them frequently, but the perception on the part of


foreign -- foreigners is that the Federal system is one in


which procedures are uniform across the country, and a --


with predictability, perhaps, that is more a matter of


perception than of reality.


QUESTION:  I know Alabamans who are afraid of


New York courts.


(Laughter.)


MS. REID:  And vice versa.


QUESTION:  But it is a little different from


what it was in the days of the post revolution, when the


British creditor said State courts are simply going to let


them collect on their debts.


MS. REID:  That's true.  In this particular


case, the reason in large part that it was decided to go


into Federal courts is simply because we wanted to get as


speed a resolution as possible, and the State court system


has interlocutory appeals, which is just the way the


system works, and -- but it does often lead to additional


delay and we had noteholders who were insistent that we


try and get our collateral back as soon as possible. 


QUESTION:  Anyway, you -- I think no one has


suggested a dynamic interpretation of 1332, so that if the


original rationale is not as strong today as it was then,

that somehow the meaning of 1332 would change.


MS. REID:  No.  I think it's -- the -- clearly


the United Kingdom at this point is, I guess one could say


at best, annoyed by this continuing refusal to recognize


their sovereignty over these types of entities, and the


fact is that you know, they have submitted an amicus brief


here, several other amicus briefs, two diplomatic notes,


so that the fear of the Framers of having an entanglement


of some sort with an ally is still, I think, valid today.


QUESTION:  No other circuit has followed the


Second Circuit, have they?


MS. REID:  No.  The Third Circuit has split


explicitly.  The Fourth and the Seventh Circuit have also


disagreed, though not -- they didn't discuss Matimak, and


one of them was earlier than Matimak, but no, there is no


other circuit that has followed this rule.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. MINEAR:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The United States submits that corporations


organized under the United Kingdom overseas territories


are citizens or subjects of a foreign State for purposes


of alienage diversity jurisdiction.  We reach that


conclusion based on the plain language of 1332.  Section


1332's operative term, subject, describes a personal


entity that is amenable to foreign authority in the sense


that it owes allegiance to that foreign State and is


entitled to the protection of that foreign State.  That


term quite clearly embraces a corporation created by a


foreign State.  This Court recognized that principle in


Steamship Company v. Tugman 120 years ago.


The crucial issue in this case is whether the


United Kingdom exercises sufficient sovereign authority


over the British Virgin Islands such that citizens and


corporations can be said to be subject to the United


Kingdom's rules, and we think the answer to that is


clearly yes.  The United States expressly recognizes the


United Kingdom's sovereignty over the British Virgin


Islands.  We do so through treaties such as the Consulate

Convention that we have with the United Kingdom.  We also


recognize it through our diplomatic relations with the


United Kingdom.  Now, we fully support the United


Kingdom's claim here of sovereignty over the British


Virgin Islands.


In addition, if the Court needs to look further,


and we think it does not, it's clear from the British


Virgin Islands' constitution that the United Kingdom has


retained its sovereignty over the British Virgin Islands. 


That constitution expressly states that the United Kingdom


reserves full power to exercise and pass laws for the good


government, order, and peace of the British Virgin


Islands.


We think the language of section 1332


conclusively resolves this case, but if the Court needs to


look further still, then we think the policies that


underlie section 1332 further buttress the conclusion that


we reach.


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, what if the -- say, the


U.K. takes one position and makes a representation, but


the State Department, our State Department disagrees.


MR. MINEAR:  The --


(Slide.)


QUESTION:  Then what sort of an action should


our courts take?

 MR. MINEAR:  We think that you should defer on


the United States views on these matters.  As far as


disagreements between the United Kingdom and the United


States, that's a matter for the State Department to deal


with, but this Court's own decisions, cases such as Jones


v. The United States, which is at 137 U.S. 202, explicitly


state that questions of sovereignty are political


questions that are entrusted to the political branches.


QUESTION:  Well then, if you were to submit the


views of the State Department in a case like that, no


matter what else there is in the record, we should accept


the views of the State Department?


MR. MINEAR:  Your cases suggest that that is the


result that would follow.


QUESTION:  Yes, but do you have a position --


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, we do.  To answer pointedly,


yes, we do believe that you should defer to the United


States views, because oftentimes on the question -- let me


distinguish here that the question of subject is, of


course, the meaning of that term is a legal question that


this Court would interpret according to its normal


practices, but the question of whether a foreign entity is


a foreign State is a question that is properly entrusted


to the political branches.


We believe that the Second Circuit's decision

stands alone here because it is quite plainly wrong.  The


Third Circuit has expressly rejected it, and the Fourth


Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have not followed it. 


Under these circumstances, we think it is appropriate for


the Court to reverse the decision below and remand the


case for further proceedings.


QUESTION:  Can you comment on the stateless


person problem, not a legal person?


MR. MINEAR:  But an individual.  Yes, we can


conceive that there can be such a thing as a stateless


person, and we cannot believe that section 1332 by its


plain language would reach a person who is not a citizen


or a subject of a foreign State.  Pure alienage is not


sufficient.  Nevertheless, the class of stateless persons


is vanishingly small, and as was pointed out in the


earlier discussion, the idea of a stateless corporation is


an oxymoron, as Judge Altimari had stated.


QUESTION:  But there are some U.S. citizens who


don't have access to the Federal court because they're not


a citizen of any State.  Let's take a U.S. citizen who is


residing in Switzerland.


MR. MINEAR:  That is correct.  That is correct,


and again, we think the courts have consistently answered


these questions by adherence to the plain language of the


jurisdictional provisions.  For instance, for many years,

until Congress dealt with the issue, citizens of the


District of Columbia were not entitled to ordinary


diversity jurisdiction, but these are matters that we


think are best resolved by looking closely at the language


that Congress has provided in the jurisdictional


provisions.


If there are no further questions, thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Minear.


Mr. Albert, we'll hear from you.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. ALBERT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


There are two statutes at issue here, both of


which have plain language.  Section 1332 of title 28 says


that diversity jurisdiction extends only to citizens or


citizens and subjects, and it does not extend to all


aliens.  The British Nationality Act of 1981 defines those


persons whom the United Kingdom of Great Britain and


Northern Ireland views as its citizens or subjects, and


natural persons who are living within the British


Dependent Territories do not fall within the category of


being British Citizens.


There is a special class, a subclass that is


delegated to those people.  They are British Dependent

Territory citizens, or British Overseas Territories


citizens, and this is an important distinction, because


they do not have the full measure of rights that any


English citizen would have.


QUESTION:  You're now relying on English law, I


take it.


MR. ALBERT:  I'm referring to English law, yes.


QUESTION:  Yes.  I think that creates some


difficulty for United States courts, particularly when the


U.K. is making representations here as to one point, then


you tell us we have to read English law, which we're much


less familiar with, of course, than American law.


MR. ALBERT:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  Under Rule


44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court can


look to any source for finding where --


QUESTION:  I realize that.  It's not that we're


somehow disqualified from it, but it makes it a much more


difficult inquiry.


MR. ALBERT:  It would be a much more difficult


inquiry had the United Kingdom actually cited to any


statute or any case ever decided in any English court


anywhere on the subject, but it is --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Albert, even if the British


Nationality can be read as saying that corporations formed


in the British Virgin Islands are not citizens, it doesn't

say they're not subjects of the United Kingdom, does it?


MR. ALBERT:  Well, actually, the British


Nationality Act carves out classes of citizens, and


classes of subjects, and persons who are neither citizens


nor subjects, so in fact it --


QUESTION:  I just didn't find anything that


indicated to me that a corporation formed in the British


Virgin Island was not a subject of the U.K., and we are


dealing here with a brief filed by the U.K. that says they


are subjects, so what do we --


MR. ALBERT:  Well, I think that the question


here is whether the deference should be unyielding to a


litigation and advocacy position which the British


Government puts forth in its briefs versus the substantive


basis for that position which one would find in a statute.


QUESTION:  Just looking at it from an American,


U.S. perspective under the statute, citizens are subjects,


and the fact that it is a corporation formed in the


British Virgin Islands would lead me to conclude that is a


subject of a foreign nation under our own statute.


MR. ALBERT:  Respectfully, Justice O'Connor, I


think that the conclusion ought to be different, because


there is nothing with -- the first step in the inquiry is,


what would 1332(a)(2) have to say about corporations, and


we know that 1332(a)(2) is a reference to citizens or

subjects which is consistently -- which before the Letson


fiction was adopted had resulted in severe conflict over


whether there was jurisdiction for corporations at all.


What this Court did in Letson was adopted the


fiction not that the corporations were citizens or


subjects, but that the corporations would be deemed to be


citizens or subjects by virtue of the imputed citizenship


of its shareholders and, applying the same principle here,


you would impute the citizenship of the -- the citizenship


of natural persons resident within the British Virgin


Islands to a British Virgin Islands --


QUESTION:  That's going back to a law that has


long since become obsolete.  A corporation within the


United States is a citizen of the State in which it's


incorporated and where it has its principal place of


business.  We don't look to the citizenship of the


shareholders any more.  Why should there be such a


tremendous disparity between our modern view of what a


U.S. corporation is and the rest of the world when we


don't even really think of the corporation as an entity in


itself but say it's stuck by what its shareholder


citizenship is.


MR. ALBERT:  Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,


1332(c) does not say that corporations are citizens of


their States.  It says that for purposes of diversity they

are deemed to be citizens of these States.  It is a


counting rule, not a citizenship rule, and hence, the


Letson fiction still obtains.  All that Congress did when


it adopted the 1332(c) language was to restrict the scope


of diversity jurisdiction by providing a second political


jurisdiction, principal place of business, which would


further limit the number of diversity cases which were


appearing in Federal courts.


This Court has never held that corporations were


political citizens or political subjects.  Only 1332(c)


deems them to be so, and taking that a step further, it is


Congress' choice, because Congress' language in 1332(a)(2)


is that only citizens or subjects -- it does not use the


word aliens or anything broader -- are subject to


diversity jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  Are you saying those words cover only


human individuals and not corporations?


MR. ALBERT:  For 1332(a)(2), humans, then


applying the 1332(c) presumption, that would bring


corporations within the scope of diversity jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  Well, 1332(a) does use the term,


aliens at the very end.


MR. ALBERT:  Yes, there is a reference to it,


but not in the provision of 1332(a)(2) on the extension of


that dispute between citizens of a State and citizens or

subjects of a foreign State, and in fact, Mr. Chief


Justice, Congress in fact had used the word, aliens, the


broader word, in the original enactment, in the Judiciary


Act of 1789, but Congress abandoned that language when it


revised the statute in 1875.


QUESTION:  Is a Spanish corporation -- as I


say -- is that -- does that come within 1332 jurisdiction,


a corporation formed in Scotland?


MR. ALBERT:  In Scotland, yes, because a --


because the Scottish people, the English and Welsh people,


and the people of Northern Ireland all are citizens of the


Metropolitan United Kingdom, the United Kingdom of Great


Britain and Northern Ireland.


QUESTION:  Well, my problem is if -- take


some -- the British Virgin Islands, a place that's still


held in something like colonial status, that you say that


Scotland, which has a great deal more independence,


belongs to the U.K. in the sense that it is a subject of


the U.K., but the British Virgin Islands, or the Cayman


Islands, that have less independence, are not subjects? 


That may be something a lawyer could understand, but I


don't think it makes much sense, does it?


MR. ALBERT:  I think that the distinction is, no


one is disputing here that the British Virgin Islands is


subordinate to the United Kingdom, no one is disputing

that its people ultimately are answerable to the authority


of the United Kingdom, but that simply goes --


QUESTION:  Does it make them subject --


subjects?


MR. ALBERT:  Subject to, not subject of, and


that is why the British Nationality Act is so important


here.


QUESTION:  If it's so important, I guess then


maybe corporations incorporated in Scotland are not


citizens and subjects either, because it doesn't say


anything about corporations, does it?


MR. ALBERT:  No, Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  Wouldn't people then be surprised if


it doesn't say anything, if we said that Scottish


corporations weren't citizens, or -- in fact, wouldn't the


people who live in these islands be a little surprised if


the Supreme Court were to say, you're not nationals?  How


does it work?  This is not an act that refers to


corporations.


MR. ALBERT:  The proper allegation in a case


like this would be that a corporation is incorporated


under the laws of Scotland and is therefore a citizen or a


subject of the United Kingdom.


QUESTION:  And the reason that they are but


these people aren't is?

 MR. ALBERT:  Is because England, Wales,


Scotland, and Northern Ireland, along with the Channel


Islands, are the constituent parts of the Metropolitan


United Kingdom.  That is the Government with whom we


maintain a direct relationship, and when we treaty with


them, we -- our treaties are binding as to that nation and


those persons who are within those political subdivisions.


QUESTION:  As of English law, the reason that --


although their law says, I guess, the counselor law, the


diplomatic manual,the thing that says you have to swear


allegiance if you're in the British foreign -- you know,


you're in the British Virgin Islands, all the laws are


subject to British authority and so forth, so the reason,


in your opinion, despite all those things they list in


their brief, that makes it very, very similar, the reason


that a corporation incorporated in Wales is a citizen of


the United Kingdom or subject of the United Kingdom but


these are not, because it's the British Virgin Islands,


is?


MR. ALBERT:  Because when parliament enacts a


law of general applicability within the United Kingdom,


its applicability is to those four jurisdictions that I've


mentioned, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland,


along with in some instances the Channel Islands, but it


does not, of its force, extend to the British Overseas

Territories, the British dependent -- what's now known as


the British Overseas Territories.  They are regulated


separately.


When we enter into a treaty with the United


Kingdom on any subject whatsoever, unless our treaty


specifically extends to those territories, what happens in


those territories is unaffected by our treaty, so it is


not a two-way street of reciprocal obligations within the


United Kingdom.  All of their powers of these


jurisdictions are derived from the United Kingdom, but


they don't have any reciprocal rights, and that is


especially true of the natural people who live within


these territories.


The natural people who live within these


territories have no right of abode within the -- have no


right of abode within the Metropolitan United Kingdom.  If


you call them citizens or subjects, and in fact the United


Kingdom uses both terms now, it no longer adheres to the


old concept of subjects, they cannot travel to the United


Kingdom --


QUESTION:  Are they stateless people?


MR. ALBERT:  They are not stateless people at


all.  They do have a State.  Their State, their


overarching State is the United Kingdom, which extends to


them defense protection.  The United Kingdom protects them

in an international sense, but they do have -- and in that


sense they a State.


QUESTION:  They are British -- their State is


the U.K.?


MR. ALBERT:  They are just -- they are very


similar to what our territorial residents would have been


before we extended citizenship.


QUESTION:  They are subject of and to the United


States, I assume, the residents in the U.S. Territories.


MR. ALBERT:  Residents of U.S. Territories are


now citizens by virtue of an amendment to the Immigration


and --


citizens?


QUESTION:  What were they before they were


MR. ALBERT:  They were nationals and natives. 


They had no status.  They were very much --


QUESTION:  They were not stateless, were they?


MR. ALBERT:  No, they were not.


QUESTION:  And so why isn't a corporation


organized in the British Virgin Islands or the Cayman


Islands -- why is that stateless?  There's only one State


it can belong to, because these are not independent


sovereigns.  The BVI is not an independent sovereign. 


What State does that -- you tell me that the individual


would belong to the U.K.  What does a corporation belong

to?


MR. ALBERT:  I do not advocate the position that


the Matimak -- the Matimak Court adopted that these


corporations were stateless.  I do not think that that is


essential to the determination below, and I think that it


was a poor choice of words.  There is a State involved. 


The United Kingdom granted to the British Virgin Islands


the authority to adopt a Companies Act, just as United


States territories have authority under statute of


Congress to adopt their own incorporation laws.  That does


not mean that the corporations that are incorporated


within the British Virgin Islands are subjects of, rather


than subject to --


QUESTION:  They belong to some State, and either


they belong to the U.K., or they belong to something that


isn't a sovereign, or they're stateless.  It's got to be


one of those three, so which is it?


MR. ALBERT:  They belong to the United Kingdom,


but that does not answer the statutory question at issue


here, because even if they belong to a kingdom, even if


they belong to the United Kingdom, that does not make the


citizens or subjects of the kingdom.  You can be an alien


and subject -- an alien to the United States, subject to


the kingdom, yet not be a citizen or subject of the United


Kingdom, and that was Congress' choice to make.

Congress --


QUESTION:  Could I ask, the word subject in the


statute just tracks the word subject in the Constitution,


and I -- wasn't the status of the colonists before our


Revolution precisely the same as the status of the British


Virgin Islands?


MR. ALBERT:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  Which would lead me to the inquiry


whether the -- even the revolutionaries considered


themselves subjects of the British Crown.  If they


weren't, I guess they weren't engaging in a revolution


really, were they?


(Laughter.)


MR. ALBERT:  The laughter from the audience in


fact focuses the point here, because that was the


fundamental shift in the understanding of the colonists


and their relationship to the British Government.  Before


the Revolution, the old idea of subjectship was that it


was permanent.  One could never abandon one's subjectship. 


The political idea during the Revolution was a shift


toward the idea of volitional allegiance.


That is, that once the Crown abdicated parts of


its protective authority, then the people no longer were


subjects of the Crown, and the legal basis for the legal


philosophers during the formation -- in the 1774 to 1776

period was to justify how it was that we could throw off


our bonds to the British Crown, and the way in which they


justified it was to say that the King had abdicated, and


therefore, in the words of the Declaration of


Independence, we were no longer his subjects.  What were


we?  Well, there was a --


QUESTION:  But we had been.  We had been.


MR. ALBERT:  Oh, we had been.  We had been.


QUESTION:  We occupied the same status in those


days as the British --


QUESTION:  Why wasn't that status the one that's


comparable to the status of citizens in the Virgin Islands


here --


MR. ALBERT:  Justice --


QUESTION:  -- because they're not claiming that


they've been abandoned by the Crown here.


MR. ALBERT:  Justice Stevens, there are two


places in which that abandonment can come about.  One is


by the people themselves declaring themselves independent,


they saying that those bonds have been thrown off.


QUESTION:  Of course, that hasn't happened here.


MR. ALBERT:  It certainly has not happened here,


but there is another way, because when nations adopt the


idea of volitional allegiance, the new idea of what a


subject is, then the nation itself can change its laws to

determine what the status of its people are.  Here, the


United Kingdom has changed the status of its persons.  The


United Kingdom has moved away from that 18th and 16th,


17th century view of what a subject is and moved to our


view of what a subject is, and the British Nationality Act


explains exactly what these people are.


QUESTION:  The British Nationality Act has


nothing to do with corporations.


MR. ALBERT:  But the British Nationality Act


does have to do with what the people in the British Virgin


Islands are --


QUESTION:  And the other thing they --


MR. ALBERT:  -- and then applies --


QUESTION:  I understand your point there, but --


so I'm cutting you off, but they say that in these places


the Queen appoints the Governor, the Governor is


responsible for internal security, public service, and


court administration, but all the laws they pass in these


places are subject to review by the Foreign Office, the


Commonwealth Office, and then the Queen in Council, which


is a group of particular individuals, that the Legislative


Council swears its allegiance to the Crown before it takes


place, and so they haven't just discarded this place at


all.  They've sort of treated it as we might treat a city


inside a State, or some other kind of semi-independent

entity, and you say to that, what?


MR. ALBERT:  Or more particularly, as we would


treat one of our territories, because the ability of


Congress to legislate for its --


QUESTION:  You mean, people in our Territories


like Puerto Rico, let's say, which is a Commonwealth --


MR. ALBERT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- or Samoa, they are not subjects of


the United States?


MR. ALBERT:  They are not subjects of the United


States.


QUESTION:  They don't owe their allegiance to


the United States, and they're not subject to its laws. 


Which is it?


MR. ALBERT:  The position that has been


advocated here, and I think that the -- and that has been


uniformly advanced by the scholars is that citizenship


versus subjectship is simply -- are simply two sides of


the same coin determin -- describing what the relationship


is of one in either a democracy or a monarchy, and what


has happened in the United Kingdom is that as the country


has evolved from a strict monarchy to a constitutional


monarchy with democratic principles, that the ideas of


subjectship have evolved, and the idea of citizenship has


been incorporated into their law.  This --

 QUESTION:  Do you feel some discomfort in


saying, well, that's what the U.K. law is, and you told us


that what the Companies Act means, when U.K. itself is


telling this Court, you've got it all wrong?  You're


standing before the Court as an interpreter of U.K. law. 


You're riding the whole -- your whole case on what U.K.


law is, and yet the U.K. tells us, you read it wrong.


MR. ALBERT:  I would have thought that had the


United Kingdom had a statute on which it could rely, or


any decision on which it could rely, it would cite them. 


The only authority to which it cites in the record at all


is in the lodging --


QUESTION:  Which -- go ahead.


MR. ALBERT:  Is in the lodging at page L31, an


excerpt from its diplomatic manual which describes the


various categories under the British Nationality Act.


The other authority upon which it relies are its


diplomatic notes in which it asserts that it views these


people as its subjects, but if you look to each citation


of that -- those diplomatic notes, they come not in a


submission to a court, asking a court to determine what


British law is, but in a protest to the State Department


after a case has been decided saying, we don't like the


decision of this court.


Now, I've cited to the -- I've certainly cited

to the text of the British Nationality Act which tells you


where the diplomatic -- where the diplomatic manual


derives its basis.


QUESTION:  Is it a fair summary to say that it's


a litigating position and therefore we do not owe it


Chevron deference?


MR. ALBERT:  I think it is a pure advocacy


position, and it does not deserve --


QUESTION:  Are you arguing for what we might


call a variable definition of subject, that VI residents


are subjects of Great Britain in some cases and not


others?


That is to say, you said earlier that the U.K.


could make a treaty binding on VI residents, VI citizens,


so that you can be subject of Great Britain in some


instances and not others.


MR. ALBERT:  Justice Kennedy, the U.K. itself --


QUESTION:  If I characterize your argument that


way, would that be a proper characterization of your


argument?


MR. ALBERT:  I think that at the second level of


Matimak inquiry, when -- that the Court would necessarily


have to inquire as to whether or not a person is or is not


a subject, and I think that I would be -- I am willing to


concede that Britain could change its statute for general

purposes or for limited purposes so as to give to these


territorial citizens the right to proceed in American


courts, and we would defer to that simply by reason of --


simply for reasons for international comity.


QUESTION:  But doesn't that potential indicate


that there is sovereignty, because --


MR. ALBERT:  Once --


QUESTION:  -- isn't sovereignty the capacity to


exercise power and authority?


MR. ALBERT:  Sovereignty is that power.  The


question is whether or not they are subjects.


I'll give you an example.


QUESTION:  They are subjects because of the


potential of the exercise of that power.


MR. ALBERT:  The land that sits in the middle of


London at Leicester Square, the famous Tolk v. Moxie Land,


is subject to the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, but


that does not make the land a subject, and so the mere


fact that the United Kingdom adopts legislation which


regulates behavior of its people, both within the


metropolitan United Kingdom and within its territories,


does not mean that the people within its territories are


subjects for purposes of 1332, and I say that especially


in light of the fact that as we stand here today the


United Kingdom has adopted a new statute which has not yet

come into force, because a statutory instrument has not


yet been signed for it, which will render the British


Territories' citizens to be British citizens, giving those


British citizens now the right of abode within the United


Kingdom, and that will happen in the future.  It probably


will happen soon, maybe in a matter of months, maybe in a


matter of years, but it has not happened yet, and we


determine subject matter jurisdiction as of the time of


the commencement of --


QUESTION:  How does that affect a corporation? 


You're talking about what will be the status of


individuals.


MR. ALBERT:  I think that a -- that applying --


that the proper way to apply the Letson principle here is


that a British Virgin Islands Corporation should never be


subject to diversity jurisdiction precisely because the


presumption is that its shareholders have opted for


British Virgin Islands status rather than opted for


British status.


QUESTION:  And that would be the case -- it


would be -- the Congress would be immobile as well.  In


order to make -- if I follow your argument correctly, in


order to make a BVI corporation subject to 1332


jurisdiction, there would have to be a constitutional


amendment, because the Constitution uses the same words

for a citizen or subject -- citizen or subject.


MR. ALBERT:  The Second Circuit did not reach


the constitutional --


QUESTION:  That's what I'm putting to you,


because the statute uses the same term, citizens or


subjects.


MR. ALBERT:  I do not think that there is a


presumption in this Court that the use of the same


language in Article 3 and in title 28 means that the


statute has --


QUESTION:  Well, tell me what subject means


within Article 3 that it doesn't mean within 1332 and why


a court should interpret it -- interpret them differently.


MR. ALBERT:  Because if you look to the


Judiciary Act of 1789, which was adopted nearly


contemporaneously, Congress used the broader language,


alien, rather than the narrower language, citizen or


subject, and --


QUESTION:  That's not -- the Constitution says


citizen or subject, doesn't it?


MR. ALBERT:  That's correct, it does, and --


QUESTION:  What does it mean -- what does


subject mean within the Constitution, within Article 3, as


it reads?


MR. ALBERT:  It would be mere speculation on my

part to suggest what it was that they meant, since this


was one of the least debated provisions of the


Constitution.


QUESTION:  But you're urging a certain statutory


interpretation, and you said, well, maybe it has a


different meaning, the word subject, in the Constitution,


so I'm asking you to tell me what could be those different


meanings.


MR. ALBERT:  I think that it is entirely


possible that in 1787 Congress -- the Convention intended


to extend the grant of authority to the full measure of


diversity jurisdiction over cases involving all


foreigners, but the reason that I don't think that they


focused on the issue was because in 1787 there really were


not these cases of -- there were not a lot of cases,


probably no cases in which there were people who lacked


subjectship yet nevertheless were foreigners.


With respect to these trading colonies in


particular, the people who were involved in the mercantile


trade involving these Caribbean colonies were not people


who were resident within those colonies --


QUESTION:  What about Canadians?  Until Canada


domesticated its constitution, I suppose for most of the


19th Century Canadians were not subjects of the Crown?


MR. ALBERT:  I think Canadians were subjects of

the Crown by virtue of the fact that they were in a


settler colony rather than in a plantation, a plantation


colony, and the -- one of the difficulties of the British


law of that entire era is that it never really had a


uni -- it never had a uniform picture of who its persons


were, and what the relationship was between the Crown and


each one of the different types of colonies that were


created, and it was very, very difficult for the -- it was


very difficult for Britain, because Britain had different


types of colonies which promoted different types of


British interests, and therefore it created different


types of Governments within them, and created different


statuses with respect to immigration and migration to


Europe for those people.


QUESTION:  So among the subjects, or -- well,


the entities that are under U.K. sovereignty, which are


those are subjects and which of them are not?


MR. ALBERT:  The ones which are certainly not


subjects right now are those which are the British


Overseas Territories, which include the British Virgin


Islands, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Turks and


Caicos --


QUESTION:  Which ones are?  Which ones are?


MR. ALBERT:  Pardon?

MR. ALBERT:  The Falklands -- the Falklands,


those residents are not British citizens.  They are


British Overseas -- Overseas Territories citizens.


QUESTION:  How about Leicester Square?

MR. ALBERT:  It has no status whatsoever,


because it is property, not a person.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH L. REID


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. REID:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


this Court:


I will try to be brief.  I would like to


separate the inquiry between corporations and then address


natural persons.  Corporations are incorporated through


the laws of their legislative district.  The United

Kingdom's brief details quite clearly how the corporations


are incorporated, rather like our States, corporations in


Northern Ireland are incorporated under the laws of


Northern Ireland.  As I understand respondent's argument,


that would make them stateless entities, because they are


not actually incorporated in Scotland, Wales, or the


United Kingdom.  Clearly, that is an absurd result, given


the presence of the British --


QUESTION:  I think his answer was that if


they're formed under Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland,


they're okay, but if they're formed under BVI, they're


not.


MS. REID:  Right.  I think he may have


inadvertently been in error, because the Northern Ireland


corporations are actually incorporated under a different


law than those of the ones in England, but the point is


the same.  All of these entities incorporate under their


own individual quasi State or district law, all subject to


the Crown, and they all should be analyzed in the


identical way.  They are all subject to and subjects of


the United Kingdom.


In terms of the natural citizens, I just wanted


to point -- the British Nationality Act, of course, has no


applications to corporations, and the analysis that


somehow we should adopt the old Letson rule is

inapplicable both because it's United Kingdom law, we have


no learning -- I mean, United States law, no learning on


what -- how the United Kingdom would do it, but it seems


sensible to adopt the more modern view, but the 1981


Nationality Act, interestingly, in schedule 5 to section


41, in terms of naturalization and becoming a citizen or a


British Overseas Citizen, or a British, what was then


known as Dependent Territory citizen, you're required to


take the following oath of allegiance:  I, name, swear by


Almighty God that on becoming a British Dependent


Territory citizen I will be faithful and bear true


allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs


and successors, according to law.


I submit to you that that is the definition of a


subject, and of allegiance, and that really is --


demonstrates that the United Kingdom has come before this


Court not as a litigation posture, because it has no


interest really in any of these cases, but as a concern


over the fact that its sovereignty is not being recognized


by the judiciary when it has been recognized by the United


States Government in numerous treaties, and again, I won't


read them, but I would simply refer you to the Consular


Convention and footnote 17 of the United Kingdom's brief,


which details the numerous treaties that have been entered


into governing the British Virgin Islands and other of the
