 Those Justices recognized that the record

 There were numerous remedied by Section 2

 MR. REIN:  Well, this is an on-face 

challenge, and might I say, Justice Sotomayor --


we're talking about, it has many more discriminating --
240 discriminatory voting laws that were blocked by 
Section 5 objections.

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And Congress -- Congress 
said that, too.  Nobody -- there isn't anybody in -- on 

 MR. REIN:  Well, I don't agree with your 

premises, but let me just say, number one, when I said 

Williams, said, "If this case were about three States,

Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, those States have 
the worst records, and application of Section 5 to them 
might be okay." 

 MR. REIN:  Justice Ginsburg, Judge Williams 

said that, as he assessed various measures in the 
record, he thought those States might be distinguished. 
He did not say, and he didn't reach the question, 
whether those States should be subject to preclearance. 
In other words, whether on an absolute basis, there was 
sufficient record to subject them --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But think about this State 
11
12  that you're representing, it's about a quarter black, 
13  but Alabama has no black statewide elected officials. 
14  If Congress were to write a formula that looked to the 
15
16  residents, Alabama would be the number one State on the 
17  list. 
 If you factor in unpublished Section 2 
18
19  suits, Alabama would be the number two State on the 
20
21  actions, Alabama would again be the number two State on 
22  the list. 
 I mean, you're objecting to a formula, but

 MR. REIN:  Well, if -- if I might respond 


because I think Justice Sotomayor had a similar 

question, and that is why should this be approached on 

face.  Going back to Katzenbach, and all of the cases 

that have addressed the Voting Rights Act preclearance 
and the formula, they've all been addressed to determine 
the validity of imposing preclearance under the 
circumstances then prevailing, and the formula because 
Shelby County is covered, not by an independent 
determination of Congress with respect to Shelby County, 

1

4

6 
7 
8

10
11  but because it falls within the formula as part of the 
12  State of Alabama.  So I -- I don't think that there's 
13  any reluctance upon on this --
14
15
16  question becomes, why do we strike down a formula, as 
17  Justice Kagan said, which under any circumstance the 
18  record shows the remedy would be congruent, 
19  proportional, rational, whatever standard of review we 
20
21
22  questions.  One is whether the formula needs to be 
23  addressed.  In Northwest Austin, this Court addressed 
24  the formula, and the circumstances there were a very 
small jurisdiction, as the Court said, approaching a 
25

apply, its application to Alabama would happen. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But facial challenges 

are generally disfavored in our law.  And so the 

 MR. REIN:  There -- there are two separate 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

very big question. 


Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Interestingly enough, in 
Katzenbach the Court didn't do what you're asking us to 
do, which is to look at the record of all the other 
States or all of the other counties.  It basically 

 It did the same in Rome, the City of Rome. 

It did the same in Katzenbach.  The -- so the formula 

itself is the reason why Shelby County encounters the 

burdens, and it is the reason why the Court needs to 
address it.

 MR. REIN:  I don't think that --
14
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're asking us to do 
15
16  something, which is to ignore your record and look at 
17  everybody else's. 
18
19  reading of Katzenbach.  In Katzenbach, what the Court 
20
21  in practice and theory.  And what the Court said is, 
22  while we don't have evidence on every jurisdiction 
23  that's reached by the formula, that by devising two 
24  criteria, which were predictive of where discrimination 
25

did was examined whether the -- the formula was rational 

 MR. REIN:  I don't think that's a fair 

might lie, the Congress could then sweep in

 So we're not here to parse the 

 I could tell you that in Alabama the number of 

legislators in the Alabama legislature are proportionate 

jurisdictions as to which it had no specific findings. 

jurisdictions.  We are here to challenge this formula 
because in and of itself it speaks to old data, it isn't 
probative with respect to the kinds of discrimination 
that Congress was focusing on and it is an inappropriate 
vehicle to sort out the sovereignty of individual 
States.

11  to the number of black voters.  There's a very high 
12  registration and turnout of black voters in Alabama. 
13  But I don't think that that really addresses the issue 
14  of the rationality in theory and practice in the 
15
16
17  another hypothetical statute, that would present a 
18  different case.  But we're here facing a county, a State 
19  that are swept in by a formula that is neither rational 
in theory nor in practice.  That's the -- that's the hub 
20
21  of the case. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I suppose the thrust of 
22
23  the questions so far has been if you would be covered 
24  under any formula that most likely would be drawn, why 
25

formula. 

 If Congress wants to write another statute, 

are you injured under this one?

 MR. REIN:  Well, we don't agree that we 


would be covered under any formula. 


 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's -- that's the 


 MR. REIN:  Well, I think that if -- if 

Congress has the power to look at jurisdictions like 
Shelby County, individually and without regard to how 

hypothesis.  If you could be covered under most 

suggested formulas for this kind of statute, why are you 
injured by this one?  I think that's the thrust of the 
question.

12  States, in other words, what is the discrimination here 
13  among the jurisdictions, and after thoroughly 
14  considering each and every one comes up with a list and 
says this list gravely troubles us, that might present a 
15
16  vehicle for saying this is a way to sort out the covered 
17  jurisdictions --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose Congress passed a 
18
19  law that said, everyone whose last name begins with A 
20
21  that tax is challenged by somebody whose last name 
22  begins with A.  Would it be a defense to that challenge 
23  that for some reason this particular person really 
24  should pay a $1,000 penalty that people with a different 
25

shall pay a special tax of $1,000 a year.  And let's say 

last name do not pay? 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. REIN:  No, because that would just 


invent another statute, and this is all a debate as to 

whether somebody might invent a statute which has a 

formula that is rational. 


JUSTICE SCALIA:  I was about to ask a 

similar question.  If someone is acquitted of a Federal 
crime, would it -- would the prosecution be able to say, 
well, okay, he didn't commit this crime, but Congress 
could have enacted a different statute which he would 
have violated in this case.  Of course, you wouldn't

11  listen to that, would you? 
12

14  hypotheticals is obvious that it starts from a predicate 
15
16  there's no question that Alabama was rightly included in 
17  the original Voting Rights Act.  There's no challenge to 
18  the reauthorization acts.  The only question is whether 
19  a formula should be applied today.  And the point is 
that the record is replete with evidence to show that 
20
21  you should. 
22
23
24  some made-up reason for why the $1,000 is being applied 
to you or why a different crime is going to be charged 
25

 MR. REIN:  No, I agree with you. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem with those 

 MR. REIN:  Well, I mean --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not like there's 

that the application has no basis in any record, but 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 There's no independent determination by the 

Congress that Alabama singly should be covered. 
Congress has up -- you know, has readopted the formula 

against you.  It's a real record as to what Alabama has 
done to earn its place on the list. 

 MR. REIN:  Justice Sotomayor, with all 
respect, the question whether Alabama was properly 
placed under the act in 1964 was -- it was answered in 
Katzenbach because it came under a formula then deemed 
to be rational in theory and in practice.

11  and it is the formula that covers Alabama and thus 
12  Shelby County --
13
14  formula -- of course, part of the formula looks back to 
15
16  jurisdiction that did engage in testing and had low 
17  turnout or -- or low registration?  Now, that isn't true 
18  of Alabama today. 
 MR. REIN:  That's correct.  That's correct. 
19
JUSTICE BREYER:  So when Congress in fact 
20
21  reenacted this in 2005, it knew what it was doing was 
22  picking out Alabama.  It understood it was picking out 
23  Alabama, even though the indicia are not -- I mean, even 
24  though they're not engaging in that particular thing. 
But the underlying evil is the discrimination.  So the 
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, the reason for the 

what happened in 1965.  And it says are you a 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

closest analogy I could think of is imagine a State has 
a plant disease and in 1965 you can recognize the 
presence of that disease, which is hard to find, by a 
certain kind of surface movement or plant growing up. 
Now, it's evolved.  So by now, when we use 
that same formula, all we're doing is picking out that 
State.  But we know one thing:  The disease is still 
there in the State.  Because this is a question of 
renewing a statute that in fact has worked.  And so the 
question I guess is, is it rational to pick out at least 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5
6 
7 
8 
9 
10
11  some of those States?  And to go back to Justice 
12  Sotomayor's question, as long as it's rational in at 
13  least some instances directly to pick out those States, 
14  at least one or two of them, then doesn't the statute 
15
16
17  couple of things are important.  The Court said in 
18  Northwest Austin, an opinion you joined, "Current needs 
19  have to generate the current burden."  So what happened 
in 1965 in Alabama, that Alabama itself has said was a 
20
21  disgrace, doesn't justify a current burden. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But this is then the 
22
23  question, does it justify?  I mean, this isn't a 
24  question of rewriting the statute.  This is a question 
25

of renewing a statute that by and large has worked. 

survive a facial challenge?  That's the question. 

 MR. REIN:  Thank you.  Justice Breyer, a 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. REIN:  Justice Breyer --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And if you have a statute 
that sunsets, you might say, I don't want it to sunset 
if it's worked, as long as the problem is still there to 
some degree.  That's the question of rationality.  Isn't 
that what happened? 

1
2
3 
4 
5
6 
 MR. REIN:  If you base it on the findings of 
7
1965.  I could take the decision in City of Rome, which 
8 
follows along that line.  We had a huge problem at the 
9 
first passage of the Voting Rights Act and the Court was 
10
11  tolerant of Congress's decision that it had not yet been 
12  cured.  There were vestiges of discrimination. 
 So when I look at those statistics today and 
13
14  look at what Alabama has in terms of black registration 
and turnout, there's no resemblance.  We're dealing with 
15
16  a completely changed situation --
17
18
19  metrics -- excuse me. 
20
21  emphasizing over and over again in your brief, 
22  registration and you said it a couple of times this 
23  morning.  Congress was well aware that registration was 
24  no longer the problem.  This legislative record is 
25

replete with what they call second generation devices.

Congress said up front:  We know that the registration 

is fine.  That is no longer the problem.  But the 

discrimination continues in other forms. 


 MR. REIN:  Let me speak to that because I 

think that that highlights one of the weaknesses here. 

On the one hand, Justice Breyer's questioning, well, 

could Congress just continue based on what it found in 

'65 and renew?  And I think your question shows it's a 

very different situation.  Congress is not continuing 

its efforts initiated in 1975 to allow people --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, the reason 
11
12  Section 5 was created was because States were moving 
13  faster than litigation permitted to catch the new forms 
14  of discriminatory practices that were being developed. 
15
16  find another.  And basically, Justice Ginsburg calls it 
17  secondary.  I don't know that I'd call anything 
18  secondary or primary.  Discrimination is discrimination. 
 And what Congress said is it continues, not 
19
in terms of voter numbers, but in terms of examples of 
20
21  other ways to disenfranchise voters, like moving a 
22  voting booth from a convenient location for all voters 
23  to a place that historically has been known for 
24  discrimination.  I think that's an example taken from 
25

As the courts struck down one form, the States would 

one of the Section 2 and 5 cases from Alabama.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, I don't know 
what the difference is except that this Court or some 
may think that secondary is not important.  But the form 
of discrimination is still discrimination if Congress 
has found it to be so.

reasonably think this:  It's an old disease, it's gotten

11  a lot better, a lot better, but it's still there.  So if 
12  you had a remedy that really helped it work, but it 
13  wasn't totally over, wouldn't you keep that remedy? 
 MR. REIN:  Well --

17  has worked for that old disease which is not yet dead,

21  that the old disease, limiting people's right to register

11  has said the Fourteenth Amendment does, but the original 
12  enactment was under the Fifteenth Amendment.

15
 MR. REIN:  Well, "abridgement" might mean, 
16
17  for example, I let you vote in one election, but not in 
18  another; for example, separate primary rules from 
19  election rules.  Abridgement can be done in many ways. 
I think dilution is a different concept. 
20
21  We're not saying that dilution isn't covered by the 
22  Fourteenth Amendment, but I was responding to 
23  Justice Breyer in saying there was an old disease and 
24  that disease is cured.  If you want to label it

"disease" and generalize it, you can say, well, the new

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, some of --

 MR. REIN:  But I think that's not what 


asked to this point I think mirror what the government 

says toward the end of its brief, page 48 and page 49. 

It's rather proud of this reverse engineering:  We 

really knew it was some specific States we were 

interested in, and so we used these old categories to

14  proportionality? 
15
16  all, I don't accept that it was, quote, "reverse 
17  engineered."  I think it was just, as Justice Breyer 
18  indicated, continued because it was there.  If you look 
19  at what was done and was approved in 1964, what Congress 
20
21  We've examined them in detail.  We've identified the 
22  characteristics that would let somebody say, yes, that's 
23  where the discrimination is ripe.  They're using a 
24  tester device.  The turnout is below the national 
25

average by a substantial margin.  That spells it out and 

 Is that a methodology that in your view is

said, well, here are the problem areas that we detect.

we have a relief valve in the then-existing bailout.  So 
it was all very rational. 

 Here you'd have to say is the finding with 
respect to every State -- Alaska, Arizona, the covered 
jurisdictions in New York City -- is the designation of 
them congruent to the problem that you detect in each 
one?  Even assuming -- and we don't accept -- that any 
of these problems require the kind of extraordinary 
relief, what's the congruence and what's the 
proportionality of this remedy to the violation you

under the equal footing doctrine it would be proper to 
just single out States by name, and if that, in effect,

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the formula that 


has --


Justice Kennedy, is Congress cannot arbitrarily pick out 
States.  Congress has to treat each State with equal 
dignity.  It has to examine all the States.  The 
teaching of Katzenbach is that when Congress has done 
that kind of examination, it can devise a formula even 

if it understands that that formula will not apply 

across all 50 States.

MR. REIN:  So we accept Katzenbach.  But in 
10
11  terms of just picking out States and saying, I'm going 
12  to look at you and I'm going to look at you, no, that --
13  that does not protect the equal dignity of the States. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Rein, the formula 
14
that -- that is applied right now, under that formula 
15
16  covered jurisdictions, which have less than 25 percent 
17  of the nation's total population, they account for 
18  56 percent of all successful published Section 2 
19  lawsuits. 
20
21  successful Section 2 lawsuits, four times higher in 
22  covered jurisdictions than in noncovered jurisdictions. 
23  So the formula -- you can -- you know, say maybe this 
24  district shouldn't be covered, maybe this one should be 
25

If you do that on a per capita basis, the 

covered. 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 The formula seems to be working pretty well 

in terms of going after the actual violations on the 
ground and who's committing them. 

 MR. REIN:  There are -- there are two 
fallacies, Justice Kagan, in -- in that statement. 
Number one is treating the covered jurisdictions as some 
kind of entity, a lump:  Let us treat them.  And as 
Judge Williams did in his dissent, if you look at them 
one by one, giving them their equal dignity, you won't 
reach the same result.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, all formulas are 
11
12  underinclusive and all formulas are overinclusive. 
13  Congress has developed this formula and has continued it 
14  in use that actually seems to work pretty well in 
targeting the places where there are the most successful 
15
16  Section 2 lawsuits, where there are the most violations 
17  on the ground that have been adjudicated. 
 MR. REIN:  Well, if -- if you look at the 
18
19  analysis State by State done by Judge Williams, that 
isn't true.  Congress has picked out some States that 
20
21  fall at the top and some that do not, and there are 
22  other States like Illinois or Tennessee, and I don't 
23  think they deserve preclearance, that clearly have 
24  comparable records. 
25

And second, dividing by population may make

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it happens not to be 

the method that Congress selected. 

 MR. REIN:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If they selected that, you 

it look it look better, but it is irrational.  It is not 

only irrational when we object to it, but note that in 

the brief of the Harris Respondent they say it's 

irrational because, after all, that makes Delaware, a 

small State, look worse on the list of who are the primary 
violators.  It's not a useful metric.  It may make a 
nice number.  But there is no justification for that 
metric.

 MR. REIN:  Well --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is this an effective 


MR. REIN:  It is -- number one, it is 

effective.  There are preliminary injunctions.  It 

depends on the kind of dispute you have.  Some of them 

are very complex, and it would be complex if somebody 

brought -- a State brought a Section 5 challenge in a 

three-judge court saying the attorney general's denied 

1

12  question, not the nature of Section 2. 
 And might I say, if you look at the Voting 
13
14  Rights Act, one thing that really stands out is you are 
15
16  practices in their law.  The remedy Congress put in 
17  place for those States was Section 2.  And all across 
18  the country, when you talk about equal sovereignty, if 
19  there is a problem in Ohio the remedy is Section 2.  So 
20
21  remedy, it could look to the specifics of Section 2 and 
22  say, maybe we ought to put timetables in there or modify 
23  it.

 But that's not what happened.  They 

reenacted Section 2 just as it stood.  So I think that

Section 2 covers even more broadly because it deals with 
results, which the Court has said is broader than 
effects.  It's an effective remedy, and I think at this 
point, given the record, given the history, the right 
thing to do is go forward under Section 2 and remove the 
stigma of prior restraint and preclearance from the 
States and the unequal application based on data that 
has no better history than 1972.

11  Katzenbach the Court said, "The doctrine of the equality

13  this approach, for that doctrine applies only to the 
14  terms upon which States are admitted to the Union and 
15
16  subsequently appeared."  That's what -- has the Court 
17  changed that interpretation? 
 MR. REIN:  I think that that referred in 
18
19  Katzenbach -- I'm familiar with that statement.  It 
20
21  not -- you are selecting out.  The Court felt the 
22  formula was rational in theory and practice and 
23  therefore it didn't, on its face, remove the equality of 
24  the States.  They were all assessed under the same two 
criteria.  Some passed, some did not.  But I think that 
25

referred to the fact that once you use a formula you are

that really doesn't mask the need for equal treatment of 
the sovereign States. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm going to have a hard 
time with that because you can't be suggesting that the 
government sees a problem in one or more States and 
decides it's going to do something for them and not for 
others, like emergency relief, and that that somehow 
violates the equal footing doctrine.  You can't treat 
States the same because their problems are different, 
their populations are different, their needs are

 MR. REIN:  Well, I think when Congress uses 
12
13  the powers delegated under Article I, Section 8, it has 
14  substantial latitude in how it exercises the power.  We 
are talking about remedial power here.  We are talking 
15
16  about overriding powers that are reserved to the States 
17  to correct abuse.  When Congress does that, it has to 
18  treat them equally.  It can't say --
19
20
21  Katzenbach and City of Rome?  Do you think the City of 
22  Boerne now controls both Fourteen -- the Fourteenth and 
23  the Fifteenth Amendment and how we look at any case that 
24  arises under them?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would you tell me what 

you think is left of the rational means test in

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And then I think you have to ask the 

question:  All right -- you know, is this killing a fly 

the two tests have a lot in common because in City of 

Boerne, the Katzenbach decision was pointed out as a 

model of asking the questions that congruence in 

proportionality ask us to address.  Number one, how 

does this remedy meet findings of constitutional 
violation?  You've got to ask that question.  They asked 
that question in Katzenbach.  What is the relation 
between the two?

11  with a sledgehammer, a fair question because when you 
12  start to invade core functions of the States, I think 
13  that a great deal of caution and care is required.  So I 
14  think that the rational basis test, the McCulloch test, 
15
16
17  defends under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment 
18  saying, well, if something doesn't violate the 
19  Fifteenth, it violates the Fourteenth.  And the Court's 
precedent under the Fourteenth Amendment is very clear 
20
21  that the City of Boerne congruence and proportionality 
22  test applies.  The Court has applied it, but I don't 
23  think we -- we wouldn't really need to get that far 
24  because we believe that if you examine it under

 There's a fundamental point that needs to be

14  its amici, this Court in Northwest Austin, that the 
15
16  the culture of blatantly racist vote suppression that 
17  characterized parts of this country for a century. 
 Section 5 preclearance was the principal 
18
19  engine of that progress.  And it has always been true 
that only a tiny fraction of submissions under Section 5 
20
21  result in objections.  So that progress under Section 5 
22  that follows from that has been as a result of the 
23  deterrence and the constraint Section 5 imposes on 
24  States and subjurisdictions and not on the actual 
25

Voting Rights Act made a huge difference in transforming 

enforcement by means of objection.

 Now, when Congress faced the question 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I ask you just a 

whether to reauthorize Section 5 in 2006, it had to 
decide whether the -- whether it could be confident that 
the attitudes and behaviors in covered jurisdictions had 
changed enough that that very effective constraint and 

deterrence could be confidently removed.  And Congress 

had, as Judge Kagan identified earlier, a very 

substantial record of continuing need before it when

only a tiny fraction of submissions result in 
objections. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that will always be true 

forever into the future.  You could always say, oh, 
there has been improvement, but the only reason there 
has been improvement are these extraordinary procedures

in view of the record of continuing need and in view of 
that history, which we acknowledge is not sufficient on 
its own to justify reenactment, but it's certainly 
relevant to the judgment Congress made because it 
justifies Congress having made a cautious choice in 2006

should be covered.  Or maybe certain parts of the 

country should be covered based on a formula that is 

grounded in up-to-date statistics. 


 But why -- why wasn't that required by the 

congruence and proportionality standards?  Suppose that 
Congress in 1965 had based the coverage formula on 
voting statistics from 1919, 46 years earlier.  Do you

22  evidence about disproportionate results in Section 2

that you seem so proud of, it seems to me that that 
obscures the -- the real purpose of -- of the statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What the question --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Verrilli, could 

you respond to the question that Justice Kennedy asked 

earlier, which was for why isn't Section 2 enough now? 

The government could bring Section 2 claims if it seeks 
privately to do.  Why isn't -- he asked if it was 
expensive.  You heard the question, so.

11  Section 5 because what Section 5 does is shift the 
12  burden of inertia.  And there's a -- I think it is 
13  self-evident that Section 2 cannot do the work of 
14  Section 5. 
15
16  That in fact is the most frequent type of Section 5 
17  submission, polling place changes.  Now, changes in the 
18  polling places at the last minute before an election can 
19  be a source of great mischief.  Closing polling places, 
20
 What Section 5 does is require those kinds 
21
22  of changes to be pre-cleared and on a 60-day calendar, 
23  which effectively prevents that kind of mischief.  And 
24  there is no way in the world you could use Section 2 to

Take one example:  Polling place changes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I do think the

insufficient and that Section 5 was utterly necessary in 
1965.  No doubt about that.

understanding of -- of the dangers of polling place

10
11  injunctions, it's not clear -- and -- and with the fact 
12  that the government itself can commence these suits, 
13  it's not clear to me that there's that much difference 
14  in a Section 2 suit now and preclearance.  I may be 
wrong about that.  I don't have statistics for it. 
15
16  That's why we're asking. 
17
18  really think that that conclusion follows.  I think 
19  these under the -- there are thousands and thousands of 
these under-the-radar screen changes, the polling places 
20
21  and registration techniques, et cetera.  And in most of 
22  those I submit, Your Honor, the -- the cost-benefit 
23  ratio is going to be, given the cost of this litigation, 
24  which one of the -- one of the reasons Katzenbach said 
25

Section 5 was necessary, is going to tilt strongly 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I -- I don't -- I don't 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 Even with respect to the big ticket items, 


the big redistrictings, I think the logic Katzenbach 

holds in that those suits are extremely expensive and 

they typically result in after-the-fact litigation. 

 Now, it is true, and the Petitioners raised 
the notion that there could be a preliminary injunction, 
but I really think the Petitioner's argument that 
Section 2 is a satisfactory and complete substitute for 
Section 5 rests entirely on their ability to demonstrate 

1 
2

8 
9 
10
11  that preliminary injunctions can do comparable work to 
12  what Section 5 does.  They haven't made any effort to do 
13  that.  And while I don't have statistics for you, I can 
14  tell you that the Civil Rights Division tells me that 
15
16  of ultimately successful Section 2 suits was there a 
17  preliminary injunction issued. 
18
19  certainly given the weighty question before this Court 
of the constitutionality of this law, to the extent the 
20
21  argument is that Section 2 is a valid substitute for 
22  Section 5, I just don't think that the -- that the 
23  Petitioners have given the Court anything that allows 
24  the Court to reach that conclusion and of course --
25

it's their understanding that in fewer than one-quarter 

 So I don't think that there's a basis, 

against bringing these suits.

18  bigger problem in Arizona than Nevada, or in the Bronx

GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think the combination 
20
21  of the history, which I concede is not dispositive, but 
22  is relevant because it suggests caution is in order and 
23  that's a reasonable judgment on the part of Congress,

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the statistics that I 
have before me show that in, let's say the 5 years prior

15

17  is not just the population judgment that Mr. Rein was 
18  critical of, the fact is, and I think this is in the 
19  Katz amicus brief, that the covered jurisdictions 
contain only 14 percent of the subjurisdictions in the 
20
21  nation.  And so 14 percent of the subjurisdictions in 
22  the nation are generating up to 81 percent of the 
23  successful Section 2 litigation.  And I think --

1
just want to be sure that I hear your answer to an

allegation, argument, an excellent argument, that's been 
3 
made, or at least as I've picked up, and that is that: 
4 
Yes, the problem was terrible; it has gotten a lot 

5
better; it is not to some degree cured.  All right?  I 

6 
think there is a kind of common ground.  Now then the 

7 
question is:  Well, what about this statute that has a 

8 
certain formula?  One response is:  Yes, it has a 

9 
formula that no longer has tremendous relevance in terms 
10
11  of its characteristic -- that is literacy tests.  But it 
12  still picked out nine States.  So, so far, you're with 
13  me. 
14
know, you don't sunset it.  You just keep it going. 
15
16  You're not held to quite the same criteria as if you

if he's right that there is an irrationality involved if 
you were writing it today in treating State A, which is 
not too discriminatorily worse than apparently 
Massachusetts or something.  All right?  So -- so if 
that's true, do we respond State by State?  Or is this a 
matter we should consider not as applied, but on its 
face?

12  responses, Justice Breyer.  The first is one that 
13  focuses on the practical operation of the law and the 
14  consequences that flow from it.  I do not think that 
Shelby County or Alabama ought to be able to bring a 
15
16  successful facial challenge against this law on the 
17  basis that it ought not to have covered Arizona or 
18  Alaska.  The statute has bailout mechanism.  Those 
19  jurisdictions can try to avail themselves of it.  And if 
they do and it doesn't work, then they -- they may very 
20
21  well have an as-applied challenge that they can bring to 
22  the law.  But that doesn't justify -- given the 
23  structure of the law and that there is a tailoring 
24  mechanism in it, it doesn't justify Alabama --

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Congress's decision in 
2006 to reenact the geographic coverage was congruent 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  To -- to the problem 

understand the distinction between facial and as-applied 
when you are talking about a formula.  As applied to 
Shelby County, they are covered because of the formula, 
so they're challenging the formula as applied to them. 
And we've heard some discussion.  I'm not even sure what 
your position is on the formula.  Is the formula 
congruent and proportional today, or do you have this 
reverse engineering argument?

17  has found four different times that the formula was 
18  congruent and proportional.  And the same kinds of 
19  problems that Mr. Rein is identifying now were --

21

23  were eliminated by the statute, so no -- no jurisdiction 
24  could have tests and devices.  And City of Rome itself

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

substantially ameliorated by then, but there were 
additional kinds of problems.  The ascent of these 
second-generation problems was true in City of Rome as a 
justification that made it congruent and proportional. 

And we submit that it's still true now, that 

Congress wasn't writing on a blank slate in 2006. 
Congress was making a judgment about whether this 
formula, which everyone agrees, and in fact Mr. Rein's 
case depends on the proposition that Section 5 was a big 
success.

12  that judgment, Mr. Verrilli.  But that's -- that's a 
13  problem that I have.  This Court doesn't like to get 
14  involved in -- in racial questions such as this one. 
It's something that can be left -- left to Congress. 
15
 The problem here, however, is suggested by 
16
17  the comment I made earlier, that the initial enactment 
18  of this legislation in a -- in a time when the need for 
19  it was so much more abundantly clear was -- in the 
20
21  that was only a 5-year term. 
22
23  for a 5-year term.  Double-digits against it in the 
24  Senate.  Then it was reenacted for 7 years.  Single 
25

digits against it.  Then enacted for 25 years, 8 Senate 

Senate, there -- it was double-digits against it.  And 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, maybe it was making 

 Then, it is reenacted 5 years later, again

votes against it. 

 And this last enactment, not a single vote 
in the Senate against it.  And the House is pretty much 
the same.  Now, I don't think that's attributable to the 
fact that it is so much clearer now that we need this. 
I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to 
a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial 
entitlement.  It's been written about.  Whenever a 
society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult 
to get out of them through the normal political 

1

11  processes. 
 I don't think there is anything to be gained 
12
13  by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act. 
14  And I am fairly confident it will be reenacted in 
perpetuity unless -- unless a court can say it does not 
15
16  comport with the Constitution.  You have to show, when 
17  you are treating different States differently, that 
18  there's a good reason for it. 
 That's the -- that's the concern that those 
19
of us who -- who have some questions about this statute 
20
21  have.  It's -- it's a concern that this is not the kind 
22  of a question you can leave to Congress.  There are 
23  certain districts in the House that are black districts

they have no interest in voting against this.  The State

14  the enforcement power that the Constitution gives to the 
Congress to make these judgments to ensure protection of 
15
16  fundamental rights.  So this is -- this is a situation 
17  in which Congress is given a power which is expressly 
18  given to it to act upon the States in their sovereign 
19  capacity.  And it cannot have been lost on the framers 
20

to look behind the judgment of Congress as expressed in

any sense. 

of power, we do think it is a grant of power to Congress 
to make these judgments, now of course subject to review 
by this Court under the standard of Northwest Austin, 
which we agree is an appropriate standard.  That's the 
first point.

14  I'm talking about looking at it to see whether it makes

16
17  think that the deference that Congress is owed, as City 
18  of Boerne said, "much deference" -- Katzenbach said 
19  "much deference."  That deference is appropriate because 
of the nature of the power that has been conferred here 
20
21  and because, frankly, of the superior institutional 
22  competence of Congress to make these kinds of judgments. 
23  These are judgments that assess social conditions. 
24  These are predictive judgments about human behavior and 
they're predictive judgments about social conditions and

Congress know the most about, which is voting and the 
political process. 

 And I would also say I understand your point 

about entrenchment, Justice Scalia, but certainly with 
respect to the Senate, you just can't say that it's in 
everybody's interests -- that -- that the enforcement of 
Section 5 is going to make it easier for some of those 
Senators to win and it's going to make it harder for 
some of those Senators to win.  And yet they voted

appropriate for -- for Congress to have exercised this

11  express constitutional authority when it did in 1965, 
12  and everybody agrees that it was the -- was the exercise 
13  of that authority that brought about the situation where 
14  we can now argue about whether it's still necessary. 
And the point, I think, is of fundamental 
15
16  importance here is that that history remains relevant. 
17  What Congress did was make a cautious choice in 2006 
18  that given the record before it and given the history, 
19  the more prudent course was to maintain the deterrent 
and constraining effect of Section 5, even given the 
20

We're defending it as a facial challenge,

the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act 
illustrates two essential points about the nature and 
continuing aspects of voting discrimination in the 
affected areas.  The first speaks to this question of 
whether Section 2 was adequate standing alone.

19  you use Section 5.  The issue is why just in these 
20
 MR. ADEGBILE:  Fair enough.  It's beyond a 
21
22  question of being true in any place.  Our brief shows 
23  that specifically in the covered jurisdictions, there is 
24  a pattern, a demonstrated pattern of Section 2 and 5 
being used in tandem whereas in other jurisdictions,

most of the Section 2 cases are one-off examples. 

 We point to a whole number of examples. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But a Section 2 case can, 
in effect, have an order for bail-in, correct me if I'm 

Take for example Selma, Alabama.  Selma, Alabama in the 
1990s, not in the 1960s but in the 1990s, had a series 
of objections and Section 2 activity and observers all 
that were necessary to continue to give effect to the 
minority inclusion principle that Section 5 was passed 
to vindicate in 1965.

11  wrong, under Section 3 and then you basically have a 
12  mini -- something that replicates Section 5. 
 MR. ADEGBILE:  The bail-in is available --
13
14  bail-in is available if there's an actual finding of a 
constitutional violation.  It has been used in -- in a 
15
16  number of circumstances.  The United States brief has an 
17  appendix that points to those.  One of the recent ones 
18  was in Port Chester, New York, if memory serves.  But 
19  it's quite clear that the pattern in the covered 
20
21  discrimination in those places -- take, for example, the 
22  case in LULAC. 
 After this Court ruled that the 
23
24  redistricting plan, after the 2000 round of 
redistricting, bore the mark of intentional 
25

jurisdictions is such that the repetitive nature of 

54

discrimination, in the remedial election, the State of 
Texas tried to shorten and constrain the early voting 
period for purposes of denying the Latino community of 
the opportunity to have the benefits of the ruling. 

What we've seen in Section 2 cases is that 
the benefits of discrimination vest in incumbents who 
would not be there, but for the discriminatory plan. 
And Congress, and specifically in the House Report, I 
believe it's page 57, found that Section 2 continues to 
be an inadequate remedy to address the problem of these

10
11  successive violations. 
 Another example that makes this point very 
12
13  clearly is in the 1990s in Mississippi.  There was an 
14  important Section 2 case brought, finally after 
100 years, to break down the dual registration system 
15
16  that had a discriminatory purpose.  When Mississippi 
17  went to implement the National Voter Registration Act, 
18  it tried to bring back dual registration, and it was 
19  Section 5 -- Section 5 enforcement action that was able 
20
21
22  the reverse engineering argument that the United States 
23  has made today? 
24
25

 MR. ADEGBILE:  I would frame it slightly 

differently, Chief Justice Roberts.  My understanding is 

to knock it down. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you agree with 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess -- I guess 

the question is whether or not that disparity is 

that the history bears some importance in the context of 
the reauthorizations, but that Congress in -- in none of 
the reauthorizations stopped with the historical 
backward look.  It takes cognizance of the experience, 
but it also looks to see what the experience has been on 
the ground.  And what Congress saw in 2006 is that there 
was a surprisingly high number of continuing objections 
after the 1982 reauthorization period and that --

11  sufficient to justify the differential treatment under

13  it has to be reverse engineered and -- and not simply 
14  justified on its own, then it seems to me you have a

16  under Section 5. 
17

19  and I think there are two principal sources of evidence.

21  congruent and proportional. 
22
23  understand those things to be unrelated.  I think that 
24  they're part of the same, same test, same evaluative

much harder test to justify the differential treatment

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

question is, is Congress remedying something or is it 
creating a new right.  That's essentially what Boerne is 
getting to, is Congress trying to go -- do an 
end-around, a back doorway to expand the Constitution. 
We know in this area Congress is trying to implement the 
Fifteenth Amendment and the history tells us something 
about that.  But specifically to the question --

1

3 
4 
5
6

10
11  limited, right? 
12
13  Court's cases have held that Congress, in proper 
14  exercise of its remedial powers, can reach beyond the --
15
16  prophylactic effect when they have demonstrated that a 
17  substantial problem exists. 
18
19  issue about the disparity in coverage and continuing to 
cover these jurisdictions, there are two major inputs. 
20
21  The first is the Section 5 activity.  The Section 5 
22  activity shows that the problem persists.  It's a range 
23  of different obstacles, and Section 5 was passed to 
24  reach the next discriminatory thing.  The case in --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Section 5 -- the 
25

the core of the intentional discrimination with 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the Fifteenth 
Amendment is limited to intentional discrimination, and, 
of course, the preclearance requirement is not so 

 MR. ADEGBILE:  That's correct.  But this 

 The -- the two things that speak to this 

57
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

MR. ADEGBILE:  Absolutely, Justice Alito. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  All right. 
 MR. ADEGBILE:  And so I come to my second 

category.  The second category, of course, is the piece 
of the Voting Rights Act that has national application, 
Section 2.  And what the evidence in this case shows, 

Section 5 activity may show that there's a problem in 
the jurisdictions covered by Section 5, but it says 
nothing about the presence or absence of similar 
problems in noncovered jurisdictions, isn't that right? 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5
6
7
8 
9 
10
11  and it was before Congress, is that the concentration of 
12  Section 2 successes in the covered jurisdictions is 
13  substantially more.  Justice Kagan said that it was four 
14  times more adjusting for population data. 
The fact of the matter is that there is 
15
16  another piece of evidence in the record in this case 
17  where Peyton McCrary looks at all of the Section 
18  2 cases, and what he shows is that the directional 
19  sense, that the Ellen Katz study pointed to dramatically 
20
21  he found that 81 percent --
22
23  noncovered States are worse in that regard than the nine 
24  covered States, is that correct? 
25

understates the disparity under Section 2.  And so 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think all of the 

MR. ADEGBILE:  Justice Scalia --

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

is worse. 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Every -- every one of them 

 MR. ADEGBILE:  Justice Scalia, it's -- it's 

MR. ADEGBILE:  What we see in the evidence 

a fair question, and -- and I was speaking to the 
aggregate --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not just a fair one, 
it's the crucial question.  Congress has selected these 
nine States.  Now, is there some good reason for 
selecting these nine? 

1

5
6
7 
8 
9 
10
11  is that of the top eight States with section --
12  favorable Section 2 outcomes, seven of them, seven of 
13  them are the covered jurisdictions.  The eighth was 
14  bailed in under the other part of the mechanism that, as 
15
16  jurisdictions that have special problems in voting.  And 
17  so we think that that points to the fact that this is 
18  not a static statute, it's a statute that is --
19
20
21  States that are in, at least some of those States have a 
22  better record than some of the States that are out.  So 
23  in 1965, well, we have history.  We have 200 years or 
24  perhaps of slavery.  We have 80 years or so of legal 
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but his point, I think 

the point is this:  If you draw a red line around the 

segregation.  We have had 41 years of this statute.  And 

Justice Kennedy points out, can bring in some 

59
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

this statute has helped, a lot. 

Official 

 So therefore Congress in 2005 looks back and 

says don't change horses in the middle of the stream 
because we still have a ways to go. 

Now the question is, is it rational to do 

that?  And people could differ on that.  And one thing 

to say is, of course this is aimed at States.  What do 

you think the Civil War was about?  Of course it was 

aimed at treating some States differently than others. 

And at some point that historical and practical

13  has it run out now? 
14
15
16  That's something you have heard people worried about. 
17  Does it never run out?  Or does it run out, but not yet? 
18  Or do we have a clear case where at least it doesn't run 
19  out now? 
20
21
22  I think that the -- what the evidence shows before 
23  Congress is that it hasn't run out yet.  The whole 
24  purpose of this act is that we made progress and 
25

 And now you tell me when does it run out? 

What is the standard for when it runs out?  Never? 

Now, I would like you to address that. 
 MR. ADEGBILE:  Fair enough, Justice Breyer. 

Congress recognized the progress that we made.  And, for

example, they took away the examiner provision which was 
designed to address the registration problem. 

 In terms of when we are there, I think it 
will be some point in the future.  Our great hope is 
that by the end of this next reauthorization we won't be 
there.  Indeed, there is an overlooked provision that 
says in 15 years, which is now 9 years from where I 
stand here today before you, Congress should go back and 
look and see is it still necessary.

12  case in which a Federal judge in Alabama cited this 
13  Court's opinion in Northwest Austin -- there were 
14  legislators that sit today that were caught on tape 
referring to African American voters as illiterates.

16  Their peers were referring to them as aborigines.

That problem is solved on an absolute, as well as, a 
relative basis.  So that's like saying if I detect that 
there is a disease afoot in the population in 1965 and I 
have a treatment, a radical treatment that may help cure 
that disease, when it comes to 2005 and I see a new 
disease or I think the old disease is gone, there is a

I did not think that that fell within our bailiwick. 

Justice Kagan.  What I said is, based on the record made 
by the Congress, you have the power, and certainly it 
was recognized in Northwest Austin, to determine whether 
that record justifies the discrimination among --

12  tests, et cetera.  But I suspect the problem was the 
13  denial or abridgement by a State of the right to vote on 
14  the basis of race and color.  And that test was a way of 
15
16
17  problem, it certainly is not solved.  If your version of 
18  the problem, literacy tests, is the problem, well, you 
19  have a much stronger case.  So how, in your opinion, do 
20
21  addressing in the Voting Rights Act? 
22
23  and you look at the evidence within the four corners of 
24  the Voting Rights Act.  It responds to limited 
25

picking out places where that problem existed. 

 Now, if my version of the problem is the 

we decide what was the problem that Congress was

registration and voting as measured and the use of

Alderson Reporting Company 

 The devices are gone.  That problem has been 

resolved by the Congress definitively.  So it can't be 
the basis for further -- further legislation. 

I think what we are talking about here is 
that Congress looks and says, well, we did solve that 
problem.  As everyone agrees, it's been very effective, 
Section 5 has done its work.  People are registering and 
voting and, coming to Justice Scalia's point, Senators 
who see that a very large group in the population has

of the efficacy of Section 5.  You have a different 
15
16  constituency from the constituency you had in 1964. 
17
18  there is discrimination, you have to examine that 
19  nationwide.  They didn't look at some of the problems of 
dilution and the like because they would have found them
