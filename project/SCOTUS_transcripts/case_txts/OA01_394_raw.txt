CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-394, Warren Christopher v. Jennifer K.


Harbury. 


Mr. Cordray.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. CORDRAY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  May


it please the Court:


I represent current and former Government


officials who have been sued in their individual capacity


based on a claim for denial of access to the courts and


the further claim that they violated clearly established


law as of 1993, thus negating their defense of qualified


immunity. 


The substantive due process right of access


claim urged here is extremely expansive and unsupported by


the Court's precedents.  Our position boils down to this. 


The right of access is not violated unless an individual


is, in fact, barred from filing claims in the courts.  In


limited circumstances, far different from those at issue


here, the Court has recognized that an actual bar to


access in the courts implicates the Due Process Clause. 


Here there is no denial of access to the courts under this

Court's precedents. 


The claim asserted here, moreover, would


constitutionalize the handling of informal channels of


communication between Government officials and private


citizens.  It's entirely foreseeable that recognizing this


claim would cause the flow of information to the public to


be reduced to stultifying forms of pretrial discovery.  We


know no holding of this Court that would lead to such a


result. 


QUESTION:  To begin with right of access, the


Bell case, Bell v. Milwaukee, is discussed in -- in the


briefs.  That's 1983.  This is Bivens.  I recognize the


distinction.  That's, of course, a circuit court case. 


It's not -- but suppose that case were here.  Suppose we


had the Bell case.  Would you say the Bell case is


correct?


MR. CORDRAY:  Your Honor, we feel that the


conduct at issue in the Bell case, very serious misconduct


-- there were actual criminal violations.  The


perpetrators were prosecuted.  There would be many ways to


address the misconduct at issue in that case.  We do not


believe that it would state a claim for denial of access


to the courts. 


We also believe -- and in fact, it's -- the


district court held here the facts of that case are quite

distant from this case where here we're in the sensitive


context of foreign policy and the oversight of covert


operations in a foreign country, and that would result --


QUESTION:  But your basic position is -- is that


there's a police coverup and the police destroy the


evidence and they lie, et cetera, no -- no cause of action


for denial of access to courts. 


MR. CORDRAY:  That's correct.  There would be


many remedies that could and should be imposed in such a


case. 


QUESTION:  Even where the purpose of the action


of the official is to conceal facts that would have


provided the basis for a legal recovery in court.


MR. CORDRAY:  We believe so, Your Honor, and for


this reason.  In this case, the court of appeals devised a


mixed motive test if one of the purposes was to prevent or


impede a lawsuit.


QUESTION:  Well, yes, but we're speaking


hypothetically.


MR. CORDRAY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And there's some circuit court


support for where that's the alleged motive, that that


could provide a basis for a suit for denial of access to


the court. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Alleged that that is the sole

motive, no other motive.  I mean, it's -- what I'm trying


to communicate is it's very difficult in these cases to --


to suggest this. 


It's very easy to allege that this is one of the


motives or even the sole motive at a motion to dismiss


stage where the -- where the allegations are treated


generously and, all of a sudden, all of these claims


become constitutional claims.  If there's some failure to


timely disclose information and some irreparable harm


results, this could apply, for example, in undercover


Government investigations of criminal conduct, sting


operations.  If the allegation is made that maybe my


attorney inquired, there was some intentionally misleading


statement made, and therefore, as a result, some


irreparable harm occurred, someone was killed during the


implementation of the operation, something of that sort,


all of these would become denial of access to court --


QUESTION:  Suppose that it is an ordinary case,


civil case, criminal system, and they're holding -- a


group of rogue policemen are unlawfully somebody in a jail


cell and his wife comes in and says, I -- I want to get a


-- go to court and get a writ of habeas corpus on his


behalf.  Now, will you tell me please, is that -- is this


going on?  And they lie so that she cannot go to court and


get the writ of habeas corpus.  Now, in that circumstance,

would that be a -- a denial of access to the courts? 


MR. CORDRAY:  In a situation where the


Government was holding an individual in custody, therefore


physically barring that person from accessing the courts,


that person --


QUESTION:  No, no.  The person -- the wife --


MR. CORDRAY:  That -- that person --


QUESTION:  -- wants to go.


MR. CORDRAY:  That person would have a claim for


denial of access to the courts. 


The wife or an attorney inquiring on their


behalf, et cetera, do not have a right to Government


information.  The mere fact that someone is incarcerated


doesn't mean that their attorney inquiring of the


prosecutor's office or the police have some right of


access to information. 


QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose the Government


imprisons the key witness in my suit in order to deprive


me of the ability to win the suit.  Is there denial of


access to courts there?  Again, we'll have 1980 -- let's


assume 1983 because Bivens has an extra problem. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Are we talking about a criminal


case, a criminal proceeding? 


QUESTION:  Either --


MR. CORDRAY:  A witness -- it would matter if it

were a criminal proceeding because there are special fair


trial guarantees that the Constitution imposes such as


Brady v. Maryland and the like in a -- an ongoing criminal


proceeding.  If we're talking about a civil case or here


prior to any civil case even being filed when we're in the


realm of potentially pretrial investigation, discovery of


information, people seeking information, that would not


constitute a substantive due process right of access to


courts claim, we do not believe.  Again, those facts,


again, are far afield from what's at issue in this case,


but we don't believe that -- that that would file a claim,


would be our position.  You wouldn't need to go that far


in this case.


QUESTION:  Was a FOIA claim open to the


respondent here?  Could -- could such information have


been sought and obtained theoretically under FOIA?


MR. CORDRAY:  At any time.  At any time.  And in


fact, respondent did file FOIA claims later.  Her


contention here is that she was lulled into inaction, but


of course, it remained open to her at any time to file a


FOIA claim.  It remained open to her at any time to file a


lawsuit in the courts.  And in fact, she did so.  She


later pursued litigation to -- under FOIA to get


documents.  She received thousands of pages of documents.


Part of the complaint here is that the

information was not timely disclosed.  And again, that's


unfortunate.  It's regrettable.  There may even be


individuals who should be called to account for it, but it


doesn't constitute a substantive right of access to courts


claim under the substantive due process line of cases or,


you know, all such communications between Government


officials and private citizens --


QUESTION:  Mr. Cordray, may -- may I go back to


your answer about this being like a sting operation? 


Those are designed to uncover crimes, and the object of


the sting is a suspect.  But here, we're not dealing with


someone who was suspected of a crime.  We're dealing with


someone who was seeking information from her Government


for perfectly understandable, appropriate purposes. 


MR. CORDRAY:  That -- that's true, nor do we


contend otherwise.  But even a suspect, a criminal


suspect, is innocent till proven guilty, and the purpose


of those operations is to try to ferret out crime.  It's


true.  But it --


QUESTION:  But couldn't one make a distinction? 


I mean, you say if this case, then the sting operation,


and I think that however you come out in this case, you're


not touching the sting case. 


MR. CORDRAY:  I don't believe that's correct,


Your Honor, because a constitutional line can't be founded

there.  It can't be maintained there.  It has no moorings


at that point.  We're not talking about guilty suspects


who have already been adjudicated.  We're talking about


individuals --


QUESTION:  People suspected of crimes. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Sure.  And -- and here, the


Government's purposes involved overseeing covert military


operations in a foreign country.  There may be innocents


involved.  There may be people who are impeding our


foreign policy and the like.  The Government is trying to


carry out its functions, carry out its duties and


responsibilities, and the same is true of police trying to


uncover crime.  And the mere fact that someone is


suspected or they may not be suspected -- they may be on a


list --


QUESTION:  The person who's being deceived -- I


just don't see where there's any spill-over that you can


-- you can disassociate the suspect who was being deceived


in order to be caught by the Government and someone who


was under no suspicion of any involvement in any


wrongdoing.


MR. CORDRAY:  We don't think a constitutional


line could be -- could be founded there and maintained. 


I will say in the case of affirmative


misrepresentations by Government officials or

affirmatively misleading statements, there -- there are


some circumstances where they perhaps are justified. 


There are many circumstances where they would not be


justified, and if they violate a legal duty, there would


be legal redress for the violation of the duty.  If it's


criminal in nature, there would be -- criminal sanctions


could be imposed upon the perpetrators.  There's a free


press and there are political checks.  People can lose


their job.  They'd be subject to censure.  People could


vote them out of office.  But it doesn't in our view


constitute a substantive due process right of access to


the courts or an actual denial of access.


QUESTION:  Mr. Cordray, one of your -- one of


your arguments here is essentially a lack of standing


argument that -- that there's no remediable harm that's


been suffered.  Why -- why is that?  You say the


injunction -- it's -- it's too speculative whether the


injunction would ever have issued.  But what about a delay


in -- in getting damages?  Why -- why doesn't that


constitute harm? 


MR. CORDRAY:  A delay in what constitute harm?


QUESTION:  In obtaining -- in obtaining damages;


that is, had she known this information sooner, she could


have brought suit sooner and would have obtained justice


sooner.

 MR. CORDRAY:  Again, I don't think that that


founds -- that that meets the standing requirements. 


We're -- we're concerned here about the traceability and


redressability requirements.  And at the end of all of


this long skein of hypotheticals here is a notion that an


American court order would have somehow have prevented the


Guatemalan military from executing her husband. 


QUESTION:  Yes, I am not talking about -- I am


not talking about that.  I'm talking about the -- I'm just


talking about her ability to get monetary compensation for


what the Government did.  Hasn't that been at least


delayed?  You say she can still get it.  But the answer to


that is, yes, well, you know -- but meanwhile, she hasn't


gotten it. 


MR. CORDRAY:  It may have been delayed.  She


does have tort claims that are now pending in district


court, intentional infliction of emotional distress,


negligent supervision.  Those are proceeding under the


Federal Tort Claims Act.  And so, again, we -- we would


say that she's not been denied access to the courts. 


She's pursued that access.  She is vigorously pursuing it. 


She's pursued political relief and the like.


QUESTION:  Is -- are the claims that are now


pending against the individuals or the -- the United


States has substituted itself?

 MR. CORDRAY:  The United States has substituted


itself under the Federal Tort Claims Act for the purposes


of those claims.  They're in discovery in the trial court.


QUESTION:  And what -- they're in discovery


right now? 


MR. CORDRAY:  Yes, they are.  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Would she have had standing if she


had clearly brought or clearly adduced the theory that she


wanted an injunction against the officials to prevent the


officials from continuing to pay money to the agents of a


foreign government who were torturing her husband, who in


fact was a -- a foreign national?  Would she have had


standing if she had made that allegation?


MR. CORDRAY:  I'm not certain, to be honest,


Your Honor.  It would be very close to the line. 


QUESTION:  Why wouldn't she have had?  Let's put


it that way. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Well, because -- because there


would be, again, a traceability, redressability problem. 


If she's simply seeking -- her standing is somehow to save


her husband's life.  That's always been the claim asserted


to this case --


QUESTION:  Right, and her -- her allegation is


that they are torturing her husband because the United


States is paying them to do it.  And she says, on my

hypothetical, I want you to enjoin them from paying more


money.  That -- that -- the -- the causal connection, at


least in the allegation, would have been very clear,


wouldn't it?


MR. CORDRAY:  It would be close to the line.  It


would still depend on third party responses to a court


order, which this Court has had some --


QUESTION:  Well, she might or might not have


been able to prove ultimately, had it gone to trial, that


stopping the money would stop the action of the foreign


government.  But as a matter of standing to get to trial,


she would have had it, wouldn't she? 


MR. CORDRAY:  I frankly think it's like the


Simon case where the issue was availability of tax credit


or tax relief, and it was thought that that was not


significant enough to influence clearly the third party's


contract --


QUESTION:  Well, then your -- well, was it that


or was it there was no cause of action?  It was --


MR. CORDRAY:  Well, we think -- we think both.


QUESTION:  But it seems to me you have to take


her complaint the way -- the way Justice Souter wrote it. 


I mean, her complaint --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Her complaint is that the only reason

they're -- they're torturing is because we're paying them


to do that.  And if that is the allegation, I -- I think


the redressability/causality element is certainly there.


MR. CORDRAY:  It would be close to the line


because we're talking about independent decisions by third


parties in response to a court order would be the issue. 


That would be the issue. 


QUESTION:  What do you mean third parties?


MR. CORDRAY:  The third party is the Guatemalan


military who, in the end, have to change their conduct.


QUESTION:  No, no, no.  But the injunction is


against the payment which she says is the only reason the


Guatemalan military are doing this.  She wants to enjoin


the American officials from paying the money which she


asserts is the sole reason they're going through with


this.  Why -- why --


MR. CORDRAY:  But the only claim to standing on


her part to enjoin the CIA from doing something would be


somehow because it affects her husband's well-being and


the like.  So, you have to make that further step that the


third parties are going to be influenced in a positive way


and a decisive way by an American court order, and that's


where we think it breaks down.  But -- but that's a close-


to-the-line case in terms of standing.


QUESTION:  How can you be so cavalier?  It's

close to the line.  You -- you win anyway even if it's on


the other side of the line? 


MR. CORDRAY:  We think that there's not standing


under Simon and Linda R.S., and we think it's even clearer


in a foreign military context where we're talking about


foreign nationals not subject to U.S. jurisdiction, who at


the end of the chain of reasoning, have to alter their


conduct.  That's correct. 


I'd also like to address --


QUESTION:  May I just ask you another question


before you leave the subject? 


MR. CORDRAY:  Sure. 


QUESTION:  Assume, for the sake of argument,


that there is standing in that case.  Would there have


been a cause of action alleged? 


MR. CORDRAY:  Here for denial of access to --


QUESTION:  On my hypothesis. 


MR. CORDRAY:  For denial of access to the


courts?


QUESTION:  Any cause of action.


MR. CORDRAY:  By Ms. Harbury for denial of


access to the courts.  That's the only claim we have


before this Court --


QUESTION:  Yes, yes, yes. 


MR. CORDRAY:  Again, it's distant from any

allegations of torture or mistreatment of someone.  We're


only talking about denial of access to the courts based on


the alleged --


QUESTION:  And -- and she said I -- I want to go


into court because I want to press this cause of action. 


One of your arguments is, well, you've got to get into


court first, or -- or at least try to get into court.  But


another line of argument is whether you're yet at the


courthouse door or not, you've at least got to have a


cause of action that you could press if you got there.


And my question here is, assume standing, assume


your second line of argument on access to courts so that


the issue comes down to whether there would have been an


allegation of a cause of action on that hypothesis.  Would


there have been a cause of action alleged?


MR. CORDRAY:  We still allege there are many


steps on the standing argument in terms of what kind of


claims she would have brought.  There's -- in the court of


appeals --


QUESTION:  Okay, but I'm -- I'm saying assume


for the sake of argument that there is standing.  Would


there have been a cause of action sufficient to support


the access to courts claim? 


MR. CORDRAY:  Again, in a situation where the


claim is that she did not have timely disclosure of

information that would have helped her formulate her cause


of action, we do not think that falls within the


Constitution.  But my --


QUESTION:  Do you -- do you concede that at


least the claim that there was something unconstitutional


or illegal about paying the -- about our Government paying


the money to a foreign government for this purpose would


state a cause of action? 


MR. CORDRAY:  We don't concede that.  We don't


think that that's the case.  And again, what we're talking


about here is disclosure of information necessary to


formulate a claim.  We don't think that's


constitutionalized under the substantive due process. 


If I might reserve the remainder of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Cordray. 


General Olson, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


5 years ago in its Glucksberg decision, the


Court urged utmost care in creating new substantive due


process rights because doing so removes the matter from


the arena of public debate and legislative action.  That

admonition is acutely compelling in the field of


Government-to-citizen communication.  Respondent's theory


would not only constitutionalize the Freedom of


Information Act and create a constitutional pre-litigation


discovery right against the Government, but would also


affirmatively discourage an unquantifiable, but immense


volume of valuable informal Government communications that


take place thousands of times every day.  As the Court


held in OPM v. Richmond in 1990, the natural consequence


of a rule imposing liability for Government statements


would be a decision to cut back and impose strict controls


upon Government provision of information. 


Government officials respond to informal


requests for information every day in -- in an infinite


variety of contexts with infinite -- with an infinite


array of answers, candor, off-the-record disclosures, and


occasional polite evasions.  One of the most commonplace


of those governmental responses to requests for


information is the equivocal and innocuous I will get back


to you that forms the core of respondent's constitutional


theory. 


Today, the respondent urges that that I will get


back to you, when accompanied by an easy to allege and


hard to disprove, in the words of this Court, allegation


that such responses were intentionally false for the


19

purpose of discouraging a potentially productive


litigation will become the trigger for expensive,


burdensome, and distracting personal suits for damages


against the offending officials.  The -- the consequence


will be a drying up of informal Government-to-citizen


exchanges and a regime of no comment or brush-offs or


brusk refusals to discuss, the precise antithesis of the


open Government the Framers of the First Amendment


intended. 


So, to constitutionalize the responses in an


informal context where the response was not required by


any provision of law, no response was required at all, the


response violated no law or affirmative duty to respond,


it promised no specific action or any specific time table


-- I will get back to you didn't promise any --


QUESTION:  Well, the allegation, though, is that


the response was given in -- with the intent and in order


to prevent a potential lawsuit.  At least that's the


allegation. 


MR. OLSON:  That is the allegation, and that's a


conclusionary information and belief, easy to allege, hard


to disprove allegation that can be made in every one of


these cases.  It's easy to imagine an infinite number of


situations.  I think it was Justice Ginsburg that was


asking about the sting operation.  The sting is a

falsehood that's created by government to accomplish some


law enforcement objective, but if it's a false storefront


or something like that, it's a falsehood to a lot of


different people. 


There are lots of different situations where the


Government quite legitimately may have reasons to give


false information out.  We're not defending all the


circumstances in which that might occur because there are


duties and responsibilities and statutes that are imposed


for that sort of thing.  But to constitutionalize this


subject would just put this broad blanket of inhibition


over the whole disclosure of -- this was an informal oral


communication.  It wasn't a written communication.  It


wasn't where writing was occurred. 


She had at any time -- the respondent had at any


time the opportunity and right to bring an action under --


to -- to bring a request and then an action under the


Freedom of Information Act, which is Congress' carefully


structured regime for receiving information from the


Government.  If she had received an evasive or


nonresponsive answer in connection with the Freedom of


Information Act, that would have been remedied or remedial


in a court under the strictures that Congress carefully


developed and this Court has implemented over the years. 


There's --

 QUESTION:  General --


QUESTION:  Well, do you say there should be an


exhaustion requirement?  You have to at least go with a


FOIA request? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, Justice O'Connor, even if she


had gone -- well, she -- if she -- I wouldn't put it as


exhaustion.  What I'm suggesting is that because there is


this regime in place already, there are other ways to get


information from the Government.  There -- there could


have been a lawsuit brought at any time, although this


would have been very, very remote, this lawsuit.  And --


and the answers to questions could have been policed by a


court. 


We're not suggesting that there's necessary an


exhaustion requirement, but that to constitutionalize


these exchanges and to create remedies for damages under


these circumstances, when the legislature has developed an


infinite -- I mean, not an infinite, but a substantial


array of opportunities to both obtain information and to


police the type of information that's obtained, if a


Government official lies, there may be certain


circumstances where they are subject to discipline.


There -- there may be -- and we're talking about


all levels of government, State, local, and the National


Government.  There may be remedies that are available.

Many of the cases cited by the plaintiff were violations


of underlying provisions of law.  There was manufacturing


of evidence in some of those cases. 


What we're saying is that there are ways to deal


with Government-to-citizen communications that don't have


the --


QUESTION:  What -- what do you do, Mr. Olson,


with the circuit court cases which have held under 1983 a


violation of the right of access to courts when there's a


coverup of a -- of a police murderer or something of that


sort? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, precisely. 


QUESTION:  Is there a right of access to courts


in your view in those cases? 


MR. OLSON:  We believe that there is not.  We


believe that in each of those cases, there were


circumstances where there were other rights that were


violated, and that to take the step that those courts


took, to the extent that they go beyond the violation of


other underlying rights, would create this very problem


that the Court urged caution about.  The consequence could


be the drying up of information. 


The creation of an additional right in those


areas is problematical in the first place in terms of what


it would accomplish beyond the rights that are already in

existence.  And the down side consequence to the


Constitution, to the regular exchange of information, and


the limitation, as this Court said in Glucksberg --


QUESTION:  I suppose -- I suppose that they


could allege that the drying up of information was also


done in order to prevent them from bringing a lawsuit,


that is, if you say no comment. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, they --


QUESTION:  They could allege the only reason you


said no comment was you didn't want to give the


information. 


MR. OLSON:  Of course.  As a matter of -- as a


matter of fact, Justice Scalia, what they did say is that


-- and this is on page 20 of the transcript in the oral


argument, and there is something similar in the -- in the


brief, that they had -- that they -- we can't get back to


you or we're not able to respond to you -- they suggested


that that would be a perfectly constitutional response, or


as you say, a no comment would be a perfectly


constitutional response.  That could have been a lie too. 


We can't -- I'm sorry we can't get back to you.  Well, in


fact, they could get back under the theory pleaded in the


complaint.  So, that would have been a lie too. 


It illustrates the slipperiness of the slope


that the respondent's theory would ask the Court to embark

lie. 


QUESTION:  I don't see how no comment could be a


MR. OLSON:  Pardon me? 


QUESTION:  I don't see how no comment could be a


MR. OLSON:  No comment might not be a lie,


Justice Stevens, but -- but the -- the respondent


specifically says it would have been constitutional to say


I cannot get back to you, or if there is information,


we're not in a position to give it to you.  There are --


that's -- those specific things that are in the brief


itself and in the transcript of the oral argument could


easily be lies as well, and they could easily be


characterized as lies. 


QUESTION:  Is it your position, just to be sure,


that the refusal to give information can never be a denial


of access to the courts?


MR. OLSON:  I -- I hesitate ever to say anything


of that sort.  There are circumstances when it conceivably


could.  There could be legal duties triggering a


requirement.  In the habeas situation that one of the


Justices asked about, there are rights of the individual


which may be asserted by -- under appropriate next-friend

standing, but it's the rights of the individual in


custody.


QUESTION:  Well, withholding could give rise to


tolling of the statute of limitations. 


MR. OLSON:  Absolutely, and that's another


situation, Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist, in which if


something is delayed -- and I think Justice Scalia asked


that question.  There's a tolling remedy.  There's


additional damages because of the delay.  There are


remedies in virtually all of these circumstances. 


One last point, if I still have time, is that


the causation, the actual harm element of this so-called


cause of action, is extraordinarily remote.  The


respondent is taking the position that if the Government


had just answered constitutionally by saying no comment,


somehow she might have filed a Freedom of Information


case.  It might have been in time.  It might have been in


time then for her to file some sort of justiciable,


nonfrivolous cause of action, which she doesn't really


ever fully identify except calling it some sort of


injunction, and that that sort of injunction would have


caused a court somehow to provide the opportunity to save


the individual's life that she was attempting to save. 


That all is extraordinarily remote when -- when compounded


with the various aspects of the elusive nature of the

right being articulated here, the elusive nature of the


remedy that could be -- possibly be given and the damage


that constitutionalizing this right would create.  We


submit that this a course that this Court should not and


would not under its precedents want to go. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson. 


Mr. Harbury, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER K. HARBURY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. HARBURY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case turns upon a very narrow question of


law, specifically the United States officials take


affirmative and wrongful action to deceive a citizen,


number one, with the intention of obstructing her or


preventing her from proceeding to the courts of law for


emergency injunctive relief, and where such affirmative


and wrongful conduct and actions of deceit not only delay


the filing of that case, but in fact extinguish the cause


of action, and when it is known at the time that her


husband is in a secret cell being severely tortured and


that he is in danger of imminent extrajudicial execution. 


Ironically I note that today this case is in the highest


Court of the land, but it is exactly 10 years and 6 days


too late.

 Given the importance of a number of the points


that have been made today, I would like to start with a


few clarifications. 


Number one, I'm not arguing here that the


petitioners simply were negligent or did not get back to


me on time or that they had some duty, when 6 days after


my husband's capture, they learned that he was being


tortured and secretly detained.  I'm not say that they had


a duty to locate me, to knock on my door, and inform --


and inform me of his situation. 


I'm saying that they could not take wrongful and


affirmative steps, once I went to them, to deceive me, to


tell me that there was no information when, in fact, they


had numerous bulletins from the CIA telling them that he


was captured alive, that he was undergoing torture, that


they were falsifying his death, and when I was speaking


with them, that he was still alive and could, in fact,


have been saved. 


Number two, I am not alleging here that the --


that the Government officials should have given me


sensitive national security information.  I'm alleging


that they covered up information that was not sensitive,


that our own Government has since decided did not


constitute state secrets and could have been given to me


initially, and that that nonsensitive information had all

the details I needed in 1993 to approach the courts of law


for an emergency injunctive to -- injunction to --


QUESTION:  Ms. Harbury, may I ask you --


QUESTION:  If -- if this were a -- if this were


a private cause of -- of action without governmental


actors, it would be just a tort of deceit, I -- I take it.


MS. HARBURY:  The tort of --


QUESTION:  Like a tortious action for deceit if


these were all private actors.  We'll leave the Government


out of it.  And it seems to me that what you're trying to


do is to make up for the absence of a tort of deceit under


the Federal Tort Claims Act by creating a constitutional


right.  Is that what's -- is that what's happening here


structurally so far as your argument is concerned? 


MS. HARBURY:  No, Your Honor.  I'm alleging that


any kind of affirmative and wrongful conduct by a state


official, when the objective and, in fact, the result is


to prevent the filing of a lawsuit, access to courts, then


-- then a constitutional right has been violated. 


QUESTION:  I'm suggesting to you that the only


reason you -- you must say that is because if you followed


the usual course of the law and file an action for deceit,


you'd be barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act.  That


is correct, is it not?


MS. HARBURY:  I believe the Federal Tort Claims

Act could not have been triggered in the case when one was


only asking for injunctive relief, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  In -- in the context of a private


person, under the law of torts, there is an action for


deceit based on the facts that you've -- that you've


discussed, is there not? 


MS. HARBURY:  Yes, there is. 


QUESTION:  All right.  And the reason that you


have to show an access -- right of access to court is


because, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, you can't sue


for deceit.  I mean, that's -- that's where we -- that's


the beginning point here.  Isn't that right? 


MS. HARBURY:  I could not sued for deceit under


the Federal Tort Claims Act.  That is correct, Your Honor,


but that action, even if I could file it under the Federal


Tort Claims Act, would not be focused on the wrong and the


injury that I am alleging here.  I'm saying that my day in


court, when I could have saved my husband's life, has been


extinguished wrongfully on the basis of a violation of


standard -- of standard duties of conduct.


QUESTION:  Ms. Harbury, on that central


question, an issue kept coming up repeatedly in the D.C.


Circuit during your argument there, and the court asked,


access to court, access to do what? 


Now, the -- they rejected your claim that there

was a Fifth Amendment right, a substantive right,


involving the Government's participation in -- in the


torture abroad.  They rejected your argument about a


familial relationship.  So, what I don't understand at


this point is rejecting your claims, your substantive


claims, of a wrong to yourself, wrongful conduct engaged


in by the United States, access to court for what?  If you


have no Fifth Amendment claim, what is there?  What claim


could you state?


MS. HARBURY:  All of the claims that I would


have stated, Your Honor, would have been rooted in the


context that in the absence of extraordinary


circumstances, as in Guatemala in 1992 and '93, the use of


torture, the causation and participation in torture by


United States officials, was completely outside of the


scope of their delegated authorities and, in the


alternative, in violation of their own regulations and


subject to review under the APA for emergency injunctive


relief.  That core concept would, in turn, have allowed me


to sue for conspiracy to end aiding and abetting, assault


and battery in his case, emotional distress in my case,


intentional refusal to supervise independent contractors.


And I would still assert that although my


familial rights have not been recognized in the Bivens


context for a number of good reasons, because there's no

easy way to draw the line in damages in that context, but


had I gone to a court of law and said, this is my family,


I have the right to choose our medical care, I have the


right to choose whether or not together we will have


children and how we will raise them and which church we


shall worship at and what professions we shall exercise,


the most fundamental right of all that I would have


presented seeking injunctive relief is that I have a right


to defend my family from wrongful outside actions,


especially when they're taken by the state.  I would have


brought all of those issues before the courts of law and


asked for emergency assistance.


QUESTION:  At bottom, in this case you're


claiming damages now.  Is that not correct? 


MS. HARBURY:  There are some tort claims issues


still in the district court, yes, Your Honor, but those


cannot make good the lost day in court to save a human


life. 


QUESTION:  No, but -- but what's running through


my mind is the -- there's a long chain of causation here,


and if -- if one were persuaded -- and I'm not saying I


am, but if one were persuaded that even if you had all the


help that you sought at the time you did, there still


would not have been time to save your husband's life.  And


therefore, the ultimate damage would -- would have been

suffered anyway.  Would you be entitled to prevail? 


MS. HARBURY:  If the question where there was no


time to save my husband's life? 


QUESTION:  Correct. 


MS. HARBURY:  I would certainly want to bring my


witnesses and my evidence to a factual hearing on exactly


that subject, Your Honor, because I believe there was at


least 6 months if not, under more recent information, a


year or a year-and-a-half during which I could have saved


my husband's life.  But under the allegations in the


complaint, 6 months.  And that any court faced with


torture and the possibility that someone tomorrow may be


literally thrown from a helicopter, I do not believe that


any court in this country could not have acted swiftly to


redress that situation. 


QUESTION:  In -- in this case, Ms. Harbury, you


are seeking money damages, are you not? 


MS. HARBURY:  I am, Your Honor.  Money damages


related to other harm which was incurred, not the


equivalent of the day in court to save my husband's life,


which has been extinguished.  There is no -- there is no


way that I can now recover that day.  So, the damages


claims in the lower court are on peripheral injuries.


QUESTION:  You began by telling us that this is


a very narrow remedy that you seek.  I have trouble with

matters, which involve access to courts, the Government is


going to be sued all of the time.  And as you know, when


the law evolves and we decide cases, we -- we, of course,


look to the egregious nature of the conduct in a


particular case, but we also have to look at what we're


creating as a general rule.  And the Government says as a


general rule what you're asking for is a sweeping,


revolutionary cause of action. 


MS. HARBURY:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think that in


this case that is not a true concern.  If I may elaborate


on that. 


Number one, the circuit courts that have dealt


with the issue of access to the courts in the context of a


Government coverup have created a solution that would so


filter out most cases that there would not be a flood gate


effect.  Specifically, just delaying a case, as opposed to


extinguishing that actual cause of action, as in this


case, will not be a harm that in itself, without further


damage, is going to be actionable as a constitutional


violation for denial of access.  So, in the vast majority


of cases, where an official makes a neutral statement,


there's not going to be any damage done that the fact


finder or the judge in the district court is not going to

be able to remedy with his panoply of equitable tools. 


The second filter, though, is that there must


have been harmful and affirmative and wrongful conduct


aimed at obstructing the access to the courts, blocking


that person from going to the courts of law.  That means


that in the context of deceit, which is presented here,


that the statements have to have been intentionally


deceptive, not just words of courtesy which would be --


QUESTION:  When -- when you say wrongful, Ms.


Harbury, you don't mean in violation of any particular


statute.  You mean something broader than that, don't you?


MS. HARBURY:  In this case it would be a common


law -- common law tort, Your Honor, to commit intentional


deceit where the person making the deceptive statements is


fully aware and intends that a reasonable person will rely


on that statement to their detriment. 


QUESTION:  The Secretary of State is liable for


the common law tort of deceit under those circumstances is


what you're saying. 


MS. HARBURY:  I'm saying that where the common


law tort of deceit is the wrongful act which was taken in


order to block access to the courts of law, then it


becomes a constitutional tort.  The simple act of


deception I doubt would be actionable in most cases,


especially when the words were simply courtesy words and a

reasonable person, hearing some -- one statement, for


example, that oh, we're very concerned, a reasonable


person would probably not rely on that statement to mean


more than we'll write a letter of inquiry for you. 


But what is set out in this case, what is


alleged in this case is that there was an array of


statements made by numerous persons in the State


Department and other agencies which were intended and


which did give a number of false impressions and false


understandings, specifically that the United States had no


information at all about what was happening with my


husband.  In fact, they knew that the CIA was deeply


involved.  They knew within 6 days of his capture that


they were falsifying his death and planned to torture him


for his information. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Harbury, from the time you did --


you did get information from the Government ultimately


when you brought your Freedom of Information Act suit. 


From the time you made your request under FOIA until you


received that information, how much time elapsed? 


MS. HARBURY:  I made the FOIA request in January


of '95.  A number of disclosures were made by Government


officials in March, and in the ensuing uproar, I then


began to get some preliminary documentation later that


fall.

 The reason that I filed my FOIA, for purposes of


clarification here, in January is that the 60 Minutes


broadcast, for the first time ever, had indicated to me


that the U.S. officials were deceiving me, that they


weren't --


QUESTION:  My -- my point is your -- your theory


is, if I hadn't been lulled into the sense that the


Government was my friend, I would have immediately filed a


FOIA request and I would have gotten this information in


time to seek this injunction.  But in fact, if it takes --


there was a 6-month interval from March until September,


assuming that September was the date of execution.  If the


FOIA lawsuit would have taken more than 6 months to


process, then you would not have found out anything in


time to bring this injunction action.


MS. HARBURY:  Under those conditions, Your


Honor, knowing or believing that my husband could still


well be alive and being subjected to torture, I would have


been in court immediately for a TRO for expedited handling


of that case.  The reason I didn't do so in '95 is because


I learned that my husband was dead.  There was no longer


any reason to go for an emergency injunctive relief.


QUESTION:  Do you know of FOIA cases that have


been handled that way with a TRO?  Or you're saying that


this is a unique situation?

 MS. HARBURY:  Your Honor, I believe the FOIA


itself makes provisions for expedited handling where


necessary, and I believe that any Federal district court,


using their rights and their equitable remedies for


emergency situations, could have ordered the emergency


processing.  And in fact, those documents were not sealed


away in remote files.  They were being reviewed, actively


reviewed, by many of the petitioners as those events were


unfurling. 


QUESTION:  Well, would they?  That's -- I mean,


obviously reading your story, one is immediately


sympathetic, and it's a very sad and difficult.  I


understand that. 


And suppose you were in court and the court


might think there are other people with similar stories,


and indeed, foreign nationals are quite often perhaps,


from what one reads in the paper, subject to very bad


treatment at the hands of other foreign nationals.  And


our Government supports some of those and because we must,


according to what they say. 


Well, how is a court supposed to know whether,


when you have the CIA, when you have one group of foreign


nationals hurting another group of foreign nationals, when


there's egregious behavior throughout the world and we


have to support some -- how in your view can we

distinguish this case from the general problem of foreign


relations, from the general problem of the CIA, from


things that courts by and large don't go into? 


MS. HARBURY:  If I may.  I'm not sure if I'm


understanding your question, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, I'm really trying to work


getting you to address what I would see as a major


implication, which is not at all casting doubt on -- on


the sympathy with which an individual might have, but


rather the problem of conducting foreign affairs, which


we're told by the Government requires courts to stay out


of certain things and your thing is in that category that


they say stay out of.  And I'd like you to say what you


want about that. 


MS. HARBURY:  We're -- there are, of course --


there is, of course, here a case within a case.  There's


the 1993 claims I would have brought and there's this case


for --


QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm thinking of the case


within the case because, after all, you have to have had a


claim that a judge would have gone and addressed,


otherwise the blocking you from that wouldn't have


mattered.


MS. HARBURY:  Yes, Your Honor.  In 1993, the


claims for emergency injunctive I would have brought,

although as in the redistricting cases, it's not that they


don't touch on a political question, or in this case a


foreign affairs question, but they would have not required


the court to interfere with ongoing formation of foreign


affairs.  We would not, for example, have been asking that


the courts of law determine whether or not our military or


our CIA should be present in Guatemala or what our


relationships with the Guatemalan military, which was


later deemed by the United Nations to have engaged in


genocide against the Mayan peasants during the war.  The


court would not have been required or even asked to deal


with any of those issues. 


There would have been a very limited question


presented, which is may the CIA, in the absence of any


extraordinary circumstances such as war or imminent


national security crisis, in the absence of any of those


conditions, may they request and pay for information they


know is being contemporaneously extracted through the use


of extreme torture and refuse to, in any way, instruct or


supervise their own contractors and, in addition, shield


those very assets, or informants in this case, from


Congress which was trying at that time to force the


Guatemalan military to better respect human rights.


In fact, our foreign affairs policy at that time


was to promote human rights in Guatemala where the army

was quickly becoming an international pariah for a number


of very good reasons.  And these actions of rogue


operators with respect to the peace process, in respect --


and with respect to promotion of human rights were


undercutting the foreign affairs.  This Court, by taking


-- or the court in the United States, by taking action in


1993, would simply have settled whether or not the CIA may


pay for torture in the absence of any extraordinary


circumstances. 


QUESTION:  May I -- your answer raises this


question in my mind.  If you say you're the trial judge in


1993 with the complaint coming in and you think you're


right, you should get relief, do you think the relief that


would have been ordered by the -- the proper relief at


that time would have been simply an order not to pay any


more money to the Guatemalan people, or would it have been


broader relief covering all the matters you've discussed? 


MS. HARBURY:  I would have asked in 1993 for


three steps to have been taken by the CIA through --


through an injunctive -- through an injunction by the


courts.  Number one, which -- would be the obvious. 


Please don't ask for more information and promise to pay


for it, especially when those payments are often 20 to 30


times more than the annual national salary in Guatemala. 


And number two --

 QUESTION:  Well, let's get the first one.  What


would the first have been?  An order -- tell me again. 


What -- what would the injunction say on that first point?


MS. HARBURY:  The first point of the injunction


would have been to prohibit CIA officials from requesting


and promising payment for and making payment for continued


information contemporaneously being extracted through the


use of torture from a living prisoner.  That would have


been point one. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MS. HARBURY:  Point two would have been these


are your employees.  You may not refuse to engage in any


proper supervision of them.  You must at least sit down


and talk to them and indicate to them what the parameters


of human rights law are and international law. 


And number three, you may not shield these


people from the wrath of the United States Congress.  You


are supposed to report those matters to Congress. 


QUESTION:  And you say shield those people. 


Which people?  Shield the members of the CIA or the people


who are doing the -- the interrogating?


MS. HARBURY:  The CIA was not properly reporting


my husband's situation to Congress at the time, and the


petitioners in this case were repeatedly writing to


Congress saying there is no information about Mr. Bamaca

at all.  The same statements that were being made to me


were being made to everyone else.  We have no information. 


There was so much information appropriate for


declassification that I could have been inside of a court


within 24 hours. 


With regards to torture, I would like to borrow


two sentences from Patrick Henry, which I find very, very


appropriate today.  The issue of the times was with recent


memory of war on our territory and the scars and the


trauma that that had left.  There was an ongoing debate in


Congress as to whether or not sometimes U.S. officials


should be allowed to commit torture.  His statement:  what


has distinguished our ancestors was that they would not


permit torture or cruel or barbaric treatment.  Congress


may tell you that there is a necessity of strengthening


the arm of the Government, but if we do so, we are then


lost and undone. 


This is the bright line our Government has


always taken, all branches of this Government.  The CIA


was established in aftermath and horror that went with


what happened in World War II, the Holocaust in Europe,


the war crimes that occurred in the South Pacific. 


Treatment of prisoners of war came up again and again in


In re Yamashita.  It's mentioned again in Johnson --


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, that's clearly true.

What in your opinion should the CIA do if it discovers


that other people not in the CIA are engaged in this?


MS. HARBURY:  Questions that I would leave to


Congress and that are not raised in this case would be may


-- may a CIA agent purchase information from someone known


to be an unsavory character.  That's not presented here.


The question in -- that's presented here, the


facts that are presented here is when you have an


extremely close and supervisory relationship with a given


informant for years, you know that they are -- they are


notorious as a torturer and that, in fact, they were


engaged in a liquidation campaign against civilians, and


you say, we want more information from the living prisoner


in that room, you have the cattle prod and the pliers,


here's a check for several times -- maybe 10 or 20 times


your annual income -- would you please get that


information for us, that is crossing the line.  That's


crossing a very bright line that our Government has never


permitted.  Our Government has allowed under certain


circumstances to take life, never to torture.


QUESTION:  Well, and I assume that -- that would


have been part of your -- of your lawsuit, that you would


have had to establish that it is either what?  A violation


of a Federal statute or of the Constitution to -- to


permit torture.

 MS. HARBURY:  I -- I would be saying that


carrying out torture was outside the scope of any


statutory delegation of power to the CIA or in violation


of its own internal policies and regulations. 


QUESTION:  You're relying on the statutes or


lack of statutory authority to do it. 


MS. HARBURY:  Or in the alternative, violation


of any -- any internal regulations they might have for


extraordinary circumstances. 


QUESTION:  But you couldn't make it in violation


of the Constitution because the D.C. Circuit threw that


out.  There's something just unseemly about your saying it


violated a regulation to torture someone abroad, but it --


I have to accept for purposes of this case that it didn't


violate the U.S. Constitution. 


MS. HARBURY:  Leaving that issue aside, it


certainly violated any authority ever delegated by


Congress to any person, any official in this country to


engage in torture.  It has never -- no authority has ever


been delegated at that level to any official, not even


from the time of our Founding Fathers right up through the


present when we've only recently continued to sign on to


international treaties prohibiting torture of a human


being. 


QUESTION:  You make a -- a statement that the

United States could have raised a national security


defense, but it didn't choose to do that.  What -- what do


you envision to be the nature of that defense?


MS. HARBURY:  If the petitioners wished to


present to the district court an affirmative defense in


the answer, which has, of course, not yet been filed --


we're still at the motion to dismiss stage -- stating that


somehow there were overriding national security interests


which forced them or justified their actions in this case,


that -- that met the strict scrutiny test of a fundamental


right such as access to the courts, if they wish to make


that statement and try to provide that evidence, then I


would wish to come to the courts of law and provide my


evidence of pretext that that -- those extraordinary


circumstances of national security did not at all exist in


Guatemala during this relevant time period.  And it would


be, of course, for the judge to decide that issue.


Even giving great deference to the Government


position, I believe that I have evidence that would


clearly establish that any such assertion was pretextual. 


QUESTION:  Well, you're not talking then about a


Reynolds defense on the part of the Government where you


-- where there is no evidence to presented.  You're


talking about something else? 


MS. HARBURY:  I'm saying -- I'm trying to

conjecture what the petitioners might raise because they


haven't raised it yet.  But the court below, the appellate


court, left open that if in their answer they wished to


present a claim of national security as an affirmative


defense, which they have not raised to date, they're free


to do so.  And I'm free to answer.


Lastly I -- I don't believe that the 1983 -- the


1993 claim would have raised any -- any undue effect or


impact on our Government officials in any way.  They can


continue to make courtesy statements.  They can continue


to give the Glomar denial, which would have given me fair


notice that documents might exist in their files. 


Instead, I was told there's nothing in this file.  Maybe


you should look elsewhere.  So, I did.  I went to


Guatemala and looked in the files of the Guatemalan


military, which was of itself a less than charming


experience. 


And I do believe that it's very important that


we remember that even in such cases as the conduct of our


military affairs in the Chappell case, for example, or in


U.S. v. Stanley, although enormous latitude is given to


our officials and we have decided not to engage or to


provide Bivens remedies under those contexts, in all of


those contexts, it has been noted that equitable relief


would still be correct and adequate.  So, I believe that

my right in 1993 to move forward and obtain equitable


relief is without question. 


Lastly, addressing the issue of -- of qualified


immunity for the petitioners here, the issue of access to


the courts is not a newfangled cause of action.  It was


stated long ago in Chambers v. the Baltimore & Ohio


Railway that that right is fundamental.  That right is the


alternative of force.  In an organized society, it is the


right conservative of all other rights and lies at the


foundation --


QUESTION:  That was a full faith and credit


case, was it not?  The -- it wasn't an express right of


access to courts claimed as a right under the United


States Constitution. 


MS. HARBURY:  I believe in that case the


question was the denial of the right of citizens from


another State, in Ohio, to actually file suit, and similar


to In re Hull, it was interpreted as barring the


courthouse door. 


QUESTION:  But it was decided not under some


substantive constitutional principle, but under the -- the


full faith and credit or Interstate Commerce Clause, was


it not? 


MS. HARBURY:  That's correct.  But the Court, in


discussing those issues, noted the fundamental importance

of the access to courts and the equal access to courts of


all citizens. 


I believe that it was clear enough and very


clearly established in all of the other circuit cases and


in the long line of cases, due process and access to


courts that this Court has always given, that the rights


that I had in 1993 as in today were very clearly


established.  The Government cannot take wrongful and


affirmative steps, in this case intentional deceit,


knowing that a person will reasonably rely to their


detriment on those statements, in order to prevent them


from going to the courts of law and in order to obstruct


and thwart their ability to investigate their own case and


gather their own information. 


When those affirmative and wrongful steps are


taken, whether it be locking a packet of evidence in a


desk drawer or locking crucial information in a file


cabinet and telling the person that there is none, when


the Government acts to conceal information and takes


wrongful steps as opposed to simply passively standing by


or stating no comment, and the harm occurs as planned, and


the case is not simply delayed but destroyed, in that case


I think that it has been clear since Baltimore and since


In re Hull and since --

QUESTION:  Mr. Cordray, you have 4 minutes


remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. CORDRAY:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


At a minimum, the extent of legitimate debate


today should resolve the qualified immunity issue in this


case.  There have been allegations made about torture,


about atrocious treatment of individuals in foreign


countries.  It has occurred throughout this century. 


But before the Court today is a one particular


claim, that by saying we'll investigate and keep you


informed, Government officials denied a substantive due


process right of access to courts asserted by respondent


here. 


There is no allegation in this complaint, if you


look at pages 2 to 3 of our yellow brief, which fairly


restates the -- the pertinent allegations of this


complaint, that these people were told there was nothing


in the file.  Instead, the claim was that they said we'll


investigate the matter.  We'll keep you informed, and that


perhaps that was intentionally misleading.  That's --


that's the allegations here.  That's all the allegations


here.

 I would also say that in terms of this chain of


causation, the allegation is that at the end of the chain,


Guatemalan military, who allegedly were torturing and


holding rebels in the midst of a civil war, were going to


refrain from conduct because payments might have been


withheld by the United States -- that's extremely


speculative.  It's as speculative or more so than Simon


and Linda R.S.


And finally, I would say that, again, we are


distant here from any allegations of torture.  The


allegations are that our clients perhaps mishandled


informal channels of communication about information that


could have been provided that they may or may not have


actually had, and -- and we think that that's just very


distant from the facts that are actually alleged in the


complaint in this case. 


Maximizing a particular remedy, which is what's


being sought here, does not equal barring a cause of


action, and there is no legitimate constitutional claim we


think that the Court could recognize based on its


precedents. 


If there are no questions, thank you very much. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Cordray.


The case is submitted.
