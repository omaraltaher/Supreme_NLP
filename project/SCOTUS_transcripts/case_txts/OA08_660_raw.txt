 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-660, United States, ex rel. 
Eisenstein v. the City of New York.

 Mr. Schor.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GIDEON A. SCHOR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCHOR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 For two main reasons, the Second Circuit's 

judgment should be reversed.  First, under Appellate 
Rule 4(a)(1)(B) the government is a party in qui tam 
actions because it is named, served, and bound and a 
real party in interest, all without ever intervening or 
actively participating.

 And second, any participation-based test 
party status will create a burdensome fact-specific 
jurisdictional inquiry at the start of every appealed 
and declined qui tam --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why at the start?  Why 
isn't the time the end, when we can -- the notice of 
appeal is to be filed after there is a judgment.  Why 
isn't the proper time to determine number of days to 
appeal when the judgment is entered?  And at that point,

one can see that the government has done nothing, 
absolutely nothing in the case.

 At the inception, I agree with you, we don't 

know what, if anything, the government is going to do. 
But by the time judgment is entered, we surely know.

 MR. SCHOR:  It will be quite difficult and 
burdensome, even upon entry of judgment, for a relator 
or a defendant to determine whether the government's 
participation was sufficiently active to make the 
government a party for purpose --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we hear the 

government did nothing, not one thing.

 MR. SCHOR:  Well, under the -- under the 

active participation test, that may be.  But the 
question is -- is, will this Court be adopting the 
active participation test.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The test is -- I don't 

know what you mean by "active participation" as opposed 
to just plain participation.  If the rule is at the time 
judgment is entered to determine how much time you have 
to file your notice of appeal, the question is, has the 
government done anything?  And if the government has 
done nothing at all, then you have 30 days.

 MR. SCHOR:  In -- well, to address Your 
Honor's first point, the Second Circuit's test was

participation.  The test proposed by Respondents and the 
government is active participation, which narrows --
narrows it somewhat.  We point out in our opening brief 
that it's hard to conclude that the government did 
nothing here.  It did request to receive orders and --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that's the question, 

whether that's enough or whether the government's power 
to prevent discovery, which it can do, is that alone 
enough?

 MR. SCHOR:  Well, our position is that the 

test is the wrong test.  Our position is that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that.  But --

but I'm saying there are various steps the 
governments -- the government can take, and I -- I think 
you have a point, that even though this case may be an 
easy one, we're going to have to decide in future cases 
how much -- how much activity by the government is 
enough activity to make the government a party.

 MR. SCHOR:  And I think it will be a very 

difficult determination for the relator or the defendant 
for several reasons.  First of all, the government 
expressly declines to limit or define the circumstances 
constituting active participation.  So there will be a 
whole series of legal determinations and possibly trips 
to this Court to determine the content of the standard.

Secondly, there will be enormously difficult 

fact-gathering efforts for the -- that the relator and 
the defendant will have to undergo at the end of a case 
after judgment has been entered.  Sometimes a docket 
sheet in a fully litigated qui tam action, declined or 
not, can be a hundred or 200 pages, and the case will 
have gone on for 5 or 5 years.

 The standard would require -- the active 

participation standard would require the relator or the 
defendant to comb through the docket sheet to find every 
instance of government participation to see whether, if 
the docket sheet will review it, the participation was 
sufficiently active.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You wouldn't have to 

-- you wouldn't have to do anything like that at all. 
He would just file before 30 days just to be on the safe 
side.  It's not like he's going to say, I'm going to 
analyze this 100-page document to see whether I get an 
extra 30 days to do something as simple as filing a 
notice of appeal.

 MR. SCHOR:  Respectfully, I think that might 

read out of the rules the 60-day period.  But also, I 
think it's a reflex among trained counsel always to see 
first, as soon as judgment is entered, how much time do 
I have to file the notice of appeal.  So the inquiry

will have to be undertaken unless the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And -- and if the 
inquiry says it's hard to tell, there's a 30-day limit 
and there's a 60 day limit, I don't know of any 
responsible counsel who wouldn't file within 30 days.
 MR. SCHOR:  If that's the position, then 

that will read out of the rules the 60-day period.  The 
rules do contain a 60-day period.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why would that --
why would it -- I mean, it would still apply to the 
government or any case in which the government is a 
party, where it's not an issue whether is the government 
a party or not.

 MR. SCHOR:  If it becomes too difficult to 
determine whether the government is a party, then it --
then it would be very hard to imagine the relator or the 
defendant who will feel able to invoke the 60-day 
provision, and that would effectively make it a dead 
letter --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no, no, no, I 

agree with you that it -- I'm just saying why in a world 
would the relator want to invoke the 60-day provision if 
there's at all -- at all a question about whether it's 
30 days or 60 days?

people read the rules and see there's a -- there are 30 
days if the government's not a party and 60 days if the 
government is a party.  It's -- it's a function of the 
rules themselves.  If the rules say there's a 60-day 
period --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any advantage? 
I mean, a notice of appeal is the easiest document, so 
it's not a question that there's any labor involved in 
doing this.  But is there any advantage to filing -- to 
taking the 60 days instead of the 30 days?  Why would 
counsel want to take advantage of the extra 30 days?  It 
isn't a question of a labor, having to write, like 
having to write a brief.  What advantage would there be 
to taking the additional 30 days?

 MR. SCHOR:  If we're talking about relator's 

counsel, sometimes in a declined qui tam action the 
relator's counsel may wait to determine, may want to 
know whether the government will be filing any sort of 
amicus brief on appeal before determining whether we'll 
go ahead with the appeal.  And rather than filing what's 
known as a protective notice of appeal, which isn't --
which isn't an optimal procedure --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How would the -- how 

would you know at the time of filing of the notice of 
appeal whether the government is thereafter going to

file an amicus brief?

 MR. SCHOR:  Relator's counsel is frequently 

in touch with government counsel.  And an important 
factor in whether relator's counsel will pursue an 
appeal and spend the money on the appeal is whether they 
will have support in any respect from the government. 
So sometimes it is the case that relator's counsel will 
very much want to know if government -- if the 
government will be making any sort of supportive filing 
on the appeal, and that may take longer to determine 
than the 30 days.  Sometimes it's 60 days.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- yes, but --

you don't have to know that before you file the one-page 
notice of appeal.  I mean, if you need more time, you 
can get more time, but you don't have to know all of 
that.  It's not going to cost you a lot of money to file 
the notice of appeal.

 MR. SCHOR:  That's -- that's true.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if it turns out the 

government is not going to come in, you can always 
dismiss the appeal.

 MR. SCHOR:  That is true.  I think it's a 

suboptimal procedure to file something, to file a notice 
with the court if -- if you're not certain that it's 
going to be pursuing your appeal.  I think it's better

to wait and not file until one is certain that one will 
be pursuing the appeal.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, anyway, a rule's a 

rule and discussing all of these consequences is beside 
the point.  If, indeed, the government's a party, it's 
60 days, right, and you say the government's a party?

 MR. SCHOR:  Correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And is -- is it your 

position that the government is a party to this case for 
all purposes, for all purposes of all the rules, or is 
it just some of them?

 MR. SCHOR:  No, we are not arguing that the 

government is a party only for some purposes and not 
others.  Our arguments are consistent with the view that 
the government is a party for the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  As opposed to the 

government's view, which does sort of pick and choose 
between --

MR. SCHOR:  Correct, and Respondents' as 

well.

 If the Court, however, wants to rule 

narrowly and just decide the Rule 4(a)(1)(B) issue, 
whether the government is a party under Rule 4(a)(1)(B), 
our arguments are certainly consistent with that as 
well.

The government is -- well let me address one 
issue that may be in the Court's mind or that the Court 
may be asking.  Well, Petitioner, you know, we have the 
government telling us that it doesn't need the 60 days 
when it doesn't intervene or actively participate; 
doesn't that end the matter.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The government is not 
saying it doesn't need the 60 days.  It's saying you 
don't qualify for the 60 days, you are not the 
government.  I don't think the government is arguing 
that its own time can be shortened.

 MR. SCHOR:  Well, the rule is that if the 
government gets 60 days everybody gets 60 days, even 
private parties like the relator.  But I believe the 
government's position is that if the rationale for 
giving 60 days doesn't apply, then everyone else 
shouldn't get the benefit of the 60 days, either.  I 
believe that's the government's position.

 We would argue that two factors detract from 

the government's argument in that respect.  First of 
all, it's unrealistic to think that the government will 
never need the 60-day period if it doesn't intervene or 
actively participate.  The problem arises if the relator 
does not appeal.  If the relator litigates and tries a 
case with sufficient skill that the government doesn't

need to take over and the district court nonetheless 
enters judgment for the defendant, the problem arises if 
the relator doesn't appeal or doesn't appeal the 
particular issue or order that the government would like 
before the court of appeals.  In that case, an amicus 
filing won't protect the government's interests and the 
government will have to appeal.  And once it's conceded 
that the government has to appeal, then it has to be 
conceded that the government will need 60 days.  That 
is, that the rationale for the 60-day period is fully 
applicable.

 It's also true sometimes --it's not at all 

fanciful that the relator might not appeal.  The relator 
might have spent a lot of money, time and money pursuing 
the trial, and, having lost, may have called it quits 
for purposes of the appeal.  Or the defendant might say 
to the relator:  Look, if you don't pursue your appeal, 
we won't file a bill of costs against you.  There could 
be all kinds of reasons why the relator might not 
appeal.  If the relator doesn't appeal, there will be no 
appeal in which the government can make an amicus 
filing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So there may be --

there may be a lot of reasons the relator will not 
pursue an appeal.  I don't think there's any reason that

the relator would not file a notice of appeal within 30 
days or, if he doesn't like 30 days, you ask for an 
extension of time for another 30 days.  Then the whole 
issue is moot.

 MR. SCHOR:  It -- it may be, but I believe 
that if Rule 4(a)(1)(B) creates a 60-day period, then 
the litigants have an entitlement to invoke it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, your argument goes --
is replying to the government the Respondent's argument 
that there is no sense in giving 60 days to the 
government, and what you're saying is, yes, sometimes 
there is.

 MR. SCHOR:  Correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even when the government 
has not actively participated.  So it really negates, 
you know, you're doing something that has no point.  It 
could have a point, to give the government 60 days, even 
in a case where it has not actively participated.  It 
may need that long to consult with other agencies as to 
whether to accept a defeat in this case or -- or on its 
own to conduct an appeal if the relator doesn't want to.

 MR. SCHOR:  That's correct, and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can the government appeal 

without having intervened in the district court?

 MR. SCHOR:  Since the government is bound by

the judgment, I believe that the government does have 
that right.  I don't have authority in the False Claims 
Act context for that position, but I think it follows 
from the conclusion, which is undisputed here, that the 
government is bound by the judgment in a declined qui 
tam action even where the government doesn't actively --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sure the government 

will agree with that.  I'm sure that's one of the 
contexts in which they agree that the government is a 
party.

 MR. SCHOR:  Yes, I think that's right, 

although they can speak for themselves.

 Now, the -- it's important also to note that 

when the government declines to proceed with a qui tam 
action, it might be declining to conduct the action or 
take discovery or use its resources, but it's not 
declining to get a judgment.  The judgment gets a 
binding judgment even when it declines.  There's no 
dispute that the claim is the government's claim and 
that the judgment finally disposes of it.  If in a 
declined action the relator litigates and gets a $10 
million award, the government takes the money.  And so 
the government is bound by the judgment.  The judgment, 
finally disposes of the government's claim.

provisions that -- that seem to indicate the government 
isn't a party.  For example, it specifically provides 
that even when the government hasn't intervened, the 
government may request copies of the pleadings.  Doesn't 
it have to make requests for them?

 MR. SCHOR:  The government has to make 

requests.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why would it have to 

do that if it's a party?

 MR. SCHOR:  The --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you're -- I mean, you're 
saying they are not a party for that rule at least, that 
requires the pleadings to be served upon the other 
party.

 MR. SCHOR:  No.  But Congress can restrict 

the operation of particular Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  The argument that I think Your Honor is 
averting to is the Rule 5 argument that my -- that 
Respondents and the government make.  Rule 5 doesn't 
define who the party is.  It attaches certain 
consequences to being a party, but it doesn't define who 
a party is.  It says you get to be served if you are a 
party.  You get to be served with certain pleadings and 
Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. SCHOR:  Congress restricted that right 

in the False Claims Act.  But that doesn't make it a 
party.  What makes it a party is whether it's named --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not following you.  I'm 
saying if -- if the government is a party, Rule 5 would 
apply and the government would automatically get copies 
of the pleading whether or not it requested them.  So 
the provision in the False Claims Act that the 
government will only get copies if it requests them 
seems to indicate that the government is not a party.

 MR. SCHOR:  The fact that ordinarily a party 

might get served with certain pleadings doesn't mean 
that if Congress restricts that right, it's not a party. 
It means it's a party that Congress has -- for whom 
Congress has restricted the right.  And that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you think that 

everyone -- you are relying on the government, that the 
government is in the caption and it's a real party in 
interest.  Is every real party in interest a party for 
this purpose?

 MR. SCHOR:  No, we are not arguing that.  To 

be a party, a real party in interest must be named in 
the -- the actions needs to be brought in the name of 
the real party in interest.  And we've cited abundant 
authority for the proposition that that means that the

pleadings must identify that person by name.  If the 
action is to be brought in the name of Smith, then the 
pleadings must identify Smith as the plaintiff.  So the 
naming requirement must be complied with.  It's not 
sufficient in our view just to be a real party.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can I come back to the Rule 

5 point just for a minute?  You say that the effect of 
the False Claims Act is simply to restrict what would 
normally be the right of the government to get copies of 
all the pleadings.  That's really not how it reads.  It 
doesn't say that the government shall receive copies of 
the pleadings only if it requests them.  It says the 
government shall receive copies of the pleadings if it 
requests them, as though without that provision it 
wouldn't have a right to receive copies.  Isn't that the 
way it reads?

 MR. SCHOR:  It does read that way.  I think 

the addition of "only" is logician's language, Your 
Honor.  I'm not sure that the drafters --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's what we are 

down here, you know.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. SCHOR:  It may be, but not every 

drafting of a statute rises to that level of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Precision.

MR. SCHOR:  -- of quality.  The attachment 
of the condition "if it requests" I think goes a long 
way towards suggesting that if it doesn't so request, 
then it -- it won't, which means that Congress has 
restricted the operation of -- of Rule 5.  And -- and 
there are a number of instances where Congress will 
restrict the operation of Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure even when someone is concededly a party to the 
case.

 I have cited a number of instances in that 
-- of that in our reply brief.  There are a number of 
statutory actions, especially where the government is a 
party, where, even though it is concededly a party and 
everyone's a party, the -- the normal party discovery 
obligations don't apply.  We have cited FOIA and EPA and 
tax summons and -- and habeas is a slightly different 
example.  But there are many examples where Congress 
will step in and restrict the obligations that the 
Federal Rules would otherwise apply to people who are 
parties without depriving them of party status.

 I would like to address the intervention 

provision.  We have many arguments in our briefs as to 
why the intervention provision doesn't determine party 
status.  I think that the simplest way from A to B is to 
follow through to its conclusion an example that the

government gives.  The government says that if it vetoes 
a settlement, then it is a party.

 Well, if it vetoes a settlement -- - that 

is, without having intervened.  If it vetoes a 
settlement without having intervened, the case goes 
forward because there is no settlement.  But then if the 
government wants to conduct the action, the only way it 
can conduct the action under the statute is if it then 
intervenes.  So you have a case where the government is 
already a party when it intervenes; and, therefore, even 
under the government's example the intervention 
provision cannot determine party status.

 I would like to just go back to the 

definition of -- of "party" that is in our briefing. 
The -- several provisions of the False Claims Act show 
that, even without ever intervening or actively 
participating, the government satisfies the classic 
elements of party status.  It's a real party interest 
because the statute upholds the government's claim and 
gives the government the bulk of recovery.  The -- the 
government is named as a plaintiff in the pleadings 
pursuant to the act's naming requirements.  The 
government is served with the complaint under Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 4 pursuant to the act's service 
requirement.  And the government is bound by the

judgment, which is not even disputed here.  Those are 
the classic elements of party status, and the government 
satisfies them all in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There is something odd 

about -- plaintiffs come to the court seeking something. 
Defendants are -- are stuck.  They're being sued.  And 
here the United States is an involuntary plaintiff.  It 
didn't commence this lawsuit, and I think there must be 
many cases where the government will say, we don't want 
anything to do with this.

 MR. SCHOR:  I -- I don't think it's accurate 
to say that the government is an involuntary plaintiff, 
because Congress has said the United States will be a 
plaintiff under these circumstances and -- and in that 
respect Congress has spoken for the United States.

 It is an oddity of the False Claims Act that 

the plaintiff is served with the complaint, but that's 
there on the face of the statute.  And once it's served, 
having been named and having been already a real party 
in interest by operation of law, then it has -- it's 
already a party at that point.  And if it's a party at 
that point, then it's a party for purposes of Federal 
Rules of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B) and -- and may 
be for other purposes as well.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  May be for other purposes? 

I thought you told me before that it was for other 
purposes as well.

 MR. SCHOR:  Yes, it is.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Let's stay on track.
 MR. SCHOR:  Yes.
 I would like to --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It's not really a party for 
all purposes in your submission.  It's not a party for 
discovery purposes, is it?

 MR. SCHOR:  In -- in our argument it is a 

party even though it is not subject to discovery.  There 
are two ways one could characterize the government.  One 
can either say it's not a party for purposes of 
discovery; or, as we say, citing authority in our reply, 
it is a party, but it is for other statutory reasons not 
subject to discovery.

 The declination provision is key here.  By 
the declination provision Congress said the government 
can decline to engage in discovery.  All right.  It 
declines to conduct the action.  One aspect of 
conducting the action is engaging in discovery.  The 
government can decline to engage.  That means not only 
not serving discovery requests, but not responding to 
discovery requests.  And that's part and parcel of the

declination provision.  That's the way Congress 
structured it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where is that?  What 

provision is that?  I didn't focus on that.

 MR. SCHOR:  The declination provision, Your 

Honor?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  I am sorry.  I didn't 

mean to eat up your time with this.

 MR. SCHOR:  No, that's all right.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, where is it in the 

stuff that I have?

 MR. SCHOR:  Oh.
 Well, it's certainly on page 2 of our 

opening brief.  It says:  "If the government elects not 
to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the 
action shall have the right to conduct the action."  And 
there are other provisions that we cite in footnote 27.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but that doesn't say 
anything about discovery in particular.  I thought you 
were talking about some declination provision that --
that said the government is -- is not subject to 
discovery.

 MR. SCHOR:  Well, footnote 27 of our brief 

also cites other provisions of the act that -- that 
define what it means "to conduct the action."  And

discovery is one of them, and the declination provision 
says that if the government declines -- if the 
government -- if the government intervenes, then it 
conducts the action; if it declines, then it doesn't 
conduct the action.  And the rest of the act defines 
what "conducting the action" is, and that includes 
discovery.

 so our -- our conclusion from that is that 

when the government declines to conduct the action, it's 
going to decline to engage in discovery.  That's --
that's the argument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and the fact that it 

cannot conduct discovery also involves the fact that 
it's immune from discovery, how do you get that?  And it 
is; is it not?

 MR. SCHOR:  Yes, that's our position, and I 

think that's the government's position as well.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I'm sure it's the 

government's position.

 MR. SCHOR:  It would be --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But how can that -- how can 

that be if it's a party?

 MR. SCHOR:  If -- it's a party who is 

because of the declination provision not subject to 
discovery.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The declination provision 
doesn't say that.  The declination provision just says 
that it is not actively conducting the case.  But how do 
you get its exemption from discovery?

 MR. SCHOR:  Because the declination 

provision says that if the government declines, then it 
will not conduct the action; The relator will conduct 
the action.  And "conducting the action" is defined 
elsewhere in the statute as including conducting 
discovery, engaging in discovery.  And it would be hard 
to imagine Congress contemplating such asymmetry in --
in discovery obligations that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I agree with that, but --
but it's -- it's for me a problem with your assertion 
that for all purposes the government is a party.  It 
seems to me it is not a party for purposes of discovery, 
and there is no provision in -- in the -- in the False 
Claims Act that exempts it from discovery.

 MR. SCHOR:  There is -- it's an inference 

drawn from the statute, Your Honor.

 In sum, we would ask the Court to reverse 

the judgment of the Second Circuit, and I would like to 
reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL T. REPHEN
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 MR. REPHEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and members 

of the Court:

 When the government declines to intervene in 

a qui tam action, it should not be deemed a party for 
purposes of the Rules of Procedure Rule 4.  The 
government's role is described in terms of intervention 
as of right in the first 60 days following the filing of 
the complaint and for good cause thereafter if the 
government decides to come in after initial declination.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is certainly a 
trap for the unaware, right?  I mean, every lawyer loves 
to win on a technicality, but --

MR. REPHEN:  I don't think this is a trap 

for the unwary.  It is clear --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It says if the 

United States is a party, it is -- it is 60; if it's 
not, it's 30.  And you have got a situation where the 
United States -- the action is brought in the name of 
the United States.

 MR. REPHEN:  It is brought in the name of 

the United States.  But, you know, looking at the 
statute, where the government has declined, it's not a 
party.  Any conservative counsel, if there are two

periods of time, 30 days or 60 days, the intelligent 
thing to do is to go ahead --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know, but this is 
such a -- such a trap for the unwary that you never even 
raise this point.  It was raised sua sponte by the court 
of appeals.

 MR. REPHEN:  And rejected.  And I think 

after -- it is hard to see --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, my point is if 
it didn't occur to you, how can you claim that it should 
definitely have occurred to your friend on the other 
side?

 MR. REPHEN:  I don't know that it didn't 

occur to us.  I think we were trying to reject it, and 
certainly after this Court decides the issue it would no 
longer be a trap for the unwary.  The decision will be 
out there, either 30 days or 60 days.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question 
about:  Are there a number of circuits that follow the 
60-day rule?

 MR. REPHEN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And in those cases, 

suppose we decide your way in this case.  What happens 
to the -- all the appeals that have been taken relying 
on the 60-day rule?  Because I understand the failure to

file a notice of appeal is jurisdictional.

 MR. REPHEN:  I think those appeals will be 

terminated.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  All of those would be 

terminated?

 MR. REPHEN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And what about judgments 

that have been entered based on appeals that were --

MR. REPHEN:  I don't know.  I guess those 

judgments would have to be vacated, the judgments --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  So we are really -- in 

several circuits, a really rather important decision is 
being called for?

 MR. REPHEN:  Yes, yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why would the judgment 

have to be vacated?  Even a jurisdictional issue becomes 
subject to preclusion once you have gone the appeal 
route --

MR. REPHEN:  That is true, Your Honor, 

correct, yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So even the 

jurisdictional base can be precluded and not raised on 
collateral attack.

 MR. REPHEN:  You are correct, Your Honor.

it is very important in this case to look at the 
legislative history.  Congress has given the government 
60 days to weigh the risks and benefits of getting 
involved in the case.  If it chooses to do so, it has 
full responsibility for the conduct of the litigation.

 If it declines to do that, the 

statute provides that the relator shall have full 
responsibility for the conduct of the litigation and 
requires the government, if it subsequently wants to get 
involved, to make a motion for intervention, during 
which time it has to show good cause.  And it's our 
position that intervention should be given its ordinary 
and common meaning, which is the method by which a 
person who is not a party becomes a party.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except that the government 
here has considerable powers even without intervening, 
and they include its ability to move to stay discovery, 
which normally a party would only be able to do.  It can 
object to any voluntary dismissal or settlement, which 
normally would be a party's right.

 MR. REPHEN:  There are certain --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And some courts have 

allowed the government to move to dismiss.

 MR. REPHEN:  There is certainly a limited 

role here, but it is a very limited role.  The

government can do that.  This Court has recognized that 
it can be a party for this limited purpose.  For 
example, if the government moved to dismiss and they 
have -- there has to be a hearing following that, and 
that motion were denied, the government could not then 
participate on the merits of the case.  It would have to 
move to intervene for good cause if the 60 days had 
passed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So unlike -- unlike your 

adversary here, you -- your adversary says the 
government is a party for all purposes; you are not 
saying the government is not a party for all purposes. 
You're saying it's not a party for some purposes?

 MR. REPHEN:  What we're saying is certainly 

it is not a party in this case, where it has quite 
absolutely no role.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You are saying that.
 MR. REPHEN:  There may be --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you're also saying as 

for the rest, sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.
 MR. REPHEN:  There may -- there may be 

circumstances.  If the Court were to hold that 
intervention is required even in those limited 
circumstances, that would be okay with us.  We're not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How about -- I'm 

sorry.  Why don't you finish, counselor?

 MR. REPHEN:  We're not taking a formal 

position on that.

 I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, how does it 
work in -- presumably, I guess the government can decide 
that it wants to appeal the case in which it has not 
participated below, right?

 MR. REPHEN:  It would have to move to 

intervene.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It has to move to 

intervene.  So let's say there's a judgment and the 
government looks at it and says:  Well, we didn't know 
we would get a decision like this; We've got to appeal 
this.  The relator doesn't want to appeal it.  30 days 
goes by.  The Government moves to intervene because it 
has 60 days.

 MR. REPHEN:  I think we would take the 

position there is no longer a case, Your Honor.  It has 
30 days; the relator has not appealed.  The government 
was not a party during that 30-day period.  31, 32, 33 
days, the case is over.  I guess there is a possibility 
for the government to move to extend its time under the 
rules, but generally there would be an opportunity for

the government to intervene.  As soon as the case is 
over, it had not been a party, it had not chosen to be a 
party, and the time has expired.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So for all the 

reasons in the legislative history that you discussed 
about why the government gets more time, those reasons 
don't apply in that situation?

 MR. REPHEN:  It doesn't apply if there is no 

longer a case, and if 30 days has gone by, there would 
be no longer a case.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What's -- what about the 

case that they were talking about, so the relator's 
pursuing a case, that case is over, and they're not 
going to appeal because they don't have any money left, 
whatever it is; but the government looks at that 
judgment and thinks, oh, God, there's something wrong 
with this one, I better appeal it.  That's the 
government lawyer speaking.

 Now, they're supposed to have 60 days to 

figure that one out, and you'll take that 60 away from 
them because they'll have to do this whole thing in 30.
 MR. REPHEN:  Yes.  Having not intervened in 

the case, they had not been a party.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Would this be a solution 
which wouldn't help you?  You would say, well, there's 
some factors here cut one way, and there's some that cut 
the other way, and some circuits have said the 
government should have the 60 days, and those cases are 
already proceeding.  So it's best to keep it where it

the Rules Committee would looked into it if it's a

 MR. REPHEN:  I think the rules --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right?
 MR. REPHEN:  Well, we rely on it because 

that was what Congress said.  Congress has made it clear 
using intervention --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The original statute or the 

earlier statute did not use the word "intervention."

 MR. REPHEN:  But we used it in a number --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I forget the different word 

it used?

 MR. REPHEN:  "Appearance," maybe.

Congress clearly means that now in 1986.  I think 
Congress knew what it was intending.  Absent any 
legislative history that Congress intended to not give 
the term "intervention" its commonly understood term --
and it's such a commonly understood term -- by which a 
nonparty becomes a party, I think one should give it 
that normal intention.

MR. REPHEN:  Our argument was --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The government would have 

been a party?

 MR. REPHEN:  I wouldn't --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because you can be a party 

and not appear.

 MR. REPHEN:  I wouldn't say that, Your 

Honor.  But I know in 1986 what they were attempting to 
do is strengthen the right of private persons to bring 
qui tam actions.  For the first time, the government was 
given a limited right to come in for good cause after 60 
days.  But if you look at the legislative history of 
that, I think Congress intended that the right of the 
government to intervene after 60 days was somewhat 
limited, and they had to show good cause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I -- I 

pressed your friend about what's the big deal, why don't 
you just file within 30.  It only seems fair to press 
you on what's the big deal with letting them have for

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I agree with 

that.  I agree with that.  But what if we say --

MR. REPHEN:  And I think Your Honor, I think 

that, Chief Justice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  What if 
I say, or whoever is writing the opinion says, this is 
only for purposes of filing the appeal?  We don't decide 
whether the government is a party in all these other 
characteristics, but whether it comes to Rule 4(a) --

MR. REPHEN:  I think the purpose of Rule 4 
was to give the government time to make a decision when 
it's actually a party and it has a right to appeal.  It 
should -- it is jurisdictional.  It should be construed 
narrowly.  The purpose of the rule is to expedite the 
process of appeals --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it should be 
construed narrowly.  I don't think saying whether it's 
30 or 60 days at all implicates that principle.

 MR. REPHEN:  Well, if -- if the rule 

provides that the government should have 60 days when it 
is a party and it's not a party, then it seems to me 
it's a bit more --

mean, if we assume you're right, then that's construing 
it narrowly.  But the whole question is that there's 
some confusion in the rule about who's right, and all 
I'm saying is it seems to me that it would be the 
easiest thing to avoid any trap for the unwary with no 
consequences on the other side, to say 60 days.

 MR. REPHEN:  But I think it wouldn't be 

consistent with the intent of Congress or the intent of 
the rule, which is to move appeals along really within 
30 days.  The exception is given to the government when 
it is a party, when it has to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, this isn't going 

to delay appeals, for heaven's sakes.  I mean, there's 
all sorts of scheduling rules about the timing of the 
briefs and everybody gets an extension on their briefs. 
This is going to have no effect whatever on how quickly 
appeals move along.

 MR. REPHEN:  Then I would tell Your Honor, 

you know, whether or not you want to give somebody a 
break on that, it is simply inconsistent with the rule, 
which requires the United States to be a party when they 
have, as in this case, played absolutely no role; and 
they are clearly not a party.

 Again, turning to the question of the real 
party in interest, as I think was discussed, real party

in interest is simply one who can bring the lawsuit. 
Mr. Eisenstein is a real party in interest.  A real 
party in interest is not synonymous with party status. 
Rule 17 describes real party in interest.  Obviously 
Rule 4 describes a party --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The other side acknowledges 

that.  They say, however, it's different when you have 
real party in interest plus the party named --

MR. REPHEN:  I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and these things are 

styled "United States."

 MR. REPHEN:  Your Honor, I don't think it's 

an accumulation of all of these bits of real party in 
interest.  Well, it doesn't really count, now the 
parties named --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no, no.  No, no, that's 

-- that's unfair.  If you are a real party in interest 
and you are the named party --

MR. REPHEN:  I think the naming -- the 

naming --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're normally a party.
 MR. REPHEN:  The naming is nominal.  I think 

the real question is to look at the intent of Congress 
in terms of the right of the government to participate,

of experience under the qui tam action, the United 
States was named but had absolutely no right to play a 
role in the litigation.

 I don't know that we should elevate form 

over substance here, and I must come back again to what 
we think is the critical role, which was the intent of 
Congress in requiring intervention on the part of the 
United States Government if it decides that it wants to 
assume the burdens of party status.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there are certain 

things the government can do, you concede, without 
intervening?

 MR. REPHEN:  Yes, there are certain limited 

roles.  I don't know that that makes them a party for 
purposes of the Eisenstein case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If the government did 

decide to take over, the qui tam plaintiff would remain 
a party --

MR. REPHEN:  But the government would have 

primary responsibility under the statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So why shouldn't it work 

the other way?  When the government stays out, it's a 
party -- when the government isn't conducting the 
litigation, it's a party just as a qui tam plaintiff 
would be a party.

MR. REPHEN:  Yes, I think the standard is 

intervention, and absent intervention by the United 
States, it should not be a party.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except the United States 

has a lot of power.  Unlike the -- the government's 
presentation here, you would not allow any degree of 
activity on the part of the government to cause it to be 
a party, even if it exercises all these other powers 
short of intervening?  It must intervene in your --

MR. REPHEN:  No, we would accept -- if it 
has to be a bright line, we would accept intervention. 
We recognize, though, the standard that you can be a 
party for limited purpose as --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, do you want a bright 

line or not a bright line?

 MR. REPHEN:  I would -- we would --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you agree with the 

government?

 MR. REPHEN:  We would live with a bright 

line certainly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you agree with the 

government's presentation that it becomes a party when 
it reaches a certain ineffable degree of activity in the 
case?

MR. REPHEN:  I don't know if it's ineffable. 

I think the government was relying on the Devlin 
decision, where there was some indication that there 
could be status of being a party where there is limited 
for participation for collateral purposes.  But again in 
Devlin, the government had argued that intervention was 
the preferable method of getting into a case.  The Court 
rejected that because they thought intervention 
essentially would be pro forma, but in this -- in this 
--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think they were 

relying on Devlin.  The --

MR. REPHEN:  They were relying --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The point they are making 

here --

MR. REPHEN:  They were addressing --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  --- is not that we're a 

party for some purposes and not for others.  The point 
they're making is we're a party for all purposes, once 
we reach a certain degree of activity in the case.

 MR. REPHEN:  I don't think the government is 

saying they're a party for all purposes which is a --

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I have a question for you, 

Mr. Wall.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. WALL:  I thought you might.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the government's 

position on that point?

 MR. WALL:  I actually wanted to start 

exactly where you and Justice Ginsburg began because I 
think we've gotten off a little bit on the wrong track.
 If this Court wants a bright-line rule, the 
right rule is intervention.  Now, that would solve 98 or

99 percent of qui tam suits under the False Claims Act. 
The government urged intervention as a prerequisite in 
Devlin, and this Court disagreed.  So the government 
left open the possibility in its brief that in a very 
small number of qui tam suits, on the order of 1 percent 
or less, it might participate, absent intervention, in a 
way that would justify treatment as a party under 
Devlin.

 But whether or not the Court agrees with us 

on that -- a question not presented here where the 
government hasn't participated in any way -- the right 
rule is intervention, and it's just a question of 
whether this Court wants to make it cover 98 percent of 
the suits or 100 percent of the suits.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Do you take the position 

that without intervention though, nonetheless the 
government could appeal at the -- at the tail end?

 MR. WALL:  No, we do not think --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  You don't think that --

okay.

 MR. WALL:  -- that the government could have 
appealed the judgment here as of right, and that is why 
we think the purposes of the 60-day period were not 
implicated.  Because the government couldn't appeal, it 
was not a potential appellant that required the

authorization of the Solicitor General, and it didn't 
need the 60 days.  And that's an important point, I 
think, about why it couldn't just be solved by the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Doesn't it need the 60 days 

to figure out whether it would want to intervene in 
order to be able to appeal?

 MR. WALL:  Justice Scalia, I think that 
would be equally true in a number of contexts -- for 
instance, class action settlements where the government 
is entitled to notice, presumably so that it can 
intervene; government contractor suits.  There are any 
number of Federal cases where the government might find 
the decision shocking and want to come in, but until it 
does, it's a non-party.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they are not statutes 
which give the government an extended period of time in 
order to allow the consultation.  This is a statute that 
does that.  And why would they -- why would they not 
envision the need for that consultation in the situation 
where the government has had no participation but comes 
up with a -- with a decision contrary to what it thinks 
the good law is, and it has to decide whether it wants 
to intervene in order to appeal.  Why shouldn't they be 
given 60 days?

respect, the False Claims Act itself doesn't say 
anything about intervention.  It doesn't say anything 
about 60 days.  It just says the government has a right 
to come in and take over the action and run it and allow 
the relator to continue as a party.  And that's why it 
uses the word "intervene" -- because Congress understood 
that, in its accepted legal meaning, as a process by 
which a nonparty becomes a party, and the idea was to 
give the executive branch a choice.  In each qui tam 
suit, the executive is able to determine whether to 
assume the greater benefits and burdens of party status.
 Petitioner is caught in the awkward position 
of saying that he thinks that the government is a party 
at the time the case is filed, not then a party for 
purposes of discovery, but even though it hasn't done 
anything, it's somehow a party again when the notice of 
appeal is filed.  And the government's position is that 
just where it does not come into the case and doesn't 
intervene, it's not a party for any of those purposes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- why do you 
care?  I mean, you're just giving people who might well 
be confused by this provision another 30 days.

 MR. WALL:  I think there are two distinct 

harms, Mr. Chief Justice.  The first is to the 
government, and the second is to Congress and the system

it set up in the statute.  The harm to the government is 
that, if it can be made a party under FRAP 4, despite 
the fact that it has actively attempted to decline party 
status, it could also be made a party under the other 
rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay, but, again, we 

would limit any decision to Federal Rule of Appeal 4 
because of the dramatically adverse consequences for the 
unwary.  They lose their right to pursue their case.

 MR. WALL:  I don't think the government has 
any objection in theory to a period of 60 days for only 
FRAP 4.  I think the difficulty is that any number of 
rules speak in terms of parties.  And Petitioners 
advance no persuasive between FRAP 4 and other rules.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I just does 

did.  Under FRAP 4, you're out the door without any 
hearing on the merits.  It's a technicality.  The spirit 
of the rules is that we don't throw people out because 
of mere technicalities.  Now, failure to file a timely 
notice of appeal is not a technicality in terms of the 
consequences.

 MR. WALL:  That's right.  Three brief 

points, I think.

 First, if this Court announces a 30-day 

rule, that's clear going forward.  Relators and their

counsel will treat declined qui tam suits like civil 
actions generally to which the United States is a party.
 Second, if the rules are better read for a 

30-day period, because the United States was not a 
party, you're entitled to appeal the judgment, then 
Petitioner was not entitled to assume that he would get 
60 days --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the relators and 
the parties in the four circuits that have adopted the 
60-day rule.  They had a court of appeals opinion in 
front of them that said you had 60 days.  They're just 
out of luck now?

 MR. WALL:  Well, I think they also were on 

notice that there's a long-standing circuit split on 
this question which the court has never answered.  Given 
the fact that what you're talking about is a ministerial 
task, filing a one-page notice, there are actually 
Federal court manuals that instruct in this circumstance 
relator's counsel to file within the 30 days.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sure that the 

Appellate Rules Advisory Committee, when they hear this 
decision, if they haven't already, will put something in 
the rules about whether it's 30 days or 60 days.  So I'm 
not terribly concerned about clarity going forward.

and the submission of new rules, and I see no reason 
that they wouldn't make it clear.  I don't know whether 
they'll think 30 or 60 is the best idea.

 MR. WALL:  Right, and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's just a 
question of -- in this case and, as Justice Stevens 
pointed out, what the effect is going to be on other 
cases.  And it seems to me that in that situation, 60 
days makes the most sense because otherwise you're 
disrupting the system solely based on a trap for the 
unwary.

 MR. WALL:  Well, and that goes to a question 

that Justice Breyer asked earlier.  The statute, 2107, 
was enacted after what is now FRAP 4.  The rule and the 
statute shortened the period to appeal from 3 months to 
30 days.  And then the Judicial Conference, in the -- in 
the -- what is now FRAP 4, drew the exception of 60 days 
for cases in which the United States was a party because 
of an express need for more time for the Solicitor 
General to make a decision.

 The Judicial Conference raised some question 
about how we do that.  Two years later Congress enacted 
the statute putting in the 30-day and 60-day rules.  I 
think then that's a baseline.  And I'm not sure that the 
advisory committee could come back and effectively amend

the -- amend the statute by changing the rule.

 What Congress had in mind when it passed 
2107 was if the -- if the -- the United States is a 
potential appellant and requires more time to conduct 
its internal decisionmaking processes, it gets 60 days. 
Otherwise, that 30-day baseline governs, and I 
respectfully disagree, Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress 
was not concerned about moving appeals forward 
expeditiously.  It shortened the period from three 
months to 30 days precisely because of wanting judgments 
to become final.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it is -- it is a 

potential appellant.  I mean if you say Congress is 
concerned about situations in which the government is a 
potential appellant.  It is a potential appellant in 
these cases until the 30 days have elapsed, at least. 
It -- it can intervene, and why shouldn't it have the 60 
days to decide whether to appeal or not?

 MR. WALL:  I guess -- and I -- the same 

answer I gave earlier, Justice Scalia:  That's equally 
true virtually in any Federal case that might affect the 
United States's interests --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand, but this --
this goes to your argument about congressional intent: 
That they were concerned about preserving to the

government time as a potential appellant to think the 
matter over.  It seems to me that argument is -- is a 
wash.

 MR. WALL:  But I think it goes back to what 
Justice Ginsburg asked much earlier, which is:  At the 
time the judgment is entered, who is a party entitled to 
take the appeal?  If the United States has done nothing, 
it's not a potential appellant.  When the 30-day period 
runs, the case is over, and the United States, if it 
wants to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can the United States 

intervene within those 30 days --

MR. WALL:  It can intervene.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and then appeal?
 MR. WALL:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it's a potential 

appellant.

 MR. WALL:  Well, it is -- yes, and it is --

it is equally true that it is a potential appellant then 
in any case that might affect its interests.  But we do 
not commonly consider the United States a party to every 
class action settlement or in every government 
contractor suit simply based on the possibility that it 
may want to intervene.

 When it does so very rarely -- we're talking

about -- I mean that is the exceptionally rare case in 
the False Claims Act, and the government is saying, we 
can make that decision within the 30 days because we are 
not a party to the judgment at the time it's entered. 
And, again, I think what Petitioner strains to do when 
he says at page 25 of his reply brief that when you 
decline as the government, you avoid the burdens of 
party status.  What Petitioner can't explain is why that 
is any different for the burden of appealing an adverse 
judgment and the burdens of discovery.  All of those 
rules speak in terms of party status.

 If Petitioner is able to foist on the 
government a status that it actively attempted to 
decline, as was its right afforded it by Congress, then 
it seems to me Petitioner can equally try to foist on 
the government, though it doesn't here, in future cases 
party status.  And this Court will have to decide case 
by case:  Is the United States a party for purposes of 
each rule of civil and appellate procedure?  And I think 
that approach threatens much more uncertainty than the 
approach the government is outlining where intervention 
is a simple, workable, administrable test to determine 
whether the United States is a party to a qui tam suit.
 If there are no more questions, thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GIDEON A. SCHOR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCHOR:  Thank you.
 I think it begs the question to say that by 

its declination the government is declining party 
status.  It is declining to conduct the action.  That's 
a much more limited category than the category of party 
status.  The government is a party because it is named, 
served, and bound, and a real party in interest.  And I 
didn't hear any arguments addressing why the 
intervention provision is not determinative of -- of 
party status in response to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why isn't it also a party 

under all these other rules?

 MR. SCHOR:  We -- we -- our position is that 

it -- that it is a party.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Under all of the rules of 

discovery?

 MR. SCHOR:  Well, again, we think it's a 
party although for other reasons in the statute that 
it's not subject to full party discovery because of the 
declination provision, which I discussed in -- in the 
opening.

of Respondent's counsel that it's -- that it's their 
rule that will be the bright-line test.  Clearly, it's 
Petitioner's rule.  Petitioner says that the government 
is a party in all qui tam actions for purposes of 
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B).  That 
forecloses all of the jurisdictional inquiries.

 It forecloses the -- the pending case issue. 
It forecloses the -- the complicated question of when --
if the government gets a surprisingly bad -- if a 
district court issues a surprisingly adverse judgment 
when the government doesn't intervene, the government --
the government wants to intervene for purposes of 
appeal.  Certainly, first of all, the government -- that 
-- that question of whether to intervene is essentially 
the question of whether to appeal, and so it should have 
60 days, given the rationale for the rule.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  What do you -- what do you 
say to the government's argument that they -- it -- it 
may close these doors that -- that you're saying, but it 
opens a lot of others under other rules?  The government 
says you're just asking for trouble under the -- under 
the -- a -- an undifferentiated number of other rules if 
we go your way.  What's your response to that?

 MR. SCHOR:  I don't think it does.  I think 
-- I think the -- an active participation standard would

create far more trouble, far more complexity.  It would 
be almost impossible for relators and defense to -- to 
know in advance what's -- what's required of them.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's -- that's true, but 

that's not the point that Justice Souter was making. 
This is a self-denying position on the part of the 
government.  You would expect the government to come in 
and say, yeah, give us 60 days to think this over.

 They're saying, no, we'll only take 30, 

because they're worried if we come out your way on that 
issue, there are other issues on which they're also 
going to be considered a party, and it's not worth the 
risk.

 MR. SCHOR:  Well, I think their concern is 
that -- is discovery primarily, and we have certainly 
put plenty of arguments in our brief as to why that 
concern is -- is less and there is certainly plenty of 
authority for -- for thinking that the government won't 
be subject to discovery.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:14 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
