CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

4

first this morning in Case No. 15-1111, Bank of America 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corporation v. The City of Miami and the consolidated

Mr. Katyal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

The question in this case is whether cities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

can sue under one of our nation's most important laws, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Fair Housing Act.  Our answer to that question is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes, sometimes, and I mean three things by that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

First, the answer can't be yes always, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

because that would eviscerate two key doctrines of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court:  Proximate cause and zone of interests. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

Second, the answer can't be no, never, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

because cities can identify concrete harms that fall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the zone-of-interests, such as discrete 

 

 

 

 

 

expenditures to combat a particular defendant's racial 

   

 

 

 

 

23 

misconduct. 

24 

            

And third, this lawsuit fails both the zone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

of interests and proximate cause, because the injury it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

seeks to remedy is unrelated to the Act's purposes, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that injury is several steps removed from any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged acts of Petitioners. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

If I could start with zone of interests.

This Court, in Lexmark --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you -- before you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

do that, Mr. Katyal, could you please tell us:  You --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you said, yes, cities can sue under the FHA, but not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- not on -- in this scenario. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Can you tell us what -- under what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances could a city sue? 

   

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. 

  

 

 

 

So we want -- our position is to preserve existing law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly where it is, and existing law identifies two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places where cities can sue.  One is a Havens-like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation in which a city, like the NGO in Havens, is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combatting discrete instances of discrimination by 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant, and outlaying things, so testers or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

something. 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

So if you took the allegations in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint and -- and when -- we made them out to be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

banks were engaged in some sort of discriminatory loans, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the City had to -- had to basically expend funds to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test that out to enforce its housing statutes, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks very much like the one-to-one relationship that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6

2 

was at issue in Havens, both for zone of interest and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for proximate cause. 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  In Havens, 

  

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

the testers were not city employees.  In Havens, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were private organizational employees whose job it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do this. 

 

 

            

So why are you attributing the testers' work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the City directly? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Because, Justice Sotomayor, in 

  

 

 

 

 

that case -- and this is paragraph (F) of the complaint. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's Appendix page 20 in Havens -- the complaint asks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the City's expenditures to combat -- to identify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific things, including testers and other -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, other enforcement things. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why is this different 

  

 

 

 

 

than the other allegations in Havens that had to do, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like here, with lost revenues, with lost tax base, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court cited as well?  Here there are direct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expenditures in terms of increased monitoring of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area by police and other services. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Aren't those City expenditures? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So those -- that's not Havens, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor, with respect.  I think that's 

    

 

 

 

 

24 

Gladstone. 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I apologize. 

    

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

            

MR. KATYAL:  But -- but -- but our position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

is that to the extent the City cannot plead a complaint 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that looks like Gladstone -- and this gets back to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg's question -- the second bucket in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the City can assert an injury is just like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gladstone in which there is a segregation claim that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being advanced.  There was that racial steerers, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Realtors were literally steering African-Americans out 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Village.  That is an anti-discrimination harm to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Village itself.  And so for zone-of-interest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

purposes, Gladstone doesn't talk about proximate cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all, but for zone-of-interest purposes, there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely nothing wrong with that.  That is, the City 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has identified --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, but you're 

  

 

 

 

 

thinking that if banks are forcing people out of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neighborhood, that that's not discrimination? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Oh, no.  I'm saying that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

your -- Your Honor, to the extent that that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segregation interest, absolutely it is.  And that's what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

Gladstone recognizes. 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Here's what it doesn't recognize though.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't recognize something like this complaint, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not that the City is pleading an anti-discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  Rather, they are borrowing someone else's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

anti-discrimination interests, namely the discriminatory 

 

 

 

 

loans that happen. 

 

 

            

So look, our position is the direct victims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can obviously sue for that, but so too can the Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department and HUD, because that's what Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

empowered them to do, to have a version of parens 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

patriae standing. 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

 

 

But what they are saying is, well, we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmed downstream for tax revenues and things like that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That looks very much like the shareholder in Thompson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that so concerned this Court.  That is, the shareholder 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was not identifying an anti-discrimination injury; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were identifying an economic injury and cutting and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pasting the anti-discrimination --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about Gladstone, 

  

 

 

 

 

which is the case of a village suing?  They were suing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for diminished property values that -- which resulted in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loss of revenue.  That -- that was -- so to that extent, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these two cases seem the same to me.  The bottom line, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their municipality said our tax base has been depleted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The properties have gone way down in value. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So, Justice Ginsburg, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

that that's not totally correct for two reasons.  Number 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one, in Gladstone the injury itself to the Village was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an anti-discrimination injury.  That's the first part of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 

2 

3

5 

Gladstone.  That's found at page 110 of the opinion. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But here they haven't identified an anti-discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm to the City of Miami.  They have identified an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic harm.  So that's why this case is not within 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the zone of interest, but the one there is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

It looks much -- you can think of it this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

way:  There are kind of two lodestars in this Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  One is the Thompson shareholder.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

shareholder who has an economic injury, no doubt they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are hurt by an underlying act of discrimination at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

front end against someone who is fired, like the CEO who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is fired for race discrimination or something like that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But this Court said, a-ha, that opens the door towards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way too many lawsuits and landlords --

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was a hypothetical 

   

  

 

 

16 

17 

18 

the Court brought up on its own.  I'm -- I'm surprised 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you put so much weight on Thompson because that was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case that upheld standing. 

 

 

 

19 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Oh, absolutely.  And again, our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

opinion is fully consistent with Thompson.  That is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language in the opinion itself.  It certainly was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something Justice Kennedy raised in oral argument and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then picked up by Justice Breyer in Thompson.  But their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual language and opinion does talk about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shareholders.  And it's not just Thompson.

says something much the same about landlords and utility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

companies, and if you accept their interpretation, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are opening the door not just to the City, but to anyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else who can borrow someone else's anti-discrimination

Home was in -- was it the -- the Havens case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So there's two different 

  

 

 

 

 

buckets, and the first bucket -- that was my first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer to Justice Ginsburg -- yes, the City is like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Home, the NGO there.  They're identifying specific 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concrete interests, the expenditures that they have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outlay to combat a defendant's racial misconduct.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

so to the extent that a city wants to do that, that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

absolutely fine. 

 

20 

            

21 

well --

 

22 

            

There is a second category of things as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's how you're 

  

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

saying -- and I don't want to foreclose, prevent you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from finishing your answer, but are you saying that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

City is limited just to the damages that it -- that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11 

1 

can recover? 

 

2 

            

MR. KATYAL:  On that theory, in that bucket, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

yes, they would be limited to the damages.  They are now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the second bucket, the segregation --

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, I mean, is it just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

6 

the costs they incur in trying to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Just --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- eliminate 

  

 

 

9 

discrimination? 

10 

            

11 

Havens. 

12 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Just as it is in the NGO in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy, I see you're troubled by 

   

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

that, but I point out the second thing is the Gladstone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segregation category.  And in that circumstance, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

City can recover for either -- we will put proximate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause to the side for a second.  But just in terms of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

zone of interest, they can recover for the harms by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making an integrated neighborhood become segregated, 

 

 

 

 

 

however marginally that may be.  That is something they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can recover for, as well as, of course, injunctive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

damages. 

22 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But would that be added 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

police force or something like that? 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. KATYAL:  No.  I don't think it would 

    

  

 

 

 

 

25 

be -- you know, again, that would, I think, run into 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

1 

2 

proximate-cause problems down the road, because there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are many steps and causalities that are --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What can the City recover 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

for general damages of having a segregated -- a more 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

segregated community by a result of -- as a result of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant's actions? 

 

 

7 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that anything 

   

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

that they can directly outlay, and that may be very hard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to identify.  And that's why normally this is done more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the injunctive side, and I think the scheme Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had implied was to give parens patriae standing to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Department and to HUD to bring these cases --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- your 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

concession runs into the same problem as your main 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  I mean, if -- if the City can recover for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having a more segregated environment, that seemed to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

measured by all sorts of things, including tourists 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't going to want to visit it as much. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

How would you measure the damages if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

harm is simply having a more segregated city? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I don't know that it runs into 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the same thing.  I'm making an argument about what this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's precedence on standing requires starting with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 1990 decision in Lujan which says, a city has to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify -- the words of the opinion is -- his injury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

1 

            

So here the City has to identify an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

anti-discrimination interest that they have suffered. 

 

 

 

 

 

They can't cut and paste and borrow someone else's.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent we are talking about, as this complaint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does, kind of diminution in tax bases and so on and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's their injury, that is not an anti-discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

injury. 

8 

            

And so the way to reconcile --

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Katyal, that 

  

 

 

 

 

suggests that when Congress passed the FHA, it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking only at individual acts of discrimination to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular persons.  But the FHA is a very peculiar and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctive kind of anti-discrimination statute, which 

 

 

 

 

 

really is focusing on community harms, and we talked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about this a lot in the Texas Housing case of a couple 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of years ago.  So it's not just individuals who are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmed; it's communities who are harmed.  And that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic idea of the entire statute, why Congress passed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

it. 

20 

            

And here the cities are standing up and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

saying, every time you do this redlining and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reverse redlining, essentially a community is becoming 

   

 

 

 

 

blighted.  And who better than the City to recognize 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that interest and to assert it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, we certainly recognize 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

that that is something that is at issue and one of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goals of the Fair Housing Act, but I think the way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress dealt with that is not by saying, cities are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

empowered to have some sort of parens patriae standing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what they gave the Justice Department and HUD. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And as well, by the way, Justice Kagan, in 3610(f), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress empowered state and local enforcement over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

housing discrimination to deal with those types of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

community-centered problems that you're talking about. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

            

But here they are not using any of that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

They are coming in and saying, we are a person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggrieved.  And a person aggrieved in the statute whose 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

chapter is entitled, quote, "Enforcement by Private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Persons," and our position is --

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but they are a person 

   

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

aggrieved under the -- given Congress' purposes in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act, because they are saying, as you did this redlining, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as you did this reverse redlining, our communities, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing that makes us a city was becoming more and more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blighted, and that's what we are trying to recover for, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the costs of responding to that, the -- the costs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of not having revenues in order to carry out our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services for that community and for others. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So, Justice Kagan --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Not parens patriae.  This is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

2 

3 

their own interest in maintaining their communities free 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the kind of racial discrimination that the Act says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes neighborhood blight. 

 

 

4 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Kagan, if the -- if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

complaint were written to say that it was about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segregation causing blight, we would have no problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with it, which is what I was saying to Justice Ginsburg 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to zone of interest.  The City would fall 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within that zone of interest.  That's Gladstone, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what the Kerner Commission Report, which you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referring to says, which is, blight is not caused just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on its own but it was a result of segregation.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

references to blight in the Kerner Commission Report 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow from segregation. 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How far out -- how far out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

would damages extend in -- in the -- the hypothesis you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just gave to Justice Kagan? 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So -- so for zone of interest, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

I think, you know, you're able to get -- I don't think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it matters, that is, to the extent that the City can --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the complaint by the City pleads a segregation harm. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Even if it's downstream, they are within the zone of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

interest. 

24 

            

25 

            

Now to turn to proximate cause, though --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  I guess I don't 

    

   

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

understand why this isn't a segregation harm.  Here, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

City is saying, you've done this redlining; you've done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this reverse redlining.  It's not that it just causes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various foreclosures all over the City; it's causing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreclosures in particular concentrated areas, and it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing that because of racial segregation. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

And at the same time, it's preventing that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

racial segregation from ever being lifted because those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communities are becoming more and more blighted and less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and less capable of becoming integrated communities.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything about this complaint is about racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segregation, it seems to me. 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Kagan, I'd encourage 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

you to just look back at what you just said and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read it against their complaint, because none of that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the complaint. 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So do you think everything I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

just said, if their complaint was written like that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they could maintain a suit? 

   

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. KATYAL:  They could maintain a suit for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

segregation.  And the measure of damages wouldn't be the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure of damages which they're seeking, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recovery for the 2008 foreclosure crisis in Miami and to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the tune of billions of dollars nationwide.  It would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be, again, at most -- and I want to get to proximate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

cause -- it would be at most the delta between a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segregated community that had -- now exists as a result 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the defendant's particular conduct and an integrated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

community that would have existed otherwise.  That would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be the only measure of damages. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How -- how do you 

  

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

measure that? 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I'm not sure.  And that's why I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do think ultimately it may fail on proximate cause.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least we're -- we've been talking so far about zone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of interest, and that's, of course, all Gladstone dealt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with was zone of interest. 

 

 

 

 

            

And with respect to zone of interest, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that that complaint, the one that, Justice Kagan, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you read, would satisfy zone of interest.  It would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow at least a city to come in and get injunctive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief to try and preserve the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

community-centered concepts that you're talking about. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, the question is, would they be able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recover damages for that, including damages to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminution of their tax base?  It's certainly true, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg, that Gladstone has that line at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end of page 110 which talks about diminution of tax 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revenues.  The next line is, of course, that's enough 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for Article III standing. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

1 

            

So I don't think this Court has ever decided 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

the question of whether or not proximate-cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles allow a segregation lawsuit to extend so far. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your answer aimed at 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

Gladstone would be, I take it from everything you said, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Gladstone would flunk at the proximate-cause stage? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So I do think that that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

right; that is, there would be so many steps involved --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you could just take a look at this complaint.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you look at the Solicitor General's brief for page --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief at page 30, you see all the steps that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required before the City is injured. 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

You have to have discriminatory loans. 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

Those discriminatory loans have to lead to defaults. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The defaults have to lead to foreclosures.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreclosures need to lead to increase in vacancies.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase in vacancies needs to lead to reduction in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property values.  And then that is supposed to reduce 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

it. 

20 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I usually think of 

    

 

 

 

21 

22 

proximate cause -- correct me if I'm wrong -- as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of liability, not damages -- Palsgraf.  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

liability. 

24 

            

25 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Correct.  So it isn't --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it wasn't a question of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

19 

1 

2 

damages.  But you say proximate cause bears on both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability and damages? 

 

 

3 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I do.  I think that this Court 

    

    

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

has kind of thought about it that way.  You could think, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example, at Lexmark, and has said -- you know, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think what this Court has said is you look to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying damages that are being sought to understand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is the complaint within the kind of standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

proximate-cause principles? 

 

10 

            

And here, if you accept their theory, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

chain, you'll be doing something I don't know that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has ever done before, which is to allow such a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long chain of causation, a non-direct cause of -- chain 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of causation to the tune of, again, billions of dollars 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to recover from the --

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Katyal --

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

MR. KATYAL:  -- foreclosure crisis. 

  

 

 

 

            

I'm sorry.  Go ahead. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask a separate 

   

   

  

 

question?  We've been talking a lot about zone of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

interests and the question about whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

zone-of-interest test applies at all. 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

Because you have three cases prior to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

1988 re-enactment of the old 1968 language.  And in each 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of three cases -- in Trafficante, in Gladstone, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

Havens -- the Court very specifically says that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language stretches to the limits of Article III. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So Congress is amending the statute in 1988 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against that backdrop.  Why shouldn't we understand that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to mean that the language means it stretches to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits of Article III? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  For three reasons, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

Kagan. 

9

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

The first is that, at most, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional ratification doctrine only applies to 

 

 

 

 

 

holdings of the Court, not that -- I know you weren't on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court for Thompson, but a lot of the rest of us were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  And in Thompson, the Court unanimously --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm disabled from having 

  

 

 

 

 

thoughts on this subject. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  No, no, absolutely not.  I was 

    

  

 

 

 

 

actually anticipating the reverse. 

 

 

 

            

So, I mean -- so -- and so -- but I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court went through this.  They heard the Solicitor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General's argument at time, which was that this was all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the limits and binding holdings and what this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

said --

 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I don't understand. 

    

   

 

 

I mean, we can argue about whether these were holdings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and whether these were a dicta, and there are arguments 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

1 

on both sides of that. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

But here I am on Congress.  I mean, suppose 

    

   

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

you were an advisor to a congressman.  And the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

congressman said, okay.  I don't really like this idea 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

of going to the limits of Article III.  I think we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should limit it. 

 

 

            

You say, no worries.  Just use the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

language. 

9 

10 

11 

12 

            

And he says, use the same language?  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language has been consistently understood to go to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits of Article III. 

 

 

 

            

And you say, oh, no.  Don't worry.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

dicta. 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

And he says, okay.  I feel relieved.  We can 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

now use this language. 

 

 

 

              

I mean, wouldn't you be fired? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, Your -- Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think I'd be fired if I did what you said, which is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually follow what this Court's cases require, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, quote, "An express negation of the zone-of-interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test," not borrowing from some, you know, implicit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

doctrine. 

23 

24 

25 

            

Because at its high water mark, this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has said in Jama:  "The congressional ratification 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine is only a guide to word what Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

1 

implicitly thought." 

 

2 

            

And at least starting in 1983 in the Block 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

case -- and I think even going before that in the AGC 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, perhaps going even before that -- this Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, you need an express negation by Congress in order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to abrogate the zone-of-interest test. 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

 

And that is just not what happened here.  At 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

most, it was borrowing --

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Strange -- strange 

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

development, because the zone-of-interest test, at least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as it was announced in data processing, was understood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to expand standing over what it had been before.  So the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

zone-of-interest test was that, having in standing, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was facilitating the ability to bring lawsuits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, certainly.  But by the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

time of Block, which was a case about limiting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing -- and that was before 1988, so I think you've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got that problem. 

 

 

19 

            

You'd also be fired, Justice Kagan, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

another reason in your hypothetical, which is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congressional Report that you wrote, the House Report, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a staffer, says, you know, there's only two things 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you were trying to codify:  One was that testers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have standing under Havens, and the other is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative and judicial standing applies the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

1 

standard.  Those are the only two things in the House 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

Report --

 

3 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't read the -- the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

House Report that way.  The House Report does refer to a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of particular aspects of those cases.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

House Report seems to me to cut against you because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes clear that Congress knew about those cases.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those cases are, of course, the cases which said that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing stretches to the limits of Article III. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

And if you really look at the legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

history of this Act, it's pretty clear that when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress is acting in 1988, it took off the shelf a bill 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was discussed in 1980.  And in that bill, there was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a lot of discussion about whether standing should go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the limits of Article III.  And Congress was thinking of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changing that language. 

 

 

17 

            

And Drew Days, the Assistant Attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

General for Civil Rights, and the HUD Secretary, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both come in and they tell Congress, if you change that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language, it's a problem, because then you're cutting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

back on standing.  And Congress decided not to change 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that language because it wanted, as Drew Days said and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the HUD Secretary said, to go to the limits of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

Article III. 

 

25 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I'll answer that, and then I'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

1 

like to turn to proximate cause. 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

So, Justice Kagan, even if all of that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

true, I think this Court has insisted on an express 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negation for precisely this reason, so that you don't go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tap Drew Days and what -- have to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Katyal, this is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

an express -- an express limitation that means we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- we're doing away or we are keeping the zone of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest, because Lexmark itself was -- just establishes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that rule.  There was no explicit statement.  What the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court did was look at the statute, the endangered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

species statute, look at its words, and decide that "any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person" meant any person and decided it did away with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the zone of interests. 

 

 

 

15 

            

Here, we have a Congress in 1988 taking the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

word "aggrieved," which was in the -- in Title VII and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many other statutes but undefined.  And what it did was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take the definition looked at by prior regulations, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examined by this Court in its three cases establishing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III standing, and put in a definition of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"aggrieved" that is very different from the normal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

definition. 

23 

            

24 

            

25 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why is that --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  It is not very different.  It

is a "plain Jane," deterred definition of person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

aggrieved.  It doesn't look like what you're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about, the Endangered Species Act, which allows any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person to sue.  And it was their interpretation of if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's accepted, you'd be doing something, I think, for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first time in the Federal code.  There is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all-comers damages statute that allows anyone to sue the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way their interpretation would. 

 

 

 

            

Now, on proximate cause, our main point to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you is this:  This Court, in Lexmark, said there is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general rule -- and this is an independent argument from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

zone of interests -- there's a general rule that says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that liability is cut off after the first step. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you adopt this theory of the complaint, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're accepting sixth-step liability in a way that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has never done before.  At most, this Court, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lexmark, unanimously said you can expand it a little bit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond the first step for a kind of one-to-one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship.  But here, this Court -- or this complaint 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is seeking damages for the foreclosure crisis of 2008, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that is way, way beyond anything this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has insisted on. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  When you say that -- when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you said to me that the complaints that I wrote would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been covered by the Act, do you think it also would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

fall within proximate-cause principles? 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I -- I think that the -- the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

complaint would have to satisfy a directness 

   

 

 

 

 

requirement.  So to the extent that the City could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify segregation -- segregation harms directly, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way that maybe a university could when they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

become -- you know, when they lose diversity or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that.  To the extent there's some direct, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close, one-to-one relationship, absolutely, 100 percent, 

 

 

 

 

 

every day of the week. 

 

 

 

 

            

And, of course, Congress could write a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that enables something and abrogate the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional proximate-cause doctrine.  But here they 

  

 

 

 

 

haven't done any of that.  Here they have applied, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, a kind of plain Jane version of damages.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what they're seeking here with this creative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint -- which, you know, the Fair Housing Act has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been around since before I was born, and only until a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of years ago have we ever seen a complaint that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks anything like this. 

 

 

 

            

Here they're seeking to recover for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreclosure crisis of 2008.  That can't possibly satisfy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate-cause principles starting with Justice Holmes' 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion in Southern Pacific in 1918, going all the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the Holmes opinion of this Court just more recently. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

So you've got kind of Holmes and Holmes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But is one understanding --

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

like, I guess, when I started reading the briefs, I was 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

confused about this, because there's one understanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of proximate cause, which is that usually proximate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause is about foreseeability and only foreseeability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, there are definitely places where we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said there's this additional directness requirement, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only in pretty discrete areas.  And I guess I -- like I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of come back to this notion that I think what our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- our precedent suggests is it's a little bit statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by statute as to whether proximate cause is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreseeability inquiry and only that, or whether it has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

additional components. 

 

15

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I'll -- I'll answer that, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then if I could reserve the balance of my time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think this Court in Paroline said, quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"The proximate cause generally falls to the basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement, there must be a direct relationship between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the injury asserted and the injurious conduct." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So --

  

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I think Paroline and Lexmark 

    

 

 

 

 

both do that.  That is the general rule, not the outlier 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

rule. 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do we do with

all of the statements in Havens?  I'm quoting.  "There 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is little significance in the difference between direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and indirect injuries for purposes of filing suit under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FHA.  Trafficante.  While members of minority groups 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

were damaged the most from discrimination, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proponents of the legislation emphasize that those who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were not the direct objects of discrimination had an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in ensuring fair housing." 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

agree --

 

11 

            

12 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor, I absolutely 

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I mean --

   

  

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  -- with all of them.  Those are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

standard cases --

 

 

14 

            

15 

said --

 

16 

            

17 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- we have repeatedly 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the difference 

  

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

between direct and indirect, it has no meaning in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  The foreseeability always has meaning. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor, we've never 

  

 

 

 

 

said anything about proximate cause.  That all goes to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing.  That's a completely different inquiry. 

   

  

 

 

            

If I may reserve. 

   

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. PECK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

please the Court: 

 

 

5 

            

The City of Miami brought this -- these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

cases seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the banks' practice of providing minority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrowers with more expensive and riskier loans than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they qualified for, or that nonminority borrowers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received, actually frustrated and counteracted the 

 

 

 

 

 

City's efforts on fair housing, and -- and tended to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to cause the City to lose the benefits of social, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

professional, and business opportunities that come with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an integrated community free from housing 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

discrimination. 

16 

            

Now, you heard my friend describe these as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

two buckets, that if the complaint makes that out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly, then we do have standing that we fit within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

zone of interests.  We thought that the original 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint that we filed made this apparent.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eleventh Circuit agreed with us. 

 

 

 

 

            

But when the district court dismissed us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with prejudice on the original complaint, we made a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion for reconsideration to try to make more explicit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we thought was implicit in this complaint. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

1 

            

As a result, the Court did deny us the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

opportunity to do that.  But if you look at that amended 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint, it does talk about the fact that the City 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operates a Department of Community and Economic 

   

 

 

 

 

Development which takes complaints about fair housing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that tries to mediate it, that counsels, that educates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens about it, and is in charge of all these kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of efforts that we thought were part of our original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

complaint. 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

            

At the same time, we recognize that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury to the City is one that comes from the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to fall into the nondiscrimination principles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embodied in the Fair Housing Act.  And so those two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buckets do exist in this complaint.  And if they don't, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then they do exist if we had the opportunity to amend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the complaint and make it even more explicit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

And --

 

18 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm looking at the Joint 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

Appendix, page 186, your opening paragraph where you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, "BoA's conduct has harmed the residents of Miami 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and impaired the" -- "the City's strong, long-standing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and active commitment to open integrated residential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

housing patterns and its attendant benefits of creating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a stable community -- community." 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

And then you go on to the specific damages, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

1 

the loss of tax revenues, and increased expenses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

It's those types of allegations in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

amended complaint that you're pointing to? 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. PECK:  I -- I point to those.  I point 

    

    

   

 

 

 

5 

6 

to those on -- on 232 and 233, which describe the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operation of -- or our Department of Community and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

Economic Development. 

 

8 

            

9 

            

And so as a result --

   

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This pretty much tracks 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

Havens and Gladstone. 

 

 

            

MR. PECK:  It does, indeed, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

Sotomayor. 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

As so -- so a result, we think that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

regardless of whether you take the Article III approach 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to standing in this case, or take a more narrow 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formulation that depends on the fact that we -- our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggrievement is tied to violations of the Act, the City 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Miami has standing. 

 

 

 

            

And -- and the -- I don't understand either 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank in their briefs should disagree with us on that as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long as we make those pleadings.  And so it seems odd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we would be prevented from making those pleadings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as explicit as possible, certainly under Rule 15. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think you're a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

victim of discrimination?  Because it seems to me the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

1 

2 

damages that you seek are not going to be paid to those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who were the direct victims of the discrimination. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. PECK:  We are seeking -- we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

direct -- a direct victim.  This Court has repeatedly, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in all three cases dealing with standing under the Fair 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Housing Act, recognized that it's direct and indirect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages that are at issue; that plaintiffs who are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly harmed are also harmed.  And our -- we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suing for our own injuries.  We do not have parens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patriae status to sue for our residents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But your injuries 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

are derivative of the injury to the homeowners who had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the subprime mortgages and who suffered the foreclosure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so on.  You don't start with you.  I understand your 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that you're down the line, but I -- I don't see 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how you can say that your loss of property taxes is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

direct injury. 

 

18 

            

MR. PECK:  It is a -- what -- what we're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

saying is the injury here is the injury to our interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in an integrated community that has those business and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

social opportunities that this Court found cognizable in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- in Gladstone. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where -- where is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the limit to that?  I mean you asked for property taxes, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but presumably you suffer loss of sales taxes because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

the blight on the community.  It's less attractive to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tourists so you lose tourist revenues.  Why -- why would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- would you be able to recover loss in tourist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

revenues? 

5 

            

6 

            

7 

            

8 

            

MR. PECK:  We do not think we can. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And why is that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. PECK:  And that's --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I certainly can see 

    

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

the logic.  It's not as attractive a city, people are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to go somewhere else and so on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. PECK:  But cities are in a unique 

   

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

position.  This is their neighborhoods.  These are their 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

residents.  There are zoning laws.  The issues of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

property values and even property taxes are baked into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the home loans that are -- are made by the banks.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are part and parcel of the issue here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the fact is that the cities have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative obligation that require them to -- to look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out for fair housing.  Miami, among other cities, gets 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

block grants from the Department of Housing and Urban 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Development that require them to take affirmative --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So articulate in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

sentence what the difference is.  You don't get taxes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you would get from tourists visiting.  You do get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property taxes.  So what is it that cuts off the chain? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

1 

            

MR. PECK:  Well, we believe that because it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

has to be tied specifically to the property.  So we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could get property taxes, but --

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you -- how do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

you -- how are costs of increased services, whether it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police or whatever, how is that directly tied --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MR. PECK:  We're not claiming for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

increased services of police, but -- but our department 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that has to look for unsafe structures and -- and find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those structures because they've been abandoned after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreclosure, that our department that has to remediate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neighborhoods.  So this is the other end of having 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fought against afflictions to fair housing.  This is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other end when you try to remediate the neighborhoods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and make it whole again.  So those efforts are the ones 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we seek damages for, and those flow directly from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

it. 

18 

            

Let's note that, in Gladstone, this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

recognized that a city -- a municipality is directly 

   

   

 

 

 

 

injured in its property values and -- and the taxes that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are forgone that go to services, and so that's where we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see the direct connection. 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Katyal said that 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

Gladstone never got to proximate cause.  It just decided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there was standing. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

            

MR. PECK:  Justice Ginsburg, the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

Court did not describe proximate cause here, but it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard to read that sentence with anything but referring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to proximate cause.  It is a direct injury that flows 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the discriminatory conduct. 

 

 

 

            

Now, one thing that my friend also said was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we are seeking billions.  Now, in our complaint 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- we mention the fact that we had lost millions, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundreds of millions, not billions in property taxes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We note that before the City of Miami 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought its case, the cities of Memphis and Baltimore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both brought cases, and they ended up settling cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with identical types of allegations for less than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 million each.  So we are not talking about huge sums 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of money that --

 

 

 

16 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, presumably one 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

of the issues factored into the settlement was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that's presented today.  In other words, if --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you had prevailed they wouldn't have to give up a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage on the possibility that they might not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

stating a claim. 

   

22 

            

MR. PECK:  You know, it's possible.  At that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

point I don't believe anyone had raised proximate cause 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a separate issue, but the cities had survived 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple motions to dismiss that went to the zone of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

36 

1 

2 

3 

interest, so that is what caused other cities to see the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

survival of that and the settlement of those cases as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility to prove these cases. 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Peck, would you go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

back to the question the Chief started with, which is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how do you define the limits of your foresee --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreseeability tests?  Clearly less tourism.  Less sales 

  

  

 

 

 

 

tax.  Less of a lot of other things can be potentially 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreseeable, but you're suggesting they are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recoverable.  So is it because they are not foreseeable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or is it because they are not measurable? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. PECK:  I think they are difficult to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

measure.  And they -- they may be foreseeable, but I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that also there is the potential for superseding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

events that cut off the causal chain there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

            

But here when you --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want us to use the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

word, the phrase, the concept "proximate cause" in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining how far damages extend? 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. PECK:  You know, I -- I think it -- it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

provides some help, but not a great deal of help. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

23 

            

In Lexmark, for example --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so what -- where do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

I turn next? 

 

 

25 

            

MR. PECK:  Well, you know -- you know, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

37 

Lexmark the guidance that this Court gave was that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages incurred for the very conduct the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibits.  We think that what we've done is propose an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

approach --

 

5 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The statute doesn't 

  

 

 

 

6 

prohibit decreasing property tax values. 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MR. PECK:  But it does prohibit -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

prohibits discrimination in housing, and this is one of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the damages that we suffer that is directly from -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result of these kinds of home loans.  So therefore, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've -- we've tried to cabin our damages with respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to these specific properties and -- and we -- damages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they generate directly to the City. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

You know, all proximate cause requires is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

sufficient connection between the alleged misconduct and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the result, and it includes any injury the statute seeks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to protect against.  So here we have injuries that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute seeks to protect against.  My friend doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree that those injuries are protected by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, and, certainly, in Gladstone and Havens, those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injuries are the injuries that this -- this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

recognized. 

23 

24 

25 

            

So the question then becomes what's 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate damages?  We think we have proposed damages 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are tightly connected to the actual injury that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

City has suffered. 

 

 

2 

            

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do we have to go into that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

or not?  I'm not -- not saying we should or shouldn't, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I mean, do we have to to decide this case, decide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the damages, what damages are appropriate? 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. PECK:  You do not need to decide that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

In fact, one of the things that the Eleventh Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noted is that in the time between when the briefs were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

written and when we argued the case, this Court came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down with the decision in Inclusive Communities, and in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that decision, the Court's mentioned that there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate-cause pleading standard that needs to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated.  And the Eleventh Circuit said, we are not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to delve into what that exactly is and remand it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the district court for that decision.  And we think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that -- that can play out in -- in the further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation of this lawsuit. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if we include 

  

 

 

 

 

 

language along the lines that don't worry, it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be very much based on the experience in -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Baltimore and -- and Memphis? 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

(Laughter.) 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. PECK:  Well, I just think that the --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you know, the fact that our -- our opponents have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicated that we are talking about billions and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

1 

2 

billions of dollars and that this is about the 2008 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial crisis, which I also want to deny, needed a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

response. 

4 

            

And -- and -- and with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

financial crisis, if -- if the 2008 financial crisis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, indeed, the purpose of this lawsuit, then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations, which is two years, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have -- would have ended this lawsuit a long time ago. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

But instead what we found, and what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

Eleventh Circuit acknowledged, is that while the kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of loans -- the financial crisis was set off by subprime 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lending.  But the kinds of loans that are being offered 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here have taken different forms, but the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice remains the same, that minority borrowers are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting more expensive and riskier loans that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quicker to foreclosure, and -- and that foreclosure may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be as many, for some minorities, seven times as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frequently as the non-minority borrowers. 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there -- is there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

a difference?  I couldn't -- the -- the complaint was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not clear to me, anyway, between subprime loans and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

predatory loans. 

 

23 

            

MR. PECK:  You -- predatory loans are used 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

as sort of a generic term to talk about a taking 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

advantage of a borrower.  Subprime loans are -- are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

simply those loans that have interest rates that are so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

low that it looks like it's a wonderful deal until, of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, you look at some of -- some of the balloon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payments that are later --

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So are all -- all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

subprime loans properly categorized as predatory? 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MR. PECK:  I believe that the subprime loans 

    

 

 

 

 

 

8 

that -- that fueled the financial crisis are all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

considered predatory. 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

business that -- that is losing money, losing employees, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the neighborhood is deteriorating.  Do they have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- a stronger or a weaker claim than you do?  They 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have lost profits from their business because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neighborhood has been debilitated. 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. PECK:  I think they have a weaker claim. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

17 

We have a claim that's tied to the fact --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They are property owners. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. PECK:  They are property owners, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

they're also commercial property owners.  And -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's -- there is no -- no damage to their personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

property. 

23 

            

But -- but here what we are saying is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

if -- if I could step back for a moment.  The Endangered 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Species Act, this Court in Bennett v. Spears, recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

that Article III standing applies to the Endangered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Species Act, but you still have to make a claim that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on an interest in the preservation of animals. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You can't make a claim based on discrimination as --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that applies to housing discrimination or something like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  There is some generalized zone of interest that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ties the statute to the cause of action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

Here I say that the City has a special 

   

   

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

interest in fair housing and an integrated community 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the FHA is designed to vindicate.  The employer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not.  The local dry cleaner does not.  Now, they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have this unique relationship to the fact that this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their community, their neighborhoods, their residents, 

 

 

 

 

 

which they zone, and they decide how the property is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed to be used, and they provide services to every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of these residents, and so, therefore --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But wouldn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

business owner have an interest in running his business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in an integrated vibrant neighborhood just as the City 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have, I would say, a less direct interest in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

having that neighborhood preserved in the City? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. PECK:  You know, it may be so that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

particular business does have that interest.  But I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that it's very difficult to -- to claim the kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of damages that you've claimed. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

1 

            

Remember, one difference between the FHA 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

and -- and Title VII, for example, is that we recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirect harms.  We allow neighbors, testers, nonprofit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

organizations, and cities, and developers, and real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate brokers, all to sue to vindicate that interest. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

We don't allow the -- the equivalent of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

neighbor, a co-worker, to bring an action for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination that's been visited upon one of their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

colleagues.  We don't allow others within that kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

realm to bring these actions.  And I think that's part 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the problem that a business that makes this claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

might have. 

 

13 

            

So in the end, what I'm -- I'm suggesting is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

that there are direct injuries by virtue of these two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what -- what my friend describes as buckets.  A direct 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury to the City in its efforts to secure fair housing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by draining those resources, and those resources are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recoverable, and that that, indeed, satisfies any kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of proximate cause, as well as an injury to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in an integrated community that allows the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business opportunities, the social opportunities, the 

 

 

 

 

 

professional opportunities to flow that this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized in the Gladstone case and suggested that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate -- and even my friend in his brief suggested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appropriate damages in such an instance is the loss 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

1 

2 

of property value and property taxes, which, frankly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are part and parcel of this whole mortgage loan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

industry. 

4 

            

So we are not asking for something that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

different, that's out of the realm, that's away from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what this process is.  But something that's integral to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

that process. 

 

8 

            

So in the end what we suggest is the City of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

Miami is not so marginally involved in Fair Housing, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not working inconsistently, and its injuries are so fair 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

afield from it that we are outside the zone of interest, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever zone of interest applies, because, after all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not a very demanding test.  And there is a reason 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

for that, and that's because we are aggrieved in every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense of the word by the discrimination that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

propounded here. 

 

17 

            

And at the same time, we think that that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

statement from Lexmark that I quoted earlier -- that it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to essentially flow from the fact that there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some violation of the Act, is it sufficient too?  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each instance, we think our -- our injury is direct, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if it were to be examined more minutely, as my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend suggests, those minute steps are all true of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual borrower who has to take out a discriminatory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

loan, who has to then default, who has to then arrive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

in -- in foreclosure, who has to find that he has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abandon that house, and then he can bring that lawsuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still, because all those different steps are -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, the -- the -- the financial state of the economy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the nature of his job situation, his family 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation, all have effects on that.  But we recognize 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this is proximately caused -- his damages are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximately caused from the injury that the Fair Housing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

Act recognizes. 

 

10 

            

So for those reasons, I suggest that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

11 

Court ought to affirm the Eleventh Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Gannon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

               

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

17 

            

MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

please the Court: 

 

 

19 

            

In Gladstone, this Court concluded that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

municipality was injured if discriminatory housing 

 

 

 

 

 

practices caused a reduction in property values and, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, diminished its tax revenues.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

recodified that result with its 1988 amendments to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fair Housing Act, and the Court should hold that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same injury is still cognizable today, whether an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

Article III rationale or a broad zone-of-interest 

   

 

 

 

 

2 

rationale. 

3 

            

If I could turn to some of the points that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

have already come up today, my friend on the other side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says that you can't cut and paste injury from one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff to -- one victim of discrimination to another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's an argument that Gladstone specifically rejected. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

In Footnote 9 the Court said that what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

matters here, and this is what was -- this is what was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the breadth of the trilogy of Fair Housing Act cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Court decided between 1972 and 1982, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody has had their legal rights violated by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory housing practices.  It doesn't 

  

 

 

 

necessarily have to be the plaintiff's legal rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The plaintiff has to be injured by that violation, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't have to be their rights that are violated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's what we think is the -- is the work that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being done by the atypical definition of "aggrieved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person" that Congress put back into the statute --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's a very broad 

   

  

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

statement, Mr. Gannon.  What do you do, then, with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restaurant or the dry cleaner or the laundry or whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that wants to sue for somebody else's discrimination? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. GANNON:  Well, I agree with my friends 

   

  

 

 

 

 

25 

on both sides that that limit is going to come from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

proximate-cause analysis.  We don't disagree that there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is still a proximate-cause limitation implicit in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

statutes. 

4 

            

And here we think that although Gladstone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

didn't address proximate cause in those terms, it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important and significant that the Court there said that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the City is directly injured by the decrease in property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

values, and we think that the test -- the ultimate test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this Court stated in Lexmark -- of course, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has repeatedly recognized that proximate cause is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a statute-by-statute situational inquiry that depends 

 

 

 

 

 

upon the nature of the individual statutes, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate test is whether there is a sufficiently close 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection to the conduct that the statute prohibits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And what this statute prohibits is discriminatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

housing practices. 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You may not need to go into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, but how does proximate cause help you?  You could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a dry cleaner or you could have a magazine that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

writes about successes in integration and wants to write 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about this community before it got wrecked or whatever. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Clause could be absolutely clear. 

 

 

 

 

Absolutely clear.  15 Bishops testify was totally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

causal-related.  I mean, do they all have suits? 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GANNON:  Well, if not -- I -- I think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

1 

that what we are saying --

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They haven't even 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

argued that, and they didn't decide. 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. GANNON:  No.  And I -- I think -- I 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

think to the extent they can get themselves into the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the Home framework from Havens, then maybe they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could say that they have specific costs that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

associated with fighting discrimination. 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

            

But I wanted to say that what we have --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And you heard -- you heard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

what the question was -- the question before and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still is -- if we get into it -- we may not need to, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we did -- it would be somebody in Alaska who writes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

magazine articles about successes in integration is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be wrecked because they don't have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integration.  And it's a prime example, absolutely 

   

  

 

 

 

clear, of the causal connection.  Can he bring this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit?  I mean --

    

 

19 

            

MR. GANNON:  And I -- we -- we think -- no. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

We think that -- we think that that is further afield, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we think that --

 

 

 

 

22 

            

23 

afield --

 

24 

            

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You think it's further 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GANNON:  Yes.  And the --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- not because of causation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

1 

2 

though, because it's caused.  I made a hypothetical 

    

   

 

 

 

where we proved that it's caused. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. GANNON:  Yes, it's caused.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

proximate cause is always about determining that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that is caused is still too far away, either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in terms of foreseeability or distance or intervening 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause or something else, and so proximate cause by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition is carving out something that otherwise would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be caused by.  Otherwise, it wouldn't be doing anything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from traceability analysis under Article III. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

And here we think that the reason why this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

is sufficiently closely connected to the conduct that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute prohibits is that this statute prohibits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory housing practices, and those practices 

 

 

 

 

 

include things like the terms and conditions of the sale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of rental property; things about the real estate-related 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions; things like block busting, which was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically prohibited by 3604(e).  And block busting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was a practice by which somebody would go into a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neighborhood and induce artificially low-priced panic 

 

 

 

 

 

selling by saying there are minorities coming into this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neighborhood.  That conduct had an effect on property 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

prices. 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Gannon, how do --

  

 

 

 

 

 

how do we write it?  Let's take the corner grocer who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

had a running account with that home or the gardener who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every week cleaned the property.  I doubt someone who is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in foreclosure can afford a gardener, but let's assume 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that possibility.  Why -- how do we write that the City 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has standing and its injuries are proximately caused, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but those people don't? 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

8 

            

MR. GANNON:  I think --

    

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The company shareholder. 

  

 

 

 

9 

What's -- how do we say it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. GANNON:  The link that we see is -- is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

to property value, and that's the injury that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already recognized in Gladstone. 

 

 

 

13 

            

This is a question of congressional intent. 

   

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

When you're -- when you're construing proximate cause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're trying to figure out what Congress intended. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This Court had already recognized that a city was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly injured by decreased property value.  The same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing it said was true of the neighbors in Gladstone. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The neighbors that had their property values diminished 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were able to recover. 

 

 

 

              

I would say that the corner store, to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent that it has its property values diminished, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situated just like one of those neighbors.  To the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent that it's talking about something else like lost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits or the utility company is complaining they lost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

a customer, those things, we think, are further afield 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not so closely connected.  And proximate cause has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditionally done that type of --

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could you give us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

some more concrete answers?  The -- the utility company, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say it's further afield.  Is it covered or not? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MR. GANNON:  We think it's not covered.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

think that -- that -- that what this Court recognized in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gladstone is something that Congress was taking account 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of, and the property value -- the effect on property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

values is closely tied to discriminatory housing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practices.  Congress was entitled to think that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship would endure, and as in Lexmark, there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one-to-one relationship --

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How about real estate 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

brokers whose commission is based on the value of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

property? 

18 

            

MR. GANNON:  Yes.  Real estate brokers who 

  

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

are involved in the transaction, we discussed in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief that those are the type of people who have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in the transaction, even if it's just an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic interest, they're able to recover.  I don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

understand my friends on the other side to be disputing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, that -- that if they have a transaction that fails 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to go through because of this, because of racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

1 

discrimination, then they can sue. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

And we think it is important for the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

to remind -- remember that you don't just to have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

have --

 

5 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What if they wrote it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

generally?  They said this -- this is now a poor 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

community.  Our commissions are going to be lower across 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

the board. 

 

9 

            

10 

            

MR. GANNON:  I -- I think that --

    

   

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They are -- they're 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

somehow different from the corner grocery store?  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't get it. 

 

 

13 

            

MR. GANNON:  No.  I think if -- if they were 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

just generically saying business is done --

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That is my hypothetical. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GANNON:  That might be harder for them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

to establish the types of cases that -- that we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previously seen are where developers, brokers, real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estate -- real estate agents have -- have talked about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific transactions that they can say were caused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by -- by discriminatory housing practices.  And it -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do think it is important for the Court to recall that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those cases involve plaintiffs who don't necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a, quote/unquote, "desegregation interest," as 

 

 

 

 

 

my -- as my friend on the other side puts it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

52 

1 

            

It -- it is enough that they are injured in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

their economic interests, and as the Court pointed out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Inclusive Communities, a real estate developer is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

often a good plaintiff to challenge a local 

   

   

 

 

 

discriminatory housing practice.  We don't require that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they add on that they are -- they are something like the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonprofit in Havens where, in addition to wanting to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make money off of developing their property, they also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an interest in desegregation.  And similarly --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

12 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your answer --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Perhaps -- please. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Your answer, I think, to 

   

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the question is that it's limited to those cognizable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suits contemplated by the statute, and you see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplated by the statute as having to do with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possession or value of the property? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GANNON:  We think that the -- the harms 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that flow directly from changes in property value were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ones that Congress contemplated, both in 1968, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly in 1988, after this Court had already -- had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already enumerated that as a particular type of harm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was at issue here. 

 

 

 

 

            

And we don't think that the City should have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to establish that there's been a change in racial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

composition of the neighborhood in order to bring a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

53 

suit, because the Fair Housing Act is intended to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cover -- is intended to prohibit discriminatory housing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practices throughout the United States, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes segregated communities that aren't changing if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is discrimination. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the City can sue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on isolated instances of discrimination? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GANNON:  To the extent --

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought that the 

    

 

 

 

 

basic pitch of the -- of your position is that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affects the community as a whole, and the City has an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in ensuring the stability of the communities, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not that the City could enforce particular instances of

5

7

housing discrimination. 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

MR. GANNON:  I -- I think it's both.  I 

    

   

  

 

 

 

think that they do have the community representing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest, and -- but I also think that, to the extent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they can say we suffer a harm from this particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction -- let's assume it's just one particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apartment complex or something.  If --

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could be one -- one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

particular home? 

 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. GANNON:  Yeah.  I suspect that that's 

    

  

 

 

 

one where there wouldn't be that much in it to have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

City bring that suit instead of the individual loan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

owner, but --

 

 

2 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know if 

    

 

 

 

 

3 

there's that much in it.  Can the City bring that action 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

or not? 

 

5 

            

MR. GANNON:  Yes.  It -- to the extent that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

they can say there is a one-to-one relationship, they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

are just like the microchip manufacturer in Lexmark. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whenever there is a decline in property value on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the -- the primary victim, or the homeowner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, they suffer a corresponding decline in their tax 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

revenue. 

12 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the City can

14 

bring an action of the sort we're talking about here in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case of one subprime mortgage that results in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

foreclosure? 

16 

            

MR. GANNON:  If they can say that that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

that's -- that that was caused by discriminatory housing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

practices --

 

19 

            

20 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes. 

  

 

 

MR. GANNON:  -- and that it injured them? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

Yes.  That's just like the -- the residents in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Trafficante or the City in Gladstone.  They are able to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, we are injured by this. 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Katyal, you have four minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Four points, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

First, with respect to this complaint, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

paragraph 186 and so on, we agree.  Our blue brief at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 33 says that they do identify an interest, but they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to plausibly allege some impact on segregation in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order to survive.  They haven't done that.  They haven't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

told you whether segregation is increasing or decreasing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of the bank's conduct. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Second, the damages here they seek are way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way broader than what they're painted out to be.  Just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the taxes and the complaint are bad enough.  Indeed, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bank of America petition -- cert petition at page 34 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cites one of the complaints filed by the same counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against Cobb County, seeking hundreds of millions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

dollars. 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

There are 19,300 cities in America.  If you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt their theory, you would be allowing all of them to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring complaints just like this. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, we've said that if you accept their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, you'd be opening the door.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor General says, huh-uh; proximate cause is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow a limitation on that. 

   

 

 

            

Their own proximate-cause tests, as our 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

56 

brief explains, eliminates the directness requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

So I think it will be hard, and that's why I don't think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he had an answer, Justice Breyer, on the magazine, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things like that. 

 

 

            

And then, Justice Sotomayor, you asked him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how to write the opinion to avoid the gardener, and his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer was, look at Gladstone, because Gladstone has a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct reduction in property values.  That cannot be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent theory for this Court on proximate-cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles for many reasons, one of which Gladstone is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a proximate-cause case at all.  It's not briefed or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

argued. 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

But second, even the language he's reading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to you is only at the very end of Gladstone, saying that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you have a reduction in property value, then it will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly reduce the tax base. 

 

 

 

 

            

This complaint's totally different.  You've 

  

 

 

 

got five steps, as the Solicitor General's own brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explains, before you even get to the reduction in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property value.  Each of those are opportunities for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

intervening causes, and all the kinds of things that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court in Lexmark said are the reasons why we cut 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

off liability at the first step. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, his other answer was to say, well, look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the Congressional Report.  The Congressional Report 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

57 

1 

2 

identifies that Congress was concerned with property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

values, and therefore concerned with cities. 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

 

That Congressional Report also says Congress 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

was equally concerned with employers who suffered from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segregated neighborhoods, employees who were fired 

 

 

 

 

 

because the neighborhoods suffered from blight, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shops and other things. 

 

 

 

            

So if you take their standard, which is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at the Congressional Report, figure out who's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmed by housing discrimination, even downstream, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would come to the same conclusion we do, which is this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is an unlimited theory of liability.  It would allow 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landlords to sue, utilities companies to sue, and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor, gardeners to sue. 

 

 

 

 

            

We've also said one other thing, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan.  This gets to your point earlier about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional scheme.  If you adopt on zone of interest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their interpretation of "aggrieved persons," 3612 allows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"aggrieved persons" to intervene as a matter of right in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

Federal litigation. 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Our view is what Congress did was it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

empowered direct victims to sue, as well as some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirect victims, in the Justice Department.  Their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation says, any city, including one that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even motivated by the same type of, you know, presumably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

58 

wonderful motivations as the City of Miami, can come in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and intervene in a direct victims lawsuit and possibly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

muck it up in any number of directions.  That can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibly be what Congress thought about when they have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used the words "person aggrieved" in the statute, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow cities to come in and interfere with -- with a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of lawsuits filed by direct victims.

that Congress didn't know that in 1988, when we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already let a village come in, in a municipality. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  But, Justice Sotomayor, our 

  

 

 

 

 

position on this -- and this is very important -- we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not quibbling with that.  Gladstone is absolutely 100 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent good law.  We're not seeking to change it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're the ones that are seeking to expand it in two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directions, both by taking it out of segregation and by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expanding proximate cause to the sky. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
