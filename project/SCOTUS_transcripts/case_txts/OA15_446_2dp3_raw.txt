CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  15­446,  Cuozzo  Speed  Technologies  v.  Lee. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Beeney. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  GARRARD  R.  BEENEY 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  begin  this  morning  with  why  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  of  the  broadest­reasonable­interpretation  expedient 

 

 

 

 

in  no  way  comports  with  the  congressional  purpose  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inter  partes  review,  and  then  address  why  the  Board's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultra  vires  determination  in  instituting  inter  partes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review  is  subject  to  judicial  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Consistent  with  history,  Congress  left  to 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judiciary  to  determine  construction  standards,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  in  the  American  Invents  Act,  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicit  statutory  language  directing  the  Patent  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Trademark  Office  to  use  any  particular  standard  of  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction. 

            

But  this  Court  should  reverse,  as  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  statutory  construction,  for  four  reasons.  First,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

summary,  all  agree  that  the 

 

 

 

 

broadest­reasonable­interpretation  expedient  demands  a

broad  ability  to  amend  claims,  and  that's  so  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadest  reasonable  interpretation  brings  into  play  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broader  array  of  prior  art  that  may  be  distinguishable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  claims  were  given  their  actual  interpretation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  establishing  inter  partes  review, 

 

 

 

 

Congress  sought  to  substitute  and  provide  a  district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

court­like  litigation  for  the  determination  of 

 

 

 

 

 

patentability,  and  therefore,  did  not  provide  the  wide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liberty  to  amend  claims,  as  Justice  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  might  be  moved  by  your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

argument  if  Congress  had  not  given  any  right  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board  to  amend,  because  that  would  be  consistent  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practices  in  the  district  court,  where  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  amend  under  any  circumstance.  But  basically, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  here  said  you  can  amend  once.  I'm  not  sure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  supports  your  proposition. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  I  think  ­­ Justice  Sotomayor,  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  is  a  distinction  between  allowing  a  party  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

make  a  motion  to  amend  and  the  absolute  right  to  amend 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  once.  And  Congress  did  not  provide  any  right  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amend  in  inter  partes  review.  It  provided  only  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extremely  limited  ability  to  seek  to  amend.  And,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  in  practice,  that  opportunity  to  seek  to  amend  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost  always  denied.  And  it  is  denied  consistent  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  intent  of  establishing  inter  partes  review

to  be  court  ­­ a  court­like  adjudication.  So  simply  as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  matter  of  numbers,  the  Board  has  denied  95  percent  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  motions  to  amend.  In  42  months  of  inter  partes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review,  the  Board  has  allowed  five  motions  to  amend  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  four  ­­ less  than  30  claims  to  be  amended,  while 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

canceling  10,000  claims. 

 

 

            

your  four? 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What's  the  second  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  BEENEY:  The  second  reason  why, 

  

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  the  ­­ the  result  below  should  be  reversed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  because  the  ­­ Congress,  in  establishing  inter  partes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review,  intended  inter  partes  review  to  adjudicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  rights.  And  in  doing  so,  it  makes  no  sense  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attribute  to  those  property  rights  a  hypothetical 

   

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  their  meets  and  bounds  rather  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  what  district  courts  do,  which  is  to  give  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  actual  plain  and  ordinary  meaning. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  third  reason,  Your  Honors,  why  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  should  reverse  and  ­­ and  have  the  Patent  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Trademark  Office  use  the  ordinary  claim  construction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  is  because  there  are  a  number  of  anomalies  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injure  the  patent  system  and  injure  patentees  that  stem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  from  the  use  of  inter  partes  review.  Those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  a  claim  meaning  different  things  in  the  courts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  before  the  Board.  Those  include  different  results

in  the  courts  and  the  Board  as  to  whether  a  patentee's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  rights  are  taken  away.  And  those  include 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  meaning  one  thing  for  patentability  in  the  Board 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  a  wholly  different  thing  for  infringement  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  courts.  That's  simply  untenable,  and  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

no  reason  to  suspect  that  that  was  anywhere  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  intent  in  enacting  inter  partes  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Finally,  this  Court  should  reverse  because 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  really  has  not  in  any  way  offered  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support  of  using  the  broadest  reasonable  interpretation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  in  any  way  tethered  to  inter  partes  review.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  says  historically,  we've  done  this  before,  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  should  be  permitted  to  do  it  again. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Strikingly  missing  from  the  government's 

 

 

 

 

position,  however,  is  really  any  objection  to  taking  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court's  substitute  that  Congress  enacted,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  the  claim  construction  that  the  district  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do,  the  ordinary  meaning  of  the  claim  terms. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  nothing  really  in  the  government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  that  suggests  that  it  would  be  inappropriate  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  that  claim  construction,  and  that's  the  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction  that  should  be  used. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Is  the  standard  ­­ is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  of  proof  for  invalidity  the  same  in  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement  action  in  district  court  as  it  is  in  inter

partes  review? 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  It  is  not,  Justice  Alito.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  the  reason  ­­ there  was  a  sensible  reason  behind 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  in  that  Congress  tweaked  the  court­like  adjudicatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  and  recognized  that  it  was  establishing  a  board 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  experts,  and  therefore,  there  was  no  reason  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  presumption  in  favor  of  patentability  that  we  find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  district  courts. 

 

 

 

            

But  that  in  no  way  suggests  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress,  in  enacting  inter  partes  review,  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting  that  there  be  a  different  claim­construction 

   

 

 

 

 

standard  that  are  used  in  the  district  courts  when  inter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partes  review  was  to  be  a  substitute  for  district  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation. 

            

If  I  may  Your  Honors,  I'd  like  to  delve  into 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  that  Justice  Sotomayor  asked  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendment  process. 

 

              

I  think  it's  important  to  recognize,  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patent  and  Trademark  Office  repeatedly  has  before  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits  brief  in  this  case,  the  profound  distinction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  the  ­­ permitting  a  party  to  make  a  motion  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

amend  in  an  adjudicatory  context  and  the  absolute  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  amend  in  the  examinational  contest  ­­ context.  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact,  the  PTO,  as  it  participated  in  the  Microsoft  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Proxyconn  case,  submitted  a  letter  to  the  Federal

Circuit  making  exactly  this  point  on  April  27,  2015. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  the  PTO  said  to  the  court  was  that,  in  fact,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  this  very  profound  distinction  between  the  right  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  a  motion  to  amend  in  an  adjudicatory  context  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ability  to  amend  patents  in  the  examinational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  where  there  is  an  iterative,  back­and­forth, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally  cooperative  process  between  the  examiner  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  patentee. 

 

            

That  is  diametrically  different  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

system  that  Congress  established  in  inter  partes  review, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  represented  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court. 

 

            

And  going  back  to  the  statistics  that  I  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

citing  in  response  to  Justice  Sotomayor's  original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  95  percent  of  the  motions  to  amend  in  inter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partes  review  are  denied.  Less  than  30  claims  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amended,  while  10,000  have  been  canceled.  And  there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  not  the  kind  of  ability  that  is  necessary  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  to  avoid  the  prejudice  to  the  patentee  of  giving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her  claims  a  construction  broader  than  what  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

actually  are  that's  afforded  in  inter  partes  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Do  the  Board's  institution 

  

 

 

 

 

decisions  always  set  out  what  it  understands  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadest  reasonable  interpretation  to  be?  And  ­­ and  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  do,  is  it  ­­ must  the  Board  stick  with  that

throughout  the  proceeding?  And  in  that  ­­ if  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true,  why  does  the  patentholder  need  more  than  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity  to  amend? 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  The  ­­ IPR  proceeds  in  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  stages,  as  ­­ as  your  question  implicates, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito.  First,  there  is  the  institution 

  

 

 

 

 

 

decision.  In  there,  the  Board  typically  does  set  forth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  preliminary­claim­interpretation  standard.  But  for 

  

 

 

 

the  government  to  take  the  position  that  that's  the  end 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  ballgame  is  wholly  inconsistent  with  its  position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  second  question  presented  about  appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Obviously,  the  claim­construction  interpretation  is 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  appeal,  and  so  it  can't  be  fixed  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institution  determination. 

 

            

The  final  claim­construction  standard  that 

 

 

 

 

the  Board  applies  to  make  the  ultimate  decision  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  patent  is  going  to  survive  is  in  the  final 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  that  the  Board  renders.  At  that  point  in  time, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  too  late  for  the  patentee  to  make  any  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  as  to  whether  it  would  like  to  amend  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cancel  the  claims  that  are  under  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  also  think  it's  important  to  distinguish 

 

 

 

 

 

the  examinational  context,  in  which,  historically,  BRI 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  cabin  to.  Historically,  in  fact,  what's  used 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  court­like  litigation  structure  that  Congress

But  ­­ but  in  addition  to  the  fact  that  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  How  does  this  work?  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

mean,  suppose  you're  right  and  it  should  be  ordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning.  That  doesn't  determine  who's  going  to  win  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lose  this  case,  does  it? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  What  would  happen,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  Court  agrees  with  us  that  the  Board  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  the  ordinary­meaning  test,  is  that  the  case  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  remanded  to  the  Board  to  give  Cuozzo's  claims  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  construction.  That's  never  happened  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding.  That  would  be  the  result  of  Your  Honors 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreeing  with  us. 

 

 

            

And  we  believe  that  once  we  go  back  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board  and  the  Board  applies  the  appropriate  construction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  our  claims,  our  claims  will  survive  review  or  ­­ or, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  ­­ at  a  minimum,  we  will  be  permitted  to  amend, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  basis  of  the  decision  by  the  Board  to  deny 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cuozzo  the  opportunity  to  amend  was  that  the  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction  read  out  of  the  construction  of  the  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  embodiment  that's  set  forth  in  the  specification. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under  the  ordinary­meaning  standard  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Board  should  be  applying  in  this  adjudicatory  context

that  Congress  set  up  to  litigate  over  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  rights,  the  Board  would  be  applying  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary­construction  standard  which  we  believe  would 

 

 

 

 

 

include  the  embodiment  that's  in  this  specification, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and,  therefore,  we  would  receive  relief. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  if  ­­ if  the  ­­ if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  patent  is  invalid  under  its  broadest,  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation,  doesn't  ­­ doesn't  that  mean  the  PTO 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  never  have  issued  the  patent  in  the  first  place, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  doesn't  that  give  very  significant  meaning  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structure  to  this  process? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  Not  necessarily,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

Kennedy.  And  ­­ and  the  reason  is  this:  The  purpose  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  broadest  reasonable  interpretation  expedient,  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  agrees  it  is,  it  is  not  a  claim­construction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  as  the  Federal  circuit  said  in  Skvorecz. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  it  does  is  try  to  test  for  ambiguity  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  claim  language,  not  patentability.  Patentability  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  standard  that  Congress  set  in  inter  partes  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  what  the  broadest  reasonable  interpretation  does  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  test  for  ambiguity  in  the  patent  language  so  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  amended.  So  the  fact  that  a  patented  invention 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  an  application  may  not  pass  the  broadest  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expedient  does  not  mean  that  the  inventor  has  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claimed  a  patentable  invention.  It  simply  means  that

the  language  is  ambiguous,  and  the  language  needs  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refined.  And  that  is  a  wholly  different  exercise. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  I  ­­ I  guess  I 

   

   

  

 

 

was  ­­ was  thinking  of  the  mind­set  that  ­­ that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process,  the  structure,  that  the  PTO  uses  in  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place.  It  looks  at  a  claim.  If  ­­ if  I  were  the 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

examiner  to  determine  whether  or  not  I  should  grant  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent,  I'd  say,  I'm  going  to  give  this  the  broadest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  to  make  sure  I'm  right.  It  seems  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  ­­ or  am  I  wrong,  that  that's  not  what  they  do? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  They  do,  but  not  to  determine 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  claims  are  patentable.  They  do  to  determine 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  there's  ambiguity  in  the  language. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  Your  Honor,  you  can  go  back  to  a  whole 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  of  district  court  cases  from  ­­ all  the  way  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carr  in,  I  think,  1924  in  ­­ in  the  D.C.  circuit  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2016  decision  in  PCC  Broadband,  and  all  the  cases  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between,  Skvorecz  and  ­­ and  In  re  Hyatt  and  all  the

whether  claim  language  has  ambiguity  in  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  it  does,  then  the  patent  owner  can  amend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  does  so  as  of  right  in  examinational  context,

broadly  be  construed  to  mean. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  the  question  that 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy  asked,  and  I  think  it's  an  important 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

one,  to  me,  anyway,  was,  if  you  ­­ forget  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding.  If,  in  fact,  in  the  broadest  possible,  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever,  reasonable  interpretation  and  you  were  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

front  of  the  Patent  Office,  and  that's  what  they  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at,  and  if  it  was  too  broad  because  that  broad,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  it  has  flaws  in  it  of  whatever  kind,  the  patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  issue.  Is  that  right  or  not  right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BEENEY:  It's  not  a  question  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It's  either  right  or  wrong. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

You  can  tell  me  I'm  right,  or  you  can  tell  me  I'm  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  There  isn't  an  iterative

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  know  that. 

    

 

 

MR.  BEENEY:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  know  that.  I'm  saying: 

    

  

 

 

 

If  at  the  end  of  the  day,  on  the  broadest  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation,  it  is  not  patentable,  there  is  no  patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued. 

            

            

            

MR.  BEENEY:  That's  correct.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ if  that's  so,  you  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  this  new  law  as  ­­ as  ­­ as  you  were  looking  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  as  trying  to  build  a  little  court  proceeding.  If  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  it  was  just  doing  that,  I  would  say  you  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right. 

            

But  there  is  another  way  to  look  at  it.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  way  to  look  at  it  ­­ and  that's  what  I  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  your  comment  about  ­­ is  that  there  are  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things,  for  better  words,  let's  call  them  patent  trolls, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  the  ­­ the  Patent  Office  has  been  issuing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

billions  of  patents  that  shouldn't  have  been  issued  ­­ I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overstate  ­­ but  only  some.  And  what  happens  is  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  in  business  gets  this  piece  of  paper  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks  at  it  and  says,  oh,  my  God,  I  can't  go  ahead  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  invention. 

 

            

And  so  what  we're  trying  to  do  with  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  is  to  tell  the  office,  you've  been  doing  too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  too  fast.  Go  back  and  let  people  who  are  hurt  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  come  in  and  get  rid  of  those  patents  that  shouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  issued.  Now,  we  will  give  you,  again,  once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  chance  we  gave  you  before,  and  that  is  you  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amend  it  once  if  you  convince  the  judge  you  should  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  it  before.  But  if,  on  the  broadest  possible 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation,  you  know,  reasonable  interpretation,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  have  been  issued,  we're  canceling  it.  And  ­­

and  that  is  for  the  benefit  of  those  people  who  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffering  from  too  many  patents  that  shouldn't  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued  in  the  first  place.  I  don't  know. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  it's  that  second  purpose,  then  I  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

think,  well,  maybe  this  is  right,  what  they're  doing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  it's  ambiguous  between  those  two  purposes,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  begin  to  think,  well,  maybe  they  should  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  themselves  under  Chevron,  Meade,  or  whatever,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  which  to  do. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  ­­ that's  the  argument,  I  think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that's  in  my  mind  registering  the  other  way.  So  what  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  say? 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  Justice  Breyer,  if  I  agreed  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

and  respectfully,  I'd  like  to  explain  why  I  disagree. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Uh­huh. 

  

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  But  ­­ but  even  if  I  did  agree, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  would  say  that  Congress,  in  fact,  established 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  what  Your  Honor  described.  But  it  established  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  in  which  we  are  adjudicating  property  rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  it  makes  no  more  sense  to  adjudicate  those  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  in  a  court­like  setting  by  pretending  that  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  are  not  what,  in  fact,  was  granted,  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentee  claims,  or  what  the  patentee  could  assert  in

someone's  property  encroaches  on  another,  which  ­­ which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  would  submit  is  really  an  apt  analogy  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviousness­anticipation  tests.  We  look  at  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

boundaries  ­­ the  metes  and  bounds  of  that  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  is. 

 

            

So  Congress,  assuming  that  it  did  what  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor  suggested,  established  a  system  to  do  that,  but  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  a  system  to  adjudicate  in  a  court­like 

   

   

 

 

 

setting  the  actual  patent  rights  that  a  patentee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

obtains,  not  ones  that  someone  suggests  might  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broader.  That  is  to  determine  ambiguity  in  claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language,  not  to  adjudicate  rights. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  If  language 

  

  

 

 

 

is  ambiguous,  it  can't  have  that  plain  meaning,  can  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  I'm  sorry? 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  would  you  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

plain  meaning  that  a  district  court  would  apply  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  is  ambiguous?  How  could  it  say  that  you  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid  property  right  in  something  that's  ambiguous? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  The  test  of  the  ordinary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

meaning,  as  enunciated  by  Philips  and  its  progeny,  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  look  at  the  claim  language.  If  there's  ambiguity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  claim  language,  then  what  is  the  meaning  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent  will  be  determined  in  light  of  the  specification, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prosecution  history,  and  other  intrinsic  evidence.

In  the  rare  case  where  there  still  may  be 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity,  then  the  Court  may  consider  extrinsic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  dictionaries,  other  writings  by  the  patentee, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  somebody  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  a  particular  claim  limitation  to  mean. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

So  there  are  a  number  of  tools  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary­meaning­construction  standard  that  should  be 

 

 

 

 

used  here  to  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Aren't  those  tools  used 

  

 

 

 

 

in  determining  the  broadest  ­­ the  broadest  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading,  meaning  how  can  the  PTO  decide  what  a  broad 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  reading  is  unless  it  looks  at  all  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors  and  decides  that  the  specifications  and  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  things  don't  cure,  continue  to  provide  ambiguity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  patent? 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  It  ­­ it  does  not.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

broadest  reasonable  interpretation  is  considerably 

 

 

 

 

different  than  the  ordinary  meaning  of  construction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  and  the  fact  that  the  Patent  and  Trademark 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Office  has  admitted  as  much.  In  the  manual  for  patent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examination  procedures,  the  Patent  and  Trademark  Office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells  its  patent  examiners,  we,  quote,  "do  not  interpret 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  in  the  same  manners  as  the  courts." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Just  recently,  a  very  important  tool  that 

   

 

 

 

 

courts  look  at  in  the  ordinary­meaning  context,  the

parties. 

            

 

 

There  are  very  different  sub  tools,  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

will,  within  broadest  reasonable  interpretation  and 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  meaning,  and  that's  because  they  intend  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accomplish  different  purposes.  One  adjudicates 

  

 

 

 

patentability,  which  is  what  Congress  intended  in  IPR. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  other  identifies  ambiguity  in  claim  language.

looks  at  the  manual  in  Section  2111,  the  PTO  tells  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examiners  that  one  of  the  reasons  we  use  the  broadest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  interpretation  is  because,  unlike  the  courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  don't  have  before  us  a  fully­developed  prosecution 

   

 

 

 

 

 

history.  Well,  when  you're  in  inter  partes  review,  you

patent,  you're  infringing  it,  and  the  infringer  goes  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  Board  and  says  I  want  you  to  determine  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

validity  of  the  patent,  and  the  district  court  is  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  thing,  or  at  least  determining  the  scope  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent  and  whether  or  not  it  infringes? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  What  typically  happens,  Mr. 

  

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice,  is  in  those  situations  where  a  patent  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  subjected  to  inter  partes  review,  and  I  file  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement  case,  is  that  the  defendant  may  then  seek 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  file  a  petition  before  the  Board  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR.  BEENEY:  ­­ seeking  review  of  the  patent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  CICA  stay  in  the  district  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  fact,  in  this  rather  substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transfer  of  the  adjudicatory  function  from  the  judiciary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  administrative  agency,  we  find  that  about  85 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  of  patents  that  are  being  adjudicated  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board  are  subject  to  district  court  litigation.  And  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  85  percent  of  the  time,  district  courts  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entering  stays  70  percent  of  the  time.  So  in  fact,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  happening  is  the  judiciary  is  deferring  to  the  Board 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  making  decisions  about  the  patentability  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  that  are  at  issue.

a  little  burdensome  to  the  district  court.  They  sort  of

whatever  the  Board  says  is  the  proper  ­­ whether  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid  or  not. 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  Well,  that,  in  fact,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happens  is  that  should  a  claim  survive  inter  partes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

review,  then  there  are  various  estoppel  provisions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  enacted  in  the  America  Invents  Act  that  prevent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  relitigation  of  the  identical  prior  art  that  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  adjudicated  by  the  Board  in  IPR. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  district  courts  don't  need  to  revisit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  happened  in  inter  partes  review,  which  is  yet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  example  of  why  Congress  intended  inter  partes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review  to  be  a  substitute  for  district  court  litigation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  in  the  district

MR.  BEENEY:  In  ­­ in  inter  partes  review 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  presumption  of  validity.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That  ­­ that  shows  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

difference  in  these  proceedings. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  There  no  doubt  is  a  difference 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in  the  proceeding.  But  the  fact  that  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  the  expertise  of  this  newly  created  Board 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  establishing,  and  thereby  removed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  because  of  the  expertise,  in  no  way  suggests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  in  adjudicating  patentability,  the  Board  in  IPR 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  dispensing  with  all  the  guidance  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  ­­ has  provided,  and  all  the  guidance  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  courts  have  provided,  in  giving  patent  rights  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicating  whether  they  are  patentable,  their  ordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning. 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Are  ­­ please. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  BEENEY:  No.  I  was  just  going  to  say, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan,  it  just  doesn't  simply  flow. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Is  ­­ is  your  argument,  Mr. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Beeney,  that  Congress  couldn't  have  thought  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else  except  that  the  ordinary­meaning  standard  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control?  Because  if  I  look  at  the  statute,  I  mean,  it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  doesn't  say  one  way  or  the  other.  So  we're  a

MR.  BEENEY:  I  think  not,  Justice  Kagan. 

    

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  your  ­­ your  first  sentence  is  perhaps 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  only  at  the  margin  in  exaggeration  of  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position,  and  ­­ and  it  is  because  of  this:  Take  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor  that  ­­ that  Congress  enacted  in  IPR,  a  12­month 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period  from  which  the  time  the  Board  must  reach  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  decision  absent  good  cause.  Contrast  that  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  examination  proceedings.  The  examinational  context 

  

 

 

 

 

and  the  reexaminational  context  take  two  to  three  years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why  do  they  take  two  or  three  years?  They  take  two  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  years  because  this  is  iterative,  back  and  forth, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  for  prior  art,  discussing  with  the  patentee  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  she  invent,  asking  her  to  amend  her  claims  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  deemed  to  be  ambiguous  or  too  broad.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  happen  in  ­­ in  inter  partes  review.  It  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen  because  of  the  time  frame  that  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislated. 

            

            

There  are  other  reasons  why  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  mean,  I  guess  if  I'm 

    

   

 

 

 

trying  to  put  myself  in  Congress's  position,  I'm  ­­ I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  the  PTO,  and  it  does  pretty  much  everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  this  broadest­construction  standard.  And  if  I  had 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  clear  intent  that  you're  suggesting,  given  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backdrop  of  how  the  PTO  generally  operates,  wouldn't  I

MR.  BEENEY:  I  think  not,  Justice  Kagan,  for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the  historical  reason  that  Congress  has  never  addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim­construction  issues.  It's  always  been  a  matter 

   

  

 

 

 

left  to  the  judiciary,  number  one. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  number  two,  the  process  that  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted  in  IPR  is  a  brand  new  adjudicatory  proceeding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlike  the  PTO  has  ever  confronted  in  the  past.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing  that  one  in  inter  partes  review  should  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadest  reasonable  interpretation  is  ­­ is  really  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quintessential  example  of  trying  to  pound  a  square  peg 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  a  round  hole  simply  because  that  peg  used  to  fit  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  different  hole. 

 

 

            

Congress  established  a  very  different 

   

 

 

proceeding  in  inter  partes  review.  It  is  court­like;  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  done  under  very  similar  circumstances  to  the  way  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  proceeds  in  a  district  court;  it  adjudicates  actual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  rights  and  takes  those  property  rights  away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  for  all  those  reasons,  if  I  may  say,  the  statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically  reeks  that  the  ordinary­meaning­construction 

 

 

 

 

standard  used  by  the  district  courts  should  be  used. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Kind  of  a  hybrid.  It  has 

   

  

  

 

 

 

­­ in  certain  respects  it  resembles  administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings  and  other  district  court  proceedings.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­ there  is  a  right  to  amend,  or  an  opportunity, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  opportunity  to  amend  before  the  agency;  there  isn't

in  court.  There  are  discovery  differences;  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  differences.  So  it's  a  ­­ it's  a  little  of  one 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  a  little  of  the  other,  this  inter  partes  review. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  I  think,  Justice  Ginsburg, 

    

 

 

 

there  are  differences,  but  none  of  them  go  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental  fact  of  the  claim­construction  standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

The  system  that  Congress  established  is  consistent  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  ordinary  meaning. 

 

 

            

And  if  you  look  again  at  this  ability  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amend,  in  fact,  in  ­­ in  examinational  proceedings, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent  applications  are  almost  always  amended.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reexamination  they're  amended  66  percent  of  the  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  inter  partes  review,  they're  amended  less  than  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  of  one  percent  of  the  time,  and  that  is  why  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim­construction  standard  should  be  the  ordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning. 

            

If  I  may,  Your  Honors,  I'd  like  to  just  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefly  turn  to  the  issue  of  appellate  review  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board's  institution  decision  when  the  Board  exceeds  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  authority. 

 

            

Just  a  ­­ very  briefly,  our  position  is  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  heavy  presumption  of  judicial  review  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  actions,  there's  nothing  in  the  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme  that  meets  the  heavy  burden  to  overcome  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption.

The  statutory  scheme  here  can  be  read, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  as  the  government  would  like  to  read  it,  to  bar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review  forever;  but  then  that  provision  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  to  its  terms,  that  what  is  barred  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

director's  decision  to  institute  under  that  section,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  says,  not  all  the  other  criteria  used  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining  whether  to  institute  review. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  a  better  reading,  as  established  by  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  circuit  in  Versata,  and  the  government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original  position  in  Versata  is  that  the  statute  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevents  interim  interlocutory  review  of  the  institution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  at  the  time.  Under  Mach  Mining,  under  Boeing, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  ought  to  find  that  the  statute  can  be  read  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit  review,  and  it  should. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  there  are  no  further  questions,  I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  to  reserve  my  remaining  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Then  I  have  just  one 

   

  

 

 

 

question  about  that. 

 

 

            

Then  this  statute  is  doing  no  work,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  would  be  a  bar  on  interlocutory  review  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  judgment  rule,  in  any  event.  You  don't  need  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  to  preclude  interlocutory  review  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewing  court  can  review  only  final  judgments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BEENEY:  Correct,  Justice  Ginsburg.

Administrative  Procedures  Act  does  not  do  is,  number

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CURTIS  E.  GANNON 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  PTO  has  reasonably  decided  to  use  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longstanding  broadest­reasonable­construction  approach 

 

 

in  inter  partes  review  proceedings  because,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg  just  noted,  that  they  are  a  hybrid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  ­­ they're  ­­ they're  not  exactly  like  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  has  gone  before.  But  the  PTO  reasonably  concluded 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  are  materially  more  like  all  of  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings  that  the  PTO,  and  before  that,  the  Patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Office,  has  had  in  which  it  has  repeatedly  used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely  this  approach.  And  it  has  expressly  used  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  is  possible  for  claim  amendments  to  be  made

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Gannon,  I'm  ­­ I'm  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  bit  confused.  You  bring  a  patent.  You  go  into 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  reexamination  back  and  forth,  with  the  Patent  Office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving  it  the  broadest  reasonable  interpretation.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  make  amendments  until  you  get  to  the  point  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patent  Office  thinks  that  whatever  you  have  is  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  to  get  a  patent,  correct? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Clear  enough  and  also  satisfies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  requirements  of  patentability. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  So  how 

  

  

 

 

 

different  at  the  end  of  that  process  is  the  ordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  from  a  continuing  broad  meaning?  You've  already 

   

  

 

 

 

 

had  all  these  chances  to  amend,  to  make  things  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precise  and  as  narrow  as  the  Patent  Office  thinks  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs  to  be. 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  I  do  think  that  it  is  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  that  in  most  circumstances,  these  two  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forms  of  construction  are  going  to  end  up  in  the  same

place.  That's  true  in  most  of  the  case  law.  The  Dell 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus  brief  supporting  us  explains  this,  in  particular, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  So  when 

  

  

 

 

 

doesn't  it  end  up  in  the  same  place? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  It  doesn't  end  up  in  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  basically  when  you  get  to  the  very  end  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  to  apply  the  presumption  of  validity  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy  was  discussing  before  that  requires  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  to  adopt  a  saving  construction  of  a  patent.  It 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

gets  to  the  end  of  the  process.  In  both  procedures,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  broadest  reasonable  interpretation  and  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Philips  standard,  they're  going  to  start  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  of  the  claim  in  light  of  the  specification  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  be  understood  by  a  person  of  ordinary  skill  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  arts.  It's  true  in  the  initial  examination  context 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  PTO  does  not  use  prosecution  history,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  expressly  noted  that  it  will  use  prosecution  history 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  proceeding  like  this,  the  IPR  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  what  I  ­­ that's 

   

  

 

 

 

what  I  ­­

   

            

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ because  it's  already  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

existence.  And  ­­ and  my  friend  noted  that  it  will  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  prosecution  history  that's  briefed  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  in  the  IPR.  But  the  same  thing  is,  of  course,

true  in  a  district  court  proceeding.  The  district 

   

  

 

 

 

 

court's  going  to  consider  prosecution  history  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduced  to  it  before  the  parties. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  at  the  end  of  the  analysis  if  a  ­­ if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  court  or  the  PTO  are  left  with  two  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially  reasonable  readings  of  a  ­­ of  a  patent 

   

   

 

 

 

 

claim,  a  court  has  to  adopt  the  saving  construction  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ends  the  PT  ­­ the  one  in  ­­ in  ­­ if  the  concern  is  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  obviousness  or  anticipation  in  light  of  prior  art, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  probably  going  to  be  the  narrower  construction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Board  ­­ the  Board  and  the  PTO,  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrast,  and  before  that,  the  Patent  Office,  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  that  if  you  have  a  claim  that  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably  be  read  ­­ this  isn't  just  a  hypothetical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading,  but  this  is  one,  when  you  take  all  of  this  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account,  that  could  reasonably  be  read  as  reading  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior  patent  or  as  being  obvious  in  light  of  a  prior 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent,  then  that's  a  circumstance  in  which  the  Board  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  say,  you  need  to  make  this  clear.  Otherwise, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  hold  that  it's  not  patentable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  exactly  what's  happening  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motions  to  amend  that  are  happening  before  the  Board  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IPR  proceedings  right  now.  My  friend  is  correct  ­­

majority  of  motions  to  amend  in  IPRs  have  thus  far  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied.  Only  about  13  percent  of  ­­ of  patentholders  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IPRs  have  actually  filed  motions  to  amend.  And  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  now  been  six  motions  to  amend  that  are  granted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  was  one  new  one  last  week.  It's  a  small  number. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

But  the  vast  majority  of  these  amendments 

 

 

 

 

are  denied  on  grounds  of  unpatentability.  And  this  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  that  actually  isn't  that  different  from  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  happen  in  the  initial  exam  or  in  the  ­­ or  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reexam. 

            

And  so  my  friend  quotes  Section  305,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  standard  allowing  for  a  patentholder  to  propose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendments  in  a  course  of  an  ex  partes  reexamination. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  note  that  it's  the  ability  to  propose  amendments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  not  an  amendment  as  of  right.  Just  because  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

propose  an  amendment  in  a  ­­ in  a  reexamination  doesn't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

mean  that  the  PTO,  at  the  end  of  that,  is  going  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  right.  This  is  patentable  as  ­­ as  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed  the  amendment.  It  still  has  to  find  that,  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amended,  it  does  not  read  on  the  prior  art. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  the  one  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ what's  happening  here  is  the

they  would  read  on  prior  art  and  be  unpatentable.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  think  as  Justice 

    

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg  described  it,  we're  dealing  with  a  hybrid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

entity  with  characteristics  of  the  PTO  and  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  But  it  seems  to  me  perfectly  clear  that  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant  for  this  entity  to  substitute  for  the  judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action. 

            

So  why  ­­ why  should  we  be  so  wedded  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  they  do  business  in  the  PTO  with  respect  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadest  possible  construction  when  the  ­­ the  point  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  to  replicate  PTO  procedures.  It's  supposed  to  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  place  of  district  court  procedures. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  It's  supposed  to  take  the  place 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  some  extent,  but  not  to  the  ultimate  extent.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  supposed  to  perfectly  replicate  the  results  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  litigation.  And  we  know  that  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  imposed  structural  differences  on  the  IPR 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding  that  will  guarantee  that  there  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  results  at  the  end  of  the  day. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Most  importantly,  there's  the  different 

 

 

 

 

burden  of  proof.  If  you  ­­ even  though  you're  arguing

But  they  ­­ they  can  lead  to  different  results  here  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  reasons,  even  setting  aside  the  question  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  broadest  reasonable  interpretation  applies 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  you're  just 

  

 

 

 

 

saying  that,  okay,  there's  a  problem  here,  and  so  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  accept  another  problem  that's  presented  where  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  to  do  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  we  ­­ we  do  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  why  this  ultimately  ends  up  being  more  like  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board  proceeding  or  a  PTO  proceeding  is  because  there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ability  to  make  claim  amendments.  You're  not,  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  end  of  the  process,  just  stuck  with  having  to  adopt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  saving  construction  of  the  patents.  The  ­­ the  patent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owner  can  come  in  and  say,  look,  I  can  fix  that  problem. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  can  keep  this  from  being  obvious. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  are  you  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  IPR  proceeding?

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  that's 

  

 

 

 

happened  six  times  ever. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  It's  ­­ it  ­­ the  ­­ out  of  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  it's  a  small  number  so  far.  Many  more  motions  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually,  three  times  as  many  motions,  16  motions  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  denied  as  moot.  They  were  contingent  amendments, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  ­­ the  patent  owner  said,  well,  if  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  adopt  ­­ if  you're  going  to  disagree  with  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  construction,  I  would  propose  amending  the  patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this  way.  And  the  Board  said,  we  deny  your  motion  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moot  because  we  agree  with  your  construction  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent  is  actually  patentable  without  the  amendments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  this  is  not  an  instance  where  the  patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owner  is  shooting  in  the  dark,  where  he  has  only  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance  to  amend.  As  was  already  mentioned,  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PTO,  the  Board,  is  generally  going  to  give  a  preliminary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  construction  when  it  issues  its  ­­ its  decision  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institute  the  proceedings.  Here,  at  Pages  171  to  177a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Petition  Appendix,  there  are  seven  pages  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board  explaining,  in  its  decision  to  institute  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding,  what  it  thinks  the  phrase  "integrally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attached"  means  for  purposes  of  this  patent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  there's  already 

  

 

 

 

 

been  ­­ there's  already  been  a  case  where  you've  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary  results  with  respect  to  the  same  patent,  right?

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  what  do  you  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  case? 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  in  that  case,  if  the

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you  put  the

talking  about  district  courts  that  don't  do  patent  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  a  regular  basis.  You  put  the  district  court  to  all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trouble  of  trying  to  construe  the  patent,  and  then

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  the  ­­ I  think  this  is

some  ­­

 

  

if  you've  been  sued  for  infringement  by  the

one  of  these  IPR  proceedings  within  12  months. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  usually,  the  district  court  hasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gotten  that  far  along,  and  there  isn't  that  much  wasted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effort.  And  instead,  what  we  do  is  we  go  back  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PTO,  and  the  PTO  gets  exactly  the  chance  that  Congress

in  the  ­­ in  the  ­­ the  Board  proceeding,  the  IPR,

concerned  because  of  Article  III,  and  we  have  to  have  a

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  I  think  that,  ultimately, 

   

  

 

 

 

the  question  in  the  IPR  is  ­­ is  narrow,  because  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  devoted  to  a  couple  types  of  unpatentability.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  going  to  be  about  whether  the  PTO  ever  should  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued  this  patent  because  it  was,  in  fact,  anticipated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  a  prior  patent,  or  it  was  obvious  in  light  of  prior 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

art,  and  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  you  say  it's  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

it's  narrow,  but  we  have  the  broadest  possible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction.  I'll  ­­ I'll  work  with  that.  I  think 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're  probably  right. 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  GANNON:  But  what  I  mean  by  "narrower" 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  that  in  ­­ in  a  district  court  proceeding,  there  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  grounds  that  could  be  used  to  challenge  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patents  and  ­­ and  it  ­­ it  could  proceed  along 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  lines.  This  ­­ this  is  a  narrower  trap  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  only  grounds  that  can  be  considered  are  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  invalidity  on  the  basis  of  102  or  103.  And  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  that  you  do  not  have  to  be  somebody  who  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article  III  standing  in  order  to  initiate  an  IPR. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  another  thing  that  we  think  shows  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  intended  to  be  just  a  perfect  substitute  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  litigation. 

 

 

            

To  be  sure,  most  of  these  IPRs  are  going  to

interest,  who  were  concerned  about  whether  they're  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  sued  for  infringement  on  the  basis  of  this  patent,

this  patent  that  they  think  ought  not  to  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued  is  invalidated.  And  this  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What's  the  evidence?  That 

  

  

 

 

 

is  to  say,  I  picked  that  up  from  your  brief,  that  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  is,  in  part  ­­ call  it  a  partial­Groundhog­Day 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  You'll  do  it  again  until  you  get  it  right,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partly,  it's  designed  here  to  go  back  to  the  ­­ I  ­­ to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Patent  Office,  probably  because  a  large  number  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

businessmen  told  Congress  that  they  were  getting  threats 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  suits  in  respect  to  patents  that  obviously  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  have  been  issued. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

Now,  if  that  was  the  problem,  then  it 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  make  ­­ it  does  make  sense  to  say  at  least  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PTO  has  the  authority  under  a  partial­Groundhog­Day 

   

 

 

 

 

statute  to  do  that  part  of  it  over.  And  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surprising;  there  are  only  six  that  actually  got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amended,  because  they  narrowed  it  before  and  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PTO  held  these  are  invalid,  anyway.  Okay?  That 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  ­­ so  that  doesn't  move  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  look  at  the  view  I  just  expressed  of  the

little  district  court  proceeding  designed  to  save  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  time  and  money  that  they'd  have  to  spend  on  a  big 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  proceeding.  All  right? 

  

 

 

 

            

Now,  what's  the  evidence  that  the  first  view 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  had,  which  would  not  say  this  is  just  a  little 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  proceeding,  is  correct? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  I  think  we  have  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

different  types  of  evidence.  We  do  have  the  legislative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  that  we  quote  in  our  brief  that  said  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committee  report  said  that  a  purpose  of  this  was  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

improve  patent  quality  and  ­­ and  help  justify  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  in  favor  of  validity  that  a  company's  issued 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

patents  in  district  courts. 

 

 

 

            

But  then  in  terms  of  the  notion  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  intended  to  be  another  little  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding  that  happens  to  be  faster  and  cheaper  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  all  of  the  structural  differences  that  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imported  here  to  ensure  that  it  wasn't  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  same.  And  so,  as  I  mentioned,  it  was  going 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  limited  to  certain  particular  grounds  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unpatentability  under  102  and  103.  The  evidence  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  considered  there  is  limited.  The  only  prior 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

art  that  can  be  considered  is  prior  art  that  comes  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patents  and  prior  publications.  That's  a  narrower 

   

  

 

 

 

universe  than  could  be  used  in  a  district  court

going  to  be  different. 

 

 

 

            

And  so  we  think  that  in  ­­ in  speaking  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  those  things  expressly  and  ­­ and  then  also  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensuring  that  there  still  would  be  an  opportunity  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amend  claims,  that,  ultimately,  is  the  reason  why  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  sufficiently  like  district  court  litigation  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  PTO  to  part  ­­ to  depart  from  its  longstanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  of  using  the  BRI  approach  in  every  type  of

isn't  the  first  Groundhog  Day­type  statute  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  PTO  has  had.

reading  of  the  patent?  Could  it  say,  fine,  this  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pertinent  fact,  a  mixed  question  of  law,  in  fact,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  pending  before  me.  And  I  appreciate  the  fact 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  think  this  agency  thinks  this,  but  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsibility  is  to  decide  this  case  according  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  and  law,  and  I  disagree  with  the  PTO's  reading. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Yes.  As  long  as  the  patent 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

still  exists.  If  the  end  of  the  IPR  proceeding  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cancelation  of  the  relevant  claim,  then  there  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  something  to  be  litigated  about  in  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  But  otherwise,  the  claim 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

construction  that  is  adopted  in  ­­ in  ­­ along  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  getting  to  upholding  the  patent  claim  isn't  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bind  the  district  court  any  more  than  the  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  construction  would  bind  a  different  district  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

or  the  PTO. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  can  it  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  understand  what  PTO  thinks  the  scope  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent  is,  but  my  responsibility  is  to  interpret  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  a  different  standard,  and  under  my  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  I  have  a  different  result? 

   

   

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Yes.  That  ­­ that  could  be  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference,  and  that  is  exactly  what  the  courts  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeatedly  recognized,  going  back,  as  my  friend  noted, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  1924  decision  from  the  D.C.  circuit  in  the  Carr 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  which  recognized  that  the  PTO  and  the  courts  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  different  standards  precisely  because  you  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  clarify  the  scope  of  the  claim  when  you're  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  PTO. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  if  the  district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court  interprets  the  patent,  is  ­­ is  that  binding  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  PTO? 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  No.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  The  same  thing  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  It  just 

  

  

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me  that  that's  a  bizarre  way  to  conduct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  ­­ decide  a  legal  question.  I  mean,  who  ­­ how 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  it  work?  Whoever  gets  to  the  judgment  first,  or  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  with  respect  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  whether  the  patent  still  exists,  if  the  PTO 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cancels  the  claims  at  the  end  of  the  proceeding,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  won't  be  something  to  be  litigating  about  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court. 

 

            

If  the  PTO  holds  that  the  burden  of  proving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  claim  is  unpatentable  has  not  been  satisfied, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  somebody  else  can  take  another  shot  at  that  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court.

This  particular  party  who  proceeded  before

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ won't  be  able  to,  because

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Even  though  they're

MR.  GANNON:  Even  though  they're  different 

  

 

 

 

 

standards  of  proof. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  that  how  estoppel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

normally  works? 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Here,  Congress  has  expressly 

  

 

 

 

 

prescribed  that  you  cannot  use,  in  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding,  an  argument  that  you  could  have  advanced  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  the  answer  to  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  is,  no,  that's  not  the  way  estoppel  normally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

works. 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That's  right.  But  I  would  also 

   

  

  

 

 

 

say  that  in  this  context,  the  Court  has  recognized  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blonder  Tongue  that  estoppel  ­­ that  ­­ that  people  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeatedly  relitigate  the  question  of  patent  validity  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  courts  around  the  country. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  there  another 

  

 

 

 

 

example  where  you  have  a  complaint  filed  that  puts  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  before  the  district  court  during  which  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  can  take  that  issue  away  from  the  district  court

guess  you're  saying  it  doesn't  bind  the  district  court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  I  ­­ I'm  saying  that  if  the  PTO

find  that,  yes,  it  is  correct,  this  is  one  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patents  we  never  ought  to  have  issued  in  the  first

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ and  the  patent  owner  has  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  proffered  amendments,  they  can't  come  up  with

because  of  their  ­­ their  view,  and  then  it  goes  back  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court,  and  the  district  court  said,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thank  you  very  much  for  your  opinion,  but  my  job  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  a  different  analysis.  I'm  not  bound  by  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

broadest­possible  reading.  And  when  I  read  the  patent, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I  think  it  comes  out  the  other  way,  and  that's  how  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  decide  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  It  is  true  that  a  district 

   

  

 

 

 

 

court,  as  long  as  the  patent  still  exists  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  parties  and  the

about  a  patent  application,  yes.  And  also,  here,

that  this  patent  claim  is  unpatentable.  It  doesn't

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  What  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

was  asking,  I  think,  is  a  different  question.  The 

   

   

  

 

 

 

reason  it's  not  ­­ it's  not  as  if  it's  an  appeal  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  because  the  district  ­­ that  ­­ that's  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  before  the  district  court:  What  is  the  scope  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  patent;  what  does  it  cover?  And  the  Patent  Office 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  telling  you,  well,  it  covers  this,  and  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  says,  thank  you,  I  apply  a  different  standard.  I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  it  covers  this.  And  when  that's  the  case,  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid  patent. 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That's  correct.  That  could 

  

  

 

 

 

happen.  But  if  the  claim  has  already  been  canceled,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  that  if  the  ­­ if  the  ­­

If  the  PTO  has  canceled  the  patent,  the  lawsuit  in  the

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ and  determined  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ assuming  it  loses  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  circuit,  the  district  court  case  has  ended, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct? 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  if  the  patent  is  gone, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  ­­ then  they're  not  going  to  be  litigating  about  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  district  court. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  So  what  does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

survive?  Let's  assume  the  Patent  Office  decides  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  patent's  still  alive.  The  loser  goes  up  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  circuit,  and  the  Federal  circuit  says  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  a  patent.  They've  given  it  a  meaning  of  ­­ the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

broadest  possible  meaning  and  said  it's  still  valid. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now  what  happens  in  the  district  court?  What's  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alive?  Give  a  concrete  example. 

   

  

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well  ­­

MR.  GANNON:  No.  I  don't  expect  that  it 

    

  

 

 

 

 

would,  because  the  problem  here  has  to  do  ­­ it  ­­ it's

circumstances  and  only  after  making  these  findings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  position  now  is  that  that  decision  is  never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewable. 

            

Justice  Ginsburg  asked  a  very  intelligent 

   

 

 

 

question,  which  is,  if  we  ­­ what's  the  purpose  of  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  the  APA?  And  your  opposing  colleague  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  two  purposes:  It  precludes  mandamus,  and  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

precludes  reviews  of  the  denial  to  grant  such  a  hearing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why  isn't  that  ­­ all  of  that  enough  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  should  be  some  review?  Why  would  Congress  tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  PTO  don't  do  it  except  in  these  limited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances,  but  nobody's  going  to  ever  watch  you  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  sure  that's  what  you're  doing? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  I  ­­ I'd  say  a  couple 

   

   

  

 

 

 

things.  First  of  all,  calling  something  nonappealable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  particularly  odd  way  of  saying  that  the  only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  get  review  of  this  in  the  Federal  circuit  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  an  appeal  rather  than  mandamus. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  secondly,  with  respect  to  the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  whether  this  is  just  barring  review  of  the  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  to  institute  a  proceeding,  we  think  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrast  with  the  statute  that  applies  to  ex  parte 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reexams  is  ­­ is  very  telling  here.  And  this  is  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  several  provisions  of  the  Patent  Act,  Congress  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  the  same  phrase.  They  have  called  certain

decisions  by  the  PTO  "final  and  nonappealable."  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  did  here,  but  they  ­­ they  made  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  to  a  much  broader  category  of  decisions  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  had  previously  done. 

 

 

 

            

But  in  the  context  of  ex  parte  reexams,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  303(c),  which  is  reprinted  on  Page  1a  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  brief,  they've  made  final  and  nonappealable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  the  following:  The  determination  by  the  director 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  no  substantial  new  question  of  patentability  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  raised. 

 

            

And  so  that's  a  provision  in  which  Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

did  exactly  what  my  friend  says  it  was  trying  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  It  said  that  the  only  thing  that  is  final  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonappealable  is  the  decision  that  no  new  question  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  raised,  and  therefore,  this  proceeding  will  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instituted. 

            

Here,  the  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what  do  we  do  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  circuit's  reading  in  Portola  ­­ Portola  ­­

nonappealable  is  the  entire  decision  whether  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institute  an  inter  partes  review  under  this  section. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Gannon,  would  you 

  

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  reply  brief  at  page  19,  and  they  give  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

series  of  rulings  that  the  Board  might  make  that,  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  view,  would  be  immune  from  any  judicial  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

So  the  Board  goes  ahead  and  institutes  an 

 

 

 

 

IPR,  even  though  the  requester  for  that  IPR  has  already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed  a  parallel  civil  action,  something  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute  says  should  not  happen.  That  would  not  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewable,  that  wrong  decision,  under  your  view  of  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is  that  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  We  ­­ we  think  that  they  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  subject  to  an  appeal.  The  court  of  appeals  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left  open  the  possibility  of  mandamus,  and  we  understand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  it  did  that.  Because  the  phrase  here  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"nonappealable,"  that  doesn't  necessarily  rule  out 

  

 

 

 

 

mandamus. 

            

We  don't  think  that  it  would  make  sense  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  mandamus  only  at  the  end  of  the  proceeding.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  if  mandamus  were  to  happen,  it  should  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  it  would  normally  happen,  at  the  time  when  the  error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ the  alleged  error  occurs,  but  it  would  be  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserved  for  extraordinary  circumstances. 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ the  party  would  go  immediately  to  the

Federal  circuit  and  say,  we  have  a  clear  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

indisputable  entitlement  to  relief  here  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  is  violating  the  statutes.  That's  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

where  there'd  be  expedited  briefing,  where  the  P  tab 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  have  invested  all  the  resources  into  getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  decision  on  the  merits  before  a  court  pulled  it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  and  said,  you  never  should  have  gotten  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

So  we  do  think  that  there  may  be 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  that  satisfy  mandamus  where  there  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review  of  the  Board's  departure  from  statutory  criteria, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  what  Congress  has  spoken  to  here  and  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonappealable  is  the  decision  whether  to  institute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings  under  the  section.  That's  not  just  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  of  whether  there's  a  reasonable  likelihood 

   

 

 

 

 

under  Subsection  A,  it's  everything.  And  that  section 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes  references  to  311,  to  313.  It  has  at  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference  to  a  decision  under  this  chapter. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  all  of  that,  we  think,  is  included  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  scope  of  the  appeal  bar,  and  that  distinguishes  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  a  case  like  Mach  Mining  where  the  presumption 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  reviewability  had  not  been  overcome  ­­ or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  of  favor  of  reviewability  had  not  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overcome.  Here,  Congress  here  clearly  spoke  to  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  May  I  ask  you  a  question 

   

   

  

 

 

that  relates  to  the  other  ­­ other  issue?

The  district  court  holds  that  a  patent  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

valid.  Could  the  ­­ the  PTO,  on  its  own  initiative,

reexamine  the  validity  of  patents  that  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued  ­­ that  it  has  issued.  That's  the  statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framework  since  1980. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­ so  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  reaches  a  judgment  saying,  you  win  based 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  my  reading  of  the  patent,  and  then  you  can  go  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PTO  and  say,  no,  the  reading  of  the  patent  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  was  wrong,  so  you  lose? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  my  understanding  of 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg's  hypothetical  was  that  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

director  of  the  PTO  could  institute  the  reexamination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding  in  ­­ in  light  of  issues  that  were  revealed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  time  in  the  district  court  proceeding. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  then  can  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

losing  party  in  the  district  court  go  back  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court,  or  if  it's  on  appeal,  to  the  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals,  and  say  the  district  court  was  wrong?  The  PTO 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that,  and  I  should  win. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  They  ­­ they  could  say  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  they  already  have  a  final  judgment,  then  that's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  an  issue.  And  depending  on  if  the  patent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  not  actually  been  invalidated,  then  ­­ then  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  still  be  using  the  district  court  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction  in  the  judicial  litigation. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

Mr.  Beeney,  you  have  a  minute  left. 

   

 

 

 

 

         

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  GARRARD  R.  BEENEY 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BEENEY:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Let  me  just  begin  by  saying  that  as  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  brief,  we  heard  nothing  today  that  suggests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  use  of  the  ordinary­claim  construction  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  accomplish  Congress's  purpose.  But  what  we  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoid  is  all  of  the  bizarre  harms  that  are  caused  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  of  the  broadest­reasonable­interpretation  expedient. 

 

 

 

 

We  have  different  results,  demonstrable  different 

 

 

 

 

 

results,  as  the  Chief  Justice  pointed  out.  Many  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  are  cited  in  our  brief  where  a  patent  is  upheld  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court  and  then  invalidated  by  the  Board. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  wouldn't  happen  if  we  used  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  construction  as  Congress  intended  by  having  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court­like  system.  We  wouldn't  be  depriving  patent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

owners  of  their  property  rights  based  on  pretending  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent  means  something  that  it  doesn't  mean.  Patent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  should  be  taken  away  only  if  the  patent  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claimed,  that  was  granted,  and  that  was  issued  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unpatentable. 

            

And  that,  Justice  Kennedy,  is  why  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  have  speculation  in  IPR.  They're  property 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rights,  and  they  should  be  treated  as  to  what  those

properties  rights  encompass. 

 

 

            

Putting  together  the  government's  position, 

 

 

 

 

the  government  says  BRI  is,  quote,  "an  examinational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expedient"  used,  quote,  "before  the  patent  issues"  in, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote,  "an  iterative  process,"  quote,  "to  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarity  and  precision  in  claims." 

 

 

 

 

   

That  is  not  IPR. 

 

 

 

The  government  ­­ the  Congress  in  enacting  IPR  got  rid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  that  examinational.  They  got  rid  of  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you  very  much. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon,  at  12:02  p.m.,  the 
 

 

 

 

 

case  in  the
 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
