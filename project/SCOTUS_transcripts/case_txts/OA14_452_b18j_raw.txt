(10:05  a.m.) 

 

            

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We  will  hear 

  

 

 

argument  first  this  morning  in  Case  14­452,  Kansas  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gleason  and  the  consolidated  cases.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  DEREK  L.  SCHMIDT 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

These  sentences  do  not  offend  the  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.  Each  of  these  jurors  was  able  to  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningful  effect  to  anything  and  everything  they  heard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  presented  in  mitigation.  The  verdicts  reflect  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasoned  moral  response  of  these  jurors  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  brutality  of  these  crimes,  the  weak  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  mitigation,  and  the  individual  assessment  of  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's  moral  culpability. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Do  you  agree  ­­ do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree,  whatever  the  Eighth  Amendment  does  not  require, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  would  be  better  practice  for  the  trial  judge  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  the  jury  what  the  burden  is  on  mitigators,  just  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ward  off  any  possibility  of  confusion? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  And,  in  fact,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg,  that  now  happens  in  Kansas.  Subsequent  to

this  case,  the  State  made  a  decision  to  alter  its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pattern  instructions,  but  that'd  not  required  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment.  In  fact,  the  Kansas  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  why  can't  we  presume 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  required  by  the  State  law,  not  the  Constitution?  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  as  I'm  reading  the  decision  below,  the  court  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  the  principles  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voice  to  or  support  for  the  use  of  this  burden  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  is  commanding  it. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Well,  I  think  not, 
 

   

  

 

 

Your  Honor. 

 

This  decision  ­­ these  decisions  were  plainly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on 

 

the  Kansas  Supreme  Court's  interpretation  not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

of  State 

 

law,  but  of  the  Eighth  Amendment.  And  I  ­­ I 
   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

would 

point  out  a  couple  of  reasons  I  believe  that 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

conclusion 

is  inescapable. 

 

            

First,  the  court's  conclusion,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

indicated  at  page  103  in  our  application,  the  summary  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  did,  the  court  indicated  very  plainly  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  talking  about  mitigating  evidence  as  required  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment  with  no  reference  to  State  law  or  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  whatsoever. 

 

            

Second,  this  argument  has  been  presented 

 

 

 

 

 

previously  when  Kansas  has  been  before  this  Court.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  rejected  a  similar  argument  in  Kansas  v.  Marsh;  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected  a  similar  argument  in  Kansas  v.  Cheever  two

terms  ago.  It  presumably  rejected  or  at  least  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embraced  the  similar  argument  made  at  the  cert  stage  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  cases. 

 

            

            

And  in  fact,  in  the  Kansas  v.  Marsh  case  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Did  the  Kansas  Supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

Court  read  these  cases? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Perhaps  I  ought  not  answer 

   

  

 

 

 

that,  Justice  Scalia,  but  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  How  can  you  explain  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  indeed  our  prior  cases  are  so  clear  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point? 

            

don't  ­­

 

            

penalty. 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Justice  Scalia,  I,  of  course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  They  don't  like  the  death 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SCHMIDT:  ­­ know  how  to  answer  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  I  can  only  say  that  this  decision  ­­ these 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions  clearly  are  based  on  that  court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  that  can't  be. 

  

 

 

 

 

Already  we  know  and  the  Kansas  court  knew  the  dissent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  out  that  a  burden  for  mitigating  circumstances 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  is  okay,  so  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  believe  that  no  burden  is  required  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution.  They  know  that  there  is  no  requirement

because  the  cases  mentioned  by  you  and  Justice  Scalia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that.  So  it  has  to  be  their  view  of  State  law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  No,  Your  Honor,  I  believe  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

error,  and  that's  why  we're  in  front  of  this  Court.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  there's  any  question  about  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  ­­ I  suppose  the  issue  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

not  what  they  believe,  but  what  they  said. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  They  did  in  fact  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  mean,  we  ­­ we  ­­ we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  psychoanalyze  the  lower  courts;  we  ­­ we  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  said.  And  if  they  said  that  it's  the  Eighth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment,  it's  the  Eighth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  In  the  10  pages  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority  opinion  on  this  subject  in  the  Gleason  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  there  are  8  references  to  the  Eighth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment;  in  the  dissent  slightly  fewer  pages  in  total, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  18  references  to  the  Eighth  Amendment.  And  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gleason  decision,  it's  in  our  reply  at  page  8,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  Supreme  Court  rejected  the  notion  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  matter  at  issue  here  wasn't  required  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment,  instead,  wrote  both  recommended 

 

 

 

 

 

statements  from  the  prior  case,  the  one  at  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  If  you  prevail  here  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your  position,  is  it  necessary  for  us  to  remand  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  Supreme  Court  to  determine  ­­ for  them  to

determine  whether  State  law  would  require  a  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

result  on  this  issue?  I  know  there  are  some  other 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  in  the  case,  but  on  this  issue  or  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Not  on  this  issue,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ or  are  we  permitted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

simply  to  reverse  outright? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  I  believe  you're  permitted  to 

    

 

 

 

 

reverse  outright. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Certainly  remand  on  some 

  

 

 

 

 

on  other  issues,  I  understand. 

   

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Correct.  We  presume  there 

  

  

 

 

 

would  be  further  proceedings  below  on  other  issues  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't  decided  in  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  couldn't  ­­ why 

  

 

 

 

 

couldn't  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  say  on  remand,  thank 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  for  enlightening  us  about  the  Eighth  Amendment,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  still  think  that  Kansas  law,  independent  of  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  constitutional  requirement,  requires  juries  to 

 

 

 

 

 

be  told  what  the  burden  is?  They  could  do  that  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand. 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Justice  Ginsburg,  that  would, 

  

 

 

 

 

of  course,  be  an  issue  that  we  would  argue  on  remand  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  were  briefed.  That's  not  what  they  did  here.  And, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact,  if  this  Court  does  not  correct  the  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  error,  I  would  respectfully  submit  we'll  never

get  to  that  question  on  remand  because  the  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment,  that  court's  interpretation  of  it,  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispose  of  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  about  the  other? 

  

 

 

 

 

Didn't  they  say  something  about  inadmissible  hearsay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  prejudice  ­­ cause  prejudice  in  the  Carr  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  In  the  Carr  case,  there  was  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  with  respect  to  that,  Justice  Ginsburg.  It  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  questions  that  were  presented  or  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued  in  front  of  this  Court.  It  was,  as  you  know,  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluminous  record  with  many,  many  issues  discussed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Kansas  Supreme  Court's  decision  below 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  reversed  by  this  Court  because  it  made  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors.  First,  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  incorrectly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

found  in  the  Eighth  Amendment  what  the  dissent  called  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

per  se  requirement.  They  found  that  there  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  in  the  Eighth  Amendment  for  an  affirmative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction  that  mitigation  need  not  be  proven  beyond  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  there  ­­ to  go  back  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  that  Justice  Ginsburg  has  asked,  as  we  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  never  held  that  there  is  an  absolute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  that  you  give  the  reasonable  doubt  ­­ don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  it's  no  reasonable  doubt  in  a  mitigating  case,  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  you  said.

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  We  send  it  back  because,  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

you  said,  they  just  ­­ if  the  law  in  the  State  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different,  they've  changed  it.  When  they  changed  it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  they  apply  the  change  retroactively? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  No,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

And,  in  fact,  if  this  Court  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  did  they  say? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  SCHMIDT:  The  pattern  instructions  in 

  

 

 

 

 

Kansas  that  would  be  applicable  in  a  circumstance  like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  on  this  subject  have  been  changed  prospectively. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  we  now  use  them. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  that  court's  held  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

only  prospective? 

 

            

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  I  don't  believe  that's  been  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You  ­­ how  can  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

retroactively  give  an  instruction?  Right? 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  you  very  simply  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  have  a  new  trial,  that's  how.  I  mean,  you  simply 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  a  new  sentencing  hearing  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  But,  Your  Honor,  of  course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  would  be  no  need  for  a  new  trial  if  this  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  correct  the  Eighth  Amendment  error,  which  is  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  trying  for  ­­

Kansas  law,  as  is  now  revealed  by  their  pattern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions,  suggests  that  you  do  have  to  give  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction  that's  required,  that  the  ­­ that  the

MR.  SCHMIDT:  No,  Your  Honor,  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  not? 

  

 

 

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Not  unless  that  instruction 

  

 

 

 

 

were  to  apply  retroactively  in  the  case  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  SCHMIDT:  ­­ and  that  question,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

course,  is  not  presented. 

 

 

 

            

In  fact,  there  are  currently  9  persons  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  of  death  in  Kansas  and  this  issue,  this  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  issue,  as  our  court  has  expressed  it,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present  in  6  of  them.  So  two­thirds  of  the  death 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  cases  in  our  State  are  negatively  affected  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  event  this  Court  were  to  decline  to  correct  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment  error  and  allow  the  Kansas  court  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  to  misapply  the  Eighth  Amendment  in  the  manner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  done. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  How  ­­ how  was  the  change  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  pattern  instructions  made?  Who  made  it?

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Is  it  approved  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  or  is  it  divorced  from  the  Supreme  Court? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  I  believe  that's  correct,  but 

    

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  don't  want  to  swear  to  that,  Your  Honor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You  believe  it's  correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

that  it  is  approved  by  the  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  I  want  to  double­check  on  that

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay. 

  

 

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  My  thinking  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

following,  so  you'll  understand  why  I  ask  this  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It,  I  think,  could  be  the  case  that  you're  right,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  never  held  that  the  Eighth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  giving  such  an  instruction. 

 

 

 

 

            

Next  question:  Should  it  now  hold  it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Well,  the  answer  to  that  question  could  be  this  is  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  case  to  decide  that.  Because  it  may  be  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  court  has  held  it  as  to  the  future  and  may  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  future  rule  as  to  the  9  people  who  are  involved  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  past.  Therefore,  send  it  back. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

What  do  you  think  of  that  reasoning? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Well  ­­

like  to  know  your  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Respectfully,  I  ­­ I  share 

   

   

  

 

your  conclusion  on  that  point,  Justice  Breyer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Isn't  it  true,  General 

  

 

 

 

 

Schmidt,  that  it  makes  a  big  difference  whether  this  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  under  the  Federal  Constitution  or  under  Kansas  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  presumably,  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  understood  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  had  the  capability  of  basing  its  decision  on  Kansas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  But  if  ­­ if  it  did  that,  it  would  have  to  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsibility  for  the  decisions  in  these  cases,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  some  of  the  most  horrendous  murders  that  I  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen  in  my  10  years  here.  And  we  see  practically  every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

death  penalty  case  that  comes  up  anywhere  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country. 

   

These  have  to  rank  as  among  the  worst.  So  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  take  responsibility  for  that.  It  said  it's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment,  and  we  have  to  apply  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution. 

            

Now,  it  may  be  they  will  say,  well,  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  say  that  Kansas  law  requires  this,  but  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  their  responsibility;  isn't  that  true? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Justice  Alito,  I,  of  course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

won't  speculate  on  what  the  Kansas  court  was  ­­ might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do.  I  ­­

how  ­­ how  many  people  are  there  on  death  row  in  Kansas?

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Which  would  suggest  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  Kansans,  unlike  our  Justice  Breyer,  do  not  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  death  penalty  is  unconstitutional  and  indeed  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  favor  it,  which  might  suggest  that  a  retention 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

election  that  goes  before  such  people  would  not  come  out

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Justice  Scalia,  all  I  can  say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  that  in  these  cases,  it's  certainly  apparent  to  us,

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  is  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  do  when  it's  told  its  own  lower  courts  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  before  this  case,  or  two,  you  must  give  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction?  What  ­­ what  ­­ what's  the  Court  supposed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do? 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Are  you  asking  about  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  Supreme  Court  is  supposed  to  do  in  that  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor? 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.  Whether  the 

  

  

 

 

Constitution  requires  it  or  not,  it  has  said  the  better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  is  to  give  this  instruction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What's  a  court  supposed  to  do?  Say, 

   

  

 

 

 

willy­nilly,  my  lower  courts  can  disagree  with  me  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  do  it? 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Justice  Sotomayor,  no.  And  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

would  leave  it  to  the  Kansas  court  under  Kansas  law  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice.  It  is,  of  course,  the  supreme  court  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  to  determine  what  the  appropriate  step  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  State  law.  But  what  the  Kansas  court  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  do  in  that  circumstance  is  pivot  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment  and  make  a  Federal  decision  that  is

and  it  can't,  by  doing  so,  immunize  itself  from  ­­ from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review  in  this  Court.  And  that's  Michigan  v.  Long, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  ­­ which  ­­ which  I  don't  know  if  were  cited  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  brief,  but  Michigan  v.  Long,  to  Justice  Alito's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  made  it  very  clear  that  a  ­­ a  State  court  can't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hide  behind  a  ­­ a  Federal  law  and  ­­ and  ­­ and  be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immune  because  there  might  be  a  State  law  to  predicate. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  have  to  see  what  they  wrote.  And  this  ­­ I  assume 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Kansas  would  pride  itself  on  ­­ on  being  cited  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  jurisdictions.  And  if  it's  wrong  and  it  uses  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  calculus  that's  incorrect,  it's  ­­ it's  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  duty  to  reverse. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Yes,  Justice  Kennedy,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

certainly  agree.  And  to  that  last  point  on  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions,  we've  identified,  and  they're  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs,  at  least  5  states  that  we  believe  are  similarly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situated,  where  they  actually  impose  no  burden,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  require  an  affirmative  instruction. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  believe,  notwithstanding  the 

 

 

 

 

back­and­forth  in  the  briefs,  that  the  Uniform  Code  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Military  Justice  looks  much  more  like  the  Kansas  system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  this  point  than  on  what  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  constitutionally  required. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  suppose  ­­ I  suppose 

    

   

 

 

that  it  is  true  that  if  you're  a  juror  and  you're

considering  whether  or  not  to  grant  mercy,  that's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that's  easily  subject  to  a  burden­of­proof 

   

 

 

 

 

analysis  one  way  or  the  other.  If  a  juror  thinks  I  have

burden  of  proof  of  any  sort. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Certainly  correct, 

  

 

 

Justice  Kennedy.  And,  of  course,  a  mercy  instruction 

   

  

 

 

 

 

was  given  in  each  of  these  cases.  And  in  addition, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  and  apart  from  the  mercy  instruction  issue, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  in  the  past  looked  at  what  you've  called 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

catch­all  instructions,  like  the  Factor  K  instructions 

   

 

 

 

 

from  California,  has  looked  on  them  favorably.  And  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  cases  there  was  a  catch­all  instruction  given  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

well.  It's  an  instruction  7  on  Gleason  6  and  8  with 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

respect  to  the  Carr  cases.  So  there  was  both  a

sentence  less  than  death. 

 

 

 

            

And  to  Justice  Kennedy's  point,  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  not  a  finding  subject  to  some  burden  of  proof. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  an  open­ended  invitation  to  consider  and  weigh  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  effect  to  anything  else  these  jurors  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  in  rendering  a  reasoned,  moral  judgment. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Didn't  the  Court  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  reading  that  from 

  

 

 

 

 

Gleason,  and  that's  also  in  Carr? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

Instruction  6  and  8  in  Carr.  Similar  language.  It  may 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

not  be  exactly  identical,  but  it's  substantively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Didn't  the  Kansas  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

say,  yes,  we  have  that,  but  the  only  burden  of  proof  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  of  the  instructions  was  in  aggravating  circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  the  State  bore  that  burden? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  it  pointed  to  the  fact  that  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  mitigating  were  mentioned  in  the  same  clause  5  or  6 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  with  no  explanation  of  what  the  burden  was  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating.  The  Kansas  Court  thought  that  the  jurors

could  be  confused  or  would  be  confused  by  what  burden  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proof  was  needed. 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Justice  Sotomayor,  and  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

the  second  reason  we  would  respectfully  ask  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  reverse  the  Kansas  Court,  in  addition  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bright­line  per  se  rule. 

 

 

 

            

The  Kansas  Court  reported  it  said  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying  this  Court's  instruction  from  Boyde  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California  to  test  whether  or  not  the  Eighth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  offended  by  instructions  that  are  alleged  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous  or  confusing,  which  I  think  is  what's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

happening  there. 

 

            

The  Kansas  Court  said  it  was  applying  Boyde, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  then  it  went  on  to  conduct  no  actual  Boyde  analysis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  than  what  Your  Honor  points  to,  which  is  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  said  repeatedly,  in  both  cases,  that  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  burden  of  proof  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  must  prove  with  respect  to  aggravators,  and  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  the  weighing  factor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  mere  silence  on  the  other  side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow  led  the  Kansas  Court  to  conclude  that  Boyde  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated  because  jurors  would  have  inferred  what  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed  on  the  State  must  also  have  been  imposed  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent.  I  just  don't  think  that  follows  either 

    

 

 

 

 

 

logic  or  natural  language.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  think  what 

    

   

 

 

they're  saying  is  that  some  jurors  would  be  confused. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  certainly,  there  have  been  jury  ­­ jury  studies  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicate  that  jurors  are  often  confused,  generally, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  burdens  of  proof. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Justice  Sotomayor,  I  certainly 

   

  

 

 

agree  that  is  what  they  seem  to  be  saying,  but  the  test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  adopted  and  applied  repeatedly  since 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Boyde  is  not  that  there  is  some  speculative  possibility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  hypothetical  circumstance  somebody  might  have  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

confused.  It  is  there  is  a  showing,  that  there  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  likelihood  that  these  jurors  applied  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  in  a  way  that  prevented  them  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

considering  constitutionally  relevant  mitigation 

 

 

 

evidence.  There's  no  showing  of  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  is  such  common  sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  is  a  maxim  of  interpretation  that  invokes  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When  ­­ when  somebody  says  interest­free  loans  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  with  good  credit,  it  implies  that  there  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest­free  loans  for  people  who  don't  have  good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit.  Inclusio  unius,  exclusio  alterius. 

  

 

 

 

            

And  if  one  says  there  are  aggravating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors  and  mitigating  factors,  and  you  must  prove  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  factors  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

normal  understanding  is  you  don't  have  to  prove  it

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  for  the  mitigating  factors. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  such  ­­ such  common  reasoning  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  any  juror  who  doesn't  follow  it  is  ­­ is  certainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  typical  juror,  and  not  the  person  for  whom  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  instructions  have  to  be  devised. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  the  jury 

  

 

 

 

instructions  don't  have  to  be  devised  necessarily  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court.  They  should  be  understandable  to  jurors. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  doubt  very  much  that  any  juror  has  heard  of  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maxim. 

            

But  putting  that  aside,  the  Kansas  Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  has  much  more  experience  than  we  do  with  trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  decisions,  has  determined  that  confusion  exists  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  exist.  Why  isn't  that  enough  for  us? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Your  Honor,  I  would  point  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

back  again  to  the  concluding  paragraph,  because  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  illustrates  my  response  that  ­­ there's  suggestion  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  response  throughout  the  record,  but  it  illustrates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  well. 

 

            

Again,  back  on  page  103  of  the  Gleason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix,  this  is  what  our  court  said:  "The  district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court's  instruction  on  mitigating  circumstances  failed 

 

 

 

 

 

to  affirmatively  inform  the  jury  that  mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  need  not  be  proven  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

doubt."  So  there  was  silence  on  that  point.

Next  sentence:  "And  the  penalty  phrase"  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

"phase  instructions  as  a  whole  exacerbated  the  error 

   

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  referred  only  to  the  State's  burden  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,"  which,  of  course,  will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

always  be  true  because  it's  constitutionally  required 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  jurors  be  informed  the  State,  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bears  that  burden  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The  Kansas  Court  then  concluded  in  the  next 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  ­­ I  won't  read  it  because  I've  cited  it  before 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ but  under  these  circumstances,  in  other  words,  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  an  instruction  that  the  State  must  prove  beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  reasonable  doubt  and  there  is  silence  on  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side,  we  conclude  there  is  a  reasonable  likelihood  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ the  Boyde  is  violated  ­­ I'm  summarizing,  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course  ­­ it  is  conclusory  and  nothing  else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  other  words,  it  is  back  to  that  per  se 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application  that  was  novel  in  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding.  They  gave  it  the  gloss  of  Boyde.  They  said 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  applying  Boyde.  But  they  misapplied  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  instruction  from  Boyde  and  instead  merely  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's  our  Boyde  analysis.  There's  a  per  se  violation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  is  a  beyond­a­reasonable­doubt  instruction 

   

 

 

 

correctly  for  the  State  and  silence  on  the  other  side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No  other  indication  of  juror  misapplication  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusion.

Justice  Scalia,  back  on  the  point  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  raising.  I  would  just  say  that  it  is  ­­ perhaps 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ironic  is  the  correct  word,  but  frustrating  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standpoint  of  the  government  in  this  case  ­­ the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case,  that  we  bent  over  backwards  to  make  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  these  jurors  the  heavy  burden  borne  by  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  did  repeatedly  tell  them,  at  multiple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places,  the  State  bears  a  burden  to  prove  aggravation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  and  to  prove  on  the  weighing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor,  and  that  the  death  penalty  should  be  imposed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  phrasing's  in  there;  it's  a  normative  phrase.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  not  subject  directly  to  a  burden  of  proof. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  because  we  told  them  that  repeatedly  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  clear  how  heavy  the  State's  burden  was,  that  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  turned  into  an  argument  that  we  somehow  misled  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  the  prosecutor  in 

  

 

 

 

 

Carr  did  tell  the  jury,  I'm  going  to  create  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  as  to  the  defendants'  mitigating  evidence.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  prosecutor  didn't  do  what  you  said. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Well,  Justice  Sotomayor,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Carr  records  are  very  thick.  And  I  would  say  on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gleason,  I  think  it's  bright  line,  very  clear.  We 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

conceded  the  existence  of  all  but  two  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating  factors  that  were  asserted  in  Gleason.  And

the  other  two  merely  asked  was  anything  produced;  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  any  evidence  on  that,  which  this  Court  has  said  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  since  Marsh  is  permissible.  So  I  think  Gleason  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  clean  example  on  behalf  of  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Carr,  I'd  admit,  is  a  much  longer  record  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  a  lot  more  back  and  forth  in  it.  You  had  expert 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  and  some  back  and  forth  on  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  even  in  the  Carr  case,  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed  since  Boyde,  and  has  done  so  repeatedly,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  determining  whether  or  not  there's  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

likelihood  of  unconstitutional  juror  confusion,  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors  thought  they  couldn't  consider  something,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  context  of  the  entire  trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  look  at  the  overall  instructions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  given  in  the  Carr  case,  you'll  also  see  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Carr  prosecutors  ­­ and  I'd  refer  the  Court  to  pages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

392  and  393  of  the  Joint  Appendix,  as  well  as  442  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

443  of  the  same  ­­ the  prosecutor  told  the  Carr  juries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  jury's  task  is,  quote,  "to  research  and  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analyze  and  to  distribute  the  information  and  to  weigh

death  verdict,  and  I  quote,  "Because  you  have  looked  and

I  offer  those  as  examples, 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor,  to  make  the  point  that  it  is,  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  always  possible,  particularly  when  dealing  with

to  find  a  phrase  here  or  there  that,  in  hindsight, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps  was  inartfully  crafted. 

 

 

 

            

But  the  overall  thrust  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions,  the  arguments  of  counsel,  the  nature  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence  that  was  put  on,  to  Justice  Kennedy's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  was  these  jurors  were  told  to  consider  and  weigh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything.  In  fact,  they  were  literally  told  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase  in  Instruction  2,  to  consider  and  weigh 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  admitted  into  evidence  that  would  weigh  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravation  or  mitigation.  It  was  clear  they  were  given 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  open­ended  instruction,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  General,  if  I  can 

   

  

 

 

 

understand  your  argument,  you're  saying  not  only  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  analysis  would  come  out  the  State's  way,  but  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  this  ­­ the  lower  court  really  never  did  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  at  all,  right?

It  didn't  think  that  it  was  doing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis.  It  didn't  think  that  that  analysis  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  because  it  thought  that  there  was  just  a  per 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

se  rule  that  one  had  to  give  this  instruction;  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct? 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  No,  Justice  Kagan,  that's  not. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

What  I'm  saying  is  that  the  lower  court  correctly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  Boyde  as  the  proper  analysis,  said  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  was  doing,  but  then  wholly  misapplied  Boyde  and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead,  conjured  this  per  se  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Their  misapplication  of  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

precedent  in  Boyde  is  what  resulted  in  their  incorrect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  that  the  Eighth  Amendment  requires  this  sort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  per  se  instruction. 

 

 

 

            

So  it's  not  just  that  they  didn't  get  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  should  have  done  and  they  did  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  It's  that  they  tried  to  do  what  they  should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  done  under  this  Court's  precedent;  they  just  did  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong.  And  that's  why  we  asked  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  find  that  a  little  bit 

    

   

 

 

 

confusing.  It  just  ­­ it  sounds  like  they  just  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited  Boyde  but  failed  to  pay  attention  to  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Boyde  said  about  what  the  analysis  ought  to  be  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead  substituted  their  own  analysis,  which  was  a  per 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

se  rule  deriving  from  the  Eighth  Amendment.

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Well,  except,  Your  Honor,  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your  point  about  citing  Boyde,  they  did  more  than  cite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Boyde.  They  also  recited  some  of  the  concepts  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Boyde.  I  mean,  for  example,  the  Court  said  ­­ and  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  I  already  mentioned  this  passage  to  you  ­­ our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  said  that  they  looked  at  the  context  of  the  trial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  something  that  Boyde  says  must  be  done  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  Boyde  analysis.  But  in  their  conclusion,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor's  statements  made  matters  worse, 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding  the  fact  it  was  already  discussed  with, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor.  I  just  don't  believe  that  is  a  fair 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  or  an  accurate  conclusion. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  a  ­­ what  a 

   

  

 

 

 

wonderful  system  we've  created.  We  give  ­­ even  when  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  court  is  wrong  in  convicting  somebody,  so  long  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  reasonably  wrong,  we  uphold  them.  And  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  wrong  on  a  legal  conclusion  applying  our  test, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  jump  in  and  reverse  them,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Justice  Sotomayor,  all  I  can 

   

  

 

 

 

say  is  on  this  case,  our  court  was  wrong  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment.  We  would  ask  for  reversal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  with  permission,  I'd  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  reserve  the  balance  of  my  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  General.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JEFFREY  T.  GREEN 

 

 

 

 

 

            

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS  IN 

 

 

 

 

 

                

NOS.  14­452  AND  14­449 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  first  address  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor's  questions,  briefly. 

 

 

            

Justice  Sotomayor,  you  were  correct,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  Supreme  Court  has  3  times  addressed  this  issue 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

before,  not  2  times.  There  was  a  case  cited  in  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

submission  that  we  made  to  the  Court  on  Monday.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submission  was  the  objection  to  the  jury  instructions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered  by  counsel  for  Jonathan  Carr  and  Reginald  Carr. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  that  ­­ in  that  objection  to  the  ­­ or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excuse  me  ­­ the  affirmative  jury  instructions  offered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  those  attorneys.  In  those  affirmative  instructions, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  explained  that  one  of  the  reasons  why  they  wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  instruction  that  the  jury  should  be  told  no  beyond  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt  standard  applies  to  mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  is  ­­ is  a  case  called  Harman,  and  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited  at­­ and,  again,  it's  in  our  submission  ­­ 254 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  87  from  1993.  Kansas  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Is  that  true  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Gleason  case?  There  was  no  ­­ am  I  right,  that  there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  no  objection  to  these  instructions  given  on

mitigators  in  Gleason?  You  pointed  out  in  your  letter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  in  Carr. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

That's  correct.  But  I  submit  for  this  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  did  you  ­­ did  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask  ­­ oh,  it  was  the  court  in  Gleason.  Was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  court  asked  to  charge  that  mitigators  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  proved  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt?  Was  there  any 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

request  to  charge  that  was  turned  down? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  No,  there  was  not  in  Gleason, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  But,  again,  these  cases  are  consolidated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  this  purpose.  And  my  friend  on  the  other  side  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  podium  here  has  conceded  that  these  instructions  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical  for  purposes  of  the  Eighth  Amendment  analysis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  we're  going  to  do.  So  we  do  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserved  objection,  but  it  doesn't  matter  anyway.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  submit,  Justice  Ginsburg,  because  Kansas  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no­waiver  rule  for  such  failures  to  object  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gleason  case,  and  in  any  event,  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed  on  it. 

 

 

            

But  I  want  to  get  back  to  what  Kansas  said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  ­­ in  the  Harman  case.  It  said  that  the  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  were  ­­ and  these  are  the  same  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  here  in  a  mandatory  minimum  case.  Kansas 

   

  

 

 

 

 

has  a  bifurcated  proceeding  in  mandatory  minimum  cases.

These  same  jury  instructions  were  confusing,  and  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely  the  reason  that  we  have  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then  we  have  the  Kleypas  case  that  comes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later.  In  the  Kleypas  case,  the  courts  ­­ the  Kansas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court's  ­­ Kansas  Supreme  Court's  analysis  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  this:  The  instruction  is  okay  on  the  unanimity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  for  Mills  and  McKoy  purposes.  So  it's  okay. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  okay.  But  for  purposes  of  understanding  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigation  evidence  is  to  work,  it's  confusing.  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

citation  to  Federal  authority.  None  whatsoever.  And  so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  say  there  should  be  an  instruction  given  to  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  phase  juror  in  Kansas  ­­ jury  in  Kansas,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is,  first,  let's  have  the  non­unanimity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction,  then  let's  have  the  instruction  that  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  understand  the 

    

 

 

 

point  you're  getting  to.  What  ­­ what  is  your  point? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  this  was  ­­ this  decision  was  based  on  State  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  that  it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  State  law. 

 

 

 

            

And,  in  fact,  if  you  go  to  Scott,  the  next 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  in  the  proceeding,  Your  Honor  ­­ Your  Honor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invited  us  to  look  at  the  cases.  If  you  go  to  Scott, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  says  the  same  thing.  We're  reiterating  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  said  in  Kleypas,  and  by  the  way,  we  think  that

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  thought  the  whole 

    

 

 

 

 

point  of  our  decision  in  Michigan  v.  Long  was  to  make  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  to  State  courts  that  we  weren't  going  to  do  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  thing.  We  weren't  going  to  try  to  look,  well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  many  Federal  cites,  how  many  State  cites.  Unless 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  clear  that  it's  based  solely  on  State  law,  then  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume  it's  the  Federal  question  and  Federal  basis  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case.  And  ­­ and  I  assume  your  friend  was  correct 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  how  many  times  the  Eighth  Amendment  was  ­­ was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited  in  the  opinion. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  I  think  that's  probably  true 

    

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  this  decision.  I  would  call  the  Court's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attention  to  ­­ to  the  Gleason  Pet.  App.  102,  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  core  statement  of  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  an  interpretation  of  Kansas  State  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

With  respect  to  your  question  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  It  doesn't  matter  under 

  

 

 

 

 

Michigan  v.  Long.  It's  debatable  whether  that's  a  good 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

rule  or  not,  but  it  is  the  rule.  It  says  if  there's  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt,  this  Court  will  assume  that  the  State  court  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  on  the  Federal  ground,  not  the  State  ground. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  I  understand  that,  Your  Honor, 

    

 

 

 

 

and  I  would  submit  that,  if  you  look  at  the  history  of

that  does  rely  solely  on  State  law  and  solely  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  Supreme  Court's  decision  or  interpretation  of  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  State  law,  but  ­­ please. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  I  was  just  going  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

add,  are  you  asking  us  to  dismiss  the  case  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  an  adequate  and  independent  State  ground? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  I  am  asking  you,  first,  to  issue 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  opinion  that  would  say  the  origins  of  this  rule  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  Eighth  Amendment.  They're  in  fact  Kansas  State  law, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Kansas  Supreme  Court's  interpretation  of  its  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  And  second,  the  Court  might  consider  dismissal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  case. 

 

 

            

But  to  answer  your  earlier  question  to  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend  on  the  other  side  of  the  podium,  Justice  Kennedy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  be  difficult  to  imagine  a  circumstance  in  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  wouldn't  say,  well,  you  were  wrong,  Kansas, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  Eighth  Amendment  here,  and  therefore  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  remand  so  you  can  resolve  this  issue  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  this  is  in  fact  a  Kansas  Supreme  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  of  the  Kansas  State  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  if  ­­ if  ­­ if  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  determines  that  this  instruction  is  not  confusing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  matter  of  Eighth  Amendment  law,  that  surely  has  a

significance  ­­ I  would  think  it  would  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

significance  on  any  remand  proceedings  that  might  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place.  And  plus  ­­ and  it  has  additional  significance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  other  jurisdictions  that  use  this  ­­ and  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  that  use  this  instruction.  So  surely  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  significant  and  necessary  to  decide  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment. 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  it  may  be  that  ­­ and  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  why  my  first  alternative  suggestion  was  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  take  a  look  at  ­­ at  this.  And  maybe  this  is  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  that's  bracketed  with  Michigan  v.  Long.  There's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  history  of  Kansas  Supreme  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  Kansas  law  that  would  allow  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  this  isn't  a  Michigan  v.  Long  case.  If  a  State 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

supreme  court  simply  says,  look,  we  have  a  decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  We  think  it's  confusing.  The  history  is  it's  an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  State  law.  And  by  the  way,  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support  under  Federal  law  that's  ­­ that  is  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Michigan  v.  Long  case. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  presumably, 

  

 

 

 

the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  is  familiar  with  Michigan  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Long,  as  we  are,  and  they're  on  notice  that  if  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start  putting  the  Federal  authorities  mentioning  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment  8  times,  that  the  court  is  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  it  as  a  decision  based  on  Federal  law.

The  whole  point  of  Michigan  v.  Long  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ so  that  we  wouldn't  have  to  do  what  we've  been

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  I  won't  ­­ I  won't  waste 

   

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Of  course,  you  know,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  read  our  Eighth  Amendment  cases,  maybe  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  didn't  read  Michigan  v.  Long.  I  mean,  that's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely  understandable. 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  I'm  going  to  ­­ I'm  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrate  to  you  in  a  minute  that  they  did  read  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment  cases  and  that  they  got  it  right, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  would  it  not  be  true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Kansas  issue  ­­ the  Kansas  law  issue  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  in  a  State  collateral  proceeding?  Why  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

remand  necessary? 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  in  part  because  if  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kansas  collateral  proceeding,  the  presumption  of 

 

 

 

 

 

legality  and  finality  would  attach  on  direct  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  case  is  still  on  direct  review.  And  so  I  would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submit,  Justice  Alito,  that  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court

sort  this  out. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  In  the  ordinary  case,  let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say  a  State  Supreme  Court  decides  an  issue.  They  make 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  ­­ they  make  no  reference  whatsoever  to  State  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  based  it  on  the  Federal  Constitution.  It  comes  up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here;  we  reverse.  We  would  not  remand  and  say,  well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  didn't  say  anything  about  State  law,  but  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible  that  you  might  want  to  find  that  the  same  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  under  State  law.  We  wouldn't  do  it  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation,  would  we?  In  every  case  like  that  we  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand? 

            

MR.  GREEN:  I  don't  know  about  every  case, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  can  imagine  that  the  Court  would  want  to  go  back 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say,  well,  look,  Federal  law  doesn't  work  this  way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it  ­­ but,  you  know,  Kansas  Supreme  Court  or  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supreme  court,  if  you  think  it  works  another  way,  fine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  is  that  what  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  in  such  cases?  We've  remanded  all  of  those  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  to  say,  well,  you  didn't  mention  State  law,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  you  want  to  think  about  State  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  I  haven't  seen  a  case  like  that. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

But  to  go  to  the  Chief  Justice's  question,  Michigan  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Long  was  ­­ was  kind  of  the  reverse  of  this  case.  It

additional  weight  to  the  decision.  It  was  the  basis  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  decision. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  All  right.  If  we  assume  for 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  sake  of  argument  that  we  would  not  do  that  in  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  then  what  you  are  proposing  is  that  we  do  it  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  think  there's  a  sufficient  ­­ there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  uncertainty  about  the  basis  for  the  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  then  we're  going  to  get  into  the  situation  in  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  cases  of  deciding,  is  there  enough?  Well,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited  some  State  cases,  they  might  ­­ we're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  be  making  these  decisions  in  every  one  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  I  would  submit  that  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

would  be  such  a  case,  especially  given  the  history  of  ­­

have  no  mitigating  burden,  do  you  know  how  many  of  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  an  instruction  just  like  this  one? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Yes.  We  cited  in  our  brief

the  United  States  that  have  the  death  penalty,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You're  not  saying  that 

  

 

 

 

 

that's  required  by  the  Eighth  Amendment;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  not  advocating  a  per  se  rule  that  such 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  are  necessary. 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  No.  That's  right,  Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

Kagan.  We're  not  ­­ we're  not  advocating  that  kind  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

per  se  rule.  In  fact,  one  could  imagine  a  set  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  ­­ a  set  of  instructions  that  are  silent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  mitigation,  but  nonetheless  would  pass 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

muster  under  the  Eighth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  could  I  ­­ could  I  talk 

   

   

  

 

 

 

about  the  circumstances  of  this  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GREEN:  Please. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Which  is,  you  know,  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  instruction  here  that  is  unfortunate  in  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juxtaposition  of  the  reasonable  doubt  standard  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference  to  mitigating  circumstances.  And,  you  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  unfortunate,  and  I  can  see  why  they  changed  their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pattern  instructions. 

 

            

But  ­­ but  we've  said  that  the  analysis  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holistic  one.  We  look  at  everything.  You  also  have

instruction.  You  have,  in  both  cases,  arguments  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutors  that  indicate  fairly  clearly  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  all  up  to  the  jurors  in  Gleason.  It  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Mitigating  circumstances  are  every  juror's  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

choice."  In  ­­ in  Carr,  the  prosecutor  says,  "Anything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fairness  may  be  considered  as  extenuating." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  guess  the  question  is,  even  if  this  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  really  unfortunate  wording  in  the  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt/mitigating  circumstances  juxtaposition,  why 

 

 

 

doesn't  all  of  this  other  stuff  indicate  that  no  juror 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  likely  to  be  confused? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Because  the  unfortunate  wording 

  

 

 

 

 

that  Your  Honor  refers  to  is  repeated  throughout  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions.  Please  let  me  demonstrate  here.  With  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  the  findings  of  ­­ findings  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  circumstances,  every  time  the  Court  is  told 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  must  find  aggravating  circumstances  beyond  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt,  the  same  sentence  says,  "And  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating  circumstances  found  to  exist." 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  repeated  parallelism  in  these  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  instructions  with  respect  to  the  use  of  the  verbs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Let's  go  to  Justice  Scalia's  point  earlier  with  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  what  a  reasonable  juror  would  have  known.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

juror  ­­ if  you  look  at  Instruction  No.  1,  Instruction

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Which  ­­ which  case?  In 

  

  

 

 

 

 

which  case,  Gleason? 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Yes.  I'm  sorry,  Your  Honor. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

This  would  be  in  our  Gleason  app,  Appendix  1(a). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instruction  No.  1  says  that  when  a  Defendant  ­­ excuse 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

me.  "The  laws  of  Kansas  provide  that  a  separate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  proceeding  shall  be  conducted  when  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Defendant  has  been  found  guilty." 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  verb  "find"  or  "finding"  appears  7 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  in  the  ­­ throughout  the  instructions  saying  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  must  find  mitigating  circumstances.  Three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

times  in  the  instructions,  at  crucial  points  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instruction  No.  10,  which  I'll  ask  us  to  look  at  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minute,  and  Instruction  No.  12,  which  is  the  verdict, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  is  referred  to  ­­ or  the  jury  is  asked  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

findings  with  respect  to  aggravating  circumstances.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  the  same  exercise  throughout. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  the  jury  was  also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

aware  that  there  was  a  big  difference  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

aggravators  and  mitigators.  They  were  told  they  had  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  unanimous  on  the  ­­ on  the  aggravators.  But  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigators,  each  jury  ­­ each  juror  was  to  make  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  for  herself  and,  moreover,  that  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigator  need  not  be  found  by  all  the  jurors.  So

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  I  might  agree  with  that, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  except  for  the  jury  was  expressly  told  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instruction  No.  7  that  ­­ that  with  respect  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigators,  it  didn't  have  to  be  unanimous.  However,

with  ­­ with  the  juror's  belief  that  the  juror  had  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  it  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt?  My  goodness,  if  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  you  would  think  every  other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

juror  would  find  the  same  mitigator,  and  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressly  told  that  they  don't  have  to  find  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigator. 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  is  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

only  ­­ the  only  standard  that  the  jury  is  offered,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  It's  the  only  one  that  they  know.  It's  the  one 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they've  sat  through  the  guilt  phase  with.  It's  now

the  one  that  they're  trying  to  apply  in  the  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phase,  executing  a  moral  ­­ pardon  the  pun  ­­ executing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  moral  judgment  as  to  whether  a  defendant  should  live 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  die. 

 

            

So  with  respect  to  what  jurors  might  say  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  another  in  the  jury  room,  one  can  imagine  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  where  one  juror  says,  mercy,  I'm  not  ­­ you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  maybe  there  should  be  mercy.  Another  ­­ another 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juror  says  to  that  juror,  well,  I  didn't  ­­ I  didn't  see 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  evidence  for  that.  I  mean,  are  you  certain  mercy 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  applied  here?  No.  You  know,  you  have  to  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  that  mercy  applies  here. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  don't  think  that's  a  farfetched  notion  at 

   

 

 

 

 

all,  especially  when  you  look  at  an  instruction  like  No. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10,  which  is  on  page  5A  of  the  Joint  Appendix.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instruction  10  draws  an  express  parallel  and  uses  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verb  "to  find,"  Your  Honor.  "If  you  find  unanimously 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  one  or  more  aggravating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  exist  and  that  they  are  not  outweighed  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  mitigating  circumstances  found  to  exist,  then  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall  impose  a  sentence  of  death." 

   

 

 

 

            

Let's  jump  down  to  the  next  paragraph.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

next  paragraph  says,  "However"  ­­

Gleason  Appendix  ­­

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Oh,  the  Gleason. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  GREEN:  ­­ red  ­­ red  brief.  My 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

apologies,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

            

            

The  next  paragraph  says  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  You  put  it  in  the  red 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  It's  also  in  the  petition  for  writ  of  certiorari 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix,  the  white  appendix.  Gleason  133,  page  133  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  white. 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  The  second  paragraph  of 

  

 

 

 

 

Instruction  No.  10  says,  "However,  if  one  or  more  juries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not"  ­­ "jurors  is  not  persuaded  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  on  the  burden  of  proof  in  the  paragraph  above." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So,  again,  the  jury  is  called  to  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  the  reasonable  doubt  standard  when  assessing  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravating  and  mitigating  circumstances  in  parallel. 

 

 

 

 

 

And,  again,  this  is  the  only  ­­ this  is  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  that  the  jury  has  been  exposed  to  throughout 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trial. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Your  proposal  is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  the  floor  was  not  telling  them,  mitigators  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  be  shown  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  But  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  doesn't  tell  the  jury  what  the  burden  of  proof  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  mitigators. 

 

            

Why  are  you  urging  beyond  ­­ you  don't  have

to  find  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  Okay.  So  what  do 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  find  in  order  to  accept  a  mitigator? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  It  doesn't  expressly  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ Justice  Ginsburg.  That's  the  whole  problem,  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  ­­ I  respectfully  disagree  with  Justice  Scalia. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

A  lawyer  might  look  at  these  instructions  and  say,  aha, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  there  is  an  absence  or  a  silence  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  what  the  burden  of  proof  is  as  to  mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  creates  a  negative  implication. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I  have  the  same 

   

  

 

 

 

question.  Suppose  the  jury  is  instructed  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigators  do  not  have  to  be  proved  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt.  And  then  the  jury  sends  a  question,  well,  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  burden  of  proof  on  mitigators?  How  should  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  judge  answer  that? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GREEN:  In  Kansas,  the  answer  is,  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  of  production  and  a  burden  of  production  only. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  all  that  means  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  We're  asking  under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment  ­­ or  at  least  that's  my  interest  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  Eighth  Amendment,  what  is  required  in  response 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Justice  Alito's  question?  I  didn't  mean  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

interrupt. 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  it  may  be  just  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

negative,  that  there  is  no  ­­ that  there  is  no  burden

individual  jurors  should  consider  all  of  the  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  it's  about  weighing  and  ­­ and  maybe  the  judge

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Wait.  It's  not  a  matter  ­­

   

  

  

 

 

 

we're  asking  the  factual  finding  of  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigator  existed,  not  weighing  the  mitigators  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  aggravators,  the  factual  finding  of  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigator  existed,  whether  indeed  this  defendant  had  a

that  the  juror  has  to  sustain  in  order  to  come  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment? 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  consistent  with  ­­ with

the  offense  which  was  presented  in  either  the  guilt  or

proof.  It  ­­ and  it  does  relate  to  both  aggravating  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating  circumstances. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it  says  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  consider  anything  that  was  presented,  not  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  found  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  If  it  was

evidence  that's  presented.  But  you  say,  well,  we  have

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  NEAL  K.  KATYAL 

 

 

 

 

 

    

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT  IN  CASE  NO.  14­450 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A  man  is  being  put  to  death  under  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  that  are  so  confusing  that  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  likelihood  that  some  juries  would  interpret 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  instructions  to  bar  consideration  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating  evidence  and  others  would  not.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity  and  inequity  is  impermissible  under  the  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment. 

            

Now,  the  State's  answer  is  the  instructions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  the  jury  in  a  catch­all  provision  to  consider 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  as  mitigating.  That's  irrelevant.  There  are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

two  fundamentally  different  questions.  The  first  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"what."  What  kinds  of  circumstances  count  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating?  And  second  is  the  "how."  How  does  a  jury 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

determine  if  those  circumstances  exist  in  a  given  case.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  circumstances  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

the  circumstances  that  count  as  ­­ as  mitigating,  4(a) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  ­­ the  Gleason  brief,  "any  other  aspect  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's  character,  background  or  record,  and  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  aspect  of  the  offense  which  was  presented." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Exactly,  Mr.  Chief  Justice.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

agree  that,  for  example,  the  jury  was  instructed  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald  Carr's  child  abuse,  if  it  existed,  could  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating  factor.  The  question  is:  How  was  a  jury  to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

determine  whether  Reginald  Carr  was  abused  in  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  as  a  child? 

   

 

            

So  the  catch­all  provision  doesn't  answer 

 

 

 

 

 

that  question. 

 

            

Now,  General  Schmidt's  answer  is,  well,  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  language  of  instruction  2.  And,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice,  I  think  you  were  referring  to  that.  This  is

our  ­­ out  general  point  here  is  that  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  repeatedly  in  Abdul­Kabir  and  in  Braverman  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mere  presentation  of  evidence  is  enough.  The  evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  given  full  effect  as  a  mitigating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance. 

            

And  I  understand  that  different  people  can 

   

 

 

 

 

look  at  this  ­­ these  set  of  instructions  as  a  whole  and

this  Court's  decision  in  Boyde  says  as  long  as  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  reasonable  likelihood  that  a  jury  could  read  them  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing  way  and  bar  the  consideration  of  mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  that  is  enough. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  Justice  Scalia,  you  said,  well,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  square  with  common  sense.  What  about  an  example 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like,  quote,  "interest­free  loans  for  people  with  good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit"? 

            

Now,  our  argument  is  not  simply  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  instruction  said  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  though 

   

 

 

 

 

 

they  did  9  times.  It's  that  they  coupled  the  beyond  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt  with  the  language  found  to  exist,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating  circumstances  must  be  found  to  exist  9  times. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so,  Justice  Scalia  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

something  ­­ if  you're  considering  whether  to  retire, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  said  you  should  be  absolutely  sure  you  have  enough

you  had  to  be  absolutely  sure  you  were  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bored. 

            

MR.  GREEN:  Well,  let  me  just  do  it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  with  respect  to  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  that  Justice  Scalia  said.  If  ­­ if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypo  was  interest­free  loans  should  be  given  to  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  to  have  good  credit,  found  to  have  good  credit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  mirrors  these  instructions,  and  then  the  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  found  with  a  certain  standard  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

   

 

 

 

 

doubt,  or  whatever,  I  think  it's  absolutely  plausible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  people  would  read  that  instruction  and  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  just  as  much  to  people  without  good  credit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They'd  apply  the  same  standard.  And  that  squares  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  with  the  experience  in  the  States.  At  least  24 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  are  using  this,  if  ­­ if  not  every  State.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  point  to  a  single  State  that  says  found  to  exist 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurs  in  the  jury  instructions  9  times.  It's  not  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  absence  of  an  affirmative  instruction,  it's  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  instructions  are  injecting  confusion  and 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertainty. 

            

And  the  distinction  here  is  that  you  can

life,  simply  because  of  a  legal  interpretation  of  what

Finish  the  sentence. 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  was  just  going  to  say,  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  death  for  the  worst  offender,  Mr.  ­­ Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alito,  that's  ­­ that's  ­­ that's  the  death  penalty  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  imposed  for  the  worst  interpretation  of  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  If  ­­ if  I  were  on  a  jury 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

and  I  were  told  that  the  burden  ­­ that  mitigators  do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  to  be  proved  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  I  would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  that  confusing  because  then  I  would  ask  what  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  burden  of  proof  on  mitigators?  And  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  there's  any  way,  really,  to  answer  that  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  maybe  this  is  a  situation  like  trying  to  define 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  doubt  where  less  is  more.  It's  better  not  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  into  the  question  of  burden  of  proof  at  all.

the  fact  as  to  which  it  would  apply?  The  overall

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  Justice  Alito,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

this  Court  has  never  said  that  if  jury  instructions  are, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  silence,  confusing,  that  that  silence  alone  is  enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  rise  to  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation.  Here,  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  that  the  instructions  themselves  injected  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusion.  And  so  I  don't  think  this  Court  is  going  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  every  possible  thing  that  the  jury  might  thought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  their  heads.  The  point  is  here  they  mentioned  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  standard,  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  They  mentioned 

   

  

 

 

 

 

it  9  times.  And  they  said  that  the  mitigating 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  had  to  be  found  to  exist. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  jury  interpreted  it  this  way,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  ­­ then  the  Court  would  be  blessing  a  jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction  on  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  for  the  first 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  ever  in  its  history  that  said  that  a  jury,  all  12 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  them,  might  have  believed  mitigating  circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  existed  and  could  not  give  it  effect.  That  is

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what  burden

the  showing  of  mercy? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  They  were  clearly 

  

 

 

 

 

instructed  that  they  can  show  mercy.  So  what  ­­ they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  say  anything  about  the  burden  of  proof. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  And  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were  clearly  instructed  that  mercy  was  a,  quote,  "a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating  factor."  And  so  they  were  then  told  9  times 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  had  to  find  a  mitigating  factor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you  think  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

had  ­­ they  would  have  interpreted  that  I  have  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  whether  to  extend  mercy  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

doubt? 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Absolutely,  Your  Honor.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

think  this  Court  has  said  many  times  that  we  presume  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  follows  its  instructions,  and  this  is  a  perfect

doubt.  If  there  was  case  for  mercy  after  reading  all  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ all  the  sentencing  proceedings,  it  was  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reginald  Carr  had  been  abused  badly  as  a  child.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  mercy  should  have  extended.  We  are  ­­ we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  death­qualified  jurors  here  who  already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  extend  mercy  just  simply  because  death  is  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line.  There  had  to  be  something  additional.  That 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

something  additional,  in  the  context  of  this  case,  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  about  the  child  abuse  of  Reginald  Carr. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  Justice  Kagan,  that's  exactly  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State,  time  and  again,  Joint  Appendix  pages  250  to  256, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  ­­ that  Reginald  Carr  did  not  meet  his  burden 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  proof  on.  And  so  this  was  front  and  center  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating  phase  of  the  trial.  This  was  extremely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing,  I  think,  to  a  jury.  And,  of  course,  this 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court's  decision  in  Boyde  has  a  far  lower  standard  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  It's  simply  just  was  there  something  more  than  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility,  it  doesn't  even  have  to  be  50  percent,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  interpreted  the  instructions  the  wrong  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Katyal,  Kansas  has 

  

 

 

 

 

already  answered  this  question,  hasn't  it?  Its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  is  that  a  jury  be  instructed  both  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigation  need  not  be  proven  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and,  second,  that  the  jury  be  told  it  has  no  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  burden  of  proof.

MR.  KATYAL:  Exactly.  And  just  like  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Maryland  v.  Mills  where  this  Court,  under  the  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment,  looked  to  that,  here  it's  significant  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  even  Kansas  is  defending  the  rule  that  these  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  left  the  jury  with  the  impression  of.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  indeed,  I'm  not  aware  of  a  single  State  that  does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so.  There's  no  amici  on  the  State's  side  saying  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  going  to  impose  any  sort  of  harm  to  them.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  most  modest  fix  in  the  world.  It  could  be  done 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  with  an  affirmative  instruction,  it  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  by  just  striking  out  the  words  "found  to  exist"  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  jury  instructions. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  do  you  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  ­­ if  you  ­­ are  they  supposed  to  consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  they  didn't  find  to  exist? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Oh,  no. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  think  it's  a  bit 

    

   

 

 

 

of  a  stretch  to  say  found  to  exist  implies  a  particular 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  of  proof. 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  don't  think  so  at  all,  Your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  I  think  found  to  exist,  that's  the  most  natural 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  of  reading  it.  And  if  there's  any  doubt,  just  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  Instruction  No.  1.  The  first  thing  the  jury  was  told

months  of  testimony  about  whether  or  not  the  Carrs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed  the  crime  under  what  standard?  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

beyond­a­reasonable­doubt  standard. 

 

            

That  was  the  only  thing  the  jury  was  told, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  and  again,  both  at  the  guilt  phases,  the  9  times  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  mitigating  phase  of  this  trial.  It  thinks  ­­ it's

think  that's  right.  Now,  of  course  you  could  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum  thresholds,  evidence,  and  relevance,  and  so  on, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  this  Court's  decision  in  Tennard  said.

This  is  the  opposite.  This  is  the  highest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  in  all  of  law,  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  been  done.  And  these  jury  instructions  did  so. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  look,  I  understand  that  we  could  read 

   

 

 

 

 

 

these  facts  and  say  these  are  horrific  crimes,  as  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  Justice  Alito.  But  so,  too,  Reginald  Carr  had  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

horrific  upbringing.  And  I  think  the  jury  was  entitled, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  Court's  decision  in  Stringer  says,  that  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ when  ­­ when  the  injection  of  an  arbitrary  factor  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  in  and  two  juries  could  reach  different  results  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  facts,  that  violates  the  Eighth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Case  14­452  is  ­­ oh,  I'm  sorry.  You  have

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I'm  anxious

Two  or  three  points  as  time  allows, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

 

 

            

First  on  Mr.  Katyal's  point  that  the  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  the  how  and  not  the  what.  I  would  come  back  to

the  point  that  there  was  both  a  catch­all  and  a  mercy 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction  here.  And  I  would  further  point  this  Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  what  this  Court  has  suggested  in  the  past. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  has  fairly  consistently  suggested 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  cure  to  a  Lockett  type  of  error,  that  there  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  presented  that  might  not  have  been  able  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  effect,  would  be  catch­all  or  mercy  types  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions. 

            

And  I  would  refer  you  to  pages  310  and  11  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Penry  1  where  it  wasn't  the  Court,  but  it  was  defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  requested  a  mercy  instruction  that  was  not  granted. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  as  a  result,  the  case  wound  up  in  front  of  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court. 

            

But  also  suggest  that  you  look  at  page  803 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  Penry  2  where  this  Court  suggested  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  O'Connor  writing  ­­ that  a  catch­all  instruction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

well­crafted  would  have  been  the  cure  for  the  error  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  found  in  Penry  2. 

 

 

 

 

              

A  similar  implication  at  page  242  in 

 

 

 

 

 

Abdul­Kabir,  and  a  similar  implication  in  page  308  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blystone.  So  I  think  Kansas  has  done  here  precisely 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  Court  has  repeatedly  suggested  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  is  the  ­­ I  know  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

your  rebuttal.  What's  the  catch­all  instruction  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rely  on?

MR.  SCHMIDT:  The  catch­all  instruction  is 

  

 

 

 

 

the  last  paragraph  of  Instruction  No.  7. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Of  7.  Of  7.  Thank  you. 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  SCHMIDT:  Yes.  Correct.  And  the  mercy 

  

  

  

 

 

 

instruction  is  earlier.  I  believe  it's  the  second 

    

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph  in  Gleason. 

 

 

            

Secondly,  with  respect  to  Justice  Ginsburg's 

 

 

 

 

 

observation  that  there  ­­ a  juror  would  have  noticed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  a  different  between  the  use  of  finding  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  unanimity,  or  finding  in  another  context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting  that  this  argument's  not  very  persuasive, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  mere  use  of  the  word  "find"  repeatedly  somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created  confusion,  I  think  that's  correct.  And  I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

there's  other  contrast  in  this  record  that  shows  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  example,  with  respect  to  the  verdict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forms.  In  those  cases  where  the  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  language  is  included,  finding  is  included  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  both  aggravation  and  mitigation,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors  were  asked  to  check  the  box  on  what  aggravators 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  found.  They  weren't  asked  to  do  anything  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  with  respect  to  mitigators. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  a  lay  juror,  being  asked  to  do  one  task 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  one  purpose  and  a  different  task  for  a  different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

purpose,  is  not  likely  to  conclude  that  the  two  tasks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  some  way  equivalent.

Likewise,  to  the  point  that  was  suggested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier,  Mr.  Katyal  correctly  points  out  that  the  mercy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction  is  described  as  a  mitigating  circumstance. 

   

 

 

 

 

That's  absolutely  true,  but  it  certainly  doesn't  follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  jury  would  have  thought  that  they  have  to  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  burden  of  proof  to  mercy.  It's  an  act  of  grace. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  entire  point  of  mercy.  And  that  further 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests  that  it  wasn't  reasonable  to  conclude  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  these  words  "find"  time  and  again  somehow  led 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  to  an  equivocal  ­­ an  equivalent  understanding  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  they  ought  to  be  used. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Third,  with  respect  to  the  Kleypas  decision, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  am  well  on  it,  but  this  is  back  to  the  point  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referenced  by  Mr.  Green  on  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referencing  of  Kansas  case  law.  I  would  merely  point 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  to  what  this  Court  itself  said  in  rejecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely  the  same  argument  in  the  Marsh  case  ­­ it's  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  169  ­­ where  the  Court  ultimately  concluded  Kleypas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  ­­ State  law  case  that  they  draw  upon  ­­ Kleypas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  rested  on  Federal  law.  And  the  same  is  true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

The  Kansas  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Harman  didn't. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  I'm  sorry? 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Harman  didn't.

MR.  SCHMIDT:  That's  correct.  Harman  was 

  

  

 

 

 

not  a  death  penalty  case.  It  was  a  pre­death  penalty 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

case  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  no.  But  they  say  just 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  said  here. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  And  beyond  that,  Harman  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1993  case,  barely  after  this  Court  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  then  as  a  succession  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

references  back. 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  No.  But  the  point,  Your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Honor,  is  that  when  the  Kansas  Supreme  Court  talked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  Harman,  this  Court  only  three  years  previously  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laid  down  the  rule  that  governs  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  is  now  well  developed  what  the  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  rule  is.  Harman  doesn't  say  anything  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  this  Court  has  been  asked  to  decide. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  finally,  I  would  urge  the  Court  to  end, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  suppose,  where  we  began,  which  is  there's  Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  error  here.  And  absent  correction  of  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment  error  by  this  Court,  it  will  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Eighth  Amendment  interpretation  given  by  the  Kansas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  that  disposes  of  this  case,  disposes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  similarly  situated  cases  in  Kansas  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  As  we  said  this  ­­ so  as  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  just  that.  Four  sentences  you  quote,  they're

wrong. 

            

Now,  as  to  whether  the  ­­ the  instruction  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

content  here  was  too  confusing  because  of  the  placement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  arguments  you  heard,  they  didn't  really  go  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  Nor  did  they  really  go  into  the  question  of  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  Nor  did  they  get  into  the  question  of  whether  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  State  law  is  retroactive. 

 

 

 

 

            

All  those  remain  open  on  remand  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  to  ask  the  Court  to  consider  it,  and  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  decides  it's  appropriate  to  raise  it  at  that  time, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  consider  it.  Is  that  satisfactory  to  you? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHMIDT:  No,  Justice  Breyer. 

  

 

 

 

Obviously,  we'll  deal  with  whatever  State  law  questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  arise  subsequently.  But  this  was  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Not  just  State  law,  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  confusion.  Sorry.  Go  ahead.  Forget  it. 

  

  

  

 

 

 

              

I  wanted  to  know  if  it's  satisfactory.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer  is  no. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Case  14­452  is  submitted,  and  we  will  hear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  second  question  in  the  other  two  cases  in  a  moment.
