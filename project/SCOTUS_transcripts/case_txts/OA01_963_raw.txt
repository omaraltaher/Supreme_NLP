CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 91 -- or rather, 01-963, Norfolk & Western


Railway Company versus Freeman Ayers.


Mr. Phillips.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


In 1997, this Court recognized that there is an


asbestos litigation crisis confronting the Nation, and


nothing in the last five years has -- done anything other


than to show that that crisis is more acute now than at


any other time in our history.  The Rand Corporation in a


report just two months ago concluded that there are now


6,000 defendants confronted with asbestos litigation


claims, that the estimated value of those claims in


litigation costs exceeds $200 billion.


The six plaintiffs who are involved in this


case, the respondents here today, are emblematic of at


least a fundamental element of the problem that confronts


asbestos litigation.  Each of them received close to, and


in some instances more than a million dollars in


compensatory damages for claims of asbestosis.  The basis

for their claim, the primary basis for their claim was


that they confronted a fear of cancer.


Asbestosis does not convert into cancer --


QUESTION:  How do we know that?  I mean, I


notice that the awards there seem to grow with age, and


they don't seem to vary depending upon smoking.  I mean,


they're inversely related to age, they don't seem to be


affected by smoking, and that suggested to me that maybe


it didn't play a major part, this fear of cancer.  How do


we know that it played a major part?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there is a legal answer and


there is a factual answer.  The legal answer is that you


have to assume it because the jury was instructed to


include it as an element, and under West Virginia law, it 

is absolutely settled and respondents don't contest it.


QUESTION:  Well, but that, the fact that it's


one element doesn't mean it's the primary element, does


it?  They did all suffer physical impairment as a result


of the asbestosis itself, did they not?


MR. PHILLIPS:  They all suffered asbestosis, and


they all suffered some physical elements of it.


QUESTION:  And how do you know that the physical


impairment was not the primary ingredient in the jury


verdict.  I don't understand that.


MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't know that it's not the

primary ingredient, Justice Stevens.  What I do know is


that as a matter of law, you can't ignore the fact that


the -- that fear of cancer was put before the jury as a


significant component of the plaintiff's case in chief,


that the jury was instructed to include that, and that --


QUESTION:  Yes, but you said it was the primary


element of damages, and that's what I think Justice Breyer


and I are wondering whether the record really


supports that element --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think the record supports


it in the sense that we know that these are asbestosis


claims that even the respondents' expert testified were


mild, for the most part.  One or two differences about


that, but these are still relatively mild asbestosis 

claims, and mild asbestosis claims do not typically


generate million-dollar damages awards --


QUESTION:  Did the defendant --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- particularly where there's no


cost of medical care as part of the component.


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, did the defendant


attempt to test this by seeking a special verdict so that


the damages could be broken down by the jury?  This was a


general verdict, so we don't know how much they gave for


anything.


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, the defendants didn't -- the

defendant did not ask for that.


QUESTION:  But it could have --


MR. PHILLIPS:  What the defendant did ask for,


Justice Ginsburg, was to have fear-of damages eliminated


as a component of the case in a case like this --


QUESTION:  But they could have -- if they tested


this, isolated this, and then we'd know how much was


actually allocated, whether it was as he initially said


the primary, or whether it was a lesser thing.  We just


don't know.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, and that's because it's the


plaintiff's burden.  If they didn't want to have -- if


they didn't want to take the risk of a general verdict


being set aside because there's an element of damages 

that's included that the court ultimately decides should


be excluded as a matter of law, they then bear the risk


and the burden of having the case sent back for a new


trial.


QUESTION:  Oh, but the relevance of this, I


think your overall point, in my mind, is that the other


side would say, I think they do say that this is a case in


which there was an impact, and as a result of the


impact -- the thickening of the lungs -- the person does


have a fear of getting cancer greater than most people,


that that's -- entitles them under traditional law to some

damages, and where you can get a special verdict, it's


easy to see, if the jury has awarded too much damage for


that, in which case you get a reversal under -- you get a


reversal if they give too much for it, and -- so what's


the problem here that has anything to do with there being


6,000 plaintiffs and enormous damage and problems overall?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the problem's easy to


identify, that is that if the instruction is that everyone


who suffers a diagnosed case of asbestosis is entitled to


go to the jury on fear of cancer claims, then the amount


of damages that will be generated as a consequence of that


will run completely out of sync --


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. PHILLIPS: 


-- with the damages that --

QUESTION:  Why would it?  Why -- maybe they're


entitled to some fear.  A person who has no problem in the


world has a 1 in 4 chance of dying in cancer.  A person


who's subjected to asbestos may have a 1 in 3 chance.


MR. PHILLIPS:  But this Court --


QUESTION:  That gives them entitlement to some


little amount, anyway.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice Breyer, you said, or the


Court said in Buckley that you don't analyze these issues


case by case.  What you have to do is make a judgment


about the category of cases that's based on the policies

of the Federal Employers Liability Act, and the policy --


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, under West Virginia


practice, is it -- if a plaintiff or a defendant requests


a special verdict, is it automatically allowed, or is it


in the discretion of the trial court?


MR. PHILLIPS:  It's in the discretion of the


trial court, and it is also clear under West Virginia law


that if two theories are put before the jury with respect


to damages and one of them is impermissible, the answer is


you strike down and you get a new trial on damages, so


that's -- that's clear.  And I don't -- I don't hear the


respondents as arguing anything to the contrary.


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, do we look at this case


as one of a claim for traditional pain and suffering 

damages?  Is that how we should view it?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  This Court said in Gottshall


that pain and suffering damages are describable as


sensations stemming directly from a physical injury or


condition.


The physical injury that -- that's identified


here is asbestosis, and to be sure, the pain and suffering


that an asbestotic would be allowed to recover for might


be a fear of shortness of breath or other symptoms that


arise out of asbestosis, but the notion that cancer that


doesn't exist currently, may never take place, stems from

the existence of asbestosis is not a fair application of


that rule of law, particularly when there is no evidence,


and again, I don't think respondents challenge this, that


asbestosis does not cause cancer, it does not lead to


cancer.


QUESTION:  But, it sounds like you want us to


say there is some limitation on the availability of pain


and suffering damages in the context of an asbestosis


case.


MR. PHILLIPS:  All -- Not --


QUESTION:  It would be something different than


one would think of in a traditional pain and suffering


case, wouldn't it?


MR. PHILLIPS: 


Well, I think it's the 

respondents who are asking you to do something different


with a pain and suffering case, and actually I'm not even


sure that's a fair way to characterize the respondents'


argument.  I don't understand them to be arguing that this


is a classic pain and suffering --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm trying to find out what


you're arguing.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, and my argument is, this


is not under any circumstances the kind of pain and


suffering that we traditionally think of.  It's not


something that emanates directly out of the existing


10

injury.  Second, it's not negligent infliction of


emotional distress, and it's not emotional injury as a


component of a negligence claim.


QUESTION:  Well, what was it -- was the case


presented as a separate claim for negligently-caused


emotional distress?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  It was --


QUESTION:  No.  It was a pain and suffering


argument.  That's what it was, wasn't it?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it wasn't clear exactly


what it was until the jury -- until we got to the jury


instructions.  At that point, the trial judge did say, I


view these as pain and suffering.


QUESTION:  As pain and suffering.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I mean, I thought that's what we were


confronting here.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, except that the traditional


standard for pain and suffering doesn't permit the kind of


disconnect between the fear of cancer that you're talking


about here and asbestosis.  You normally associate pain


and suffering as sensations that emanate directly from the


injury itself, and fear of cancer doesn't emanate at all


from asbestosis.


QUESTION:  But it can include fright.

MR. PHILLIPS:  Fright from asbestosis --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- to be sure.


QUESTION:  Is it conceded -- I think you said it


was conceded, but is it conceded that fear of cancer does


not emanate from asbestosis?  If it's clear that you have


a greater risk of cancer if you have contracted


asbestosis, why isn't the fear connected to the


asbestosis?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it's interesting, you know,


the testimony itself was simply, do you have a fear


because of exposure to asbestos now that you have


asbestosis.  They didn't even ask the question whether the


fear arises out of the asbestosis.


QUESTION:  Did you ask questions about the


causation theory that you're now espousing?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  Our argument, Justice


Souter, was that fear of cancer is too unrelated, as a


matter of law, to be an element of pain and suffering.


QUESTION:  Okay, but I take it your argument is


that the mere fact that there is an association between


asbestosis and a higher risk of developing cancer,


depending on whether you smoke and so on, is not enough of


an association to support a -- in effect, a separate


element of damages for fear of cancer?

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  What is your authority for that?  In


other words, you're saying there's got to be some kind of


a different, or more intense causal relationship than


simply this association that can statistically be shown.


MR. PHILLIPS:  I think --


QUESTION:  What's the basis for that?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Buckley, frankly, is as close to


anything on that score, because Buckley says even if you


accept as an article of faith, as I think the Court did,


that each of those individuals who'd been exposed to


asbestos felt that he or she would be more seriously at


risk --


QUESTION: 


Did they have asbestosis? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  No, none of the --


QUESTION:  No --


MR. PHILLIPS:  No.


QUESTION:  -- they didn't, and the point here


is that there is proof of asbestosis, and there is a


statistical showing that you don't deny, I think, of a


higher degree of risk, what -- however the causal chain


works -- which associates asbestosis with fear of cancer,


so this is not a Buckley situation, and my question is,


why isn't that statistical association sufficient to


ground an instruction allowing for compensation for fear

that results from this association?


MR. PHILLIPS:  There are two answers to that,


Justice Souter.  In the first place, the -- there is no


strong common law doctrine that says that those -- that


that kind of a disconnect between the damages is a core


element of what the common law routinely grants for --


QUESTION:  Well, you call it disconnect, he


calls it a connect.  What it is, there is, I take it, an


undenied statistical association between asbestosis and a


probability of developing cancer --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- and that's the basis for the claim


of the fear.  Why is that inconsistent with a common law


theory of pain and suffering damages?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the core of the pain and


suffering -- the pain and suffering theory is that it is a


fright that emanates directly out of the particular


condition you have, which is asbestosis.


QUESTION:  All right, if you want to use that


kind of terminology, I don't see why you haven't got it


here.  The reason these people are worried is that they've


got asbestosis, and people with asbestosis have a higher


chance of developing cancer.  Isn't that enough out of, in


your terms?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  Even if you accept that

premise, Justice Souter, you still have to confront the


overall policies of the Federal Employers Liability Act,


and the question of whether not allowing a recovery that


might otherwise be legitimate -- and that is precisely


what the Court said --


QUESTION:  So, are you saying that even if the


common law allowed it, we should not allow it under the


act, or the act doesn't allow it?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I don't think the common


law clearly allows it.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Have you got any authority for


that proposition --


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, because --


QUESTION:  -- that an association between these


two conditions is insufficient to support a damage award?


MR. PHILLIPS:  There are lower court -- we cite


the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions, the Eleventh


Circuit decisions -- there are decisions out there that


have said we're not going to allow fear of cancer in cases


involving asbestosis, but I --


QUESTION:  Well, there does appear to be a


minority of jurisdictions that have said -- and have


held -- that you have to show as a plaintiff in a case


like this a verifiable causal nexus between cancer and the


injury suffered in cases where you're dealing with

exposure to a hazardous material.  That -- maybe that's a


reasonable requirement, but it appears to be a minority


view.  Are you suggesting that we should adopt that here?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I'm not asking you to -- I


don't think the answer to this case resides in the common


law, because I think the common law is essentially a


muddle.  There are cases on both sides.


QUESTION:  Well, are you -- do you think we


should adopt an interpretation of FELA that says there has


to be some verifiable causal nexus?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Absolutely, Justice O'Connor, and


the reason to do that --


QUESTION:  Do you acknowledge that that is a


view that is generally a minority view in the country? 

MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- I -- I'll concede that it is


a minority view in the sense that there are maybe five


cases on one side --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and three or four on the


other.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. PHILLIPS:  This is not an area that's been


litigated sufficiently to be able to say where the trends


are.


QUESTION:  It may make sense, but I just want to

know where we are here.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Well, I've only got two


or three cases that identify it in the context -- the way


you just did, Justice O'Connor, and my colleague on the


other side will identify four or five cases that don't


impose that requirement, but what remains absolutely


critical in the analysis of this case, I think, is the


core policy that this Court identified in Gottshall and in


Buckley that says if you don't have a clear answer from


the common law, you have to look to see whether or not


this particular damages remedy creates the possibility of


unpredictable and unlimited damages, and that's the reason


why the Court needs to adopt a more restrictive view of


the standard to be applied under the Federal Employers 

Liability Act.


That may not be the rule that would be required


as a matter of common law in any particular State, but


under FELA, the notion that you're going to create


unlimited liability in circumstances in which the


plaintiffs are allowed significantly reduced requirements


in order to prove the basis for their claim suggests that


this Court has consistently taken the position that it


must cut back and not allow on a category basis -- on a


categorical basis -- not allow damages to extend to --


QUESTION:  But what -- I mean, what -- unlimited

damages, I don't know what you want us to do.  What if the


statistical chance of your getting cancer if you have


asbestosis is -- is your chances are doubled.  Would that


be enough to create the kind of a fear that we could allow


damages for it?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, I don't think so --


QUESTION:  I see.


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  What if it's 90 percent certain that


if you have developed asbestosis, you will develop cancer?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that would be a different


case.  I think once you get past more likely than not --


QUESTION:  Okay, so it's somewhere between 50


and 90 percent?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I think when you get past more


likely than not that you will incur cancer, there is a


risk, then at that point -- but remember, the flip side of


this is the two-disease rule, and that's an important


element in how the Court ought to analyze this problem,


because not only -- by allowing fear of cancer damages


now, you essentially say to the world, the sky is the


limit, inconsistent with what the Court said in Gottshall


and Buckley.


The flip side is, if you don't allow the fear of


cancer damages now, but allow fear of -- but allow the

plaintiff to come back after he or she contracts cancer


and allows as a part of that recovery for fear of cancer,


then the people who are most seriously injured are made


whole at the appropriate time in the appropriate


circumstances.


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, I know your light is


on, but there's a second question and you haven't even


talked about it, the joint and several liability --


MR. PHILLIPS:  The apportionment.


QUESTION:  -- the apportionment.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  And I wasn't sure that there was any


support in the statute or in the evidence at trial here


for how some apportionment should have been made. 

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the quick answer on


apportionment is that in 1908, it was absolutely clear


there was several liability.  You're only liable for the


injuries you cause.  That's embodied, I think, in the


statutory language that says that the railroad is


responsible for the injuries while employed.  That


language has been interpreted as recognizing we only pay


for the things that we cause.


The Third Restatement --


QUESTION:  Cause in whole or in part?


MR. PHILLIPS:  But that goes to the question of


19

25

what you need to show a jury in order to get a negligence


claim to the jury in the first instance.  It doesn't say


you're -- you're liable for the entirety of the damages in


whole or in part.


QUESTION:  It could be read to say that.


MR. PHILLIPS:  It could, but I don't think


that's the most natural reading of that particular


language, and I don't think it's an appropriate one where


the policies in 1908, and the policies of the law under


the Third Restatement quite clearly say that you should


apportion, because that is the fair way in order to ensure


that a defendant is not -- does not -- is not forced to


overcompensate.


QUESTION: 


It's really a question of who should 

bear the burden of bringing in those other people.  If


it's joint and several, you could join other people.  On


your view, you say to the plaintiff, "Unless, plaintiff,


you bring in all these other people, you can only get a


small piece from any particular one."


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, and I think the statute


and the existing common law clearly suggest that the right


answer is that because you've reduced the burden of the


plaintiff in order to get into court and to be able to


make a case, the quid pro quo for that ought to be that


you only hold the railroad liable for the amount of the

injury it caused, and here it is not contested that -- and


Mr. Butler's case is the prototype example of it -- he had


three months of exposure when he was with Norfolk &


Western, he had 30 years of exposure with others.  That is


a reasonable basis on which to apportion for cause, and


that -- and no one has contested that.


I'd reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Phillips.


Mr. Salmons, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. SALMONS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Respondents may not recover damages under FELA


for their anxiety about developing cancer in the future as


part of their emotional injuries from the separate disease


of asbestosis.  The overwhelming majority of courts that


have considered the relationship between asbestosis and


cancer have concluded that they are separate diseases that


result in separate injuries to the plaintiff --


QUESTION:  May I ask in that --


MR. SALMONS:  -- and give rise to separate --


QUESTION:  May I ask this question?  I really


wanted to ask it of Mr. Phillips, but his time was running

out.  Would you draw a distinction between a case in which


the asbestosis actually is a cause of cancer, as opposed


to a case like this, in which asbestos and cancer --


asbestosis and cancer -- are the result of a common cause?


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I do think there would


be a difference between those two instances.  Here, the


Court can look to the evolving tort law principles in


cases involving asbestos, where the overwhelming majority


of courts have concluded they are, indeed, separate


diseases with no causal connection between them only in


the sense that they both stem from the same exposure --


QUESTION:  -- that in this


MR. SALMONS:  -- to asbestos.


QUESTION: 


that in this case, then, if it were 

true, which I understand it is not, that the asbestosis


itself is a contributing cause to cancer, that then there


would be liability?


MR. SALMONS:  Well, Your Honor, I think that --


you know -- the Court may still need to look at what


type -- what exactly the causal connection is -- and it


would still need to take into account both the text and


the purposes of FELA, and -- and in particular, the


concern --


QUESTION:  But taking all those things into


account, what do you do in a case in which the cancer is a

result of the asbestosis rather than the result of a


common source? 


MR. SALMONS:  I -- I do think, Your Honor, that


if -- that if the cancer, in fact, results directly from


the disease of asbestosis, then that puts you more


directly in the category of pain and suffering damages


that would be available traditionally in tort law, and


that probably would be recoverable there, but --


QUESTION:  Why --


QUESTION:  Isn't that a jury question?  Do we


know for sure that the one does not lead to the other?


MR. SALMONS:  I do think, Your Honor, that this


Court can look to the experience of courts that have


considered the relationship between the two diseases, and 

have adopted legal rules to govern the disposition of


these claims, and have concluded that they are separate


diseases that result in separate injuries and give rise to


separate causes of action, and I think this Court can look


to that and -- and -- and can conclude that as a matter of


law both because of --


QUESTION:  Do the respondents agree with you on


that factual point?


MR. SALMONS:  That the majority of courts have


concluded --


QUESTION:  No -- no, that -- that asbestosis

does not lead to cancer, but rather, is -- is produced by


the same -- by the same cause that produces cancer?


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I do think that the


respondents have taken that position in this case.  On


page 20 of their brief, they say that the relationship


between asbestosis and cancer is two-fold.


First, the asbestosis confirms the extent and


severity of the initial exposure to asbestos which, of


course, under Buckley is not a separate injury or impact


that can give rise to liability under FELA, and second,


that they both -- both the cancer and the asbestosis would


result from the same negligent conduct of the defendant,


but I do not read respondents to be alleging in this Court


that there is any causal relationship between cancer and 

asbestosis in terms of asbestosis actually turning into


cancer.


There may be a correlation, but you know,


that -- the reasonableness of the fears is really not the


question.


QUESTION:  The question I had is, if there is a


causal correlation, if 50 percent of the people who have


contracted asbestosis as a result of exposure to asbestos


will also contract cancer, why does that matter?  That's


what I didn't quite see.


MR. SALMONS:  I -- I think --

QUESTION:  Because I understand -- I think you


do correctly state their -- they agree with you on the


facts on this.


MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think that in


terms of -- of the existing tort law principles that, as


this Court noted in Gottshall, and even prior to that


around the time of the enactment of FELA, that pain and


suffering damages are limited to those damages that flow


directly from the injury that allows you to sue, and


that --


QUESTION:  But both of those cases were a self-


standing claim of emotional distress.  It wasn't pinned to


any existing injuries.


Here, the difference, and at least as portrayed 

by the judge who made it part of pain and suffering, is


you do have an injury, you have the asbestosis, and one of


the elements of damages is pain and suffering, and this is


included in pain and suffering.  At least that's the way


the judge saw it, as distinguished from Buckley and


Gottshall, which were self-standing claims of emotional


distress not tied to any preexisting injury.


MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor, that is the way


the court below approached the question.  We think the


problem with that is that, as the overwhelming majority of


courts that have considered the issue of the relationship

between the diseases have concluded, they are separate


diseases that result in separate injuries and separate


causes of action, and the test of FELA --


QUESTION:  But doesn't it matter what form --


I'm familiar with one of those cases, and that was the


question --


MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- when does the statute of


limitations start to run when you get the virulent form of


cancer?  Does it begin to run when you got the asbestosis,


because that should have tipped you off and you should


have sued then?


The answer in that context, and there are many


courts that say that cancer is a separate claim, is not 

necessarily what it should be in this context.


MR. SALMONS:  We do think it is instructive,


however, Your Honor, and that's particularly true because


FELA provides for liability -- to any person suffering


injury while employed -- for such injury, and we think,


consistent with the text of that statute, which limits the


employer's liability to the injury that's actually


suffered, and not the fear of suffering a future -- injury


in the future -- that the rule we are propounding today is


the most consistent with that text and the most consistent


with the purposes and -- and policy considerations this

Court articulated in both Gottshall and Buckley, and in


particular --


QUESTION:  You did say -- you said in your brief


that it's a question of not whether, but when, because


when you get cancer, if you get cancer, you get the


damages for past, present, and future pain and suffering,


but that's not quite right, is it, because you are leaving


out the category of person who has asbestosis and never


gets cancer, which will be most of these people?  Those


people -- for them, it is a question of whether, not when,


right?


MR. SALMONS:  It is true, Your Honor, that


people who now have asbestosis and fear getting cancer in


the future may never get cancer. 


In fact, the 

overwhelming number of them won't get cancer --


QUESTION:  And then they --


MR. SALMONS:  But --


QUESTION:  -- they never -- they can never


collect for this alleged fear.


MR. SALMONS:  That is true, Your Honor, and


that's also true for the snowmen of Metro-North that were


at issue in Buckley.  The Court -- this Court did not say,


though, their fears were not reasonable.  In fact, the


court of appeals in that case had found that they were.


What this Court said was, they didn't fit within

the common law categories that allowed recovery because


the exposure itself was not an impact or injury, and our


position is that while the asbestosis gives them an


ability to sue for their injuries related to that


asbestosis, they cannot reach back to that initial


exposure and recover the damages that were precluded in


Buckley, namely --


QUESTION:  But here -- here we've got something


more.  We've got the proof that this is a serious risk,


and that proof consists of the fact that asbestosis has,


in fact, developed.


MR. SALMONS:  That is correct, and they can


recover for all of their harms related directly to that


asbestosis, but our position is they can't recover for 

their fears of the future disease of cancer --


QUESTION:  I know that that's your position, but


once we cross that threshold, as we have in this case --


the threshold that shows that the fear is, in fact, a


serious one, because at least asbestosis has now


developed, why isn't their fear of cancer just as


reasonable whether that fear rests upon the fact that in


10 percent of asbestosis cases, the asbestosis progresses


to cancer -- which isn't true -- or, on the other hand, in


the same percentage of asbestosis cases, cancer will also


develop as a result of the common cause for which the

employer is liable?


Why is the fear any less reasonable in either of


those cases?


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, with respect, we don't


think the question is whether their fears are reasonable,


but their question is whether their fears are recoverable


at this time.


QUESTION:  Well, I know that, and one of the


questions we want to know in determining whether recovery


is possible is whether the fear is reasonable.


MR. SALMONS:  And we do not --


QUESTION:  One threshold test that we all agree


on is, the fear has at least got to be confirmed by some


physical manifestation. 
 Okay, we've got this here. 

Once the physical manifestation is shown, why is


reasonable fear -- why should reasonable fear -- not be


enough for recovery, whether the causal connection goes


from asbestosis to cancer, or common cause to cancer?


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, we think that one of


the primary reasons why it should not be enough -- that


reasonableness of the fear should not be enough in and of


itself -- even assuming for a moment that the statistics


that are at -- that were in evidence here are, in fact,


sufficiently conclusive to draw those assumptions -- I


mean, I do think it's important to remember that this

Court in Buckley referred to these same types of figures


as being uncertain and controversial, and I think that


that description is probably still true here.


But the purposes and policies of FELA, which


this Court recognized in Buckley, and in particular the


fear that plaintiffs with relatively minor injuries now


will come into court being drawn by the opportunity to get


front-loaded, significant damages for future harms, will


end up frustrating the system, and will end up hurting the


plaintiffs that in fact develop cancer later, and I think


that this case implicates those policies and concerns of


FELA and tort law generally just as much as was the case


in Buckley, that the vast majority, the number of people


that will actually get cancer in the future is relatively 

low, and there is a significant risk --

MR. SALMONS:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Lazarus, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. LAZARUS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The only issue raised by the first question


presented in the cert petition is whether the trial


court's jury instruction correctly described the legal

standard for when a physically injured plaintiff can


recover for related emotional distress injury, and the


sufficiency of the evidence and the jury's application of


that legal standard to the evidence at trial is not one of


the questions presented in this case, and it is quite


clear that the --


QUESTION:  Well, the question presented doesn't


speak in terms of the instruction, as I read it.


MR. LAZARUS:  No, but the question poses a pure


question of law, and that is whether, when you have a


physical injury, what the relationship has to be between


the emotional distress and the physical injury, and our


argument, Your Honor, is that under traditional tort law,


it is not required that the emotional stress immediately 

accompany the physical injury; that it have its own


physical manifestations; that it be severe.


Tort law, as this Court explained in the Metro-


North case, approaches the recovery for emotional distress


injury from a categorical perspective, and tort law


categorically distinguishes between two different


situations.


First, the situation where one has a stand-


alone claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress


where the emotional injury itself the element of the


offense, the injury element, and second, the so-called

parasitic damage context, where there is a threshold


physical injury which supplies the essential element, and


what many courts do is they impose very significant


limitations on the recovery of emotional distress in the


stand-alone context such as physical manifestations,


immediacy, and severity, but --


QUESTION:  And you say this case is not brought


on this theory?


MR. LAZARUS:  The jury instruction is reproduced


on page 573 of the joint appendix.


QUESTION:  Where do we -- 573?


MR. LAZARUS:  573 on the joint appendix, and


that jury instruction makes it absolutely clear that


respondents were entitled to recover for their reasonable 

fear of cancer as part of their overall damages only to


the extent that that fear related to -- the Court's


words -- related to proven physical injury, and there is


absolutely no merit to petitioner's argument --


QUESTION:  Do some jurisdictions go further


these days and require there be a reasonable causal nexus?


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, almost no


jurisdictions do.  There are really only two cases --


QUESTION:  I thought there were a few that did.


MR. LAZARUS:  But almost all the cases go the


other way, and the reason, Your Honor, is because --

20

21

22

23

25

there's some confusion in petitioner's argument here about


what "pain and suffering" means.  If you look at the jury


instruction very closely on page 573, the trial judge in


this case was very careful, knew exactly what he was


doing.


In the paragraph right before the "fear of


cancer" paragraph, he refers to the entitlement of a


physically injured plaintiff to recover for physical and


mental pain and suffering.  In the next paragraph, where


he refers to reasonable fear of cancer, he refers only to


mental pain and suffering, and this is a longstanding


distinction in tort law.  Physical pain and suffering is


the kind of pain which is immediate and intimately


associated with the bodily injury.


QUESTION:  All that is true, what you say, but I


felt the question was open, and the reason that I thought


it was open is because probably I once learned that this


area of the law arose out of an English case where


somebody is watching a coffin fall off in an accident, and


the rule was that you can't recover unless something hits


you, but what you were recovering for was the coffin, and


the pain and suffering that a family member would feel.


MR. LAZARUS:  Right.


QUESTION:  That was immediate, directly related


to the accident, and quite clearly present and measurable.

MR. LAZARUS:  Right.


QUESTION:  This is the kind of thing that is not


immediate.  It's a fear of something way in the future. 


It is very hard to determine whether it is right or wrong,


and it has no causal relation to the physical thing, and


therefore, I thought that it's open.


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, it's really --


QUESTION:  You want to say -- I'll look it up,


but if you were to say it's absolutely not open, I mean,


they have, you know, lots of briefs where they've made a


pretty good case it's at least open.


MR. LAZARUS:  It's open and shut.


QUESTION:  Oh, all right.


(Laughter.)


MR. LAZARUS:  If one looks to the Restatement of


Torts, section 456, which ascribed -- well-settled, widely


applied, and it describes the circumstances when a


physically injured plaintiff can recover for related


emotional distress injuries.  It fits this case, and it


includes in comment c, it expressly denies the validity of


their physical manifestation requirements --


QUESTION:  No.  I mean, you saw their reply


brief, and their reply briefed that is that the underlined


phrase -- the italicized phrase -- or from conduct which


causes it, is not really what's at issue.  What's issue

are the words in that called "emotional disturbance," and


the question is, what kind of emotional --


MR. LAZARUS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- disturbance, and I think that


their argument is, which if I put numbers on it is, each


one of us in this room has 1 in 4 chance that we will die


of cancer, and the difference between us and a plaintiff


in this case is that he has a 1 in -- 1 in 5 -- 1 in 5 --


wait -- We have 1 in 5, 1 in 5 and he has 1 in 4, and what


they're saying is, I think, that the difference between a


1 in 5 chance of dying of cancer, and a difference of 1 in


4 chance of dying of cancer is intangible -- hard to


measure in anyone's psychology.  Nobody really makes such


distinctions rational, and therefore don't open this up to 

juries awarding large amounts of money.


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, one really can't in


the beginning start to entertain their evidence that


they've introduced which wasn't part of the trial record


in this case.  The trial record --


QUESTION:  No, I don't think their evidence is


relevant.


MR. LAZARUS:  Right.


QUESTION:  I would say this is a question that's


being put to us as a matter of law.


MR. LAZARUS:  Right.


QUESTION:  And it is up to us to look at the


35 

numbers.


MR. LAZARUS:  Right.


QUESTION:  And in reaching those numbers I gave


you, I've assumed everything in your favor.  That is, it's


really -- because you're a railroad and not the kind of


thing that was involved in the studies you cite -- it


could be a lot less than what I say, but it's not going to


be more.


MR. LAZARUS:  Well, actually, it may well be


more, but let's put that aside.  What is quite clear, Your


Honor, as this Court explained in the Metro-North case, is


that just because there are background risks, that doesn't


mean that one can't have a reasonable apprehension based 

on an increased risk.


For instance, it is 100 percent sure, Your


Honor, that every one of us in this room will die.  We


have a background risk.  But the fact that someone through


negligent conduct causes us a physical injury which


increases our risk of dying sooner does not mean we can


recover for that.


And the place to look in the Restatement of


Torts, Your Honor, to see that this is a classic thing


that one can recover for, if you look to section 456, you


look to comment c, and then it referenced comment -- it

referenced Restatement section 905, and Restatement -- and


it says that when you have a physical injury, then it


triggers the whole panoply of emotional distress injuries,


and section 905 of the Restatement of Torts describes what


is encompassed by "emotional distress," and comment e


describes how it goes, as always, to fear, anxiety,


apprehension of future consequences.


QUESTION:  Mr. Lazarus --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Lazarus, what if you put a


physician on the stand, and the physician says, this man


was 25 years old when he was injured, he ordinarily would


be expected to live to be 75, but as a result of this


injury he's only going to live to be 72?  Now, is that the


sort of thing that's compensable?


MR. LAZARUS:  Well, Your Honor, I don't know. 


I don't know -- I don't doubt, Your Honor, that in tort


law, that there is a level of probability of risk below


which one can say as a matter of law there's not a


reasonable apprehension.  I don't think, though, in this


case, first of all, that there's any question that


statistics support a reasonable apprehension, but even


more importantly, the question whether they do or don't in


this case is not one of the issues here.  The issue is


whether that's enough.  The issue is whether you --

point -- let's for a moment not think of ourselves as


lawyers.  Here are two people, the person in Buckley, the


snowman, and the person who has asbestosis, both of those


people may have a real fear of cancer, and we may find


them credible witnesses.


I thought in the Buckley situation that one


concern is, it's too easy to make this up, and for some


people facing that risk, they'll say, "Well, yeah, I might


be run over tomorrow, it doesn't bother me."  Isn't the


real problem that the fear of something, when that fear


doesn't have the physical manifestation, that these things


are too easy to make up, too uncontrollable, and I frankly


can't see the difference from the point of view of a


sufferer between the person in Buckley and the person 

here.


The person in the Grand Central Station case


could say "I had the same fear that that person has.  He


hasn't proved his fear any more than I proved mine, why


should he recover and not me?"


MR. LAZARUS:  Well, Your Honor, because as the


Court, I think, explained quite well in Buckley, the way


tort law approaches the question is on a categorical basis


and distinguishes between those with physical injury,


because if you have that threshold physical injury, that


gives you the corroborating evidence you need that you

have, now, a legitimate plaintiff -- a legitimate


plaintiff -- who has established their cause of action. 


You're not adding new cases to the docket, and even more


importantly, as the court has --


QUESTION:  Well, what's more legitimate -- and


there was no doubt about the conditions under which the


people worked in Grand Central Station -- that they were


exposed to asbestos, that they should have been told much


earlier about their exposure, and they must have been very


angry that they weren't told.


MR. LAZARUS:  Well, Your Honor, first of all,


those who have asbestosis, as the trial record in this


case referred, those with asbestosis have a statistically


higher significance of getting the other kinds of cancers, 

because what -- it's not just a mere exposure, unimpaired,


and what the asbestosis requirement does by requiring that


kind of serious physical injury is, as everyone


understood, and the rail industry argued in Metro-North,


it dramatically limits the number of --


QUESTION:  Well, is there --


MR. LAZARUS:  -- possible plaintiffs.


QUESTION:  Mr. Lazarus, is their increased


chance of cancer because they have asbestosis, or because


the asbestosis originates from their exposure to asbestos,


and it's the exposure to asbestos, not the asbestosis,

that will cause cancer?


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, we do not know, and no


one knows, whether the asbestosis itself transforms itself


into cancer.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- then you do challenge the


statement by your opponents that asbestosis itself cannot


change into cancer?


MR. LAZARUS:  No, Your Honor, their own


experts --


QUESTION:  Well, no, now, wait a minute --


MR. LAZARUS:  Yes.  Yes.  I --


QUESTION:  -- I asked you a question.  What's


the answer?


MR. LAZARUS:  -- I do. 


I do challenge that. 

QUESTION:  You do challenge that?


MR. LAZARUS:  Their own expert, Your Honor, on


page 470 of the joint appendix, Dr. Renn -- their


expert -- testified on page 470 that one could not


contract lung cancer from exposure to asbestos until one


had asbestosis.


We're willing to admit that the science is more


unclear that asbestos -- whether it actually transforms


itself or not, we don't know, and we don't think as a


matter of law it's necessary.  It was their expert at


trial who testified that actually to get lung cancer from

asbestos exposure, it was a necessary prerequisite to


first have asbestosis.  We think --


QUESTION:  Well, can I ask you one other --


QUESTION:  That question wasn't put to the jury. 


I mean, the fact is that the jury was not required to find


that the fear was a fear that the asbestosis would turn


into cancer.


MR. LAZARUS:  That's absolutely right, Your


Honor.  We -- and we think that was not an error in the


jury instructions.  There's many cases out there -- let me


refer to this one case, a case they cite in their reply


brief on page 2 --


QUESTION:  Why wouldn't that be error?  I mean,


the instruction does say that a plaintiff who's 

demonstrated that he's developed a reasonable fear of


cancer related to the proven physical injury from asbestos


can be compensated for the fear.


MR. LAZARUS:  Right, and it has to be related to


the proven physical injury, and it was in this case.


If I can give the example --


QUESTION:  But it's so -- in the same


instruction the court says, you cannot award damages for


cancer or any increased risk of cancer.


MR. LAZARUS:  Right, Your Honor, and that's


where the court got it actually --

QUESTION:  Which is so contradictory.


MR. LAZARUS:  No.  No, it's not, Your Honor. 


What the court is doing here is exactly what courts do who


adopt the separate disease rule which says, you can only


recover for your present injuries now, and you can't


recover for future injuries.  The cancer itself, or the


risk, is a future injury.


QUESTION:  I was going to ask this.  What if one


of these -- if you prevail, and then one of these


plaintiffs develops cancer, I assume he can go in and sue


again?


MR. LAZARUS:  That's right, yes, for the cancer.


QUESTION:  All right.  Is there some kind of a


discount now for the fear that he --


MR. LAZARUS:  No, no, just like there are


separate causes of action for assault and battery.  Those


are two different injuries.  The apprehension of something


is a separate injury, and for these plaintiffs -- the


respondents -- it is a current --


QUESTION:  So the fear that you're going to die


of cancer is compensable before you get it, and it's


compensable again after you get it?


MR. LAZARUS:  No.  No.  The fear would not be --


the cancer would be --

MR. LAZARUS:  I -- sorry, I wasn't -- if you've


recovered once, you aren't going to be allowed to recover


again.


first --


QUESTION:  So there would be a discount.


MR. LAZARUS:  Yes.  If you'd brought the


QUESTION:  All right.  So then your first answer


was, you changed it from --


MR. LAZARUS:  I'm sorry.  I thought your


question was whether they could recover for cancer in the


second one.  I didn't understand you were referring to --


QUESTION:  Do we have cases in the law where you


give discounts for the first verdict?


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, I'm not sure.  I don't


think this issue has come up, but I don't think it's a bar


to the recovery here.


If I can refer to the radiation burn case that


they referred to on page 2 of the reply brief --


QUESTION:  Well, but it indicates that maybe the


recovery now is problematic.


MR. LAZARUS:  No, Your Honor, it's not


problematic, because we have a present injury, and where


you have a present physical injury and you have a present


emotional injury, an apprehension based on that, those are

two types of injuries.


QUESTION:  Well, don't you think that emotional


fear ought to be one that is reasonable?


MR. LAZARUS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And a causal nexus there between the


asbestosis and the fear?


MR. LAZARUS:  Well, Your Honor, we do think


there is a causal nexus --


QUESTION:  There should be, shouldn't there?


MR. LAZARUS:  We -- but we do think there's a


causal nexus here, and under the Restatement of Torts, all


right, there are two different possible causal nexus under


section 456 of the Restatement.  We actually think both of


those are met, and that is, we think that the fear is 

caused by the physical injury.  It's also caused by the


same negligent conduct, but that is also a sufficiency of


the evidence question, and what they are positing here is


what the legal standard should be for physically injured


plaintiffs and the recovery for related emotional stress


harm.


An example, the Anderson case they cite on


page 2 of their reply brief -- a radiation burn case --


which they say is distinct from this case.  It's exactly


the same as this case.

bite cases support you, and the radiation cases support


you, and if it's cut-and-dried, as you say, then you win.


But if, when I look at all this stuff again, and


I come to the conclusion -- if I were to come to the


conclusion that it wasn't cut-and-dried, then I'm much


more at sea, and I want you to see why.


One was the reason I gave, which is the risk


problems, and the other, which is driving that, and I'd


just like you to comment on this, is -- is my concern that


if we begin to compensate people for fear of small changes


in risks when the law doesn't -- is open on the point --


what will happen in the asbestos cases, and that was their


initial point, is that we will -- there's $200 billion at


stake, and the fund will run dry.


When the people who really get the cancer come


into court, the cupboard will be bare, and I think that's


a serious policy problem, and it's worrying me quite a


lot, and that's why I keep coming back to the open nature


of this.


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, I think that the way


to address that kind of issue is not to change decades of


settled tort --


QUESTION:  Well, I say, is there any answer --


MR. LAZARUS:  Yes, there is.

clear --


MR. LAZARUS:  There is.  There is --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. LAZARUS:  -- and what can be done in a case


like that is, the defendant in that case can request a


verdict form which requires the jury to allocate out, and


that would allow a judge and an appellate, if appropriate,


to review, and jury trials --


QUESTION:  Yes, but --


MR. LAZARUS:  -- trials, it happens all the


time.


QUESTION:  -- that isn't automatic in most


jurisdictions, Mr. Lazarus.  You can't say "I want a


special verdict," and if the court says "No, I don't think 

I'll give you one," that's pretty much the end of it,


isn't it?


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, they didn't request


one here, but that is the proper way to address the issue,


and that's why you see --


QUESTION:  I don't understand what you're


saying.  What -- allocate out -- how does that -- the


money is still paid to this claimant, so that when the


person who actually has cancer comes into court, this


company is bankrupt.

Justice Breyer's concern, and that is, it allows you to


have a record upon which one can make sure that the jury


hasn't awarded a disproportionate amount based upon this


one element, that you don't have the tail wagging the dog.


QUESTION:  But what's disproportionate?


QUESTION:  What's disproportionate?


QUESTION:  Suppose you take one plaintiff who is


very nervous, very apprehensive, and for that person this


increased risk --


QUESTION:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- is going to be much more


aggravated.  Then, take another person who's subject to


the same risk, but has a thicker skin and says, "Well,


I'll take it in stride."


MR. LAZARUS:  Well, Your Honor, it's a


reasonable apprehension.  This is why there's an objective


standard which applies to emotional recovery which doesn't


require the physical.  It has to meet an objective


standard.


If someone has a very, very thick skin in tort


law and they, in fact, as a result of that, don't suffer


damage, then they haven't suffered damage.  If they have a


very, very, very thin skin, and they suffer a lot of


damage, then they don't recover everything --

MR. LAZARUS:  -- unless it's a reasonable


apprehension.


QUESTION:  If a person gets cancer -- and I take


it you agree with the Government that such a person could


get past, present, and future anxiety as part of pain and


suffering, but suppose that person had earlier had


asbestos, and then brings his claim for lung cancer,


couldn't -- if you prevail today -- the defendant say


"Well, at least for the apprehension in the past, you know


you're precluded, because you could have brought that


claim when you got asbestosis"?


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, that might be


possible.  That is not an issue which has been addressed


here before this Court, and I haven't looked at the issue 

preclusion there between the two.


What is clear is, if you have a current physical


injury --


QUESTION:  It would be claim preclusion.


MR. LAZARUS:  Yes, right, and it's not an issue


which has been briefed here, because I think that when you


have a case like this with a present physical injury, and


you have a present emotional injury based on that, or as


this Court has actually said in Metro-North, related to


the physical injury, that's sufficient.

issue, with the Court's --


QUESTION:  Before you do, may I ask one --


QUESTION:  Let me ask one -- please.


QUESTION:  Just one quick question.  Do you


agree with Mr. Phillips' appraisal of the facts as -- we


should assume that the fear of cancer was the major


element of damages?


MR. LAZARUS:  No, Your Honor.  All one has to


assume here is that there was sufficient evidence that a


reasonable jury could give some money based on fear of


cancer, not that they had to, and not, certainly, that


they gave $4.4 million, just sufficient evidence that a


reasonable jury could have given a dollar, or some money. 


That's all that would be necessary.


The second -- sorry.


QUESTION:  Was there testimony here that


plaintiff A had heavy, or severe asbestosis and


plaintiff B had mild, and was it based on any lung X-rays


to show that this person's very badly infected and the


other wasn't?


MR. LAZARUS:  Yes, Your Honor.  There is --


there's lots of record evidence in this case to establish


the asbestosis and how there may have been different


degrees of asbestosis.


QUESTION:  All right, and since that's dependent

on dosage, why isn't this a case in which we can apportion


causation?


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, for very simple a


reason.  The first reason is that we think that FELA


itself on its face actually directs there to be joint and


several liability when you have single injuries.  That's


our first argument, that FELA on its face answers the


question, or that FELA provides that the railroad should


be liable, quote, "for such injury or death resulting in


whole or in part from the negligence of the railroad."


QUESTION:  Correct me if I'm wrong, is it a


principle of tort law that if causation can be


apportioned, that the injury is -- that there is then


several liability on that tort --


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  -- or am I wrong about that?


MR. LAZARUS:  No.  The background principle of


the common law of torts here is that there are -- if there


is a single injury, then there is joint and several


liability unless there's a reasonable basis for


apportionment.  Our threshold argument --


QUESTION:  And since asbestosis is peculiarly


related to dosage and exposure, why isn't that a proper


ground for apportionment here?


MR. LAZARUS:  Assuming that FELA doesn't answer

21

22

the question, let me answer it based upon the common law. 


Because the plaintiff has the burden -- sorry, the


defendant -- petitioner has the burden in that case to


establish 1) what the doses were, and 2) what the dose


relationship was, and the one thing we know here, the


prototype example that Mr. Phillips referred to is


Mr. Butler, and the fact is that Mr. Butler apparently


worked for three months exposed to asbestos for


petitioner, and for many, many years exposed to asbestos


at other workplaces.


While we don't know what the dose relationship


is, Your Honor, we do know for the record the one thing


the dose relationship isn't is time.  One can't compare


one time to another. 


Let me tell you why we know that. 

On page 420 of the joint appendix, their expert testified


that one is far more likely to contract asbestosis from


high concentrations over a short period of time than low


concentrations over a long period of time, and there's a


reason for that.


As Dr. Brody explains on page 87 of the joint


appendix, the lungs can naturally rid themselves of the


fibers at the low concentrations.  It's only at the high


concentrations -- the macrophages.  It's only at the high


concentrations that the lungs can't rid themselves of the


fibers.

21

22

23

24

25

While we have no idea how low the concentration


levels were at these other workplaces, we do know how high


the concentrations levels were at petitioner's workplace,


because Mr. Butler testified on page 249 of the joint


appendix that during those three months, he worked in the


location of petitioner's workplace where the asbestos


concentrations were at the highest.  Mr. Butler testified


that he worked in the room where the engines were stripped


of their fibers, and more fibers were placed on.


He testifies on page 249 he looks at these same


pictures, which were trial exhibits -- they're reproduced


in our brief.  He looks at these pictures and he says,


yes, that's the kind of room I worked in.  This is 249


and 250. 
 Yes, that's the kind of exposure I faced. 

QUESTION:  Well --


MR. LAZARUS:  So we know he had the very high


concentrations --


QUESTION:  Well now, how do we know that? 


You're saying he worked in the place with the highest


concentrations so far as the railroad is concerned, but


how do we know how that compares with where he worked


elsewhere?


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, we have no idea, and


they -- because they never introduced or sought to


introduce any evidence, but what we do know is that very

low concentrations -- here we can turn to the Rand report,


which they filed with this Court -- lodged with the


Court --just two weeks ago.  The Rand report and the


testimony of this case makes absolutely clear that in low


concentration employment centers, at low concentration


exposures, one is very unlikely to have any kind of


physical injury, asbestosis or cancer ever develop, which


is why there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of


plaintiffs, many of which come from low exposure, which,


as the Rand report makes clear, is not likely to lead to


any kind of disease.  We have no idea how low it was here. 


We know how high it was here.


I have no doubt, Your Honor, that petitioner


would have been very hard-pressed at trial to actually 

show what the doses were, and to show what the dose


relationship is, but what I do know is, whatever their


reason was at trial for never trying to introduce this


evidence, and they never -- if you looked at their motion,


where they made the motion for this jury instruction, they


never even remotely suggest what the basis for


apportionment would be, but whatever their strategic


reason for doing that at trial, what is absolutely clear


is they are not allowed in the first instance to come to


the United States Supreme Court and proffer newspaper


articles, magazine articles, selected journal articles and

try to argue that there is a reasonable basis for


apportionment, or they're entitled to a remand to litigate


a issue which they failed to litigate in the first


instance.


The simple truth, Your Honor, is that at trial


in this case the respondents established all of their


essential elements of their negligent cause of action. 


They established their physical injury, and they received


a jury award which certainly, compared to the jury awards


that I see mentioned in the amicus briefs, is a jury award


which seems relatively modest, and certainly a jury award


which on its face doesn't suggest that there was some


outrageous amount given for reasonable fear of cancer.


QUESTION: 


May I just ask you, you say there's 

no evidence of what the degree of exposure in other areas,


and so forth and so on.  Didn't they make any offers of


proof with, or did they just the prove the time that they


worked --


MR. LAZARUS:  They really just proved the time. 


They -- we know the nature of the work, but what we don't


know, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Well, but then that would be a


question of the weight of that evidence, rather than


whether they preserved the point.


MR. LAZARUS:  Well, Your Honor, I'm not -- they

never offer a basis of apportionment.  We'd have to know,


and the evidence at trial made clear, to know the dose and


dose relationship you'd have to know the air flow rates,


the pathways of exposure --


QUESTION:  At what point in the trial did it


become clear, by a ruling of the trial judge, that they


could not rely on the exposure in other areas?


MR. LAZARUS:  Your Honor, they were not denied


this opportunity at trial to introduce the evidence with


respect to the non-railroad employment, and you can see


that because they actually did do some cross-examination,


they did try to introduce the evidence of three months,


they did try to refer to the other workplaces, they could


have tried to introduce more evidence.


QUESTION:  Well, why was that relevant if


there's joint liability?


MR. LAZARUS:  Well, we thought it was


irrelevant, Your Honor, but they were clearly thinking


about the possibility of requesting an apportionment


instruction, but the fact is, they never laid out a


reasonable basis.


If you look at the memorandum --


QUESTION:  Oh, but they did request an


instruction, didn't they?


MR. LAZARUS:  They did request the instruction,

but --


QUESTION:  So the point was preserved.


MR. LAZARUS:  Right, but the trial court was


correct in denying the instruction because they had not


met their burden of proffering a reasonable basis for


apportionment, and in the absence of that evidentiary


basis, the trial court was absolutely correct in denying


it.  This was a jury verdict, Your Honor, this was


reached.


QUESTION:  Oh, but that theory, then, is that


several liability would have been appropriate if the


evidence were sufficient?


MR. LAZARUS:  Well, no, Your Honor.  Our


threshold argument is that it would not -- asbestosis, 

this is a classic individual injury.  There are many


courts who have talked about this, and they said, well, in


theory, asbestosis is dose-related.


QUESTION:  With respect, Mr. Lazarus, isn't


your -- the bottom line in this argument that this is


simply not an issue in the case, because they didn't


provide a basis?


MR. LAZARUS:  Yes, that's absolutely right.


QUESTION:  So you're saying, forget it.


MR. LAZARUS:  That's right.  They had the burden


and they simply didn't meet their burden.

QUESTION:  It seems to me that argument goes to


the weight of the evidence they offered, rather than to


the -- your legal position.  I may be missing something.


MR. LAZARUS:  Well, Your Honor, no, they have to


as a matter of law, right, proffer some kind, and here


there's absolutely nothing --


QUESTION:  Well, but they did proffer -- if I


remember it, they did proffer evidence as to the time that


these people worked in other areas where they were exposed


to asbestos, didn't they?


MR. LAZARUS:  There is some evidence --


QUESTION: 


But you're saying that's not enough. 

MR. LAZARUS:  There's some evidence as to that,


but in fact if you can look to their instruction they


don't even say what -- that time is the relevant factor,


and I think the evidence at trial shows that time is not


even close to establishing what the dose relationship


would be.  This is very complicated.


QUESTION:  But aren't you really saying that


unless there's an abuse of discretion on the part of the


trial judge in refusing to send this to the jury, based on


what you've just described, insufficiency of evidence on


their part, that it's not in the case for us?


MR. LAZARUS:  That's absolutely right, Your


57 

Honor.


Thank you.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Lazarus.


Mr. Phillips, you have two minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


I want to be absolutely clear about the


apportionment in this case.  We put in an instruction on


apportionment based on a reasonable basis following


Justice Kennedy's analysis of the law, which says if


there's a reasonable basis to apportion, you do that.


The trial judge did not reject that on the basis 

of insufficient evidence.  What he said at page 179,


volume 9 of the transcript is, if you've got a joint tort­


feasor, that tort-feasor is liable for all of the


injuries.  He said it as a matter of law.  It's joint and


several liability.  There is no apportionment.  That's the


ruling we challenged.  That's the legal issue before this


Court.

The second question, then, with your leave, is


QUESTION:  Well, but should we adopt your


position if it's as difficult to show this separate

causation as your brother argues?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, Dean Prosser said from day


one it's always going to be difficult to apportion, but


that's no reason not to have the jury undertake to


apportion.  There are lots of decisions that juries make


that are very hard to make, but the better rule is to


apportion, because that's the fair outcome that will arise


in these cases.


With respect to the fear of cancer damages, the


key to this case, it seems to me, is just how big a


gatekeeper function the fact of asbestosis can be, and


my -- the argument is, asbestosis is extraordinarily easy


to diagnose.  There are currently 5,500 cases under FELA


in West Virginia. 


Every single one of them involves a 

claim of asbestosis.  Every single one of them will be


supported by an expert.


What you get is, that's not a gatekeeper.  Those


cases are going to come in, and then you're going to have


exactly the kinds of evidence you had in this case, I'm


afraid of cancer, give me whatever you think is the right


number.  That is the essence of unpredictable and


unlimited damages.  This Court declined to allow that


under FELA in Buckley.  It should decline to allow that


under FELA in this case as well.


If there are no questions, I'll reserve --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Phillips.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
