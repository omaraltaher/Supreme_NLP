ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The upshot in practice of the Commonwealth's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed rule in this case is that when a criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant like Petitioner demonstrates that his trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel failed to preserve the fundamental fairness of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the criminal proceeding by failing to object and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, allowing to stand a structural error, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

gravest kind of constitutional error there can be in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course of a criminal trial.  It would be impossible for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant to obtain relief under Strickland against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Washington for ineffective assistance of counsel.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's because the Commonwealth says that such -- all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such defendants must prove actual prejudice resulting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from their attorney's deficiency. 

 

 

 

            

But the problem is that when an attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deficiency results in a structural error, it will be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

practically impossible to demonstrate what the practical

affects of --

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The problem is the 

  

 

 

 

 

structural errors -- I think one brings -- put it this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way -- come in all sizes and shapes.  So here we have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- not an exclusion of public from the trial itself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's only the from the jury selection. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I take it your view is it doesn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter.  If it had been the first day of the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selection, everything else is open, or if the entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings were closed.  Structural error -- you go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from structural error directly to new trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Do you make any distinctions between kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of errors that we have called structural? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  The short answer, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is no.  There are distinctions to be made in -- in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context of the public-trial right, for example.  Those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctions play out as -- at the threshold question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether the public-trial right, in fact, has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated. 

            

But certainly what this Court suggested in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Waller where the courtroom closure was for a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppression hearing at the outset of the trial and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the entire trial, that when the public-trial right is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deemed to have been violated, it is itself structural. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That doesn't mean, as -- as -- as Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Stevens recognized in footnote 23 of his concurrence in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reporters Committee, that doesn't mean that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

public -- that every single closure of the courtroom 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily implicates the public-trial right as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framers of the Sixth Amendment would have understood it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For instance, sidebars and in some -- in some instances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chambers conferences and certainly any circumstance in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the State is -- is able to pass the -- a strict 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny test established by Waller, those sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closures, although closures in the technical sense, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not be closures in the constitutional sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I -- this may 

    

   

 

 

 

 

not be directly pertinent, but why was the courtroom 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered closed?  I mean, it was filled with members 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the public.  Now, they were there as part of the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pool, but, of course, they weren't all chosen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, what was the -- did the judge have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to set aside how many seats for people who weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually being called for jury duty before you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclude that the courtroom was not closed? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I -- I would have 

   

   

  

 

 

thought that the courtroom -- so the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not -- I mean, it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a limited space.  There's only so many --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Sure.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- spaces and 

  

 

 

 

 

it's -- you know, he's got to get the jury pool in there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

and, you know, they took up all the space.  So you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must -- your position must be on the error itself that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judge should have kept aside certain seats for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people who weren't being called for jury duty.  I'm just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curious how many that is. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  So I -- there are two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

elements to that question.  I'll take them each in turn. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The first is we know that the courtroom was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closed because members of the public and -- indeed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every member of the public who expressed an interest in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attending the proceeding who was not a member of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury venire was turned away, actively turned away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you -- presumably, I guess the argument is, well, they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were turned away because there was no -- no room.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was no room because the courtroom was full of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members of the public who were called for jury duty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  So -- and that leads to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second answer.  And -- and -- and that is, as this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held in Presley, first of all, courtroom crowding is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a sufficient answer for turning away -- a sufficient 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification for turning away other members of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interested public.

7 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'll have to go back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and look at Presley, but courtroom overcrowding is not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification for turning away other people, what are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they supposed to do? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, but to be very clear, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is precisely what happened in Presley.  Presley, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What did they say in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Presley that you were supposed to do?  In other words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no room in the courtroom, and you say, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's not a justification for keeping people out. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  So the answer is very simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bringing in the jury venire in groups of, say, 40 rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than allowing all 90 in at once.  There are a range of, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think, very practical solutions to this particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem that would have allowed the judge to keep the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gallery open to members of the public. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Presumably, lawyers are 

  

 

 

 

members of the public.  The judge is a member of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public.  The bailiff is a member of the public.  I'm 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

presuming that once those jury members -- if they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given a choice, would not be there. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so I think they have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

stopped being a member of the public as might be

understood with respect to access.  I think one thinks 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

of members of the public as anyone who might be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interested, but not compelled to be in attendance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So I think 

   

  

  

 

 

what Presley said, if I'm not mistaken, is that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't keep out interested people just because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overcrowding. 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  That's exactly right.  And I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think underlying that holding is a recognition that not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

all members of the public are the same.  So in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance, for instance, the members of the public who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were excluded from the proceeding were the defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own mother, his mother's boyfriend, sister, and pastor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and so bearing in mind that the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

empanelment is the point at which the defendant is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduced to the judge and jury for the first time, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's the first opportunity for the defendant to make an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impression on the people who decide his or her guilt or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocence, it makes a real difference both in terms of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how the defendant behaves, that members of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interested public, not just any member of the public, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but his support system, his friends and family, are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present. 

            

It has an effect on his demeanor and the

confidence with which he presents himself, but it also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has an effect on how the jury perceives him.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what does it say that at the first time that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members, again, of the jury who are going to decide this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

young man's guilt or innocence, he is presented to them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the support even of his mother. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So what -- what you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying, and I -- I think this is true -- is that there 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are circumstances in which closing the courtroom can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an effect on the outcome of the -- of the trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But, conversely, is it your position that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's never possible for there to be a violation of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right without there being an effect on the trial; that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's never possible to show that this could not have had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any effect on the outcome? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  I think that's right.  It's 

    

  

 

 

 

to say that -- and -- and this is reflected in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's precedence --

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  As a practical matter --

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  -- in -- in Waller. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  As a practical matter, it's 

   

  

 

 

 

never possible to show that it -- there -- it would --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there would be no outcome -- no effect on the outcome? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  I -- I think this is

of choice.  That is a --

   

  

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So in this --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KIMBERLY:  -- speculative inquiry. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  In -- in this case, what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your best theory about how this could have affected the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial?  What happened here? 

  

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, as I was just 

   

  

 

 

 

describing, there's no way to tell what effect the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence of the defendant's mother would have had on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impression made to the jurors, who, again, were first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduced to him and -- and formed their first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impression of him sitting alone without the support of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody.  There's no way to know what effect it had on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his own demeanor.  There's no way to know what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect of his -- his mother's and -- and pastor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence would have had on the demeanor of the attorneys 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the judge. 

 

 

            

These are all completely -- and -- and as --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as we say, it may be that the attorneys may have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercised preemptory challenges in different ways.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

may be that prospective jurors moved by the differences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the presence of the public would have answered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions in somewhat different ways and would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formed different inquit attitudes about the defendant.

These are completely unknowable and 

 

 

 

 

indeterminate effects, though.  And that's exactly what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this Court said in Waller, and it's why since Waller, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lower courts have universally treated the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a courtroom closure as a structural error as to which 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmless error on direct appellate review simply cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be demonstrated.  And -- and we think certainly that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exact same analysis applies with respect to Strickland, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual prejudice. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose the two people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

who couldn't get in were members of the public, but not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant's mother and her pastor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, again, I think it would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

depend on -- on who they are.  I think the difficulty 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here also is there's no way to tell what sort of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

downstream effects of the closure are outside the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courtroom.  It may be that those who were excluded the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first day let be known to others that the courtroom is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closed, and others then don't plan to show up and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't even bother to come in. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could -- could I ask 

   

  

 

 

 

you, though, there is a big difference between the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

absence of an attorney at trial or a conflict of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  In both those situations, there's not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility of waiver or forfeiture -- the -- knowing

waiver or forfeiture because a conflicted counsel has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

failed to tell someone a truth that they're conflicted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and gotten themselves off the case.  Absence of counsel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the very essence of the violation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The defendant doesn't 

  

 

 

 

know enough to object.  But here there are serious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions about waiver and forfeiture.  It's -- why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't it be in the best interest of every attorney to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, I didn't know that a closure was a constitutional 

   

   

   

 

 

 

violation, the way this gentleman did?  Isn't that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  In -- in -- in circumstances 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where that isn't actually the truth? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  In every 

  

  

 

 

circumstance. 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In -- in virtually every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance, the lawyer knows there's been a closure. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

There's been plain error in his failure -- his or her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to object.  So how does the judge determine 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether that waiver or forfeiture should or should not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be held against the defendant? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I think the same way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that the judge would do so in any case implicating a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland claim based on a failure to object.  The --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the threshold question is whether the attorney rendered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

deficient performance.  And in this case, for example, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at pages 7 and 8 of the Joint Appendix, there's no 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that the defense attorney here acknowledged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the sole reason he declined to object to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courtroom closure was he did not know that it was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of his client's public trial right, and if he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had known, he would have raised an objection.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- I think a straightforward case of deficient 

   

   

 

 

 

 

performance. 

            

Now, it -- it's true the Commonwealth and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States have raised the possibility of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sandbagging in a circumstance where a defense counsel 

   

   

 

 

 

who in fact does know about the violation of the right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and nevertheless declines to raise it to preserve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility of bringing a Strickland claim later, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that turns on the presumption that the defense attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would make a material represent -- misrepresentation to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the Court in later collateral proceedings, address it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed at that -- at the question of the first prong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether he rendered deficient performance. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, why doesn't that 

  

 

 

 

 

follow, though?  Because it seems to me that if it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unpreserved error at trial and we get to appeal, you --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have a choice.  In most cases, I see claims are

dealt with collaterally.  You could either bring it as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

plain error of question on direct appeal, but you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to face prong 4 --

   

 

 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- and show it affects the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrity of the proceedings, or you have a choice.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could bring it in collateral proceedings where you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't have to meet prong 4, and it would actually be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easier to win a Sixth Amendment collateral claim than it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be a plain error claim.  And it -- it just seems 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very unusual to me that we create a structure that would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentivize, through honest and good advocacy, defines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the normality of the final judgments.  So that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question one. 

 

            

And question two is related.  Would we then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

create actually a really perverse incentive for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

State to secure IEC waivers from individuals so that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they don't confront these kinds of problems, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, kind of a Professor Stunt sort of problem, by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfecting procedure, we actually result in its denial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all. 

 

            

Can you help me with those two problems? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  So the -- the question about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plain error, first, I think it depends on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction that you're in.  In this jurisdiction, for

example, Massachusetts --

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, work with me with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the typical jurisdiction.  I know Massachusetts is a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

little different. 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, so there -- there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

groups of two.  Massachusetts falls into one bucket; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

most of the Federal courts fall into another budget. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Work with -- work with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the usual, the Federal jurisdiction, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominant in most States, which is that IECs are done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collaterally. 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  And -- and, actually, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

appreciate it.  I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't deny that 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

this is a collateral proceeding here, and I'm not --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I -- I understand that, 

    

   

 

 

but, please, just -- just stick with me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  So under Rule 54(b) in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal proceeding -- in -- in the Federal context, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be Olano four-pronged plain error context, we --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we think it's true that, for the most part in the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the lower Federal courts have dealt with it, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the third prong -- effect on substantial rights, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumed when there is a structural error.  And so, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, as a practical matter --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  It's still a prong 4,

though, right? 

 

16 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  It's still a prong 4.  And I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

think that's why, for instance, there's an opportunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the Court to avoid sandbagging, if there's any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern that the -- that the defense counsel knew about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it and kept the objection. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Defense counsel just 

  

 

 

 

doesn't bring it -- doesn't bring it on direct appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Good defence counsel wouldn't bring it, and would leave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it for collateral review in most jurisdictions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Sure.  I mean, I think in 

    

   

  

 

 

that circumstance, very frequently, plain error review 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be available.  I'm sorry to push back --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's available.  The 

  

  

 

 

question is, wouldn't the judge be doing exactly what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happening here?  Wouldn't the judge, under the fourth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prong, look at what actually happens, whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closure was complete, part of the trial, was there a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transcript of the voir dire --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- so that they could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

measure the possible effects or not, and end up saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the substantial integrity of the proceedings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't been violated?

could overrule a finding of that nature, if it was in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct review under plain error? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  I think in most circumstances 

    

 

 

 

 

in -- in -- where there's a structural error that passes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the third, it will almost always pass the fourth.  I --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, that's not the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

the lessons of our case law. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, there's -- I -- I --

   

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think reverse is true 

    

 

 

 

 

of our case law. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  I -- I don't mean to deny 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that the fourth prong has -- has -- does real work. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It -- it certainly does, and there are case-specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances in which maybe then the appellate court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would decline to grant relief on collateral review, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the defendant would, in that circumstance, be able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to bring a collateral challenge under Strickland. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the one -- I just want to push back a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little bit on the hypothetical, because, in fact, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are a number of State jurisdictions in which plain error 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review of this sort isn't available at all because they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decline to presume prejudice on whatever the equivalent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Olano prong 3 is, and Massachusetts is such a State. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so in our case, in -- in any State court

whatever plain error -- procedural plain error rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they like, they aren't bound by this Court's or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal courts' precedence on Rule 54(b).  They can, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

very frequently do, say that you have to show actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice -- actual prejudice in the sort of Strickland 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense for relief under plain error. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in that circumstance, Strickland is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical, we think, relief valve.  It's the only way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of getting later review in the circumstance where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the structural error perpetuated by the attorney's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deficient failure to object renders the trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamentally unfair.  And I -- I think it bears -- it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

bears emphasis to recall that the Commonwealth does not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deny that if there were an objection in this case, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants in this case, and in other cases like it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be entitled to a new trial automatically on direct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal. 

            

The Commonwealth does suggest putting that 

 

 

 

 

 

error -- and -- and remember, structural errors go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fundamental fairness of the proceeding.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are the -- the gravest sort of constitutional errors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible in the course of a criminal proceeding. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Putting that error together with the additional injury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of having been appointed counsel by the court, who's too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignorant to know to object to the structural violation,

that the defendant should be completely out of luck. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

structural errors are not the most grievous errors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible in the criminal process.  They are a particular 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

type of error, which the assumption is there's no way to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell whether they're prejudicial or not.  But, I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this -- this may be a good case.  That doesn't mean 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're the most shocking miscarriages of justice you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can imagine. 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I -- I don't think that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

they're necessarily shocking, but I would say that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's structural error precedents make clear that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

although one feature of a structural error is that it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible to -- to determine the practical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences, it is an independent feature of structural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors that they render the trials fundamentally unfair. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The idea is that the rights that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected by the structural error doctrine are just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essential elements to a fair trial.  And so take, for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, the -- the right to trial by jury.  Under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commonwealth --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  You're 

  

  

 

 

picking good ones, but, I mean, I -- I can come up with 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a long list of things that I think are more serious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations than the exclusion of the public from voir

dire when you have the other jury members there.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand that that is an error, and I -- the argument, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

of course, that it is a structural error; but I'm just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quarreling with the idea that these are the most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grievous miscarriages of -- of justice you can imagine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There are particular characteristics of them 

 

 

 

 

 

that put them in a different category.  The -- the --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  And --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A list of errors 

    

 

 

 

 

that could occur in criminal procedure, I think you'd 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree, there's some that you would put ahead of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excluding members of the public from voir dire when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courtroom is otherwise full. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  I -- I -- and I didn't mean 

    

   

   

 

 

 

to suggest or -- or overstate the grievousness of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error.  What I meant to suggest is that these are a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category of errors where the Court recognizes that their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denial -- that the denial of the rights protected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this doctrine render the proceeding automatically 

 

 

 

 

 

suspect and -- and inherently unfair. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, in a way, Mr. Kimberly, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I mean, you don't have to convince us of that, do you? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  I -- I hope not. 

    

   

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  No.  I'm saying you 

  

  

  

 

 

 

don't have to convince us, because -- because one of the

things that we've said over and over about structural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

error is that it's -- it's impossible to show how they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected the trial. 

 

 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And -- and that's really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what's at issue here, is whether we should put the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant to the burden of showing how it affected the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial, when, in fact, we've said over and over that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't do that. 

 

 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  I think --

    

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So whether they're 

  

 

 

 

important, whether they're not important, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

they're critical to fundamental fairness or not, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, is, in some ways, beside the point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I -- so I think there 

   

   

  

 

 

 

are two independent ways of thinking about it, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly is -- is one very important way of thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it.  It's something that we stress in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing, and I -- I think that's absolutely right. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

This is the point about putting two wrongs together and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just saying --

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it's not a question of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

putting two wrongs together.  I mean, the Commonwealth's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

argument and the argument of the United States is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is no violation of the Sixth Amendment right to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

counsel unless the -- the counsel's performance deprived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

the defendant of a -- a fair trial.  It's -- this is not 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Sixth Amendment speedy trial -- I'm sorry --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public-trial act issue.  It's a right-to-counsel issue. 

   

  

 

 

 

And prejudice is built into the Sixth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland standard because the defendant had an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney. 

            

So on what theory was the defendant deprived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of an attorney?  Well, the theory is, although there was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody sitting next to that defendant and asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions and pretending to be an attorney, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney was so bad that he might as well not have had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an attorney.  So it's built right in.  And so, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately, there has to be the determination for there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be a Sixth Amendment right-to-trial violation that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there was prejudice. 

 

 

            

Now, you can make the argument that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible to tell whether there was prejudice, but it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

built right into the speedy -- into the -- a right to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel. 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  I -- I think that's exactly 

    

   

 

 

 

right.  I wouldn't disagree with anything you said. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

But that leads me to the second point that I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was going to make, and that's that Strickland instructs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the fundamental focus of the ineffective assistance

23 

inquiry has to be on the fundamental fairness of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial.  If, therefore, the -- the two -- as we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand the two steps, it's whether there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deficient performance, objectively unreasonable 

 

 

 

performance, and whether that objectively unreasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

error, in turn, rendered the trial unfair. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, in the mine run of cases, we do not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree.  In the mine run of cases involving trial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors, the way to prove that the error rendered the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial fundamentally unfair is to show that it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiently serious that it undermined our confidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the result. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And -- and you have to say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that's always true, or it's -- it's true in such a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high percentage of the cases that there's no point in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even making that an issue, no matter how steep the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden that the prosecution might have to satisfy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  That -- that is -- that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reasoning underlying Cronic.  I think it's somewhat 

    

 

 

 

 

 

different from what we're suggesting here.  What we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting here is that the rights protected by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural errors are fundamental to the American system 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of criminal justice, and that their denial renders the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial fundamentally and inherently suspect, and 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, unfair.

And so it is simply another way to prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a defense attorney's objectively unreasonable error 

   

 

 

 

 

24 

rendered the trial unfair to show that it resulted in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural error.  It is the -- it is the hallmark of a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural error that it does exactly that, that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

renders the trial unfair. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Let's put this label aside 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for a minute.  You really think that it's impossible, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that there can never be a case where a violation like 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the one that took place here had no effect on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome of the trial? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Again, I --

   

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's impossible to ever --

  

 

 

 

 

 

for there ever to be such a case --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  It's -- it's impossible to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

tell.  And what I would say about this is -- I point the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court, for example, to the Eighth Circuit's decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Stenberg -- excuse me -- Glickman v. --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

not Glickman --

 

 

McGurk v. Stenberg.  The issue there was Nebraska had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted a statute that deprived criminal defendants in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

DWI cases of a right to trial by jury.  The judge had to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide guilt in that case.  The -- the defendant was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found guilty.  He appealed throughout the State system. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

His appeals were denied.

the Eighth Circuit looked at the case, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government in that case making the exact same arguments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

that the Commonwealth and United States here make, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court there said it is no answer to the denial of a jury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to say that the evidence against the defendant was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong.  The point is, it was the wrong entity who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided guilt or innocence.  It is fundamental to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American system of criminal justice and to our promise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of fair trials that criminal defendants be tried by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juries. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's a different --

   

  

 

 

 

I mean, that's a different situation.  Suppose the only 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

people who wanted to go -- the only members of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public who wanted to be in this -- in the courtroom were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the family and the friends of the victims of a crime. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So it would be a hostile audience. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  I -- I think -- I think that 

    

   

   

 

 

 

would implicate many of the same problems that we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  There's no way to tell the ways in which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals would have been affected by their presence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It -- it very well may be that that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have cast a defendant in worse light, but there's no way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to know.  Maybe some members of -- of the jury venire 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be off-put by what they viewed as -- as especially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

egregious behavior in that circumstance. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

The point is, it -- it remains a speculative 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry.  And -- and I think, as -- as we've suggested, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

the -- I think the -- the Court's cases on this point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really leave very little doubt that, as far as -- as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denial of the public trial right goes, there's no way to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell what the difference is. 

 

 

 

 

            

And if, in order to obtain relief, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require defendants to prove what the difference is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- it means that, just as a practical matter, there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will never be relief for violations of the public trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right that happen to be coupled with the additional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury of defense counsel who don't know to object.

MR. RAVITZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court:

ineffective assistance of counsel, and requiring 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized prejudice to be proven for claims like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, claims like the Petitioner's, ensures that a

It tells us whether the defendant's own

process, or was likely the -- the right outcome.  And it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Supposing this objection 

  

 

 

 

had been made at the first opportunity and it's denied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the trial judge.  And then it goes up on appeal.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a timely objection.  Wouldn't it follow, then, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that the case has to be -- the judgment has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacated and there has to be a retrial?

was improper, yes, that -- that's what would happen in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts.  But that -- that wasn't the case here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and it's important to recognize the distinction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between those two situations, because there are both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrinal and practical considerations there. 

 

 

 

 

            

The doctrinal ones are that now we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at a different type of claim.  We're not looking 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at a public trial claim.  We're looking at an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

ineffectiveness claim.  And there must be prejudice in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

order for that violation to be complete, Gonzalez-Lopez 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells us.  Not only that, the focus of the prejudice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry is different than the focus that it would be if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we were looking at a violation of the right to a public

trial. 

            

            

Strickland tells us --

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Unless it's a -- unless the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

fact that it's a structural error is fatal, then in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

situation -- in -- in the hypothetical Justice Ginsburg 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided, wouldn't it be open to you to prove that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  That's -- that's correct if --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it was not a structural error.  But if it's -- if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a structural error, then -- then the government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be precluded from making that -- that showing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what's -- and what --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is there a structural error in this case, in your view, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the hypothetical? 

 

 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  Where -- where there was an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

improper closure of the trial, we -- we respect the fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- or I should say of jury selection -- we respect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that the Court has said that public trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors are structural, and that the Court has said that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the closure of jury selection is a public trial error. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

However, not all structural errors should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated the same, and not all public trial errors should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be treated the same.  They're -- they're very different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from one another.  There could be a closure for --

Ginsburg's hypothetical, there's an objection, the 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

objection is overruled, it's wrongly overruled.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

then you say, well, in Massachusetts, we would -- there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be a reversal. 

   

 

            

What about under the law of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution?  Must there be a reversal on the facts of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that hypothetical? 

 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  The -- this Court in Presley 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not address remedies.  So if -- if one takes Presley 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combined with statements about a public trial error 

   

 

 

 

 

 

being a structural error, takes them together, then --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

then yes.  But the fact is the Court has never expressly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said that.  It has never said that a Presley error is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural error. 

 

            

And -- and even if it were to be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural error, that doesn't mean that it should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated like every other structural error, or even like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every other public trial error. 

 

 

 

 

            

As I said, the courtroom closure could be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for a few minutes during --

   

 

 

 

            

your line? 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but what -- what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. RAVITZ:  Excuse me? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, do you -- suppose 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that the structural error were excluding

African-Americans from the jury, or women from the jury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

Okay?  That's the error.  They select a different jury. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

All white men.  Now, we have no way of knowing whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that made a real difference in that case.  We don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know.  So it's a structural error. 

   

  

 

 

            

Now, are you saying in such a circumstance, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where the lawyer failed to object, et cetera, therefore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland, therefore inadequate assistance of counsel, 

 

 

 

 

 

that that isn't the end of it?  That there was an all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

white male jury?  Isn't that the end of it, even though 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we don't know if there was prejudice in the sense that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury would have decided differently?  Is that your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position? 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  It is our position that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice would need to be proven. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You can't.  All right?  You 

  

  

  

 

 

 

can't.  You can't prove that the jury would have come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out differently. 

 

            

So I'd say, at least in my mind, if your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point is that even -- suppose they had a -- a trial by 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquisition.  I mean, you know, I can imagine even the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

most fantastic examples where you don't know whether, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really, the result would have been every -- different if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you had the most perfect jury.  All right?

somebody has to prove that it really made a difference? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what a structural error is really about, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

kind of case, where you can't prove it because it was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically unfair proceeding. 

 

 

            

that --

 

            

Court said. 

 

            

            

MR. RAVITZ:  Well, the Court hasn't said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I don't care what the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

MR. RAVITZ:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm asking my question. 

  

 

 

 

 

And my question, I thought, until I'm getting this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer, that, of course, in some instances, you say it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was such an unfair trial, and you show inadequate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of counsel and that's the end of it.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presume the prejudice.  And I was going to ask you how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you draw the line. 

 

 

 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  Right.  It may be an unfair 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

trial with respect to the right that's claimed at issue, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but where the right that's claimed is one of ineffective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance, Strickland tells us that that -- that deals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not interested in 

  

 

 

 

 

Strickland at the moment.  I want to know how you think, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case, we should draw the line between those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural errors, which are absolutely egregious, and

it is plain that the defendant did not get a fair trial, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

although we cannot prove one way or the other that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have made a difference to the outcome. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. RAVITZ:  The --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I would have thought 

    

   

 

 

 

that you would have said, of course, in such a case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inadequate assistance of counsel for not raising that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error leads to a new trial.  We presume prejudice.  And 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

if you're not going to say that, then I will withdraw 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all my questions and keep quiet. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  I will say that the -- the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's approach in Cronic made sense, that there what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said was prejudice would be presumed where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's highly likely that there was, in fact, prejudice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not just any type of prejudice, but prejudice in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense of a breakdown in the adversary process; in other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, prejudice to the right at issue because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances on the order of a -- of a complete denial 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of counsel. 

 

            

And I say that makes sense because by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

focusing on the likelihood, the high likelihood, we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not saying that something actually existed merely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because we don't know whether it existed.  We are saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it existed when we can be very confident that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

did.  And by focusing on the right at issue, we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

zeroing in on what is before --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right. 

  

 

 

MR. RAVITZ:  -- the Court. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the rule that you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

asking us to adopt today, Cronic said an absolute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absence of counsel, you presume prejudice.  We have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

further said that a conflict of interest, actual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

conflict of interest, you can presume prejudice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Would an absolute closure, improper closure 

 

 

 

 

 

of a courtroom for no reason, could we presume prejudice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, or would you require the proof of actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice the way you're advocating here? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  Yes.  We would say that actual 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice needs to be shown, that a presumption is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

inappropriate.  That a presumption is appropriate in 

   

  

 

 

 

those situations where, again, it -- it can be said with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confidence -- and this isn't just the approach taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in Cronic.  Cronic cited cases dealing with a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variety of errors.  Because it's one thing to say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because something is difficult to show, we are going to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example, relieve the government --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's wrong -- wouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

it be logical to say that there are -- that structural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors on the reliability of a trial are affected by the

quality of the violation?  A partial closure, improper 

    

 

 

 

 

 

34 

as it may be, is not the same as a total closure.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a total situation, the reliability of the trial is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put into question in a such a fundamental way that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice can be presumed. 

 

 

 

            

Otherwise, we're never going to make any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning of structural error. 

 

 

 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  Well, but -- but the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reliability that Strickland and Cronic talked about is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the result of the trial is rendered unreliable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of a breakdown in -- in the -- the adversary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process, so it focuses in on the heart of the right at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue. 

            

The Petitioner here could have pursued a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standalone public-trial claim, and then we would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about the rights underlying that.  So Kimmelman 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

v. Morrison says it's important to look at the values 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying the right that has been asserted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the -- but the Petitioner didn't do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  He didn't do it in the SJC and he didn't do it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  So instead the focus should be on the values 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying the -- the right to the assistance of counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and whether there's been a breakdown in the adversary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

process.  That's the specific aspect of fairness, of a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair trial, that Strickland says the Counsel Clause is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

about. 

            

Had the Petitioner pursued a standalone 

   

 

 

 

35 

claim for the rights -- for violation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public-trial right, even though it was forfeited in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts, it would have gotten a review because all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims are reviewed in Massachusetts, just under a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different standard. 

 

            

And, in fact, if -- looking at the way that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts has treated those standalone claims versus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffectiveness claims, it's clear that Massachusetts 

 

 

 

 

 

understands what this Court said in -- in Kimmelman. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because in one case, in a case called Celester, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commonwealth, via the SJC, was applying its substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard to an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffectiveness claim based on this kind of a closure. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it -- and it cited -- it quoted Strickland. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But in another case where it was focusing on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the underlying right, it talked about public-trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory, even as it applied the same standard of review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. -- Mr. Ravitz, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

know, maybe this is a simple-minded way to look at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things, but I've always thought Strickland, it's about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fairness and the reliability of the trial process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's a pretty important thing to be concerned 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about.  And we have said as part of Strickland that you

have to show prejudice, because we're not really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

concerned about lawyers, however bad they may be, who do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that just don't affect the reliability of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial. 

            

But here, with respect to these structural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors, what we've said again and again and again is we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually just don't know.  So the -- in any particular 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, whether the commission of this error affected the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome. 

            

So what you are suggesting to us is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant has to come in and prove as part of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland -- which, as I said, is integral to ensuring 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fairness and reliability of the process -- has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come in and prove as part of that something that we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, time and again, is unprovable.  And that just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems like that's not something that a legal system 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

should do.  You have to prove something that we've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted is unprovable. 

 

 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  Well, when the Court said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was difficult to prove prejudice from this kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error, it wasn't talking about the reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probability standard of Strickland.  That's one of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits to the standard.  It was specifically designed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to account for and does account for situations where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there might be a breakdown in the process.  There might

be an unreliable result, and yet it's too hard to prove. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It can't be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so the standard was -- was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

middle-of-the-road standard deliberately and it's 

 

 

 

 

flexible.  And it -- and Strickland says, take into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account all the circumstances.  Take into account the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

totality of the evidence. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but then what you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

asking us to do is you're asking us to apply Strickland 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in such a way that we're saying this terrible attorney 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error took place because we're assuming that.  And we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it might -- it could have affected the outcome of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trial, but because of the kind of error it is, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've said a hundred times, we just are not able to --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say that with any certainty, so we'll give the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit of the doubt to the government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  No.  That -- that sounds like 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

what it's saying is exactly the kind of idea that relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be awarded where prejudice is merely conceivable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Strickland rejected.  And it makes sense, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say that something -- because something is difficult 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to show, it must have existed, one doesn't follow from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other.  And it would -- and it would allow for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief to be granted in a wide range of situations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where, in fact, in reality there was no prejudice.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I just -- I'm sorry to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

38 

keep, like, bugging you about this, but it just seems so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kafkaesque to me.  It's like you have to prove 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something, but we know you can't prove it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  Well, I wouldn't even say 

   

  

 

 

 

that -- that it can't be proven, because looking --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But we've said it.  We've 

  

  

 

 

 

 

said it a hundred times. 

   

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  The -- the Court hasn't said it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about a reasonable probability standard.  It hasn't said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that it -- it -- a reasonable probability can't be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shown. 

            

And -- and as far as proving it, there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogous situations where what we see is that the party 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shows a connection between the error.  So let's say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

here, the closure, the spectators that are excluded, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the events that occurred during that time taking into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account what's said in the trial transcripts, and a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection between those things and the issues at trial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving particular attention to anything that went wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and also giving attention to -- as I say, to likelihood, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to probability. 

 

            

And so the -- for example, the Solicitor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General cites the McKernan Third Circuit case that was

handed down this year, which involved a biased judge. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's -- that's the approach that the Court took 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there.  It was very simple.  It was to look at what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened, what went wrong, and what the connection was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between that and the error and then the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probability that it had an effect on the judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And sometimes -- sometimes that's the best 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we can do, but it's because we are inherently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering what would have happened in a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

situation.  That's the case in every Strickland 

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation.  We're always considering what would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happened. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's say, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean, the argument on the other side is that one of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most important things about the trial is to have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mother with the young offender.  Did that cause 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice or not, that the mother wasn't there?  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just looked and there was a guy alone who was accused of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

killing a 15-year-old, as opposed to a troubled youth 

   

   

 

 

 

 

with his mother holding his hand.  I mean, you know, all 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these things are important. 

 

 

 

            

So are they right that that prejudiced the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial or not? 

 

 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  They are right that that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfortunate and it shouldn't have happened.

As to whether it had an effect on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah. 

  

 

 

MR. RAVITZ:  -- that's something different. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. RAVITZ:  Well, again, the -- the -- a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant can aim to show a connection between the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

spectators and what happened at the trial.  So, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, let's say the judge made certain comments that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were offensive about a particular group, and members of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that group were excluded from jury selection. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, that's a 

  

 

 

 

 

different case.  I'm asking -- I'm asking about this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

MR. RAVITZ:  The defendant probably would 

  

 

 

 

 

have had a great difficulty showing it because it was so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely to have occurred, but that doesn't mean that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a breakdown in the system.  That means that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prejudice that Strickland and Cronic called for was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just highly unlikely to have been present. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And why do I say that?  Because the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

courtroom was filled with as many as 90 members of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public in the form of prospective jurors who were able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to observe the proceedings, and because there was no

evidence taken and there was no argumentation on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

merits and because once the courtroom -- once the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selection process was finished, the courtroom was opened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up.  And there was no issue raised about the rest of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- of the jury selection proceeding or the jury that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was chosen.  It was only the courtroom closure.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then when it was opened up, the jurors heard evidence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a confession.  And they heard other evidence of -- of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biological evidence and ballistics evidence.  So yes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here, it was just highly unlikely that there was, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, prejudice. 

 

            

Just on a final note, it's -- it's been said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that structural errors are the gravest type of errors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And this Court in Gonzalez Lopez redirected things and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarified that structural errors are, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different, and they've been rendered structural, given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that classification for different reasons.  And it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

important to focus on those differences just as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland says it's important to focus on the different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances in a given case. 

   

 

 

            

the Court. 

 

            

            

            

And if there are no further questions from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL 

 

 

 

 

42 

          

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

            

I'd like to begin where my co-counsel just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left off here with the idea that any time a structural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error occurs, it leads to fundamental unfairness and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreliability in the outcome of the trial.  Structural 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors implicate fairness in a way that's broader than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the interest that's protected by the Sixth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to the effective assistance of counsel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under Strickland, we're focused on whether 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel's error undermines confidence in the -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict.  You're asking whether there was such a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

breakdown in the adversarial process that we can no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer rely on what the jury did.  And the Court in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gonzalez-Lopez pushed back on the idea that all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural errors are necessarily the type of error that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermine confidence in the reliability of the trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I can give three examples of scenarios 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where structural errors occur, where other courts have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded that those errors do not undermine the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliability of the trial outcomes:  Batson errors, right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to counsel of choice, and bias trial judge.

In the context of Batson errors, which you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were talking a little bit about before, we have cited 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some cases in page 18 and 19 of our brief where courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeals have looked at cases where Batson errors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred and said, okay.  There was a Batson error.  We 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

consider that a structural error, but it didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

undermine our -- our confidence in the outcome of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial.  There was overwhelming evidence of guilt. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

There's no reason to believe that any juror that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually sitting on the jury had any kind of a bias. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And those decisions are consistent with this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's opinion in Allen v. Hardy, which is the case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that holds that Batson is not retroactive.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That would be an awful lot 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- that -- that's exactly what's worrying me.  Batson 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors, you know, we can think of a host.  Sir Walter 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Raleigh is in the Star Chamber.  You know, I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- now, the government's position is what?  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's position is that even though there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious structural error, really serious, the all-white 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury, the Star Chamber, et cetera, even then -- and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer didn't object -- even then, the person doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automatically get a new trial. 

   

 

 

            

The truth of the matter is, we don't know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

what would have happened in the jury room.  We can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

say.  And if what we're supposed to do is weigh the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence, I guess then you're having trial by appellate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge.  And -- and so do -- do we get into that?  Is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that what you want, that in each case, no matter how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

egregious sort of the structural error, which may or may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not affect the jury -- we don't know -- that there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new trial?  The appellate judges are supposed to say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not there really would have been or likely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have been an impact on this case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That strikes me as a little -- I mean, I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

would like to hear your answer, because it strikes me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as -- as not -- not -- yeah. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.  So it's -- it's our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

position, Justice Breyer, that in the case of structural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors, you still have to show prejudice.  It doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter what the structural error is.  The Strickland 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

test says that we're looking under the second prong to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see if this error had an effect on the outcome of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial.  Maybe there's a reasonable probability that it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

did, in which case the standard is satisfied; and if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's not, then the standard is not satisfied.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't run the -- rerun the trial just because we don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know.

between the -- the examples that you gave where -- where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

it would appear that the issue would be a question of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmless error, and the situation here, where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is whether there's a constitutional error at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

all? 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Well -- so I think that this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

case has been litigated on the assumption that there has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a constitutional error, a -- a Sixth Amendment 

   

   

   

 

 

violation of the public power. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  But that's not the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

error that's -- that is before us.  The error -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged error that's before us is a violation --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Oh, right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- of the right to trial --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the right to counsel. 

 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  I must have misunderstood 

    

 

 

 

the question.  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  It was probably not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

very clear. 

 

            

The error -- what we are being asked to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address is the right to counsel; am I right? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And there is no violation of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the right to counsel based purely on deficient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performance; isn't that right?

MS. O'CONNELL:  Correct. 

  

 

46 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So there has to be -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice prong has to be satisfied. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I thought your 

   

  

 

 

understanding of Batson was that you were saying when an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney is deficient, as respects to a Batson claim, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, too, you would say that -- sort of too bad. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.  But you -- you still 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

must satisfy the prejudice prong in order to rerun the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So your -- your examples 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were ineffective assistance of counsel cases, not just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Batson cases. 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  No.  Well, Batson cases 

  

  

 

 

 

would be if -- you know, if the attorney didn't object, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's -- it's being done under --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's the underlying 

  

 

 

 

 

violation of the ineffective assistance claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Correct.  Correct. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you would say the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule would go, and you have to prove prejudice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Even though we've said over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and over that you can't prove prejudice.

MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, I think on that point, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

47 

Justice Kagan, the idea that you can't prove prejudice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said it's difficult to do.  That may be true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a general matter; it's not true across the board. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We've cited cases in our brief with respect to the bias 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial judge structural error, for example, where courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have done a case-by-case inquiry and said, okay.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this case, the bias of the trial judge, there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable probability it would have affected the trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome.  In this case, there is no reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

probability that it would have. 

 

 

 

 

            

And it's not -- the -- the burden of proof 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Strickland context is on the defendant --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, I'm not saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that there aren't cases where you can have a sort of gut 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intuition as to whether it did or not.  But one of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that have made us put these particular rights in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this box called "structural" is that we say, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding that you can pick out a case here and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there and say, okay.  I kind of know. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

In general, these are -- it is so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculative as to whether this fundamental defect in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial process caused error that we're going to -- to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to presume it. 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  And -- and so that, Justice

Kagan, is the rationale for -- for not letting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

government prove harmless error if the objection is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserved.  And I think a big part of that is that these 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests -- a lot of these interests are ones that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not adequately be protected if that rule was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispensed with in the harmless-error context for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserved objections. 

 

              

I think the most stark example is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McCaskill error, the right to represent yourself, where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we didn't exempt that type of an error from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harmless-error analysis, it would always be harmless, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the judge could just deny the motion and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, well, there was no prejudice because you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have -- you would have been worse off representing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yourself. 

            

In the Strickland prejudice, the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tables are turned and the defendant has the burden to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove that there was some sort -- there was a reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probability of a different outcome at trial had this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

error been objected to and been fixed.  And there's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's just no reasonable probability of that in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular case. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't think we've ever 

    

 

 

 

 

really talked about burdens when we label things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural errors.  You know, we don't say, oh, you

haven't met your burden.  I mean, what we've said is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

that the whole burden analysis kind of goes out the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

window because this is so hard to prove because it's so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculative. 

            

So it's really not a question of who has the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden.  It's just never been the way we've addressed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the structural error category. 

 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  I -- I think in -- in 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Strickland, it's clear that the -- the -- proving each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prong of Strickland deficient performance and prejudice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is on the defendant.  And so, I guess, it is our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position that even though it's difficult to prove -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, the test is not meant to be easy.  We're looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to identify cases where the error, the attorney's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it's not meant to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

easy, but it's meant to be possible.  And what we've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said in our structural error cases is that it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible in a very, very large proportion of them. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, I guess I'd like to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

push back on that a little bit, though, and -- I mean, I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could give an example in the public-trial context in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific where, you know, a lot of times when this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular right is at issue or is violated, it's with

undercover police officer, a rape victim, a child, or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

50 

something like that. 

 

 

            

And if -- you know, if the courtroom is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closed for that witness's testimony and there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection, and on appeal, the -- the court of appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, oh, well, that was a -- that courtroom closure was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unjustified under the Waller factors.  And if that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness didn't testify or wouldn't have testified to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those things but for the courtroom closure, you could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely evaluate that and see if there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable likelihood the trial would have come out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently had that witness not testified. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I -- I don't think it's the case that --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it may be a general rule across the board that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural errors are difficult to prove, but I don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's true in every case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is the difficulty in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

any particular case something that can be weighed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determining whether the defendant has carried his burden 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of showing prejudice? 

 

 

              

I mean, in some of these, you say -- I guess 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we haven't required in some Batson cases, I think it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be -- that's where I do think it would be almost 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible to put the burden on showing prejudice.  On 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other hand, denial of counsel of choice, I would

think that would be pretty easy to show whether there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice or -- or not, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is that something a judge, reviewing whether 

   

 

 

 

 

there's been an adequate showing of prejudice, can take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

into account, or is it all or nothing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  I -- no, I think so. 

    

   

 

 

 

In Strickland, I think it's page 459 of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Strickland, the Court describes the test for how to do a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case-by-case prejudice inquiry under Strickland.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

the Court looks to, was the evidence against this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant overwhelming.  Was the error that occurred 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pervasive, in that it affected everything that happened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the trial, or was it just limited to one particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness or one particular thing. 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think, you know, under Strickland, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

test is flexible enough that courts could take into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration what type of an error it was. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think Justice Gorsuch --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How -- how about here? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And we get into the whole problem with speedy trial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they close it -- pardon me -- lack of public trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They close it for an hour, they close for half a day, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they close it for a day, they close it for two days, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they close it for the voir dire. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

How -- how do we go about looking at that?

Is -- is that presented in this case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

            

MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, I think this case has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

been litigated on the assumption that there was a Sixth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment violation here.  If this was our own case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a triviality exception to the Sixth Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

public-trial right that's recognized in the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts.  We've actually taken the position in -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various cases that a courtroom closure during voir dire 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not a Sixth Amendment violation because it doesn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermine the -- the purposes of the public-trial right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I think this Court comes -- this case comes to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court on the assumption there was a Sixth Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation.  But -- but I think the Court can take into 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account that it was closed for only a limited amount of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time in determining prejudice under Strickland.

The question there, I think, is whether a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

53 

public-trial violation happened at all.  And although 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there may be difficult cases where it's unclear whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a closure of a particular length, or the exclusion of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some and not all actually amounts to a public-trial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation.  After Presley v. Georgia, there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question --

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What about -- what about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

counsel's argument we just heard a moment ago, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a triviality exception.  Might this case qualify 

   

  

 

 

 

 

for that? 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  So, one, we don't disagree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that there is a triviality exception.  It certainly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

would not qualify after Presley v. Georgia.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

triviality question comes in at the threshold issue of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there has been a violation of the public-trial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

right at all. 

 

 

            

There's no question, under this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

precedence, and certainly the way that the lower courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniformly have treated public-trial errors after Waller, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that when it is determined that the Sixth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to a public trial has been violated, it is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural.  And so triviality comes into whether there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, in fact, a violation, not whether, assuming there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is one, it's structural.  If it happened --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  I understand.  But why 

    

  

 

 

54 

should we assume there was one here?  Why wasn't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Well, I don't think the Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

needs to look any further than Presley v. Georgia. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Presley v. Georgia involved precisely the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances here.  The courtroom was overcrowded, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

judge closed the courtroom to the public, and this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, in a 7-2 decision, that it was a violation of the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public-trial right. 

 

            

            

If I may, Justice --

   

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It didn't -- didn't get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

involved with the structural.  It was -- that was a per 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curiam opinion.  And it was -- and just the question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, does it -- does it violate the public-trial right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yes.  But Presley doesn't go on to say what the remedy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be when that's not brought up by counsel, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your own --

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

That question is answered by Waller itself, which said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's the proceeding itself that's closed that has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be redone.  And so the upshot of a courtroom closure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during an entire jury empanelment is that the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

empanelment has to happen again.  The idea is that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury empaneled behind closed doors is not a fair jury. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so it's the same sort of analysis that might arise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

in a Batson case.  The jury, not being fairly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

55 

constituted, the trial has to take --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about using it -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're going to distinguish among substantial -- among 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural errors, taking the standard out of Allano and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying those that seriously affect the fairness, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the -- if the procedural -- if the structural error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rises to meet that standard, then -- then you don't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to show prejudice.  But if it doesn't, then you'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better.  Now, that would harmonize the plain error and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this proceeding which can come up in the -- in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral proceeding. 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Yes.  So -- so I wanted to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

say a couple things that --

   

 

 

 

            

that? 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you think about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KIMBERLY:  I don't think that there's a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

basis in this Court's structural error precedence --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, that's true. 

  

 

 

 

MR. KIMBERLY:  -- for drawing --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But you're asking us --

  

 

 

 

 

 

you say, no, none.  Just take structural error as your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category, and -- and period, and that's it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, but they --

  

  

 

 

 

 

56 

they want -- and they want to go to the other extreme, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically.  But if we're cutting this child in two, what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about that as a standard? 

   

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  I -- I guess it's, at least 

    

   

 

 

 

 

as we understand what this Court has said about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structural errors, which is that they undermine -- and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should say, in particular, the public-trial right, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes to the very perception of the judiciary by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public and -- and undermines, in our view, certainly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and this Court said in Richmond Newspapers and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Press-Enterprises, that courtroom closures -- and those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, by the way, were --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But that's the third 

  

 

 

 

 

prong.  You're not answering Justice Breyer's question, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with respect.  That gets you past the third prong, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't get you home in an unpreserved error case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You still have to meet the fourth prong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  That's true.  To be clear, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

though, I mean, I think that would be true in a trial 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

error context as well.  That's just to say that the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Right. 

  

 

MR. KIMBERLY:  -- the two tests don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

overlap.  And so, yes, it is true that sometimes relief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be available on collateral review under Strickland,

even where it is not available on direct review under a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plain error standard.  But I -- I think that's --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Doesn't that seem highly 

  

 

 

 

 

unlikely?  I mean, a structural error, we think is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

important, but it isn't automatically a winner every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

single time if you don't preserve it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  May I answer? 

   

  

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Please. 

  

 

 

            

MR. KIMBERLY:  That's right, Your Honor.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

don't think there's anything particularly unseemly about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, because, again, that is exactly how the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approaches the exact same question in the context of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial errors.  It may be that a forfeited trial error 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

affects substantial rights and yet, it gets filtered out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at prong 4 of the Allano test --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Thank you. 

  

 

 

MR. KIMBERLY:  -- and -- and so that could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be raised on a Strickland basis, and counsel could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain -- the defendant could obtain relief in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context. 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
