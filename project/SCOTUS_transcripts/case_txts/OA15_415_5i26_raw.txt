CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  15­415,  Encino  Motorcars  v.  Navarro. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Clement. 

 

            

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  PAUL  D.  CLEMENT 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Service  advisors  are  salespeople  principally 

 

 

 

 

engaged  in  the  servicing  of  automobiles.  I  do  not  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  any  realistic  dispute  here  that  service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisors  are,  in  fact,  salespeople.  And  it  seems  clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me  that  service  advisors,  as  their  name  suggests,  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principally  engaged  in  the  servicing  of  automobiles. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thus,  under  the  plain  and  literal  terms, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  the  statutory  overtime  exemption,  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  are  exempt  because  the  statute  exempts  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

salesperson,  mechanic,  or  partsman  who  are  primarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged  in  selling  or  servicing  an  automobile,  a  truck, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  a  farm  implement. 

   

 

            

Now,  my  friends  on  the  other  side  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  concede  that  those  last  three  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nouns  ­­ automobiles,  trucks,  and  farm  implements  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  to  every  other  noun­verb  combination  in  the

statute.  So  they  don't  take  the  position,  for  example, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  trucks  and  farm  implements  only  go  with  servicing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  automobiles  only  goes  with  selling. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  they  do  take  the  position  that,  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  gerund  "selling,"  that  it  goes  uniquely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  salesmen,  and  therefore,  even  if  you  accept  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minute  that  there  is  a  class  of  people  who  exist  who  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

salesmen  primarily  engaged  in  the  servicing  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automobiles,  my  friends  would  say  they're  not  covered  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute. 

 

            

Now,  I  would  submit  that  the  statute  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  textual  indicators  of  breadth  that  suggests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  the  right  way  to  interpret  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  are  not  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Clement,  may  I  ask 

   

  

 

 

 

you,  what  is  the  significance  of  the  position  you  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking?  Does  it  have  any  real  consequences,  given  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  exemption  for  people  who  are  working  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commission? 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  It  ­­ it  does  ­­ it  does  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real­world  consequences,  Justice  Ginsburg,  principally 

 

 

 

 

for  those  service  advisors  who  right  now  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensated  on  a  commission  basis. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  what  ­­ in  ­­ in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

field,  what  percentage  of  service  advisors  are  not

commissioned  rather  than  salaried  employees? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Justice  Ginsburg,  I  don't  have 

   

  

 

 

 

a  specific  statistical  breakdown,  but  I'm  reliably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informed  that  it's  a  significant  number.  So  it's  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  almost  everybody  is  on  a  commissions  basis  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  couple  of  outliers  who  are  primarily  salaried. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

 

I  do  think  the  ­­ the  archetypical  service 

 

 

 

 

 

advisor  is  paid  on  a  commission  basis,  and  therefore  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  I  take  to  be  the  import  of  your  question  ­­ might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  qualify  under  the  207(i)  exemption  that's  generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  across  industries  to  commissioned 

 

 

 

 

individuals. 

            

But  there  are  significant  numbers  of 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  who  are  primarily  compensated  for  salary, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  like  it  that  way.  And  of  course,  as  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  is  aware,  these  Fair  Labor  Standard  Act  rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  waivable.  So  if  you  have  a  service  advisor 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

who's  been  paid  primarily  by  salary  and  likes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stability  that  comes  with  that,  they've  had  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  every  employee. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  What's  that? 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  every  employee 

  

 

 

 

who's  salaried.  They  ­­ if  they  want  a  job,  it's  a  job, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  unless  the  law  protected  them,  no  employer  would  pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overtime.

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  understand  that, 

   

  

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor.  I  was  ­­

    

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  don't  know  how  I  can 

    

   

 

 

 

take  from  the  fact  that  service  advisors  accept  what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  to  them  because  they  have  no  choice,  why  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prefer  not  to  have  overtime. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  don't  know  that  I  was  making 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that  strong  claim;  I  was  just  trying  to  be  responsive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  case  does  have  real­world  implications 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding  the  7(i)  exemption. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  what  example  ­­ what  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  we're  only  talking  about  those  of  the  ­­ the  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  sell  service  who  are  not  on  commission,  what  basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  there  for  giving  them  an  exception?  Do  they  work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regular  hours?  I  take  it  if  they  work  regular  hours  and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  aren't  paid  on  commission,  why  wouldn't  they  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated  like  secretaries  or  others? 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  apparently  Congress  thought  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanics  themselves  were  special  because  they  go  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  agricultural  areas  or  something  in  the  middle  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  night  and  fix  a  tractor.  So  ­­ so  they  work 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irregular  hours.  But  these  people  don't  work  irregular 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hours  and  they're  not  paid  on  commission.  So  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  they  be  treated  like  a  secretary  or  a  ­­ you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

see,  you've  got  my  question.

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  get  your  question.  I  think 

    

    

 

 

 

I  would  try  to  rephrase  it  slightly  by  saying  why  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  be  treated  differently  from  partsmen  or  mechanics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they're  also  paid  on  a  more  salaried  basis?  And  so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  don't  qualify  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  the  answer  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  partsmen  and  mechanics,  so  Congress  thought, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  agricultural  areas,  would  have  to  go  at  3:00  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

morning  to  fix  the  tractor,  and  that's  why  they  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  this  special  treatment.  And  ­­ and  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  still  true  or  not,  I  don't  know.  But  that's  why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  there  in  the  statute,  and  that  isn't  true  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service  salesmen. 

 

            

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Here,  Justice  Breyer  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  what  about  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  Yeah,  no,  I  do  want  to  be  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsive  to  that  because  I  do  think  whatever,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  Senator  Bayh  was  thinking  about  farm  implements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  in  the  day. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Right. 

  

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  think  today  there's  a  very 

    

   

 

 

 

good  reason  to  treat  the  service  advisors  the  same  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  partsmen  and  mechanics  for  purposes  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overtime  exception.  So  the  first  thing  to  focus  on  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  we  are  talking  about  an  exemption  under  the  FLSA

only  to  the  overtime  provisions.  So  however  you  decide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  minimum­wage  provisions  are  going  to  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  here's  the  reason  that  all  the  people  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  service  team,  the  partsmen,  the  mechanic  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service  advisors,  really  need  this  exemption.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

most  customers  of  auto  ­­ automobile  dealerships  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  service  themselves  work  pretty  regular  hours,  sort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  9:00  to  5:00,  Monday  through  Friday.  So  the  busy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  at  a  dealership  are  what  they  call  the  morning 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rush  and  the  afternoon  discharge  for  the  day.  And  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  on  Saturday,  over  90  percent  of  automobile 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealerships'  service  departments  are  open  on  Saturdays. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  with  respect  to  the  partsmen,  and  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  mechanics,  they  end  up  working  a  little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  40  hours  a  week,  because  they're  there  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  bit  earlier  than  most  people,  they  leave  a  little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit  later,  and  then  they're  there  on  Saturday. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  most  of  them  in  fact  are  paid  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partially  on  commission,  and  the  way  most  of  this  works 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  everybody,  the  partsmen,  the  mechanics  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales  advisors,  all  kind  of  share  in  the  commission.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  bring  in  a  certain  amount  of  sales,  they  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

share  in  that. 

 

 

            

So  as  a  practical  matter,  it  makes  an  awful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  sense  to  exempt  all  of  these  people  from  the

overtime  rules.  They're  all  paid  well.  They're  all 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

paid  above  the  minimum  wage,  which  is  ­­ the  exemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  apply  to  anyways  ­­ and  they  all  have  a  reason 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  work,  like,  about  50,  46  hours  a  week  instead  of  40 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hours  a  week.  And  it  would  be  very,  very  disruptive  to

to  pluck  you  out  and  you  alone  are  not  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exempt  from  the  overtime  rules. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  that  would  be  very  disruptive.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  industry  has  understandably  come  upon  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangements  during  the  three­plus  decades  when  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friends  at  the  Labor  Department  acquiesced  to  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangement  because  they  had  an  interpretive  regulation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  went  out  and  brought  some  enforcement  actions,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  though  it  was  the  Wage  and  Hour  Division  themselves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  litigating  these  cases,  they  could  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convince  a  single  Federal  judge  that  they  were  right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  their  interpretation  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  think  those  Federal  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But,  Mr.  Clement,  those 

  

 

 

 

 

courts  were  before  Chevron. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Oh,  they  were,  Justice

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  you  know,  I  take  less 

   

  

 

 

 

 

value  in  what  the  courts  said  because  every  one  of  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  the  provision  was  ambiguous. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  They  just  thought  that 

  

 

 

 

 

the  better  argument  ­­ this  was  before  Chevron  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favored  your  interpretation.  So  I'm  ­­ I'm  not  quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  that  ­­ that  it's  accurate  to  point  to  those  older 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  as  supporting  your  position  unequivocally. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  So  Justice  Sotomayor,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

it's  fair  to  take  the  older  cases  with  one  grain  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

salt,  but  I  wouldn't  take  it  with  two  or  three.  And  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  is  that  Chevron,  with  all  due  respect,  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invent  deference  to  agencies.  And  that's  why  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  important  to  recognize  that  all  those  early  cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  were  cases  that  were  enforcement  actions  brought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  Wage  and  Hour  Division.  And  they  weren't  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  where  a  private  party  was  coming  in. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  think  the  judges  in  that  case  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  cases,  when  they  were  sitting  there  listening  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Wage  and  Hour  Division  lawyers,  didn't  have  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference  in  mind  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  have  a  very  practical 

    

   

 

 

question.  Are  these  sales  advisors  specially  trained  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  way?  Do  they  go  to  mechanic  ­­ mechanic  school?

Do  they  ­­ how  are  they  trained? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  ­­ I'm  ­­ so  I'm  going  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  bit  out  of  the  record  here,  and  I  haven't  read 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  that's  directly  on  point.  My  strong  suspicion, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

though,  is  that  there  are  these  kind  of  academies  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  put  together,  including  by  the  National  Automobile 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dealers  Association.  And  they  would  get  some  training 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  included  both  sales  training  but  also  some  training 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  some  diagnostic.  But  I'm  ­­ I  want  to  be  candid  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  ­­ that's  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Because,  to  be  candid 

  

 

 

 

 

with  you,  it  scares  me  to  think  that  every  time  I  take 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  car  to  a  dealer,  that  a  non­mechanic  is  telling  me 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  wrong  with  it. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well  ­­ and  I  understand  that, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

but  I  think  that's  actually  why  these  people  may  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonmechanics,  but  they're  not  outside  the  servicing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lane. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  And  there  are  costs  for  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  for  the  dealers.  This  is  something  that,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  I'm  more  familiar  with.  There  are  real  costs  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  dealership  if  the  original  diagnostic  is  wrong  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  end  up  ordering  the  wrong  part.  All  of  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stuff  that  they  do  try  to  minimize.

And  I  do  think  ­­ to  get  back  to  the  Chevron 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  though  ­­ it's  also  worth  recognizing  that  two  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  cases  that  have  rejected  the  Labor  Department's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  were  post­Chevron  cases,  both  the  Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  decision  in  Walton  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  now  the  Labor 

  

 

 

 

 

Department  had  a  chance  to  rethink.  Originally  they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

said  that  these  people,  these  salespeople  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exempt.  And  then  there  were  these  ­­ the  letter,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  letter  and  the  handbook.  And  then  in  ­­ was  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2011  or  2012? 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  2011. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  They  said  now  we're  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  rethink  this,  and  our  decision  is  that  we  were  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  time,  that  these  people  are  not  exempt.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  decision  is  made  in  the  Chevron  era  when  we  defer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  expert,  and  this  Department  of  Labor  is  certainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert  in  this  area. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  Justice  Ginsburg,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

don't  think  what  the  agency  did  in  2011  merits  Chevron 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference.  And  the  Labor  Department  of  course  asked  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference,  but  they're  ­­ they're  studiously  vague  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they'd  like  you  to  defer  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  look  at  what  they  did  in  2011,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  there's  anything  you  can  really  defer  to

there.  Because  up  until  2011,  the  interpretive  rights 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  date  back  to  1970  had  a  specific  provision,  (c)(4), 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  addressed  service  advisors,  and  it  explained  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale  why  service  advisors  weren't  exempt.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  was  particularly  persuasive  to  any  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts,  but  at  least  there  was  something  that  addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service  advisors  specifically. 

 

 

            

Now,  in  2011  in  the  process  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice­and­comment  rulemaking,  they  actually  removed 

 

 

 

 

that  entirely.  So  the  interpretive  regs  no  longer  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  that  addresses  the  service  advisors 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically.  So  they're  now  relying  only  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  in  (c)(1)  that  addresses  salesmen  and  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

salesman  is  somebody  who  sells  a  car,  which  we  think  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  incomplete  recognition  of  what  the  statute  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says. 

            

But  what  I'm  making  is  really  two  points.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  they're  really  entitled  to,  in  2011,  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  out  of  the  regs  and  then  all  of  a  sudden  say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  because  we  took  them  out  of  the  regs  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice­and­comment  rulemaking,  we  now  get  Chevron 

 

 

 

 

 

deference  where  previously  we  might  not  have. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  I  don't  understand 

    

   

 

 

that.  I  mean,  it's  kind  of  the  case  for  Chevron 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference  and  notice­and­comment  rulemaking.  They

clearly  considered  exactly  this  question.  They  made  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  on  it.  They  have  effected  that  judgment  within 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  notice­and­comments  setting.  I  mean,  if  that's  not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Chevron,  what  is? 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  two  things,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  I  want  to  remind  you  that  if  this  statute  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear,  you  don't  get  to  Chevron. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Of  course. 

  

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  But  two  things  cause  Chevron. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Here  is  the  first,  which  is,  I  would  agree  with  you  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  did  is  at  the  end  of  the  notice­and­comment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulemaking,  they  came  up  with,  say,  a  new  definition  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"servicing,"  and  that  informed  why  they  came  up  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  that  they  did,  but  that's  not  what  they  did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  came  up  with  a  decision  that  took  out  the  provision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  specifically  addressed  service  advisors,  and  then  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single  paragraph  of  the  preamble  to  the  notice  ­­ to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules,  because  there's  nothing  in  the  rules  that  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addresses  it  anymore. 

 

 

            

So  the  only  thing  you  can  look  to  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preamble.  It's  on  pages  C5  and  C6  of  the  Appendix  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  red  brief.  There  is  one  paragraph  there  that  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sum  total  of  their  explanation.  I  think  it's  worth  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read,  Your  Honor,  because  what  it  principally  says  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  doing  this  because  we  don't  think  the  statute

covers  it,  which  is  not  really  the  kind  of  explanation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  think  ought  to  get  them  something  other  than  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  means. 

 

 

            

            

And  then  this  is  my  second  point  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yeah.  Because  the  first  one 

  

  

 

 

 

 

is  not  so  good.  The  first  ­­ I  mean,  agencies  do  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  time.  They  say,  this  is  the  way  we  read  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  This  is  the  way  we  want  to  read  the  statute. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  this  Court  has  never  been  in  the  business  of  saying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oh,  when  you  think  that  the  statute  says  something,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  get  deference.  Whereas  when  you  think  the  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ambiguous  but  you  give  other  reasons,  you  do  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference.  I  mean,  that  would  be  a  ­­ a  completely 

    

   

   

 

 

 

unadministrable  line  to  use. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  want 

   

   

  

 

 

 

to  quibble  too  long  with  you  on  that.  I  don't  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  unadministrable  at  all.  This  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  the  exact  same  principal  in  the  hour  context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  to  say  that  if  all  you  do  is  parrot  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  then  that  doesn't  really  gain  you  any  extra 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference,  and  I  think  all  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  This  is  not  parroting  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  This  is  saying  we  read  this  statute  in  a  way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  we  think  is  better  than  another  way.

second  one.  I  would  just  say,  though,  I  do  think  it's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

worth  reading  that  paragraph  on  C5  and  C6,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  in  the  unique  circumstance,  and  this  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segue  to  my  second  point,  in  this  is  a  unique 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance  where  every  Court  that  has  looked  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  since  you  first  took  the  position  that  it  meant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

X,  has  said,  no,  it  means  not  X.  To  then,  just  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  had  a  rule  ­­ a  notice­and­comment  rulemaking, 

   

   

 

 

 

which,  by  the  way,  started  with  the  proposal  to  codify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rule  that  all  the  courts  had  adopted,  just  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  process  you  say,  well,  we  still  think  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  better  view,  I  don't  think  that's  enough  to  get  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference.  But  even  if  you  disagree  with  me  so  far,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  I  do  think  Fox,  and  State  Farm  before  it,  say  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  an  agency  is  changing  its  position,  it  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account  for  the  reliance  interests  that  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engendered.  And  you'll  see  nothing  in  that  paragraph 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  fact  that,  well,  for  33  years,  we,  the  Labor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department,  agree  that  this  was  clear  the  other  way  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So,  I  mean,  the  question  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

on  the  reliance  interests,  if  you  think  people  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relying  and  will  be  punished  for  that  reliance.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  the  question  to  you  is,  well,  why  would  that  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so?  Because  this  rule  applies  not  retroactively  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  prospectively,  and  there  is  a  particular  provision

in  the  Portal­to­Portal  Act,  which  essentially  says  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  relied  on  an  old  interpretation,  don't  worry.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't  be  subject  to  any  damages  with  respect  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation. 

            

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  So  two  points  on  that,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

Honor.  The  first  is,  just  to  be  clear,  the  complaint  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  was  filed  in  September  2012.  It  didn't  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we  hereby  seek  damages  only  after  the  May  2011 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective  date  of  the  regulation.  So  in  terms  of  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  facing  with  here,  I  mean,  you'd  at  least  have  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trim  it  back  based  on  the  Portal­to­Portal  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision. 

            

But  here's  the  reason  I  think  even  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

nonresponsive  to  what  the  dynamic  here  is.  And  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  unique  dynamic,  I'll  grant  you.  With  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquiescently  circuit  cases.  I  mean,  my  ­­ my  clients 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  the  Ninth  Circuit,  but  I  think  this  is  even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearer. 

            

Think  about  a  dealership  in  the  Fourth  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fifth  Circuits,  okay?  They  already  have  circuit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent  that  says  that  the  service  advisors  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exempt.  Now,  if  all  the  agency  does  in  a  rulemaking  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  gosh,  darn  it,  we  still  think  we  have  the  better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view,  what  are  they  supposed  to  do?  Are  they  really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  change  their  operations  overnight  and

conform  to  this,  even  though  they  have  an  extant  circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent  that  says  they're  right  and  the  Labor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department's  wrong?  And  that  is  what,  at  least  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrow  circumstance,  makes  this  different.  I  mean,  if 

    

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  come  in  and  say,  boy,  we  are  going  to  come  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  a  whole  new  C4,  and  we  are  going  to  have  a  new 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation  for  why  these  guys  are  exempt,  then  maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  auto  dealers  in  the  Fourth  and  Fifth  Circuit  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  well,  this  is  a  whole  new  day.  Maybe  we  better 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  our  practices. 

 

 

            

But  I  would  have  a  hard  time  advising  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

client  in  the  Fourth  or  Fifth  Circuit  that  you  ought  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  your  practices,  notwithstanding  that  Walton  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  on  the  books,  notwithstanding  that  the  Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  decision  is  still  on  the  books. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  suspect,  Mr. 

   

  

 

 

Clement,  you  would  say  to  your  clients,  you  know,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  taking  a  risk  because  now  the  agency  has  changed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  minds.  And  so  going  forward,  don't  worry.  You're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

off  the  hook  with  respect  to  everything  you've  done  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  past.  But  going  forward,  given  this  doctrine  called 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chevron  Deference,  the  agency  is  going  to  get  a  thumb  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  scales,  and  it's  very  possible  that  you're  going  to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  be  subject  to  damages  if  you  keep  doing  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  doing.

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  Justice  Kagan,  I  try  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

be  a  careful  lawyer.  So  I  probably  would  tell  my 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

clients  there  is  now  some  additional  risk  than  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before.  But,  boy,  if  you  have  a  lot  of  workers  who 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  like  the  fact  that  they  are  compensated  mostly  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

salary  and  they're  service  advisors,  I'm  not  sure  I'd  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  all  of  the  trouble  of  reorienting  all  of  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  putting  them  on  a  commission  basis  so  we  can  get  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  7(i)  and  get  the  benefit  of  that  exemption  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  Labor  Department  has  told  us  that  after  33 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  of  acquiescence,  that  when  they  had  an  NPR  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told  us  they  were  going  to  codify  their  acquiescence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  changed  their  mind  on  no  better  analysis  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  simply  say,  you  know,  we  like  our  position  back  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1970.  I  would  probably  tell  them  if  you  want  to  be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really,  really  careful,  you  should  change  your  policy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  I  like  our  chances  in  the  courts. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  would  tell  them  as  well,  that  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

worry  too  much  about  Chevron,  because  I  really  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  statute  is  ambiguous  at  all.  I  think  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

literal  reading  of  the  statute  makes  it  crystal  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  you  are  a  salesman  primarily  engaged  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing  automobiles,  you  come  within  the  plain  terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  statute.  "Or"  means  "or"  in  that  context.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  in  ­­ in  the  course  of  advising  them,  I  would

have  come  across  the  Reddendo  canon  last  used  by  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  in  1918,  I  would  have  said,  well,  don't  worry 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  that  either  because  what  the  Reddendo  canon,  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  does  is  it  says,  when  you're  reading  a  statute  and  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  a  bunch  of  nouns  separated  by  "or"  and  a  bunch  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verbs  separated  by  "or"  and  you  apply  them  all  as  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should,  if  you  get  to  something  that  just  is  a  barking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cat,  there  is  just  no  such  thing,  then  all  the  Reddendo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

canon  says  is,  don't  lose  a  lot  of  sleep  over  it.  Go  on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  next  noun/verb  combination  and  continue  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret  the  statute.  Don't  like  completely  reorder 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  you're  thinking  about  the  statute  and  say  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  came  across  a  barking  cat,  I  could  put  the 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

first  noun  with  the  first  verb  and  the  second  noun  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  second  verb  and,  well,  if  I  had  two  ­­ three  nouns 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  two  verbs,  I  ­­ I  don't  know  what  I'd  do  ­­ throw  up

There  was  something  in  the  submissions  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  said  the  service  advisors  are  working  a

average,  to  15  hours  more. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Yeah.  Justice  ­­

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Is  that  incorrect? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  think  what  I  recall 

   

   

  

 

 

from  the  complaint  is  it  was  ­­ is  that  it  was  7:00  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6:00,  and  so  that  would  still  get  you  ­­ if  you  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rotate  them  around,  that  might  get  you  a  55­hour 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

workday.  What  I  was  doing  on  the  46  hours  is  I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  in  the  National  Automobile  Dealers  Association 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus  brief  as  the  average  kind  of  system­wide. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Were  ­­ in  1966,  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  service  advisors  in  existence? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Yes,  there  were. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  were  they  paid  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

same  way  as  now?  Were  they  salaried,  or  commissioned? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  think  there  was  a  mix  back 

    

   

 

 

 

 

then,  as  there  is  now. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  went  to  the  Dictionary 

    

 

 

 

 

of  Occupations,  which  was  in  existence  in  1966,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears  to  have  different  entries  for  salesmen,  service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisors,  partsmen,  mechanic.  Do  I  read  something  from 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  ­­ or  should  I  read  something,  or  why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  I  read  something  ­­ from  the  fact  that  Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew  that  these  different  positions  existed,  they  were

and  it  decided  to  use  only  "salesmen,"  which  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dictionary  meant  a  salesperson  of  cars;  a  "partsmen," 

   

   

 

 

 

which  was  defined  the  way  one  would  think;  and  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"mechanic,"  but  it  didn't  include  sales  advisors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  here's  what  I  would  say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  you  should  read  into  that,  Justice  Sotomayor,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  you  should  read  into  the  fact  that  Congress  used  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term  "any"  and  "any  salesmen,"  and  then  modified  it  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  by  selling  vehicles,  but  also  by  servicing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vehicles,  to  think  that  Congress  didn't  need  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separately  add  the  service  advisors  in,  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  already  covered  by  the  language  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  also  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  they  thought  it 

  

 

 

 

 

important.  The  partsmen  could  arguably  service 

  

 

 

 

 

automobiles  because  they  provide  the  parts  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automobile,  yet  Congress  found  the  need  to  be  explicit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  to  add  partsmen.  Why  wouldn't  it  have  ­­ if  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended  to  include  service  advisors  as  opposed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanics  and  partsmen,  why  didn't  it  use  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occupational  term?  It's  a  term  of  art. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  Justice  Sotomayor,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

don't  think  if  they  had  omitted  the  partsmen,  I  think  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  an  awfully  hard  argument  to  say  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partsmen  are  mechanics.  I  mean,  you  could  make  it,  and,

you  know,  I'm  not  so  sure  I  wouldn't  try,  but  I  think  it
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  much  harder  argument  than  to  say  that  the
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service  advisors  are  covered  by  the  term  ­­


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Except  the  dictionary
 

  

 

 

 

doesn't  use  the  words  ­­ the  functions  as  functions  of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling  a  car.  And  ­­ and  it  doesn't  use  the  word
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"service"  in  a  traditional  sense.  It  says  it's  going  to
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluate  cars,  it's  going  to  give  the  work  to  mechanics,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it  doesn't  use  the  word  "servicing"  a  car.
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Which  doesn't,  the  ­­


  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  occupational
 

  

 

 

handbook.
 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  mean,  I  guess  I  would
 

   

   

   

  

 

still  say,  though,  the  question  ­­ I'd  make 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  points, 

 

one  I've  already  made,  which  is  I  do  think, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  they 

 

used  any  salesman,  I  think  they  thought  that 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

they 

already  had  it  covered. 

 

 

 

            

The  second  thing  I  would  say  is 

   

 

 

 

 

   

I  think  if 

 

they  were  going  to  include  service  advisors 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the 

 

statute,  I  think  what  the  statute  would  say 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  exactly 

 

what  it  says  now,  which  is  it  would  say  "any 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

salesman, 

service  advisor,  partsman,  or  mechanic  engaged"  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

"primarily  engaged  in"  ­­ "in  selling  or  servicing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automobiles,"  trucks,  or  farm  implements. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  what  I  think  that  shows  is  that  there's

nothing  at  all  unnatural  to  say  that  the  service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisors  are  primarily  engaged  in  servicing  automobiles. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  what  they  do.  They're  part  of  the  servicing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process. 

            

The  way  I  would  think  about  this  is  if  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imagine  a  very  small  automobile  dealership  and  they  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  person  in  the  service  department.  That  person  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  come  out.  They're  going  to  greet  the  customer. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're  going  to  work  with  the  customer  to  diagnose  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  problem  is. 

 

 

            

Once  they  figure  out  what  the  problem  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they'll  give  them  an  estimate.  Then  if  they  have  to  fix 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  part,  they'll  go  in  the  back,  they'll  grab  the  part, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  they'll  take  the  part,  and  then  they'll  put  it  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  car  and  they'll  fix  the  part.  And  then  they'll  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  and  talk  to  the  customer  and  tell  them  what  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did. 

            

Now,  in  a  modern  automobile  dealership,  all 

   

 

 

 

 

of  that  is  done  by  three  different  people  working  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

team.  And  it  seems  to  me  quite  clear  that  the  service 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisors  are  part  of  that  servicing  process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Indeed,  my  friends  on  the  other  side  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost  give  us  that,  which  is  to  say  ­­ they  seem  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  close  to  saying  that  if  the  statute  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"salesman...  primarily  engaged  in"  the  servicing

process,  they  would  grant  us  that  the  ­­ that  the  sales 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisors  are  covered. 

 

 

              

I  mean,  they  can  quibble  if  they  want,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  way  I  read  the  position.  They  simply  say, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  statute  doesn't  say  "process."  And  so  what  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  in  mind  is  the  statute  must  mean  something  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrow  by  servicing.  This  is  that  you  have  to  be  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  hood  or  grease  under  your  nails  or  something  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

And  the  big  problem  with  that  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partsmen.  The  partsmen  are  no  more  in  the  main,  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  hood,  or  getting  their  nails  dirty  by  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing  the  automobile,  but  they  are  an  integral  part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  servicing  process.  And  because  they're  covered, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  we  know  that  Congress  used  the  term  "servicing" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  more  capacious  sense  and  not  in  some  narrow  sense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  have  to  do  the  servicing  personally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

If  I  could  reserve  the  balance  in  my  time.

partsmen  and  mechanics  who  service  cars.  Service 

  

 

 

 

 

 

advisors  don't  sell  cars.  Nor  do  they  service  cars, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  requires  automotive  manual  labor.  They  merely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

write  up  paperwork. 

 

 

            

Petitioner's  argument  fails  for  three 

 

 

 

 

reasons:  First,  selling  services  is  not  the  same  thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  servicing.  Petitioner's  argument  is  an  end­run 

  

 

 

 

 

 

around  the  statute's  three  direct  objects  of  selling: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cars,  trucks,  and  farm  implements.  Selling  services  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  listed. 

 

            

Second  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Could  you  pick  up  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Clement  left  off?  What  would  be  the  ­­ what  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  for  covering  partsmen? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  Several.  The 

  

  

  

 

 

 

first  one  is,  unlike  service  advisors,  they're  expressly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

named  in  the  statute. 

 

 

 

            

Secondly,  they're  working  as  mechanics' 

 

 

 

 

right­hand  men  or  women.  Some  partsmen  grind  down  parts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  build  them  up.  Some  use  calipers  and  measure  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  fit  on  cars.  Some  of  them  remanufacture  parts. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  use  brake  drum  lathes  and  engine  head  grinders  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valve  refacers. 

 

            

Even  those  who  are  not  are  involved  with  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  mechanics  in  requisitioning  and  dispensing  parts.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  as  to  those  who  are 

  

 

 

 

 

not,  as  to  those  who  obtain  parts,  don't  change  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parts,  supply  the  correct  part  to  the  mechanic,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  still  be  engaged  in  servicing  automobiles,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say? 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  If  they  are  physically 

  

 

 

 

 

dispensing  the  parts,  handing  them  over,  and  doing  so  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sync  with  the  mechanic's  work.  So  take  a  transmission 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

job.  If  an  automatic  transmission  is  being  redone,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partsman  has  to  know  that  the  mechanic  first  needs  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

build  the  clutch  units.  So  he  first  dispenses  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clutch  disks  and  plates  and  the  clutch  drum  bushings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  mechanic  is  working  on  them.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

partsman  goes  back,  gets  the  remainder  of  the  automatic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transmission  assembly,  and  goes  and  hands  them  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanic.  This  is  a  back  and  forth.  It's  a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

mechanic­facing  role,  not  a  customer­facing  role. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yes.  They  are  ­­ they  are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

more  closely  connected  with  the  actual  repairs  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

car.  There's  no  question  about  that.  But  they  are  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged  in  manual  labor.  That  type  of  partsman  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged  in  actually  doing  anything  physically  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

car. 

            

So  if  they  are  covered,  if  that's  ­­ if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing  automobiles  includes  that,  then  you  have  to

explain  why  the  line  is  drawn  between  that  activity  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  activity  of  the  ­­ of  the  employees  who  are  at  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  I  have  a  couple  of  responses. 

    

   

 

 

 

The  first  one  is  if  there's  a  line  to  be  drawn,  that  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course  is  for  the  agency. 

 

 

 

 

            

Secondly,  I  would  say  that  they  are  engaged 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  dictionary  definition,  repairing  or  maintaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automobiles.  And  in  the  reply  belief,  at  page  11, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  comes  very  close  to  conceding,  well,  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  repairing  in  the  way  that  repairing  ­­ servicing  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  in  several  other  statutes  that  we  cite.  But  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory  is  they  are  part  of  this  general  process,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integral  on  core  sales  and  service,  which  they're  adding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  statute. 

 

 

            

The  only  way  that  Petitioner  manages  to  add 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  to  the  statute  is  saying  that  the  phrase  "engaged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in"  somehow  broadens  the  ordinary  meaning  of  servicing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  it  doesn't,  for  three  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  dictionary  definitions  cited  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

government  engaged  in  means  employed  in  or  taking  part. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  then  Petitioner  falls  back  and  says,  well,  the  FLSA, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  uses  "engaged  in"  means  something  broader.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite  a  definition  provision,  203(j)  in  the  reply  brief. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  they  say  that  the  definition  means  that  "engaged  in"

includes  any  closely­related  process. 

 

 

 

            

So  we  pulled  the  actual  subsection  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  precisely  the  opposite  of  that.  It  does  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  separate  definitions  of  "produced"  and  "engaged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  producing,"  as  Petitioner's  quotation  suggests.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defines  "produced"  equal  as  "engaged  in  the  production 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  goods"  if  the  subject  is  engaged  in  doing  the  action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  what  that  section  says  that  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadens  it  is  language  Petitioner  doesn't  quote.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  "An  employee  shall"  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  Can  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

tell  us  where  you're  reading  from,  if  this  is  available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  us? 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Okay.  This  is  29  U.S.C.  203(j). 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

It's  the  Petitioner's  reply  brief  at  page  11. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  But  the  ­­ they  don't  quote  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section  of  full.  If  you  look  at  29  U.S.C.  203(j),  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  "An  employee  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  engaged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  production  if  employed  in  a  related  process."  It  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  deeming  that  sweeps  in  closely  related  processes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  the  language  of  "engaged." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  we  look  at  this  Court's  case  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting  that  very  provision.  So  this  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted  that  provision  as  contrasting  the  narrower

phrase,  "actually  engaged  in  production,"  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broader  phrase,  "every  process  or  occupation  affecting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

production."  That's  this  Court's  case,  Farmers 

  

 

 

 

 

Reservoir,  337  U.S.  at  759  to  60. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  far  from  proving  that  "engaged  in"  opens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  door  to  the  ill­defined  "process  of  servicing," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  203(j)  and  this  Court's  precedent  confirm  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  does  not  broaden  the  verb  "servicing."  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"servicing"  means  repairs,  maintenance,  and  similar 

 

 

 

 

 

automotive  manual  labor. 

 

 

            

Now  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  is  it  just  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  suspect  it  differs  from  place  to  place  and  how  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  they  have  and  all  that,  but  why  is  it  ­­ I  mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  these  the  people  that  when  you  go  in,  and  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  go  and  say  the  car's  making  a  funny  noise  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something,  do  they  go  out  and  look  at  the  car,  listen  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  noise?  What's  it  ­­ I  mean,  that  seems  to  me  to  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  like  a  process.  And  then  they  go  to  the  mechanic 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say,  well,  you  need  to  do  this,  or  you  want  to  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  this  or  whatever. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BIBAS:  So  my  understanding  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No.  I'm  just  trying 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ you  earlier  said  they're  just  doing  paperwork,  and

with  that  and  how  much  they  do  the  other. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Right.  So  my  understanding  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  the  important  difference  between  service  advisors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  partsmen,  to  answer  both  questions  together,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service  advisor  is  a  customer­facing  role.  He's 

   

  

 

 

 

advising  the  customer,  not  advising  the  mechanic.  Goes

symptoms  the  customer  says;  it's  making  a  squealing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

noise,  or  it's  not  driving  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  only  in  that  sense  is  he  recording 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  with  the  automobile.  He's  not  going  under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hood.  He's  not  taking  parts  apart.  He's  not  rendering 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  final  diagnosis  on  which  the  work  will  be  based.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relays  that  information  back.  It's  the  mechanic  who

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  first  thing  he  does  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  you  an  estimate.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  ­­ both  in  cost  and  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time,  and  make  recommendations  for,  well,  maybe  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  replace  it,  and  it  would  cost  you  X  dollars. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  ­­ so  just  to  say  that  he  puts  something  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  up  to  the  mechanic,  that's  incorrect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  You  are  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  ­­ he's  giving  a  preliminary  estimate  based  on  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  squealing  noise  means  you  need  a  new  timing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belt.  That's  how  much  it  would  cost.  Have  you  had  your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brakes  done,  et  cetera? 

 

 

 

            

But  it  goes  back  to  the  mechanic.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanic  may  come  back  and  say,  no,  actually,  you  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  overhaul  or  something  else,  after  going  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hood. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  don't  mean  to  be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

too  particular,  but  if  there's  a  squealing  sound  and  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  be  the  fan  belt,  you're  saying  he's  not  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open  the  hood  and  look  at  the  fan  belt? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Well,  he's  not  ­­ he's  not  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  measuring  the  tension  on  the  fan  belt,  touching 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fan  belt,  doing  any  of  that.  That's  back  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shop  bay.  For  liability  reasons,  they  can't  do  the  work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  front.  The  insurance  requires  all  of  that  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  in  the  back,  is  my  understanding.

MR.  BIBAS:  The  question  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  how  would  you 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

describe  what  this  employee  is  engaged  in?  You  say  he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  engaged  in  selling  cars  and  he's  not  engaged  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing  cars.  So  what  is  it,  what  other  category  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  other  than  selling  and  servicing? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  There  are  people  in  auto 

  

 

 

 

 

 

dealership  who  do  lots  of  things  that  might  be  part  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  process.  The  Petitioner  leaves  the  impression 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  are  three  or  four  kinds  of  employees  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  just  carving  one  out  from  an  otherwise  exempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unit.  There  are  at  least  20  categories  of  employees  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  service  department,  as  the  Machinists'  brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explains.  There  are  dozens  of  kinds  of  employees  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales  Department,  in  parts,  in  used  cars,  in  leasing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  they  may  be  engaged  in  this  selling  of  services, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  even  if  they  are,  selling  services  is  not  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  servicing. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Suppose  you  say  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

phone  them  up  and  you  say,  I'd  like  the  servicing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department,  please. 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Someone  answers  the  phone, 

  

 

 

 

 

hello.  Who  are  you?  I'm  ­­ I'm  ­­ I'm  the  service  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  do  you  call  those  persons?

MR.  BIBAS:  Service  advisor. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah,  service  advisor.  Are 

  

  

 

 

 

            

            

you  engaged  in  servicing?  Why  would  I  be  here  if  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  engaged  in  servicing?  I'd  be  over  in  the  selling 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department. 

              

 

I  think  you  read  this  either  way,  frankly. 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  I  ­­ I  don't  really  ­­ I  can't  get  too  far  with 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language,  which  is  why  I  have  a  question  which  isn't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

related  to  language. 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  I  would  say  if  ­­ if  you  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  clear,  of  course  Chevron  deference  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah,  well,  that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

question.  And  I  don't  hold  you  responsible  for  knowing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

every  word  I've  written  in  every  case,  but  still,  I  did 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Fox  make  a  point  of  an  administrative  rule  that  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  important,  an  administrative  law  rule,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  an  agency  changes  its  mind,  it  should  explain  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  probably  in  Fox  thought  that  more  than  many  of  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

colleagues.  All  right? 

  

 

            

Given  my  position  there,  and  here  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  agency  going  along  and  issuing  a  manual  where  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  the  opposite  of  what  you're  saying  now.  And  then  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  what  happened  when  after  30  years  they  changed  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind.  And  I  ­­ I  thought  Mr.  Clement  was  right,  and  if 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  read  their  reason,  their  reason  happens  to  be  this:

The  Fourth  Circuit  says  the  opposite,  but  we  think  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  know  they  didn't  use  those  words,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  wouldn't  call  that  or  the  equivalent  a  reason.  And  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  is  there  somewhere  in  this  document,  C1  through, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  5,  is  there  somewhere  a  reason  why  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed  their  mind  other  than,  oh,  we  think  this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better  interpretation?  Because  that  doesn't  address  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problem  that  I  thought  was  at  issue  in  Fox.  And  if  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  to  use  one  word  to  describe  that  problem,  it  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  they've  used.  It's  called  reliance.  I'm  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying  it  predominates,  but  doesn't  the  agency  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  address  it? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Your  Honor,  there  are  about  four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  in  there,  if  I  might  take  them  in  turn. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  asked  about  your  own  writing  and  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  position  on  reliance.  I'd  point  to  your  own  opinion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Long  Island  Care,  where  first  of  all  you  took  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  that  intermediate  agency  enforcement  changes 

 

 

 

 

 

its  set  of  rules,  and  it's  ­­ Smiley,  the  Court  said  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  thing  ­­ don't  count  as  changes  of  position  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  place. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  ­­ that's  a  good  point, 

    

   

 

 

 

and  I  don't  know  how  absolute  we  ought  to  be  there. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  the  reason  this  is  now  facing  me  with  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  Of  course  they  can't  do  everything  for  every

employee  in  the  agency,  and  they  get  all  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informal  advice.  It's  a  practical  problem. 

   

  

 

 

            

But  here  we  have  a  kind  of  extreme, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

30  years,  manuals,  noting  explicitly  that  it's  a  change 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  position.  I  mean,  it's  not  just  one  part  of  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  can't  always  be  consistent  with  every  other  part, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  that's  exactly  what  you  put  your  finger  on  that  I  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  I  asked  the  question. 

   

 

 

            

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  the  fact  that  I  said  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  way  that  time  at  most  is  going  to  show  I'm  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  perfectly  consistent,  which  is  ­­ I'll  admit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  I  think  Your  Honor  was  also 

    

 

 

 

 

 

correct  in  saying  in  Long  Island  Care  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice­and­comment  rulemaking  process  makes  any  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential  for  any  unfair  surprise  unlikely. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's  also  quite  noteworthy  in  the  reliance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area  that,  as  the  professor's  brief  pointed  out,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several  days  after  the  April  2011  rule  was  promulgated, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  before  its  effective  date,  counsel  below  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners  and  a  number  of  other  law  firms  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners'  amicus  in  that  were  all  publicizing  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members:  This  new  rule  came  out.  It's  becoming 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

effective  in  a  month.  You  need  to  take  account  of  that.

that  was  about  the  basis  for  the  rulemaking  and  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes  in  position.  It's  not  just  the  paragraph  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  C5  to  C6  of  our  brief.  The  two  pages  before  that,

the  position  that  the  agency  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  give  me  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pages  where  it's  in  your  brief? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  The  back  of  the  red  brief.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages  C3  to  C6  is  the  reasoning.  So  at  the  bottom  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C5,  the  agency  says  "and  as  commentators  point  out,"  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  incorporating  by  reference  the  two  pages  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comments  discussion  that  preceded  it.  And  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

previous  pages,  such  as  page  C4,  several  of  the  amici  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry,  no,  the  commenters  point  out  there  are  line 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawing  problems  here:  These  are  not  classic  mechanics 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  servicers.  They  are  just  coordinating.  They  have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  administrative  function.  They're  not  ­­ just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  they're  integrated  doesn't  make  them  in  fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling  or  servicing.  In  essence  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  did  they  change?  As 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  commentators  point  out,  then  they  go  on  to  say  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  in  that  sentence  that  the  commentators  point  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  I  agree,  other  people  agreed  with  them,  sure,  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true.  But  the  question  is,  why  the  change?

And  I  do  get  this.  We  changed  it  because  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  we're  more  consistent  than  the  statute  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  used  to  think  that  was  consistent  with  the  statute.

between  warranty  work  versus  non­warranty  work  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumably  the  warranty  work  was  sold  previously  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not  selling  it  now.  And  there  are  administrative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems  with  drawing  these  kinds  of  lines.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cleaner  and  simpler  for  the  agency  to  revisit  the  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  first  time  with  notice­and­comment  rulemaking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say,  let's  just  treat  these  people  as  a  class  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  require  bookkeeping  of  what's  warranty  versus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonwarranty  work. 

 

            

So  when  NELA  makes  the  line  drawing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference  in  there,  I  think  that's  what  it's  referring

They're  selling  the  servicing  of  vehicles. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  I  might:  Mr.  Clement 

   

  

  

 

 

suggested  that  you  might  be  seeking  damages  for  pre­2011 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct.  Are  you? 

  

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Our  complaint  was  filed  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

September  2012.  The  two­year  limitations  period  goes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  September  2010.  We  have  noted  that  as  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  before  the  effective  date  of  this  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation,  May  5,  2011,  the  Portal­to­Portal  Act  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  pled  and  it  could  perhaps  be  proven.  That's  an  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  remand;  it's  not  in  this  case  at  this  stage.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  dealt  with  this  issue,  and  there's  nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactive  about  applying  a  2011  regulation. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  that  the  good­faith 

  

 

 

 

 

reliance  provision? 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Yes,  that's  29  U.S.C.  259. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  is  that  applicable  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  an  open  issue  on  remand? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  That's  an  issue  ­­ it  hasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  pled;  it's  an  open  issue  on  remand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  that's  both  as  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pre­2011  and  post  ­­ post­2011  damages? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  It's  not  ­­ not  as  to  post  May

5,  2011,  because  the  opinion  letter  has  no  force  past 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  effective  date  of  the  new  regulation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  You  were 

  

  

 

 

 

 

about  to  say  there's  nothing  retroactive  about  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  About  applying  a  2011  regulation 

   

  

 

 

 

to  post­2011  conduct.  The  only  ­­ the  government's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  deals  with  this.  Well,  that  the  kinds  of  serious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliance  interest  that  count  for  these  purposes  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  penalties  or  civil  penalties  on  actions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  already  done  before  the  regulation.  And  that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

damages  you're  seeking  before  2011? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  The  Portal­to­Portal  Act  may 

  

 

 

 

 

well  be  a  defense  in  that  situation  if  they  can  plead 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  prove  reliance. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  May  I  ask  ­­

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you  are  seeking 

  

 

 

 

 

damages? 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  We  have  a  damages  claim,  but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

they  have  a  defense. 

   

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  even 

  

 

 

 

 

though  the  regulation  took  ­­ the  regulation  had  changed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  interpretation  that  took  effect  2011? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  The  notice­and­comment 

  

 

 

regulation  took  effect  May  5th,  2011.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  that  changed  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Department  understanding  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  It  maintained  the  former 

  

 

 

 

 

regulation;  it  rescinded  the  enforcement  materials  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  they  would  not  enforce  during  that  period  of  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  the  Department 

  

 

 

 

 

said  ­­ I  just  want  to  get  ­­ the  Department  said  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  enforce  prior  to  2011? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Yes. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  yet  you  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  they  should  be  liable  for  damages? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  No,  there's  the  Portal­to­Portal 

  

 

 

 

 

Act  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  putting 

  

 

 

 

aside  ­­ that's  a  defense.  You're  saying,  well,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

might  win  on  that  or  you  might  not.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Right. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  you  still  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  should  be  liable  for  damages  when  the  Department 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  they  were  not  going  to  enforce  the  position  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  articulating. 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Our  position  is  that  the  defense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  indeed  preclude  that.

I'm  asking  ­­ so  in  other  words,  they  may  not  succeed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  Portal­to­Portal  Act  defense,  but  you  nonetheless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  when  the  Department  says,  we're  not  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  the  view,  that  they're  liable  for  damages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  didn't  take  the  opposite  view. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  We  are  willing  to  concede  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre­2011  damages. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  that  at  this  point  or

proved. 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  It's  never  been  pleaded  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  This  hasn't  been 

  

 

 

 

litigated  at  all. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BIBAS:  It  hasn't  been  litigated. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  We're  dealing  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

threshold  issue  of  how  do  we  categorize  these  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  on  that,  do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know  ­­ I  had  asked  Mr.  Clement  ­­ what  is  the  universe

MR.  BIBAS:  Well,  there's  a  wide  range  of

range  of  salaries  we're  talking  about  is  a  broad 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispersion.  The  bottom  10  percent  of  service  advisors, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  the  figures  I've  seen,  make  less  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­and­a­half  times  the  minimum  wage.  There  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

entry­level  jobs  at  22,000  a  year.  Those  are  the  people 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  are  going  to  be  affected  by  this  ruling.  Those  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  ones  who  would  not  qualify  for  a  207(i)  if  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  restructured  for  commissions. 

 

 

 

            

So  we're  not  talking  about  the  highly  paid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ones  who  the  dealerships  could  exempt  under  207(i)  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structuring  it.  We're  talking  about  people  who  are  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  are  just  above  the  minimum  wage,  less  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­and­a­half  times  above. 

 

 

            

If  I  might  deal  with  a  few  questions  this 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Court  raised  earlier,  one  of  ­­ the  partsmen  issue,  I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  to  offer  an  analogy  on  partsmen.  Petitioner's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  is  as  if  you  have  a  statute  that  speaks  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone,  a  doctor  engaged  in  operating,  that  makes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sense.  If  the  statute  says,  doctor  or  nurse  engaged  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operating,  you'd  understand  you  don't  normally  think  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nurse  operates,  but  the  O.R.  nurse  is  close  enough. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  Petitioner  is  saying,  if  you  exempt  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

O.R.  nurse,  you  also  have  to  exempt  the  hospital  intake 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clerk  who  does  paperwork,  maybe  even  the  hospital  intake 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nurse  who  takes  vital  signs.  There  is  no  reason  you

go  all  the  way  out  to  the  front  office  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I'd  feel  more  comfortable 

  

 

 

 

 

about  this  if  I  understood  the  criteria  that  Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  in  choosing  the  employees  who  are  covered  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  provision.  So  take  the  case  of  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

salesperson  who  is  not  working  on  commission.  Why  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  include  that  employee  within  this  category? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  what  is  different  about  employees  of  that  nature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  service  advisors  who  are  not  working  on  commission? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  The  understanding  of  Congress, 

  

 

 

 

 

as  discussed  in  our  brief,  was  that  salesmen  are  selling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anywhere  they  go.  Back  in  the  '60s,  they  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling  off­hours.  They'd  be  going  to  people's  homes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  when  they  met  people  at  church  or  clubs  or  wherever. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  mechanics  and  partsmen,  just  as  Justice  Breyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alluded  to,  were  going  out  and  had  to  work  in  the  field, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  least  in  some  context,  and  it  was  hard  to  track 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overtime  with  their  regular  hours  and  off­site  work.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  salesman  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  All  of  that  was  true  ­­

JUSTICE  ALITO:  All  of  that  was  true  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1966.  That  really  isn't  ­­ maybe  it  was.  It's  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  my  ­­ what  I  would  have  imagined  car 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

salesmen  are  doing  or  partsmen  are  doing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BIBAS:  May  I  answer? 

   

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes,  and  then 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor  has  a  question. 

   

 

 

            

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Yes. 

  

 

If  the  universe  of  employees  who  meet  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  now  has  shrunk  so  it's  narrower  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original  purposes,  that  is  a  reason  for  Congress  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeal  or  restrict  it.  It  is  certainly  not  a  reason  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  courts  to  expand  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  was  more  of  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alito's.  When  did  automobile  salesmen  travel?  When  did 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mechanics  and  partsmen  for  automobile  leave  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

job  ­­

 

            

MR.  BIBAS:  Congress,  the  Senate  discussed

MR.  YANG:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  address  three  points,  as  well  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  some  additional  questions.  The  first  is,  I'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  to  discuss  the  text  of  the  statute  as  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted  in  1974.  Congress  enacted  the  statute  in  1974 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  separated  salesmen  from  partsmen  and  mechanics  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection  or  clause  B. 

 

 

 

            

Second,  I'd  like  to  discuss  Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  selling  services  is  being  primarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged  in  servicing  automobiles.  As  a  textual  matter, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

we  think  that's  just  plain  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  finally,  I'd  like  to  discuss  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  at  issue  here.  Petitioner  has  made  a  lot  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  arguments  about  high­paid  commission,  people  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  salesmen,  they're  incentivized  to  sell.  Petitioner 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  essentially  conceded  in  his  argument  that  what  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  talking  is  people  who  aren't  paid  on  commission. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those  people  are  who  Congress  was  concerned  about, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  fall  outside  of  207(i),  and  there's  no  reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  expand  213(b)(1)(A)  to  cover  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  first,  when  Congress  enacted  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  1974,  and  this  ­­ you  can  see  this  on  page  2A  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  appendix,  you  can  see  the  difference  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Congress  did.

Prior  to  1974,  there  was  a  single  exemption, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

salesmen,  partsmen  and  mechanics.  And  that  applied  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

several  different  types  of  vehicles.  It  included 

  

 

 

 

 

 

applying  to  trailers  and  aircraft,  as  well  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automobiles. 

            

 

In  1974,  Congress  decided  to  eliminate  the 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  for  partsmen  and  mechanics  for  trailers  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aircraft.  The  legislative  history  is  quite  clear  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  When  they  did  that,  they  created  subsection  B. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  they  preserved  the  exemption  for  salesmen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  look  at  subsection  B,  this  is  on  top  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  3A,  it  says  "Any  salesman  primarily  engaged  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling  trailers,  boats,  or  aircraft." 

 

 

 

 

            

That  shows  you  that  Congress  was  ­­ linked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

salesmen  to  selling  and,  by  implication,  partsmen  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanics  to  servicing.  Because  when  you  look  at  (A), 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  time  servicing  comes  in  is  when  partsmen  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanics  were  there. 

 

 

            

So  I  think  as  a  textual  matter,  that  shows 

   

   

 

 

 

 

you  what  Congress  was  trying  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second,  "selling"  is  not  servicing. 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  says  that  you're  engaged  in  the  selling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  or  the  ­­ and  the  servicing  process  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  selling  servicing.  If  you  are  selling  plastic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

surgery,  you're  not  ever  thought  to  be  engaging  in

plastic  surgery.  You're  selling  it. 

  

 

 

 

            

Maybe  you  might  be  seen  to  be  part  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  of  servicing,  but  it's  not  natural  to  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  engaged  in  servicing. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  it's  telling  that  Petitioner  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  rely  on  Section  203(j),  as  my  brother  suggested, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

203(j)  is  a  definitional  section.  The  only  way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  gets  to  the  suggestion  that  doing  things  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  essential  to  the  production  is  production  is  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  says,  "For  the  purposes  of  this  chapter,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall  be  deemed  production." 

 

 

 

            

And  as  my  brother  explained,  "Farmers 

 

 

 

 

 

Reservoir,"  and  this  is  a  quote,  "explains  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

production  in  the  normal  sense  is  quite  different  rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  production  in  the  special  sense  defined  here." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  we're  talking  about  is  the  normal  sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  being  engaged  in  servicing.  That  means  you  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  taking  part  in  the  repairing  or  the  providing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintenance  for  automobiles.  Service  advisors  do  not  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

Moreover,  Petitioner's  reading,  if  we  really 

 

 

 

 

 

do  expand  servicing  to  extend  to  people  who  are  engaged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  process,  why  wouldn't  you  cover  salesmen  who  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sell  warranties,  salesmen  who  only  sell  the  antirust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coating  under  the  car,  salesmen  at  the  counter  that  sell

the  key  fobs  and  other  things  that  are  branded  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealership's  logo?  They're  all  engaged  in  selling 

  

 

 

 

 

 

automobiles  in  the  sense  that  you  got  to  advertise,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  to  sell.  This  promotes  the  sale  of  automobiles. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  wrong. 

 

            

The  mechanic  that  simply  fixes  the  HVAC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  or  fixes  the  guts,  were  they  engaged  in  servicing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automobiles?  Everybody  at  a  dealership,  under 

   

  

 

 

Petitioner's  view,  is  essentially  engaged  in  selling  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

servicing  because  they're  engaged  in  the  process  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling  or  servicing  automobiles.  That's  just  wrong. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Line  drawing  is  necessary.  Now,  we  depart  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  bit  from  Respondents  in  that  we  think  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ambiguous,  right?  I  mean,  if  the  statute  had  just 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  salesmen  engaged  in  selling  or  servicing,  you'd  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forced  to  say,  well,  Congress  must  have  meant  "salesmen" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead  of  ­­ intended  a  distributive  meaning  when  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

included  "salesmen  and  partsmen  and  mechanics."  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  drawing  that  has  to  be  done  here  ­­ if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledge  that  line  drawing  has  to  be  done,  salesmen, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  service  advisors  are  way  down  the  line. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

They  rely  on  partsmen,  but  partsmen,  as  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained,  are  working  hand­in­hand  with  mechanics.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they're  logically  understood  to  be  servicing,  but  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

salesman  is  not  logically  understood  to  be  servicing.

So  what's  key  about  the  canon  of  Reddendo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  recognition  of  distributive  phrasing  is  not  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  read  the  statute  that  way,  but  what  it  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggest  is  that  there  is  no  such  basic  rule  of  grammar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  requires  the  use  of  "or"  to  link  every  antecedent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noun  with  all  antecedent  gerunds.  The  question  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  ambiguous. 

 

 

            

So  if  we  get  into  ambiguity,  the  agency  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construed  this  statute  in  notice­and­comment  rulemaking. 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  entitled  to  deference. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Now,  before  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Yang,  why  was  it  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  for  the  most  part  this  explanation  seems  like  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  world's  best  explanation  to  me  but  perfectly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate.  But  Mr.  Clement  does  have  a  point  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

somehow  the  agency  took  out  this  more  specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation  and  I  ­­ I  guess  if  I  were  just  looking  at 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  explanation  itself  I  would  say,  you  know,  not  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A­plus  job,  but  fine.  But  it  is  a  little  bit  perplexing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  to  why  they  took  this  out.  Why  was  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  Well,  we  don't  have  this  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  but  I  have  been  informed  that  there  was  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inadvertent  mistake  in  drafting.  All  of  these  are  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  C  of  the  statute.

expect  expect  you  to  say  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  It  was  inadvertent,  but  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  make  a  difference,  and  I'll  explain  why. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  prior  (c)4  ­­ they  ­­ they  redid  (c)1, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2,  and  3,  and  they  just  didn't  reprint  4  because  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hadn't  changed  at  all.  So  ­­ but  it  ­­ the  reason  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  matter  is  what  (c)4  said  before  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Not  an  A­plus  explanation. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

MR.  YANG:  It's  a  passing  grade. 

   

  

 

 

But  what  I  would  say  is  in  (c)4,  before  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  reproduced  on  page  6a  of  the  appendix  to  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  It  says  sales  advisors  aren't  included  unless 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  primarily  engaged  in  the  work  of  a  salesman, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

partsman,  or  mechanic  as  defined. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  really  does  the  work  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  "salesman."  And  the  definition  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

salesman  is  what  they  reenacted  as  notice­and­comment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulemaking  with  some  modifications  to  take  care  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes  since  the  1974  amendments. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  definition  of  salesmen  covered  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  say  "as  used  in  Section  13(b)10,"  so  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construing  the  term  "salesman"  as  used  in  this  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision.  It  means  "someone  who  is  engaged  in  making 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales  or  obtaining  orders  for  the  sales  of  vehicles."

Service  advisors  don't  fall  under  that 

 

 

 

 

 

category.  So  they're  not  salesmen  within  the  meaning  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  as  it  has  been  construed.  They're  salesmen, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure,  in  kind  of  a  general  sense.  But  they're  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

salesmen  as  construed  in  this  provision,  because  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  engaged  in  selling  automobiles. 

 

 

 

 

            

Not  the  perfect,  but  a  passing  grade  for  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  agency. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  that's  ­­ maybe  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problem  in  my  mind  will  go  away,  but  I  ­­ I'm  with  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  to  a  large  point.  I  think  it  is  ambiguous.  I  think 

    

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  longer  any  reason  at  all  for  having  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanics  exempt,  but  they're  there.  And  so  then,  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  service  people,  an  agency  could  reason,  well,  let's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  make  a  bad  situation  worse,  which  is  what  you  say. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Or  they  could  reason  the  opposite:  These  are  virtually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical,  why  not  treat  them  the  same. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Now,  problem.  30  years? 

  

 

 

MR.  YANG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  so  the  real  question  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  they  have  to  address  this? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  YANG:  Well,  they  do  have  ­­

where  I'm  having  a  problem. 

   

 

 

            

And  it  isn't  just  ­­ he's  quite  right,  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

colleague,  where  he  says  this  isn't  just  a  simple 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reversal  of  a  regulation.  It  isn't  that.  They  never 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

really  had  the  regulation  acquiescing.  And  they've  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  find  things  in  handbooks  and  so  forth.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  fact  is  everybody  thought  the  law  was  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said.  And  so  now  suddenly,  in  the  ­­ in  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  YANG:  Well,  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  This  is  the  problem, 

  

 

 

 

 

because  after  all,  different  administrations  have 

 

 

 

 

 

different  policies.  And  there's  some  protection  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ABA  from  preventing  too  big  a  shift  too  quickly,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection  being,  address  it.  Address  it.  Think  about 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

MR.  YANG:  I  think  what's  necessary  is  for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the  agency  to  recognize  that  it  had  a  prior  position, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  it  did  here.  It  also  has  to  explain  what  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing,  which  it  did  here.  It  explained  how  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  the  statute  to  be  most  appropriately  read. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  to  the  extent  you  also  have  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  suggesting  that  the  agency  has  to  explain  why  its

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Because  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

either  would  be  wrong.  But  they  have  to  explain  why  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we,  despite  30  years  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  YANG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ going  long  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other,  why  now  do  we  think  that  was  a  mistake? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  YANG:  I  think  you  can  ­­ you  can  ­­ if 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  a  requirement,  we  don't  think  it's  necessary. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  if  it  were,  you  could  easily  see  the  answer  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  the  ­­ the  1978  opinion  letter  in  conjunction  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  I  can  follow  ­­ finish.  Thank  you. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

The  1978  opinion  letter  was  based  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory  that  service  advisors  are  selling,  they're  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling.  And  so  as  a  result,  they  said,  well,  when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  working  on  service  under  warranty.  You're  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer  selling,  so  you  don't  count  for  the  exemption. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Only  when  you're  selling  nonwarranty  services  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  YANG:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Mr.  Clement,  four

Just  a  few  points  in  rebuttal,  starting 

   

 

 

 

 

right  where  Justice  Breyer  and  my  friend  from  the  SG's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office  left  off.  Which  is  to  say,  I  think,  you  know,  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  look  at  what  they  did  in  the  preamble,  they  did  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies  do  every  day,  which  is  first  they  say,  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  comments  that  say  this;  we  have  some  comments  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that.  They  simply  relate  what  the  comments  were. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then  there's  the  money  paragraph  that  explains  what  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  did,  what  justifies  their  decision,  and  there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  in  there  about  reliance  interests  at  all.  So  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  anything  to  your  Fox  position,  then  I  think  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  get  a  passing  grade;  it  gets  a  flunking  grade. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  what  I'd  like  to  just  offer  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential  comparison:  As  you  may  know,  the  agency  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  revisited  the  issue  you  addressed  in  Long  Island 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Care,  and  they  did  that  through  notice­and­comment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulemaking.  And  it's  worth  a  quick  look  to  show  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

night  looks  like  and  what  day  looks  like,  because  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  all  about  the  reliance  interests  of  the  fact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  treated  this  one  way  for  many,  many  years,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  sections  of  that  preamble  explaining  when  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  it  how  this  is  going  to  impose  costs  and  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  costs  are  justified.  It's  ­­ it's  ­­ it  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stark  example  of  how  the  agency  should  behave  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  changing  the  position.

And  here's  the  last  thing  to  add  about  this: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  also  ­­ if  they  give  that  kind  of  analysis,  it  gives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  reason  for  people,  especially  in  the  Fourth  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth  Circuit,  who  already  have  a  binding  circuit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

precedent  that  say  that  service  advisors  are  not  ­­ are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exempt,  it  gives  them  a  reason  to  maybe  think  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changing. 

            

But  when  they  do  nothing  to  address  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliance  interests  and  they  just  say,  gosh,  we  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  we  were  right  all  along,  why  is  anybody, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially  in  the  Fourth  and  Fifth  Circuit,  supposed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  the  way  they're  doing  things,  and  that's  the  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  that  they  say  that  they  can  even  possibly  get  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  protection  against  massive,  retroactive  damage 

 

 

 

 

 

liability. 

            

So  I  think,  in  a  sense,  the  State  Farm 

   

   

 

 

 

 

principles  or  the  Fox  principles  would  work  hand­in­hand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  this  concern  about  retroactivity. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  is  it  okay  if  we  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send  it  back? 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Sure.  As  long  as  it  means 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  is  no  retroactive  liability.  I  mean,  I  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  They've  already  conceded 

  

 

 

 

there's  not.  So  they're  ­­ they're  not  going  to  claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any.

MR.  CLEMENT:  No,  no.  What  ­­ no,  no.  What 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  won't  concede  ­­ we're  not  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactive  liability.  I'm  talking  about  liability  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

predates  when  they  clearly  explained  why  they  changed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  position,  which  would  be  sometime  in  late  2016  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed  to  in  2011.  So  ­­ so  in  that  sense,  it  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  a  big  difference. 

   

 

            

Just  a  couple  of  other  textual  points, 

   

 

 

 

 

because  I  do  think  you  actually  don't  even  need  to  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  any  kind  of  deference  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

My  friend  on  the  other  side  ­­ I  think  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  better  reading  of  203(j),  if  you  want  to  look  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  because  Congress  specifically  ­­ it's  a  definition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

session.  Everything  in  there  is  what  they  deem  things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  mean.  And  then  they  deem  "production"  to  mean  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing,  and  then  they  mean  "engaged  in  production"  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  something  broader. 

 

 

            

But  in  all  events,  my  friends  concede  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"engaged  in"  means  taking  part.  Well,  the  service 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisors  take  part  in  servicing,  just  like  the  partsmen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  part  in  servicing. 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  if  you  have  any  questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  the  service  advisors  do,  a  good  place  to  look 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  complaint.  JA40,  they  tell  you  what  they  are  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  evaluate  the  service  and/or  repair  needs  of  the

vehicle,  and  they  write  up  an  estimate  for  the  repair 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  services.  That,  to  me,  seems  to  be  taking  part  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  servicing  process.  I'm  not  so  sure  that's  not  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integral  to  the  servicing  process  than  what  the  partsmen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do. 

            

The  last  point  I'd  like  to  make  here  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  practical  anomaly  that  will  be  created  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

siding  with  the  other  side,  is  that  the  best­paid  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  servicing  departments  will  now  be  the  only  ones 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  not  exempt. 

 

 

 

            

On  average,  the  service  advisors  make  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$66,000  and  ­­ a  year.  The  average  partsman  makes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

$51,000  a  year.  The  average  mechanic  makes  $59,000  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

year. 

            

Now,  I'd  hate  to  be  the  person  that  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  explain  to  the  partsmen  and  the  mechanics  why  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  their  better­paid  service  advisor  colleagues  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  ones  that  aren't  exempt  from  the  FLSA  overtime 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  and  are  going  to  get  a  windfall  in  litigation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  this.  That  would  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Because  they  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

exempt  to  the  extent  they  paid  on  commission  which,  as  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  it,  most  of  them  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Yes,  Justice  Ginsburg.  But  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

repeat  my  answer  to  you,  there  are  people  right  now  who

are  service  advisors  who  are  not  paid  principally  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commission,  and  they  like  it  that  way.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences  of  ruling  in  the  other  side's  favor  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automobile  dealerships  are  going  to  have  to  go  to  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  because  FLSA  provisions  are  not  waivable.  And

this  way,  but  we've  got  the  Supreme  Court  decision.  We

the  Labor  Department  has  been  acquiescing  in  this,  save 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Ninth  Circuit  below,  and  find  that  service  advisors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  salesmen  principally  involved  in  servicing
