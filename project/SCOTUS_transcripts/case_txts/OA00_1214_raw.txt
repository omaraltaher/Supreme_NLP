CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 00-1214, Alabama v. LeReed Shelton.


General Pryor.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. PRYOR, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PRYOR:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


30 years ago in Argersinger v. Hamlin and then


more than 20 years ago in Scott v. Illinois, this Court


established the principle that, under the Sixth and


Fourteenth Amendments, a State is not obligated to provide


an indigent defendant in a misdemeanor case court-


appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel, provided that the


defendant is not actually imprisoned upon conviction.


8 years ago in Nichols v. the United States,


this Court reaffirmed that principle. 


The Supreme Court of Alabama distorted this


well-established and workable rule and held that a


probated or suspended sentence, which actually liberates a


defendant to return to free society, nevertheless triggers


a right to court-appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel. 


There are three arguments that I would like to


address this morning.

 QUESTION:  Do you -- do you concede that the


State can never impose the original sentence of time in


jail? 


MR. PRYOR:  Your Honor, obviously that is not a


court -- a question that this Court has directly addressed


in either Argersinger or Scott.  Our best reading --


QUESTION:  I'm asking whether the State of


Alabama concedes that it can't ever impose that original


sentence. 


MR. PRYOR:  Our reading of Scott is that -- that


we cannot activate the suspended sentence.  We acknowledge


that Mr. Fried, as an amicus, certainly has a plausible


reading that would allow the court to activate that


sentence.  In our judgment, that original sentence relates


back to the original offense and that the court --


QUESTION:  What -- what happens in Alabama if --


if a -- a criminal defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor


and placed on probation and then violates probation?  Does


that enable the State to impose the original sentence for


violation of the probation?


MR. PRYOR:  Yes, ordinarily it would.  But for


the problem presented involving an uncounseled defendant,


it would allow the State to activate the suspended


sentence. 


QUESTION:  Well, then we're jumping probably

ahead into what you're going to tell us, but while we're


at this point, it seems to me that if -- if you say that


the sentence cannot be reimposed, you're saying that the


State courts are in the position of imposing a sentence


that is something of a rouse.  Why should you put your own


courts in this position?  I -- I just don't think it's


very sound for us to tell the State courts, well, you go


ahead and tell these people that they can -- might be put


in prison, but that that won't really happen.  It seems to


me that that's your position. 


MR. PRYOR:  Well, there's still a risk of


imprisonment, the same risk of imprisonment, under our


reading of Argersinger and Scott, that -- that is


accompanied with the judgment of a mere fine.  Every court


has the power to enforce any judgment as an essential


aspect of the administration of justice through the power


of contempt.


QUESTION:  But you're -- you're treating the


contempt proceeding, in effect, as a separate proceeding


then, and I take it, though I'm not sure that I remember


this from your briefs -- I take it that on -- on your view


of the way the scheme ought to operate in the contempt


proceeding, before there could be any confinement on a


finding of contempt, that counsel would have to be


provided then if -- if the individual is indigent and

didn't waive it.


MR. PRYOR:  That's -- that's correct, Justice


Souter. 


QUESTION:  So, it's the separate counseled


proceeding that distinguishes your case from -- from the


case that Mr. Fried argues for. 


MR. PRYOR:  That -- that's correct, Justice


Souter.  And -- and at a minimum I would say, although I


don't think the Court has to ever address this question


because there's been no violation of probation -- at a


minimum the State would have the same power to enforce its


judgment that it would a judgment of a mere fine which


this Court held squarely in Scott does not trigger a right


to court-appointed --


QUESTION:  From your point of view, General


Pryor, what does the State gain as -- as opposed to what


the Supreme Court of Alabama said, by following --


following your -- your line of reasoning?  I think as


Justice Kennedy said, it -- it imposes a sentence, but a


sentence that everybody knows can't be enforced.


MR. PRYOR:  The State gains the powerful tool of


probation to rehabilitate an offender that the State


believes is a good risk, a risk to return to free society


who can be rehabilitated, depending on whatever mechanisms


of probation have been adopted by the trial court.

Meanwhile, the State is preserving its scarce judicial


resources to incarcerate more dangerous offenders and


provide counsel in more serious cases. 


QUESTION:  But what -- how effective is


probation going to be if there isn't the threat of -- of a


sentence in case of probation violation? 


MR. PRYOR:  I think at a minimum, the probation


is going to be as effective as a judgment of a fine


because the State is going to still have the flexible


power of contempt, whether civil or criminal in nature, to


ensure that its orders are followed and -- and will


continue to exercise jurisdiction of the probationer


during that period of probation. 


QUESTION:  Is it the -- is it the case in


Alabama that probation cannot be imposed without a


suspended sentence?


MR. PRYOR:  That is correct.  Technically that


is how probation is imposed, Justice Souter. 


QUESTION:  Wouldn't -- wouldn't we have at least


a more candid system or wouldn't the interaction of


Argersinger and -- and the Alabama system, as you view


Argersinger, produce a more candid system if -- if we took


the position that, no, they can't impose a suspended


sentence, and Alabama would then presumably amend its laws


so that probation could be imposed without imposing a

suspended sentence, and you on your view would have your


-- your contempt remedy.  We wouldn't be -- in effect, the


-- the two systems wouldn't be producing this kind of


silly effect of -- of a sentence which everyone realizes


as such cannot be imposed. 


MR. PRYOR:  Alabama certainly has the freedom to


adopt I think either system without running afoul of the


Constitution, which is the -- the issue before this Court.


Although it might make more sense and not seem as silly to


impose probation without going through the mechanics of --


QUESTION:  Well, is -- is there any State which


imposes probation without a suspended sentence that you


know of? 


MR. PRYOR:  I know from the amicus brief of the


National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers that


there are some States that impose, in fact, pretrial


probation, that that is something that --


QUESTION:  How about post-trial, after a


conviction? 


MR. PRYOR:  I just don't know.  I know that


there were several States that were cited in Shelton's


briefly correctly that -- that used the same mechanism


that Alabama does.  There were several cites --


QUESTION:  General Pryor --


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what authority would --

would the State have to -- to put somebody on probation


unless -- unless it is the suspension of -- of a judgment


of incarceration?  I mean, can a State just go around


saying you're going to be on probation? 


MR. PRYOR:  Well --


QUESTION:  It seems to me the only -- the only


reason it -- it has that grip over the person is that --


is that it has a right to incarcerate him. 


MR. PRYOR:  The States certainly view that as an


effective mechanism in most --


QUESTION:  I'm not sure there's an alternative


to it.  I'm not sure you can just pass a law saying judges


can put on probation whomever they want to put on


probation.


MR. PRYOR:  I think that -- that the Alabama


legislature has the inherent power to define what a


sentence is, whether a sentence is a fine or whether a


sentence is imprisonment.  And in fact, I think the State


would have the flexibility to define a sentence -- one of


the sentencing options as -- as probation.


QUESTION:  I take it what they would do on that


scheme would be to say, upon conviction of offense A, the


court may impose probation, and if the conditions of


probation are violated and are shown in a separate trial


or proceeding to that effect, the violation itself can be

punished.  That would be the way the scheme would work,


wouldn't it? 


MR. PRYOR:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  If -- if Alabama wanted it. 


MR. PRYOR:  If Alabama wanted it.  But -- but


this is really -- in my judgment this would be elevating


form over substance because the -- the effect is the same


with whichever system Alabama wants to adopt --


QUESTION:  General Pryor, explain to me how some


other States approach it.  If I understand correctly,


there is no trial.  It's a deferred prosecution on


condition that the -- the defendant abide by certain terms


and conditions.  Is that how it works? 


MR. PRYOR:  That's -- that's correct.


QUESTION:  And if -- if the defendant then


doesn't live up to it, then it proceeds to trial.


MR. PRYOR:  Then it proceeds to trial. 


QUESTION:  How many States use a system like


that?


States.


MR. PRYOR:  I believe the -- the brief listed 23


QUESTION:  Well, these are pretrial diversion


programs which have been very helpful in the drug context,


but they're extremely expensive to administer. 


MR. PRYOR:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And -- and

many States may very well feel that -- that there's


something almost unseemly about using this kind of


bargaining process before you have adjudicated guilt or


innocence, and -- and the State certainly should have


the --


QUESTION:  Well, why is it any more unseemly


than the ordinary plea bargain? 


MR. PRYOR:  Because at least in the -- in the


case of the ordinary plea bargain, the defendant comes


forward and admits the wrongdoing.  There's an indicia of


reliability there for the State that's not present in this


kind of pretrial system.  And -- and the States who trust


their system to adjudicate innocence or guilt may find


that that's a -- that the system that Alabama has is a


preferable system. 


QUESTION:  But Shelton was not given any


pretrial diversion.  He was convicted, was he not? 


MR. PRYOR:  That's correct, and Alabama doesn't


have it in this context except with respect to drug


offenders. 


QUESTION:  General Pryor, I can understand a


line between a fine and any kind of confinement, and


probation may involve no immediate incarceration, but it


does involve what could be very significant restraints on


the person.  So, isn't it more logical to draw the line

between money only on the one hand and confinement, be it


in jail or under terms and conditions of probation?


MR. PRYOR:  Justice Ginsburg, I'd say no for a


couple of reasons.  This Court has recognized that


imprisonment is an intrinsically different form of


punishment that has special constitutional significance. 


The probation system is one that is meant more as


rehabilitation and not as punishment to give an offender a


second chance in free society.  And -- and even with the


judgment of a fine, as I mentioned earlier, there -- it --


it is accompanied by the risk of imprisonment should the


defendant willfully refuse to pay that fine.  So, even in


that context, in the judgment of -- of a fine, there is at


least that risk, the same risk that would exist under the


regime that we propose.


I do not discount the fact that probation has --


can have serious restrictions on liberty, but it's not the


-- the deprivation of liberty, the loss of physical


liberty, that is, physical confinement that this Court has


held triggers a right to court-appointed counsel under the


Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. 


QUESTION:  Under your view, if you enforced the


jail sentence through the contempt mechanism and reached


the same result, I take it you now have a second jury


trial.

 MR. PRYOR:  Well, I guess it would be dependent


in part on the nature of the contempt proceeding.  If it's


civil contempt, if it's a direct contempt or an indirect


contempt, but if it's criminal contempt, I would imagine


-- I say that.  In Alabama, a criminal contempt procedure


only has a maximum term of imprisonment of 5 days.  So,


I'm not sure that -- that there would be a right to a jury


trial. 


For more than 20 --


QUESTION:  But then -- but then the contempt is


-- is really not a substitute of an equivalent for the --


for the imposition of the suspended sentence.  They're not


equivalent.  If it's just 5 days, that's not equivalent to


the suspended sentence.


MR. PRYOR:  Oh, absolutely.  That's absolutely


right, although I would argue that -- that the threat of


imprisonment is still enough to give the probationer an


incentive to follow the orders of the court.  It's


absolutely correct that there is a material difference


between activation of the probated sentence in this case


and the use of -- of the criminal contempt remedy that's


provided by the code of Alabama.  There's no doubt about


that. 


The -- what is at stake in this case is -- is


the use of probation, a valuable tool for the States that

allow them the freedom and flexibility again to ensure


that scarce judicial resources can be preserved for more


serious cases to provide counsel and to incarcerate more


serious offenders. 


If there are no further questions from the


Court, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance


of my time for rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Very well, General Pryor. 


Mr. Fried, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED


ON BEHALF OF THE AMICUS CURIAE


IN OPPOSITION TO THE JUDGMENT BELOW


MR. FRIED:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


First, if I might just refer to the deferred


prosecution point, which was raised by Mr. Duke in his


amicus brief and in one of the questions.  I think that's


a red herring because, as Mr. Duke points out, the


deferred prosecution requires the consent of both the


prosecutor and the defendant.  Obviously, the kind of


prosecutions we have here are usually not consented to by


the defendant. 


I think it is --


QUESTION:  Why -- why is that a red herring? 


Because I got from your brief the impression that the --

the -- there's a practical problem that a lot of States do


without giving people lawyers.  Perhaps thousands and


thousands of cases say, go plead guilty.  We'll give you


some light sentence that won't involve prison, but then


they attach to that a suspended sentence.  And what I


wondered is, well, isn't the solution to this to say --


it's called pretrial diversion or pretrial probation or


they call it different names, but to say if you violate


the condition, what happens to you is not prison, what


happens to you is the trial that we haven't yet given you


with a lawyer.  And I thought maybe that works as a


practical matter in a lot of these States in a lot of the


cases to which you referred. 


MR. FRIED:  It -- it does work.  For instance,


we use it a great deal in the Commonwealth of


Massachusetts where there is a quite different rule from


-- from the Argersinger rule where in Massachusetts we say


if there's a risk of imprisonment, you must get a lawyer. 


And a number of States have that rule which is perhaps why


they also have the deferred prosecution. 


I say it's a red herring because what we're


considering today is not the very best possible system but


what is the constitutional minimum.  Our emphasis in the


brief on Nichols is not in order to show that Nichols


somehow resolves this question in favor of allowing the

probated sentence and in favor of allowing it then to be


activated on violation, but rather Nichols shows that the


question is an open one.  Nichols doesn't resolve it, but


then neither does Argersinger.  And I think it's a mistake


and it's a mistake the Alabama Supreme Court made to treat


Argersinger as having resolved this question. 


Argersinger made quite clear that there is a


continuum here all the way from mere due process, which


was the law prior to Gideon, to a criminal -- to the right


of a criminal defendant having a counsel in any criminal


case.  And it picked a point.  It picked a point which the


Court recognized had a certain arbitrariness, and it


picked it for reasons of practicality and fairness.  And


those considerations of practicality and fairness require


no more than that there be counsel if the person is


sentenced immediately then and there to prison. 


The fairness aspect is, as the Illinois court


pointed out, that in these cases the defendant carries the


key to the prison in his own pocket.  Whether he ends up


in prison is a matter of his choice whether or not he


violates the terms of the probation. 


That's why I think Mr. Duke enters two more red


herrings into the argument.  The stay on appeal. 


Obviously in a stay case, the keys are not in the pocket


of the defendant, but in the pocket of the appeals court.

And the 30-day or $30 prison which is executed


immediately, in those cases the fine is either an illegal


fine under the -- this Court's decision in Bierdon -- the


person doesn't pay because he cannot, and that is itself a


constitutional violation -- or once again, he is


imprisoned because he chooses not to pay.  And once again,


that is the fairness point.  The keys are in his pocket.


That is a reasonable place to draw the line


because of the very important practicalities.  The


practicalities are the literally millions of misdemeanor


cases, the very large number -- it's hard to say exactly


what the number is -- the very large number of


probationary misdemeanor sentences, and the fact that


those probationary sentences overwhelmingly are intended


to serve a rehabilitative or preventive function.  Don't


drive again.  Take a anger management course.  Go to


counseling.  And the -- this is meant to keep people out


of prison, not to put them into prison. 


Unfortunately, if you insert a mandatory


formality into something which is a little bit like family


court proceeding, necessarily you will have a perverse


effect.  The State has to spend more time, has to spend


more resources.  It will do this less frequently, but it


will make sure it gets more of, if you like, deterrent


bang for its buck, and the result will be perverse.

 This system, as simply a constitutional minimum,


allows the States the flexibility which this Court from


the beginning, from Argersinger on, has recognized.


QUESTION:  You do allow the possibility that


counsel could be provided in the event the probation is


revoked. 


MR. FRIED:  I think that's a very real


possibility.  Ganyon talks about that in terms of due


process, and I think the practicalities change --


QUESTION:  But the issue with the revocation


hearing would not necessarily be whether he committed a


crime.  It would just be whether he violated a term of


probation such as leaving the jurisdiction or something.


MR. FRIED:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  He can get counsel to defend him


against that. 


MR. FRIED:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  Not against the crime itself.


MR. FRIED:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  Well, it would -- it would also


cover, I take it, whether or not the plea was voluntary


and knowingly made originally. 


MR. FRIED:  That could be brought up.  Nothing


-- nothing precludes bringing that up.  What you have is a


funnel with a very large opening, and in terms of the

statistics, a very small tube at the bottom.  It would


not --


QUESTION:  Well, is it your view that at the


probation hearing you reexamine the validity of the


original offense, the original conviction?


MR. FRIED:  The -- Alabama is a good example of


what is open at probation.  In most jurisdictions, oddly


enough, not in Massachusetts -- in most jurisdictions, the


court on probation is free to impose new -- the revocation


proceeding -- new conditions, the sentence that has


already been imposed, or a lesser sentence in light of all


circumstances, and it mentions specifically


depreciating --


QUESTION:  Yes, but all those alternatives


assume the original conviction is valid.


MR. FRIED:  I don't see why in those


proceedings --


QUESTION:  At least in a typical case. 


MR. FRIED:  -- the lawyer could not argue, look,


you're asking whether this will depreciate the gravity of


the original offense.  Let me tell you a little bit about


that.  And I would think the judge would listen, and he


has the discretion to impose a lesser sentence. 


QUESTION:  This is all pretty speculative, isn't


it, since that question doesn't confront us here?

 MR. FRIED:  No question.  And I simply want to


emphasize that that is open and is an important question


perhaps best considered in a case where it can be fully


developed.  But I don't think the Court should decide this


case on the assumption that that possibility might not in


a later case be open.  And I think that leaves the kind of


flexibility which is very desirable in these low level but


very frequently encountered cases.  I think that's what


will serve the -- the Constitution and the interests of


rehabilitation best. 


QUESTION:  Do we have any idea of the 1.4


million to 1.8 million people who are on probation for


misdemeanors, of what percentage of those cases the -- the


probation -- or the defendant was not offered a lawyer?  I


mean, the relevant feature is --


MR. FRIED:  We try --


QUESTION:  That's a rather -- yes.


MR. FRIED:  We try to infer that in the brief. 


It's -- the statistics are not kept in a transparent or


useful way.  But it may be in the hundreds of thousands. 


It may be in the hundreds of thousands because as -- as we


explain in our brief, there are a very large number of


persons on probation who did not have lawyers, and given


Argersinger, we may assume that they were misdemeanors.


So, it's a very large number.

 But the number of persons who are actually


incarcerated for breach of those conditions is quite


small.  It's in the thousands.  And that's why I think it


becomes quite practical to offer an attorney to help in


that condition, but really I think very confining and


perhaps with a perverse effect to require it as a


constitutional minimum in the much larger -- very much


larger number of cases where the matter is first


considered.  After all, if the person has to be sent to


prison, that's a failure. 


I thank the Court for its attention. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Fried, and thank you


for your participation as an amicus.


Mr. Duke, we'll hear from you.  I'm sorry.  Mr.


Mills.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. MILLS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. MILLS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


It obviously is apparent here that both the


petitioner and the respondent come to this Court relying


on the same authority, the -- primarily the Argersinger


and Scott cases. 


It seems that the State is taking a rather


shallow view, in our judgment, of the Argersinger and


21

Scott cases both as to their background and how


Argersinger is -- is implemented and the effect of that


implementation.


QUESTION:  Do you agree that neither of those


cases squarely control the outcome here? 


MR. MILLS:  It -- it would be my position that


Argersinger does by the -- some of the pronouncements that


it makes.


QUESTION:  Certainly the holding does not.


MR. MILLS:  The holding does not certainly.


And it would further be my position that -- that


the Scott case has something to say to us about this issue


also, although the holding -- the -- the facts certainly


do not coincide with this case. 


It seems to me that the background of the


Argersinger and Scott cases, of course, are the -- the


Powell v. Alabama, Gideon v. Wainwright series of cases. 


And in those cases, it seems that the Court has


established the purpose of the Counsel Clause which if we


-- if we reduce to its barest terms is this.  The purpose


of the Counsel Clause is to prevent, to the extent humanly


possible, the conviction of the innocent in an adversary


proceeding.  That seems to be what Justice Sutherland said


in Powell v. Alabama and what Justice Black said in Gideon


v. Wainwright, that what is to be done is to eliminate the

risk that the innocent may be convicted.


And when we come to the Argersinger case,


although the -- the Gideon case had -- had spoken of this


as being a -- or nobel idea was the -- were the words used


-- but I believe spoke of counsel for every defendant in


every case as being a constitutional ideal.  I think in


Argersinger, the Court was faced with the argument of


practicability and expense and -- and the other arguments


that -- that the State makes in this case, that the


mandate can't be absolute, that there must be some


accommodation to those arguments.


And in Argersinger, it -- it seems that the


Court made those accommodations.  And if we include --


QUESTION:  Well, the Court basically said, fine


only?  Okay.  We're not going to extend the Sixth


Amendment to that. 


Now, here we have a State that says, well, we


know we can't enforce the sentence.  It's a toothless


tiger.  We'll say probation, but it -- we don't mean it. 


I mean, we'll -- we'll maybe have proceedings, but we --


we can never enforce the sentence.  In light of that,


should we be concerned here? 


MR. MILLS:  Well, that -- that puzzled me


somewhat when the State made that concession in its reply


brief that this was in -- in effect a sham sentence.  And

I see no authority in the law of Alabama or any other


State that I'm aware of that authorizes a court --


QUESTION:  Well, if that's the case, what do we


think about this? 


MR. MILLS:  Perhaps we're dealing with a sham


sentence.  And perhaps that's the way the Alabama Supreme


Court treated it.  But certainly there shouldn't be, from


this Court or any other court, an authorization for a


trial court to enter a sentence that can't be enforced.


QUESTION:  Would you just clarify one thing for


me?  Did the Alabama Supreme Court endorse that view, or


is that the Attorney General?


MR. MILLS:  That's the Attorney General's view. 


What the Alabama petit court -- Supreme Court did was


merely strike the sentence.


QUESTION:  I guess whether you strike it or not


is a matter of State law, isn't it?  I mean -- I don't


know what the remedy should be for a sentence that's not


-- not an enforceable sentence and the person writes it in


the -- the judge writes in the book, suspended sentence. 


And the State and everyone else, let's say, agree that


that isn't a lawful sentence.  So, the State Supreme Court


says, erase those words.  Strike them.  Did anyone suggest


that was a matter of Federal law or what you do under


State law when a --

 MR. MILLS:  Well, I believe the Alabama Supreme


Court said it was -- it was a matter of Federal law. 


QUESTION:  That it be struck rather than just


left to lie there unenforceable.


MR. MILLS:  I'm not sure they articulated in


those terms, but their -- their basis for reaching the


decision they reached was the Federal cases that deal with


the right of counsel. 


QUESTION:  One of the things that didn't happen,


we know for sure, in this case was that an offer of


counsel.  Was that merely a -- an inadvertence on the


court's part or does Alabama not provide assigned counsel


for indigents in -- in a misdemeanor like this? 


MR. MILLS:  Perhaps it was inadvertence, but the


-- the Alabama rules of criminal procedure have that as a


part of the -- the processing of any -- any case. 


QUESTION:  In any misdemeanor?


MR. MILLS:  Any criminal prosecution, yes, sir.


QUESTION:  All right.  So that if -- if there


had been -- if there were an offense in Alabama that


carried as much as a 1-day sentence, the State would


provide counsel for an indigent, at least if requested?


MR. MILLS:  Not -- not in those terms.  Not -- I


believe the Alabama rules say where constitutionally


required.  And of course the --

 QUESTION:  So, they're not providing counsel in


these cases now because, I take it, the State's position


is it's not constitutionally required.


MR. MILLS:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  At what point do they regard it as


being constitutionally required?  When the sentence can


exceed 6 months or what?  What -- what I'm getting at is I


want to know -- I want your response to the argument that


there's going to be a -- a great practical difference if


we say now you may not impose sentences like this at all,


even though they're merely suspended.  I want to know what


the practical difference is.


MR. MILLS:  From the -- the wording of the


Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure about appointment of


counsel at the present time, I would assume that the trial


judge must go through the process outlined in Argersinger,


that is, make the pretrial determination of whether


imprisonment is a likely punishment in this particular


case, and if -- if so, appoint counsel.  If not so,


counsel is not appointed. 


QUESTION:  Well, any imprisonment?  1 day of


imprisonment? 


QUESTION:  Isn't that what the Federal --


Argersinger requires? 


MR. MILLS:  I think that's what Argersinger

says.


QUESTION:  Okay.  But Alabama, in other words,


is not doing something eccentric in this respect. 


MR. MILLS:  That -- that's correct. 


QUESTION:  The -- the only difference then


between the cases in which -- misdemeanor cases, for


example, in which counsel is offered, if an individual is


indigent, and counsel is not offered are cases in which


the judge says in advance I'm not going to put this guy


away at all even if we convict him.


MR. MILLS:  Presumably that's the process that's


being followed. 


QUESTION:  Now, do you have -- do you have any


basis to tell us what practical difference it would make


if the judge said, well, I may impose a suspended sentence


and therefore I will have to offer counsel because I read


Argersinger as requiring that?  Do you know what


difference that would make in practical terms?  How many


cases would counsel have to be offered and potentially


provided for where it's not being offered and potentially


provided for now?


MR. MILLS:  I don't have any data that would --


would support that, but it -- but it would seem that if


the trial judge makes the pretrial determination that any


sentence, whether -- whether immediate or suspended, is

warranted or may be warranted in this particular case,


that counsel should be appointed -- of course, that's the


position. 


QUESTION:  I understand that. 


MR. MILLS:  That's the position. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Mills, there is one thing that I


think is a piece of information that -- that is in the


record, and that is that most non-indigent misdemeanors


appear in court without counsel.  So, the position that


you're urging is kind of a superior justice for the


indigents.  Counsel, you would say, in every case where,


at the end of the line, there may be any jail time,


although most people who can't afford counsel do not have


counsel in cases of -- of this kind.


MR. MILLS:  That perhaps is correct.  I suppose


my response to that would be that that's -- that that's a


free choice that the non-indigent makes.


QUESTION:  Isn't it true also -- isn't it true


also, at least according to some of the statistics quoted,


that frequently these cases are not prosecuted by lawyers? 


They're simply prosecuted by the arresting officer. 


MR. MILLS:  That happens occasionally in


Alabama.  It used to happen a lot.  It's -- it's fairly


rare at the present time.  But -- but that does happen. 


That does happen.

 And, of course, in -- in Alabama, all


misdemeanors, except those that are initiated by


indictment, the first trial is in a -- a district or


municipal court where there's no jury trial.  And the jury


trial, if there is a right to jury trial, comes only by a


-- an appeal and a de novo trial in the circuit court,


which is an administrative problem.  I don't see that as a


-- as a philosophical problem.  It's -- it's still the --


most misdemeanors are -- are being tried in courts where


there is no jury, certainly all of them in the first


instance or most of them in the first instance. 


It seems that the petitioner's position


overlooks the fact that -- that the Sixth Amendment is --


is prophylactic rather than curative.  Now, its -- its


ideal is to prevent the convictions, not to do something


about them after they occur. 


Now, let me jump right quick to -- to the point


that Argersinger deals with it somewhat in that way. 


Argersinger is what we might call an outcome-based


analysis of whether there's a right to counsel.  And --


and to that extent, maybe it's -- it's curative rather


than prophylactic. 


But if -- if it is to be outcome-based analysis,


certainly it ought to be the -- the total outcome not just


the immediate outcome, and if a suspended sentence results

in incarceration, when the probation is revoked, that


certainly is a part of the -- of the outcome that


Argersinger was -- was dealing that the trial judge is


required to make some decision on before trial even


begins.  So --


QUESTION:  Do you suppose it would be


constitutional for the State to offer the defendant at the


outset the promise of imposition of a suspended sentence


if counsel were waived? 


MR. MILLS:  If knowingly waived, I don't see a


constitutional problem with that.  And I'm sure that


happens in fact. 


QUESTION:  Is that done sometimes in Alabama?


MR. MILLS:  It -- it is.  It is done.  And, of


course, this is -- this is the distinction between the --


the pretrial diversion mechanism that was addressed


earlier and a trial.  Most pretrial -- perhaps all


pretrial diversions are by definition. 


QUESTION:  Well, put in its raw form, if the


judge said, now, if -- if you agree not to have a counsel,


I'll agree not to impose a jail sentence, that -- that


wouldn't be permitted.  I mean --


MR. MILLS:  Yes, sir, and it seems if --


QUESTION:  I assume.  Correct me if I'm wrong. 


I assume it wouldn't be permitted.

 MR. MILLS:  I think that's correct.  In fact, I


think that's what Argersinger requires.  I think


Argersinger requires a trial judge to assure the defendant


who goes to trial without a lawyer that he's not going to


get jail sentence.  And if he can receive a jail sentence


somewhere down the line, the judge has given him a false


assurance.  But --


QUESTION:  The -- the jail sentence would not be


for the original crime necessarily but perhaps just for


breaking probation.


MR. MILLS:  Well, I couldn't speak to all


jurisdictions, but certainly under Alabama law, there


would be no -- no way to impose a sentence for breaking


probation.  It would either be the original sentence --


QUESTION:  Well, that's what I mean.  But the


reason this -- the original sentence now becomes effective


is because he broke probation.


MR. MILLS:  This, of course, is correct.  This


is the -- the carrot and stick analogy which -- which


the --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe I misunderstood General


Pryor's argument, but I thought he was here arguing no, he


wouldn't impose the original sentence ever.  We'd just


proceed on contempt, maximum 5 days.  Did I misunderstand?


MR. MILLS:  I think that's what he -- he said.

I'm sure he -- he told us the whole story about contempt


under Alabama law.  Each day that a contempt continues can


be a separate violation, a separate contempt, and -- and


could warrant a -- an additional 5-day sentence.  So,


contempt -- if a person was cited for violating his


probation because he quit his job --


QUESTION:  Well, but that wouldn't -- that


wouldn't involve imposition of the original sentence. 


That's something else. 


MR. MILLS:  That --


QUESTION:  That was what I understood --


MR. MILLS:  That would be something else.  That


is -- that is for the contempt itself. 


QUESTION:  What is your position in the case of


the individual who refuses to pay the fine?  No suspended


sentence of incarceration, simply a sentence of a fine,


and he refuses to pay it.  Assuming the facts are


otherwise the same, he did not have counsel and he was not


offered counsel if indigent.  Could the fine be enforced


by a contempt sanction? 


MR. MILLS:  I think this Court has addressed


that issue that it constitutionally can, and I -- I assume


there's no -- no impediment to that under Alabama law.


QUESTION:  Well, does -- is there -- is there


some tension between the position you take about the

inability of the State to enforce a -- a condition of


sentence or a condition of suspension in the position that


you take or acknowledge about the ability to enforce the


-- the sentence of fine?  Why should the two cases be


different? 


MR. MILLS:  Well, I think the -- the difference


is if the suspended sentence is imposed, a person is being


imprisoned because he committed a crime.  That would


never --


QUESTION:  And if the fine -- if the fine is


imposed, the fine is being imposed because the individual


committed a crime.


MR. MILLS:  Well, this is true, but only if he


willfully refuses to pay it where he has the ability to do


so.


QUESTION:  Well, is the -- is the difference


that you're making willful?  That -- that violations of


the conditions of suspension are not willful and refusals


to pay a fine are willful?


MR. MILLS:  Well, I believe willfulness --


willfully refusing to pay a fine would be a -- a


precondition to -- to a contempt sentence.


QUESTION:  All right.  Then let's assume that


we're talking about the class of -- of breach of -- of


conditions of suspension that are willful.  Let's assume

refuses.  I take it your position is that the suspended


sentence still cannot be imposed.  Is that correct?


MR. MILLS:  That -- that's --


QUESTION:  But that's just as -- the willfulness


factor is the same in the refusal to abide by that


condition as it is in the refusal to pay the fine.  So,


I'm having difficulty seeing why you -- why on your view


the -- the two should come out differently. 


MR. MILLS:  Well, the -- the fine and the -- the


contempt for willfully refusing to comply with some other


conditions, I -- I could not distinguish those. 


QUESTION:  No.


MR. MILLS:  Of course, let me add one other


thing about the contempt process to -- to enforce.  Under


Alabama law, it wouldn't save the State any money.  It


would -- in fact, it would cost the State a lot of money


because of the formalities required in a criminal contempt


proceeding.  There must be a separate proceeding.  I think


there probably would not have to be a jury trial, but


certainly there would have to be counsel if it is


anticipated that imprisonment will be one of the


punishments for willfully refusing.

 QUESTION:  But -- but it would only -- it would


only undergo that expense where there has been a breach of


the conditions of -- of probation.  Whereas, you're


arguing that the State must undergo the expense of counsel


in all cases.  The number of cases where there's a


violation of probation is -- is presumably quite small,


and -- and to say that the State has to provide counsel in


those cases in order to get the contempt sanction is -- is


not nearly as much of an imposition as -- as you're urging


us to impose. 


MR. MILLS:  Well, I would say one thing. 


Perhaps the -- the number of cases would not be as large


as -- as might be anticipated.  Presumably in many of the


suspended sentence cases, the judge perhaps has already


made that decision, this is a possible jail case or this


is not a possible jail case.  Or if he's made a decision


it is a possible jail case, appoints counsel, he may, of


course, impose a suspended sentence rather than an


immediate sentence.  So, perhaps many of the cases are


already being appointed counsel.  So, the -- the number


may not be that large.


I thank the Court.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Mills. 


Mr. Duke, we'll hear from you.

 ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL


DEFENSE LAWYERS, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT


MR. DUKE:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the


Court:


Were this a petty offense prosecution, perhaps


the only legitimate, appropriate question would be the one


that has occupied the Court thus far this morning, but


this is a not a petty offense prosecution.  This is a


serious offense prosecution.  As such, it is a criminal


prosecution within the Sixth Amendment. 


The Sixth Amendment guarantees counsel


regardless of the sentence or sanction imposed.  There are


two reasons why this is so.  One is textual; the other is


common sensical. 


QUESTION:  You're not saying it would guarantee


counsel if only a fine were imposed.


MR. DUKE:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  The counsel


would be guaranteed in any serious offense prosecution.


QUESTION:  Well, how do you reconcile that with


Argersinger?


MR. DUKE:  Because Argersinger, Mr. Chief


Justice, was a petty offense case.  Argersinger explicitly


assumed that if it were a serious offense case, there


would be the right to counsel.  In fact, the lower court


said there would be a right to counsel, but the lower

court said he can't have a lawyer here because this was a


petty offense. 


QUESTION:  Well, but wasn't the basis on -- the


basis you're submitting now wasn't the basis on which the


Supreme Court of Alabama ruled, was it? 


MR. DUKE:  It -- it was not the -- the


rationale, but it -- it does support the result of the


Alabama Supreme Court's decision. 


QUESTION:  But I thought that the main issue


that we had here is the one we've been talking about, is


you have to give a person a lawyer when it is a petty


offense.  And the fact is that there's going to be a


suspended sentence.  So, what about that question? 


I mean -- and I -- I thought that Mr. Fried's


main point was don't do it because if you say you have to


give a person a lawyer, where it's a petty offense and the


only key thing is is a suspended sentence, I'll tell you


there are 1,800,000 people who have received probation in


petty offenses.  And there must have been some stick if


they violated probation, and that stick is like a


suspended sentence.  So, deal with it when you worry about


the probation violation; don't worry about it up front. 


That's -- that's what, I take it, is basically the


argument. 


And I've been waiting for you to talk because I

thought you might be a person who'd know the statistics. 


So, you might know if that's really so if -- or which


seems hard to get at how many of those $1.5 million


walking-around probation people did -- were never offered


a lawyer.  What's --


MR. DUKE:  We don't know. 


QUESTION:  We don't know.  So, what are we


supposed to do? 


MR. DUKE:  The -- the studies that I've seen


suggest that in misdemeanor -- petty misdemeanor cases,


frequently the -- the people are offered a lawyer in a --


in a group and it's suggested that most of them don't need


lawyers because they're not going to jail. 


But I submit, Justice Breyer, that the -- that


the real red herring in this case is treating this as a


petty offense.  This is not a petty --


QUESTION:  And it's not offense because? 


MR. DUKE:  Because the authorized sentence in


this case was 1 year, which made the jury trial right --


guaranteed him a right to a jury trial under the Sixth


Amendment, and because this was a criminal prosecution.


QUESTION:  But the question presented is this. 


In light of the actual imprisonment standard established


in Argersinger, refined in Scott, does the imposition of a


suspended or conditional sentence in a misdemeanor case

invoke a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel?


Now, I think what you're saying is that the


Supreme Court of Alabama decision could be supported on


another ground, but I'm not sure it -- it fits within the


question presented. 


MR. DUKE:  Well, I submit it does, Mr. Chief


Justice, because as I suggested, Argersinger dealt with a


petty offense.  Scott dealt with the question of


imprisoning somebody, but the -- but the fundamental


question here that -- that this Court should not allow


itself to get embroiled in it to repeat the mistake is to


treat this as if this is a trivial case because -- or to


put it this way, at some point someone has to ask the


question how is it that this defendant in this case had a


constitutional right to a jury trial under the Sixth


Amendment because this was a criminal prosecution, but he


did not have a right to assistance of counsel.


QUESTION:  Our -- our cases have reached


different results on those two issues.


MR. DUKE:  But, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the


Scott opinion, which you wrote, did not actually address


the serious offense 6-month distinction because the


parties were not addressing it.


QUESTION:  Where do you get that from?  You're


appealing to the text of the Constitution.  Aren't all

misdemeanors criminal offenses?


MR. DUKE:  All --


QUESTION:  Aren't all misdemeanors criminal


offenses? 


MR. DUKE:  They're criminal offenses but they're


not criminal prosecutions.


QUESTION:  And -- and what does the Constitution


say? 


MR. DUKE:  Pardon?


QUESTION:  And what does the Constitution say? 


It says in all criminal prosecutions. 


MR. DUKE:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  So, if you're appealing to the


Constitution -- and -- and you say it's clear language.  I


don't think it is.  But if -- if you think it's clear


language, you should be arguing that even in petty


offenses you're entitled to counsel.


MR. DUKE:  I -- I don't think I have to argue


that, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  No, only if you rely on the text of


the Constitution, which is what I thought you were doing.


MR. DUKE:  I'm saying that the right to a jury


trial exists because and only because it's a criminal


prosecution under the Sixth Amendment.  Logically,


therefore, if it is a criminal prosecution under the Sixth

Amendment, then there is a right to counsel because the


Sixth Amendment says there is.  But what the right to


counsel should be in petty offenses is a different issue.


QUESTION:  Why?  It's a criminal offense.  If --


if you're arguing --


MR. DUKE:  It's a criminal offense --


QUESTION:  -- from the text of the Constitution


that says in all criminal prosecutions, it includes petty


misdemeanors as well as what you call major misdemeanors.


MR. DUKE:  I'm not arguing that all petty


offenses are criminal prosecutions.  They plainly are not.


QUESTION:  I know you're arguing it. 


MR. DUKE:  They're not. 


QUESTION:  They are not criminal prosecutions?


MR. DUKE:  No, otherwise there would be a right


to a jury trial.  There is not a right to a jury trial.


QUESTION:  Has this Court held that there is a


congruent right to a jury trial and --


MR. DUKE:  No. 


QUESTION:  No.  All right.


MR. DUKE:  But nor has it --


QUESTION:  Now, before I wrote an opinion


signing on to that, I'd like to see a brief. 


MR. DUKE:  Nor has it --


QUESTION:  I'd like everybody to --

 MR. DUKE:  Nor has it held otherwise.


QUESTION:  What? 


MR. DUKE:  Nor has it held otherwise.


QUESTION:  Fine.  But before I decide something


like that, I'd like to have everyone present their point


of view.  I actually read the briefs.  I'm interested in


both sides.  And -- and suddenly to decide it in this


case, what would you suggest we do?  I'm not going to


decide something like that myself without having it fully


briefed.  And -- and so, what would you suggest we do with


this case? 


MR. DUKE:  Then -- then I urge the Court to at


least reserve the issue of what is the appropriate right


to counsel in a serious offense where, as in this case,


the defendant has a constitutional right to jury trial.


Let me just briefly quote Justice Powell, joined


by then Justice Rehnquist, on the following proposition. 


Wherever the right to counsel line is to be drawn, it must


be drawn so that an indigent has a right to appointed


counsel in all cases where there's a right to a jury


trial.  If there is no accompanying right to counsel, the


right to a jury trial becomes meaningless.  No Justice of


this Court, so far as I know, in the last 40 years has


disagreed with that proposition. 


QUESTION:  But the jury trial line is 6 months'

imprisonment, isn't it? 


MR. DUKE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And here, under Argersinger, it could


be 1 day. 


MR. DUKE:  Argersinger dealt with a stop-gap


issue about where there's no right to a jury trial, can we


deny counsel, and Argersinger said no, not if you send the


person to prison because that's the basic due process


proposition.  There's no -- it's not a criminal


prosecution under the Sixth Amendment.  It's a due process


issue as in Powell against Alabama.  It's fundamentally


unfair to send somebody to prison without giving him a


lawyer. 


With respect to the -- the argument that Mr.


Fried makes, that this is essentially a little bit of an


extension of Nichols, there's no way that a -- the


sentence in this case could be activated, imposed without,


in effect, holding that the defendant can be sent to jail,


convicted of a crime and sent to jail, without providing


him a lawyer.  This Court --


QUESTION:  Well, it doesn't follow that he could


be sent to jail without providing him a lawyer in the


subsequent proceeding. 


MR. DUKE:  Yes, but --


QUESTION:  I mean, in Nichols, after all, we had

another conviction, and we had a lawyer representing the


individual when the question came up whether the first


conviction should be considered and so on.  And that may


well be so, let's say, on -- on Mr. Fried's view.  There


would be a subsequent proceeding, and there would at least


-- this is not a position he's arguing for this morning,


but it would be consistent with his position that counsel


be provided in that subsequent proceeding. 


MR. DUKE:  Yes, but the crucial difference is


that the defendant under this proceeding that Mr. Fried is


-- is urging the Court to approve -- the defendant would


be sent to jail without his guilt ever being determined in


a criminal trial in which he was represented by counsel. 


Never.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. PRYOR, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PRYOR:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  General, what was the -- assuming


that Mr. Fried's position is adopted by the Court, what is


the maximum time that the Alabama trial judge could


sentence the violator to?  What's the maximum time in


prison?


MR. PRYOR:  The suspended sentence was 30 days,

Justice Kennedy.


QUESTION:  The suspended sentence of 30 days.


MR. PRYOR:  That's -- that's correct. 


QUESTION:  Can I ask you before --


MR. PRYOR:  Yes, Justice Breyer. 


QUESTION:  There are -- at the bottom line of


the Alabama Supreme Court has two phrases in it.  The


first one, it says, we reverse that aspect of his sentence


imposing 30 days of suspended jail time.  We reverse. 


MR. PRYOR:  Right. 


QUESTION:  Then it goes to say, we tell


everybody to the trial court vacate that aspect which


imposed the suspended jail time.  Those are two things. 


We reverse and we tell them to vacate. 


As to the first, we reverse that aspect, the


State of Alabama agrees because they were there arguing in


the Alabama Supreme Court that a real suspended sentence


that meant something could be imposed, and here you're


saying it's not a real sentence because we can never carry


it out.  So, am I right in thinking it's the second part


that you disagree with and not the first part? 


MR. PRYOR:  We're trying to make sense, as we


understand it, of -- of the application of the rule of


actual imprisonment.  And I will acknowledge Mr. Fried may


be right, and if so, we would welcome that.  But our

understanding of Argersinger and Scott is we cannot


activate the suspended sentence --


QUESTION:  I'm not really asking about your -- I


just want to know if you agree or you disagree with their


part which says we reverse that aspect of the sentence.


MR. PRYOR:  No.  No, Justice Breyer, I don't


agree with that.  And -- and the reason I don't agree with


that is because Mr. Mills said something that I think is


correct when he said that the Alabama Supreme Court struck


only the suspended sentence and based only on Federal law,


and what I contend is a misapprehension of Federal law.


But the suspended sentence itself is not a sham.  It's a


device to allow the court to impose probation, which is at


a minimum then fully enforceable through the same power


that's available to the -- to any court to enforce any


judgment, including a mere fine, which Mr. Mills concedes


does not trigger a right to court-appointed counsel.


Now, I wanted to address one of the concerns


raised by Justice Souter as to the practicality.  There


are some aspects -- some statistics we know as to the


practicalities that are helpful, but I will admit we don't


know everything that we need to know.  We know that there


are approximately 115,000 misdemeanors each year in the


State of Alabama.  Those are addressed in our reply brief,


the yellow brief.  We know that approximately 25,000 of


46

those result in supervised probation.  We don't know from


the administrative office of courts in Alabama how many


result in unsupervised probation. 


We also know in Alabama -- this is not addressed


in our brief, but I checked it with -- with information in


State government -- that between -- there are between


2,100 and 2,200 attorneys in Alabama who accept court-


appointed work.  Unfortunately, the fact that we don't


know is how many of these cases, whether supervised or


unsupervised probation and in misdemeanor cases, involve


indigent defendants.  But I hope that's at least somewhat


helpful. 


QUESTION:  Let me ask you one more question. 


And I -- I don't imagine your statistics show this, but I


want to pass it up.  Out of the 115, do we know, A, how


many of those were fine-only cases, not suspended


sentences, but fine-only cases, and B, how many of those


were motor vehicle cases? 


MR. PRYOR:  Were -- were?


QUESTION:  Were motor vehicle cases because the


motor vehicle cases take you out of this problem, I


assume, in fine situations because if the fine isn't paid,


the motor vehicle -- I mean, the -- the motor vehicle laws


simply provide a -- a purely civil administrative means of


-- of remedying the problem.  And if they are a

substantial part of the 115, then the -- the fear of what


this will do, in fact, is somewhat -- the Alabama Supreme


Court's view is -- is somewhat lessened.  Do you know


those numbers?


MR. PRYOR:  No, I don't.  But -- but I do know


that 2,100 lawyers to take -- when we have 25,000


supervised probation and some number in excess of that of


unsupervised probation, still means that it's a daunting


task. 


Justice Ginsburg, the point that you raised


about the cost of counsel not being incurred by more


affluent defendants I think is relevant from this


standpoint, when you consider that it is reasonable then


for the State to preserve its own resources, just as a


more affluent defendant would -- would preserve its


resources not to incur the cost of counsel in this kind of


circumstance. 


As to the argument that Argersinger would


require the trial judge to inform the defendant that a


sentence of imprisonment will not be imposed because


counsel is not being appointed, that is not what


Argersinger or Scott require.  Argersinger and Scott


merely deprive the trial court of that remedy upon


conviction, but there's no requirement that the defendant


be informed of that. 


48

Alderson Reporting Company 

 As to Mr. Duke's argument that -- that there's a


distinction made in those decisions between petty and


serious offenses, it's -- it's simply not there, and --


and this is a misdemeanor case.  It's clearly a criminal


proceeding where the defendant not only enjoyed a Sixth


Amendment right to retain counsel, but the record shows


that he clearly understood that right to retain counsel.


Thank you. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, General


Pryor.
