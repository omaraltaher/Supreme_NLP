CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  14­613,  Green  v.  Brennan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Wolfman. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  BRIAN  WOLFMAN 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  basic  principle  of  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

timeliness  cases,  Title  VII  and  otherwise,  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clock  starts  when  the  cause  of  action  is  complete. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  a  constructive  discharge  claim  is  complete  only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

after  the  employee  resigns,  this  Court  should  reverse. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  court  has  indicated  that  limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  should  be  as  simple  as  possible.  The  Tenth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's  rule,  however,  injects  unnecessary  complexity. 

 

 

 

 

 

Identifying  the  last  discriminatory  act  in  an  alleged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hostile  work  environment  can  be  difficult. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  as  this  Court  said  in  early  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  does  the  statute  say? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Can  we  look  at  the  statute?  What's  it  ­­ what  does  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  say? 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  The  statute  says  matter  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

aggrieved  party  has  to  bring  within  45  days  the  matter

alleged  to  be  discriminatory. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  The  matter  alleged  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory.  And  is  the  resignation  of  ­­ of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  a  matter  alleged  to  be  discriminatory? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

matter  ­­

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Absolutely,  Your  Honor.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  The  employee  discriminated 

  

 

 

 

against  himself? 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  No.  The  matter  ­­ the  matter 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

alleged  is  the  whole  of  the  claim.  As  the  dictionaries 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  and  as  most  of  the  lower  courts  say,  the  matter  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  shorthanded  way  of  referring  to  the  cause  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  that  the  ­­ the  person  is  bringing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here,  the  matter  ­­ and  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undisputed  ­­ is  a  constructive  discharge  which,  as  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  in  Suders,  has  two  elements,  both  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precipitating  conduct  and  the  resignation.  Without 

  

 

 

 

 

both,  there  is  no  constructive  discharge  claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  for  a  constructive 

   

  

 

 

discharge  claim  to  succeed  you  have  to  point  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory  or  an  unlawful  act. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  It  is  true  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  so  we  have  to  find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  anyway. 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  It  is  true  that  that  is  one

component.  There  is  no  question  that  there  are  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  ­­ again,  Suders  said  there  would  be  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precipitating  conduct  and  the  resignation;  both  elements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  be  present  for  there  to  be  constructive  discharge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  ­­ but  let's  assume  for  a  second  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ that  the  ­­ the  matter  alleged  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory  is  ambiguous  in  some  sense.  Then  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  should  just  go  to  its  time­honored  default  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Default  rule  is  that  the  cause  of  action  must  be  fully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formed  before  the  limitations  period  is  triggered. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Of  course.  That's  ­­ that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

rule  is  adopted  for  statutes  that  do  not  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation  provision.  What  use  is  the  conciliation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provision  once  the  employee  has  quit? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  I  ­­ I  think  not,  Your  Honor. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

The  conciliation  process  always  anticipates  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  will  have  occurred;  that  the  acts  giving  rise  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  claim,  including  all  the  elements,  have  occurred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  conciliation  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  fine,  but  the 

  

 

 

 

 

employer  can  make  it  up,  you  know.  It's  ­­ they  try  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring  the  employer  and  the  employee  together. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  That  is  true. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Right? 

  

 

MR.  WOLFMAN:  But  only  ­­

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  he's  quit.  He's  gone. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

He's  no  longer  an  employee.  What  conciliation  can  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be? 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Your  Honor,  that  is  true  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  of  the  acts  that  could  be  brought  prior  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45­day  trigger.  For  instance,  a  termination  would  fit 

   

  

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  scenario  you're  suggesting,  a  termination 

   

 

 

 

 

which,  after  all,  is  the  analogue  to  the  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge.  That  claim  cannot  be  brought  into  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation  process  until  it  exists. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it's  just  the  first  component  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  ­­ what  you're  referring  to,  Your  Honor,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conciliation  ­­ moves  quickly  into  a  more  adversarial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

stages,  and  all  of  those  stages  presuppose  that  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  cause  of  action  that  exists,  or  a  claim  that  exists. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  again,  that's  quite  consistent  with  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  default  rule  that  ­­ that  the  limitations  period 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ is  not  triggered  until  the  claim  is  fully  formed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  perfectly  consistent  with  all  of  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Title  VII  timeliness  cases. 

 

 

 

            

If  you  look  at,  for  instance,  Evans,  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  Ricks.  At  Ricks  there  was  a  fully  formed  cause 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  action,  and  that's  why  the  limitations  period  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

triggered,  because  the  limitations  period  was  triggered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  denial  of  tenure.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  somehow  feel 

    

   

 

 

you've  given  up  too  much.  You  can  charge  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory  termination,  correct?  And  that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

employer  making  a  decision  that  he  is  going  to  fire  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  reasons  that  are  not  legitimate;  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory. 

            

Isn't  a  constructive  discharge  that  the 

   

 

 

 

moment  that  the  environment  has  gotten  so  hostile  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  feel  overwhelmed  and  have  to  leave,  isn't  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory  act  as  well? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Yes.  I  think  ­­

    

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  that  that  discharge 

  

 

 

 

 

itself  is  discriminatory  because  it  ­­ the  employer  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeded  in  a  pattern  that  has  led  you  to  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision? 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  That's  exactly  right.  And  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

did  not  mean  to  be  retreating  from  that  position  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  two  elements  of  the  claim.  So  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resignation  is  part  and  parcel  of  the  claim.  You  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  precipitating  conduct,  and  you  have  the  resignation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  what  I'm  saying. 

  

 

 

 

 

I  don't  think  ­­ I  think  it's  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  keep  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

it  as  two  separate  elements.

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Well,  there  are  separate 

  

 

 

 

 

elements  but  when  the  resignation  occurs,  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  is  imputed  to  the  employer. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  the 

  

 

 

precipitating  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  It's  imputed  to  the  employer. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  They're  ­­ they're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

always  the  same  at  the  same  point.  The  employer  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  discriminating  against  this  employee  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years,  and  ­­ and  there's  no  additional  discrimination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  an  entire  year.  But  the  employee  has  finally  gotten 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fed  up  with  it,  and  after  a  year,  during  which  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  has  done  nothing  else  discriminatory,  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides  I'm  going  to  quit.  Now  he'd  still  have  a  claim 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for,  you  know,  discriminatory  provoking  of  ­­ of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quitting,  but  the  ­­ but  the  time  period  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination  and  the  time  period  for  the  quitting  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  year  apart. 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Well,  that's  certainly 

  

 

 

 

possible,  but  again,  that  would  ­­ that  would  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  in  many  situations. 

 

 

 

            

So,  for  instance,  let's  assume  for  a  second 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  had  been  a  discriminatory  demotion  on  day 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

one,  and  then  a  year  later  there  has  been  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory  termination  with  perhaps  the  exact  same

motive.  No  one  disputes  that  both  of  those  claims  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independently  actionable,  and  no  one  disputes  that  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations  periods  have  a  different  trigger  date. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  is  an  act  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer,  and  quitting  is  not  an  act  of  the  employer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  act  of  the  employer  ­­ the  unlawful  act  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  is  coercing  the  quitting.  So  you  have  to  find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  act  on  his  part  that  coerces  the  quitting.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  different  from  the  employer  discharging  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  ­­

 

            

            

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  There  are  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ for  discriminatory  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  WOLFMAN:  ­­ are  some  differences,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  point  is  that  the  resignation,  at  the  point  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resignation,  when  the  cause  of  action  accrues  ­­ and  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  here  disputes  that's  when  the  cause  of  action

will  be  dismissed  if  the  person  is  still  on  the  job  and

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Wolfman  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  WOLFMAN:  This  is  part  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative  case. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  ­­ you  might  be  pulled  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  different  directions  here  but  you  don't  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept  what  Justice  Sotomayor  is  saying  to  win  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case;  isn't  that  right? 

 

 

 

            

In  other  words,  one  could  say,  yes,  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  discriminatory  acts  language,  that  might  point  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  last  predicate  discriminatory  act  as  opposed  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resignation,  it  might  or  it  might  not,  but  here  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  doesn't  exist.  Here  the  language  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory  matter.  That  refers  to  the  entire  claim. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  when  you  refer  to  the  entire  claim,  it's  clear  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  resignation  is  part  and  parcel  of  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  That  is  right.  I  mean,  we  ­­

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  it  at  least  creates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity,  such  that  the  default  rule  would  operate.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  you  don't  have  not  to  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  WOLFMAN:  I  think  that  is  true,  that  we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  argued  this  in  two  alternative  ways.  One  is  simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  cause  of  action  is  not  complete  until  there's  a

resignation.  And  we  think  the  regulation  is  clear,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  it  were  not  clear,  the  default  rule  kicks  in  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  win. 

 

            

But  there's  no  question  also  that  one  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premises  of  the  constructive  discharge,  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

eviction,  constructive  termination  as  in  the  Mac's  Shell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  there  is  no  question  that  there  is  this  idea  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  relationship  is  ended,  that  is  imputed  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer.  Some  courts  have  focused  more  on  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale,  and  others  have  focused  more  on  our  principal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale,  which  is  simply  that  the  cause  of  action  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  complete  until  the  resignation  occurs. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  doesn't  that  mean 

  

 

 

 

 

that  it's  within  the  employee's  ability  to  stretch  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  that  he  has?  Plus  there  could  have  been  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  discrimination  and  the  employee  stays  on  the  job, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  sometime  down  the  road  decides  to  quit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

is  a  concern  in  theory  but  not  in  practice.  In  ­­ in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reality,  there  are  no  such  claims.  The  claims  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  weak  that  those  constructive  discharge  claims  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought,  and  amicus  cites  no  claims  of  that  nature. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  let  me  just  say  that  in  this  case  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  decision  in  Bay  Area  Laundry,  which  applied  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default  rule,  the  same  ­­ the  same  concern  was  raised

that  the  limitations  period,  the  trigger,  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  hands  of  the  plaintiff.  And  the  Court  said, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  that  may  be  so,  but  that's  the  way  the  statute  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

written,  the  limitations  period  was  written,  and  so  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

And  the  Court  also  added  that  the  plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  incentives  to  bring  the  claim  as  soon  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible,  and  that  would,  of  course,  be  true  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  ­­ if  in  fact  the  person  could  no  longer  take  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  would  want  to  leave.  They  certainly  wouldn't  want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  bring  a  weak  claim  that  came  years  after  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precipitating  conduct.  That  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  not  ­­ not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

years  but  maybe  several  months.  I  mean,  you  know,  yes, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  take  it  anymore,  but  maybe  you  also  need  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paycheck  or  ­­ or,  you  know,  you're  going  to  be  eligible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  bonus  in  six  weeks,  you  may  as  well  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wait  until  then. 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  That  is  possible.  There 

  

  

 

 

 

are  ­­ most  cases,  most  of  the  constructive  discharge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  are  bought  ­­ brought  promptly.  Again,  no  one  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested  here  ­­ and  there  are  many  constructive

Justice  Kagan's  question?  You  were  discussing  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

possibility  of  deciding  this  case  based  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  language  of  the  regulation  that  applies  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  your  question  presented  is  phrased  much  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadly. 

            

You  say  under  Federal  employment 

 

 

 

 

discrimination  law,  so  I  took  that  to  mean  that  the  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you're  advocating  would  be  the  same  for  public  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  sector  employment. 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  I  think  it  would  be,  Your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  and  I  think  so.  I  think  this  ­­ this  Court's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  would  apply  there,  or  at  least  give  significant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance.  The  private  sector  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  there  is  ­­ this  matter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged  to  be  discriminatory  applies  only  to  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment. 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  That  is  correct,  but  if  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  ­­ if  I  might  extend  my  answer.  The  ­­ the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  sector  statute  talks  about  an  unlawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment  of  practice  occurring.  And  again,  in  light 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  default  rule,  even  if  there's  ambiguity  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  phraseology,  in  light  of  the  default  rule,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  very  likely  that  you're  going  to  have  the  same  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  in  both  situations. 

 

 

 

            

Both  of  them  seem  to  be  describing  the

claim,  the  cause  of  action,  what  it  is  that  the  employee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  complaining  about. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Isn't  it  true  that  outside 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  area  of  constructive  discharge  ­­ and  maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharge  is  different,  and  I  think  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

really  the  thrust  of  your  argument.  But  outside  of  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  there  must  be  an  act  of  intentional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination  within  the  limitations  period. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Well,  that  is  likely  correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  by  that  you  are  rejecting  the  notion  ­­ again,  in  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion  with  Justice  Sotomayor  ­­ that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resignation  is  imputed  to  the  employer.  And  that  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  the  case,  Your  Honor  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yeah,  but  you're  arguing 

  

 

 

 

 

that  there's  ­­ because  there's  this  imputation,  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  for  constructive  discharge. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  my  ­­ my  question  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  of  that  context,  under  Evans  and  Ricks  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Morgan  and  Ledbetter,  there  must  be  an  act  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  discrimination  within  the  limitations 

 

 

 

 

period. 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  But  let's  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

clear  about  what  those  cases  stand  for.  Those  cases  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reflect  the  facts  as  you  just  stated  them.  But  in  each

of  those  cases,  the  trigger  date  was  when  the  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  became  actionable,  and  that's  the  exact  same  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  asking  for  here. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

And  let  me  again  extend  my  answer  to  you, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito,  which  it  is  true  that  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  could  be  unique  in  the  sense  you're  suggesting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Title  VII  case,  in  the  Title  VII  area.  But  let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remember  that  constructive  eviction,  constructive 

 

 

 

 

business  termination  are  treated  the  exact  same  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  do  want  to  go  back  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  of  the  practical  implications.  As  I  ­­ as  I  began 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  the  Tenth  Circuit  rule  would  inject  unnecessary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complexity.  By  contrast,  the  date  of  resignation  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

easy  to  identify.  Most  administrative  claimants  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

laypeople  and  are  unlikely  to  be  cognizant  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last­act  rule  posited  by  the  Tenth  Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Reasonable  intuition;  that  is,  common  sense, 

 

 

 

 

 

will  tell  an  employee  that  I  cannot  and  certainly  need 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  bring  my  claim  that  I  was  forced  out  before  I  was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  forced  out. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

the  government  suggests  that  this  is  exactly  a  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it's  not  so  easy  to  figure  out  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  termination  was.

MR.  WOLFMAN:  No,  Your  Honor,  I  think  it

the  case  ­­ you  know,  someone  says  this  is  ridiculous,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  take  it  anymore,  I  will  resign  in  three  months.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  what  is  the  date  of  constructive  termination  then? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Well,  our  rule  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

definitive  notice  of  resignation.  I  think  the 

    

 

 

 

 

government  agrees  with  that.  And  so  if  you  hand  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letter  or  you  state  I  am  going  to  resign  on  Friday  or

says  it  to  himself  or  the  date  that  he  does  resign? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Oh.  Was  the  Chief  Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

 

positing  something  going  on  in  the  mind  of  the  ­­ of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff? 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  no.  It's  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

it's,  you  know,  I  think  it's  fairly  common  for  people  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  a  resignation  date  at  some  point  in  the  future.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  a  schoolteacher  will  say  as  soon  as  this  school 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year  is  over,  I'm  out  of  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  I  think  the  date  of 

    

 

 

 

 

resignation  is  the  date  the  teacher  says  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

yet. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Then  no  ­­

MR.  WOLFMAN:  There  is  a  cause  of  action 

   

  

 

 

 

 

because  there's  been  a  resignation,  definitive  notice  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

resignation.  It's  true  that  the  person  is  still  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

job  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  He's  still  getting  paid. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  WOLFMAN:  That  is  correct,  but  ­­ but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  has  resigned.  And  the  lower  courts  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  He  hasn't  resigned.  He's 

  

  

 

 

 

given  notice  of  his  intention  to  resign  three  months 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  now. 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  I  don't  believe  ­­ if  the  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  Court  wishes  to  adopt  a  ­­ a  last­day­of­work 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

rule,  that  obviously  would  benefit  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  No  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  WOLFMAN:  ­­ I'm  fine. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ I'm  just  adopting  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rule  of  what  he  says.  If  he  says  I  resign,  he's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resigned.  If  he  says  I  will  resign  in  three  months,  he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  resign  until  three  months. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  We  believe  that  when  someone, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  instance,  hands  in  a  letter  and  said,  my  last  day  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  ­­ I  resign,  my  last  day  of  work  will  be  Friday,

that  that  constitutes  a  resignation,  and  that  our  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  definitive  date  of  resignation. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  Court  wishes,  again,  to  adopt  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last­date­of  ­­ of­work  rule,  that  would  obviously

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Gannon. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CURTIS  E.  GANNON 

 

 

 

 

 

                 

ON  BEHALF  OF  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

We  agree  with  petitioner  that  the  period  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initiating  administrative  consideration  of  a 

 

 

 

 

constructive­discharge  claim  should  begin  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  gives  notice  of  resignation  and  not  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  commits  the  last  act  which  might  or  might  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lead  to  that  resignation. 

 

 

 

            

And  if  I  can  turn  to  the  colloquy  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice  and  Justice  Scalia  were  just  having  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  friend,  we  think  that  one  of  the  virtues  of  this  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  it  ­­ it  leads  to  the  same  result  in  both  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  actual  termination  and  cases  of  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  don't  you  change  ­­ why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  you  just  amend  the  regulation? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  we  think  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  We're  interpreting  the 

  

 

 

 

language  ­­ it's  not  even  a  statute.  It's  a  regulation. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

It's  your  regulation. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GANNON:  It  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  don't  you  just  amend  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  it  clear?  You  think  this  is  a  sensible  rule,  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  very  clear  rule.  And  it's  probably  a  sensible  rule 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

when  you've  got  a  45­day  period.

Why  don't  you  just  change  the  regulation?

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ this  elaborate 

  

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  The  EEOC  may  well  do  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito.  The  same  question  is  going  to  present

question  presents  itself  in  the  non­Federal  sector  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute,  as  has  already  been  discussed,  refers  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  allegedly  unlawful  employment  practice 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred.  And  the  EEOC  has  construed  this  portion  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  regulation  as  being  effectively  the  same  as  the  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  non­Federal  sector.

And  the  rule  that  we're  asking  for  is  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  rule  from  Ricks.  It's  the  exact  same  rule. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  rule  about  being  when  definitive  notice  has  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ is  given  for  a  termination,  Justice  Scalia,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  saying  that  when  somebody  says  I  quit,  my  last  day 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  work  is  three  months  from  now,  therefore,  he  hasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  quit,  that's  Ricks. 

 

 

 

            

The  Court  concluded  that  when  the  employer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  said  you  have  been  denied  tenure,  here  is  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terminal  contract,  you  will  be  working  here  for  only  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  year,  that  the  relevant  date  was  the  date  on  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  operative  decision  had  been  made  and  it  had  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicated  to  the  employee.  And  so  we  think  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  should  be  the  same  for  cases  of  actual  discharge  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  Ricks  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  ­­ and  constructive  discharge. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Ricks  alleged  only 

  

 

 

 

discrimination,  not  discriminatory  ­­ not  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge. 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That's  true.  There  is  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

difference  here. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  why  I  have  a 

   

  

 

 

 

problem  with  Ricks. 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well  ­­

Ricks  reads  directly  on  what  you're  saying.  You  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  have  an  extension. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  We're  trying  to  say  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  the  same  rule  should  apply  to  actual  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharges,  and  ­­ and  it  is  a  rule  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

date  of  notification  rather  than  date  of  separation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  the  rule  that  everybody  applies  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination  side;  it's  the  rule  that  most  of  the  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  appeals  have  applied  in  the  ­­ in  the  discharge  side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

In  the  context  of  terminations,  only 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Stevens  suggested  we  should  be  using  the  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

date  of  separation  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  again,  as  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Scalia  points  out,  there's  a  difference  between  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

employee  taking  the  action  and  the  ­­ and  the  employer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking  the  action  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

Ricks. 

            

MR.  GANNON:  We  agree  that  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ and  that  distinguishes 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  That  does  ­­ that  does  make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  different.  That's  why  this  isn't  on  all  fours 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  Ricks.  And  we  do  think  that  you  would  have  to  make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  decision  that  you  want  to  apply  the  same  rule  across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  constructive  discharge  context.  But  we  think  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  you  would  do  that  is  precisely  because,  as  the

Court  acknowledged  in  Suders,  a  constructive  discharge 

   

 

 

 

 

requires  both  an  employee's  decision  to  resign  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precipitating  conduct.  And  until  both  of  those  things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  happened,  there  is  no  constructive  discharge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nobody  can  say  I  have  been  constructively  discharged 

   

 

 

 

 

 

until  both  of  those  things  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  seems  to  me  you're  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  loading  the  dice  when  ­­ when  you  say  it  requires

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  the  ­­

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  No,  we  weren't  discussing

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  we  were  discussing  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  was  discussing  when  a  constructive  discharge  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

actionable,  and  that  until  ­­ and  so  we  do  think  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  the  decision  in  the  employee's  head.  We  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  decision  has  to  actually  be  communicated.

concern  for  counseling  and  conciliation  that  you  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussing  with  my  friend,  which  is  that,  as  in  cases  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination,  it  could  be  that  everybody  knows  that  the

or  an  actual  discharge. 

 

 

 

            

Everybody  knows  when  the  employer  says, 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  fired,  your  last  day  of  work  is  14  days  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today,  same  thing  when  the  employee  says  I'm  giving  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice,  I  quit,  my  last  day  is  14  days  from  today.  At 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  point,  whichever  one  has  happened,  the  employee  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  and  initiate  counseling.  He  may  not  be  out  the  door 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet.  There  may  be  a  resolution  that  happens.  If  he 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

does  end  up  going  out  the  door,  counseling  can  happen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

afterwards.  But  he  doesn't  have  to  initiate  counseling 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  this  happens.  There's  a  45­day  ­­

MR.  GANNON:  That  ­­ that  is  generally  true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  rest  of  the  doctrine.  That  has  nothing  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  statute  of  limitations.  The  EEOC  will  ask  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  tell  your  employer  this  is  why  you  were  resigning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  will  be  something  that  will  make  it  more  difficult  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  his  case.  But  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  think  whether  he  has  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  or  not  has  a  lot  to  do  with  ­­ with  when  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective  date  ought  to  be,  it  seems  to  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  we  think  that  the  reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  counts  as  being  an  act  that  should  be  imputed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  employer  is  because  it  is  forced  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances. 

            

And  we  think  that  the  doctrine  itself  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­limiting.  It  limits  the  time  period  between  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employee  is  able  to  suffer  the  consequence  of  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employer  does  to  him,  and  then  actually  say  I  can't

same  rule  here,  and  we  think  that  the  reason  why  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called  a  constructive  discharge  is  ­­ is  right  there  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  phrase  is  ­­ is  pregnant  with  the  idea  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  action  that  is  being  imputed  to  the  employer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  although  it  is  true  that,  unlike  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regular  ­­ the  other  claim  of  discrimination  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy  was  mentioning  before  in  Ricks,  although 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employer  has  not  actually  done  something  necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during  the  limitations  period,  the  new  act  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination  that  we  think  is  relevant  here  is  the  act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  employee,  and  it's  one  that  it's  called  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharge  precisely  because  it  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  a  discharge.  It  is  instead  an  act  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  that  is  a  resignation,  but  it  is  treated  in  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  legal  fiction  as  if  it  is  a  discharge.  And  we 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  that's  ­­ that  squares  the  circle  here.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Of  course,  I  would  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

would  take  the  term  constructive  discharge  to  refer  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  notice  of  quitting,  but  rather  to  the  acts  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  that  forced  the  quitting.  Even  though  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  hasn't  been  discharged,  you  have  constructively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharged  him  because  you've  made  his  life  miserable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  I  ­­ I  take  the  point,

constructive  discharge.  Until  the  employee  actually 

  

 

 

 

 

says  I'm  quitting,  there  has  not  been  a  constructive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge.  And  so  just  because  an  ­­ and  this  may  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Justice  Sotomayor  was  asking  about  before,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  that  ­­ that  works 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  way  with  eviction  and  other  cases  where  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  constructive,  that  the  person  has  to  act  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  That  ­­ that's  correct.  And  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  constructive  eviction  case  is  a  very  close 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

parallel.  And  it  shows  that  it's  unusual  but  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unprecedented  that  the  plaintiff  might  be  the  one  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  controls  when  the  clock  starts  on  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  limitations. 

 

            

And  take  the  case  of  a  constructive 

   

 

 

 

 

eviction.  If  somebody  wants  to  bring  a  claim  for  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

breach  of  the  covenant  of  warranty,  that's  a  claim  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  start  until  the  tenant  has  been  evicted,  either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  or  constructively.  And  so  there's  some  choice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  of  when  ­­ when  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  do  you  mean, 

  

 

 

 

 

constructively?  I  don't  understand.  Constructive  of  ­­

you're  still  occupying  the  premises?

one  version  of  constructive  eviction.  Under  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  more  classical  version  of  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eviction  that  came  up  in  cases  involving  breach  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covenant  of  warranty,  the  eviction  would  be  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  no  one  actually  came  and  forced  you  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instead,  you  just  yielded  to  a  superior  claim  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

paramount  title,  and  that  was  your  choice  of  when  you

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  in  fact  you  don't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  out.  I  think  ­­

    

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GANNON:  In  fact  you  had  not  yet  ­­

eviction  while  you're  still  occupying  the  premises. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  the  Court  recognized  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Mac's  Shell  decision  that's  more  of  an  innovation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  it  wasn't  the  way  this  was  classically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handled.  And  ­­ and  in  Mac's  Shell  said  that  it  thought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  wasn't  a  constructive  termination  of  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

franchise  until  the  franchise  had  actually  ­­ until

both  the  classical  cases  of  constructive  eviction,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  of  constructive  discharge. 

 

 

 

 

            

We  think  that  it's  clear  that  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  says  this  would  be  bad  enough  for  me  to  resign

but  I'm  not  going  to  resign,  I  want  to  bring  a  claim  for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharge,  he  couldn't  do  that.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

could  ­­ he  could  say  I've  been  discriminated  against, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  could  say  there's  been  a  hostile  work  environment, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  we  do  think,  in  disagreement  with  ­­ with  my  friend, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court­appointed  amicus,  we  do  think  that  these  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  different  claims. 

 

 

            

And  the  Court's  opinion  in  Suders  indicated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  a  distinction  between,  for  instance,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

underlying  claim  for  hostile  work  environment  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  more  aggravated  claim  of  a  constructive  discharge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for  hostile  work  environment. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Do  the  predicate  acts  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  independently  actionable  or  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  I  don't  think  that  they  have  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

be.  In  most  cases  they  will  be.  We  ­­ we  take  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  as  probably  going  to  be  an  unusual  case  where  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  bring  a  constructive  discharge  and  nothing  else. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  paradigmatic  case  is  the  one  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  was  hypothesizing  in  Suders  where  you  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hostile  work  environment  where  there  are  lots  of  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  have  been  actionable  as  discrimination,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  wouldn't  have  necessarily  have  warranted  quitting. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  the  employee  says  this  is  too  much, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  crossed  the  line,  I'm  quitting.  That  second  claim

we  think  is  a  new  claim.  That's  why  the  Court  described 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  as  a  second  ­­ as  an  additional  ­­ as  a  graver  claim. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

And  in  the  discussion  of  amending  the 

 

 

 

 

complaints  that  ­­ that  the  amicus  invokes  in  the  EEOC's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

management  directive,  the  reason  why  the  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  and  the  amicus  can  say  that  the  employee  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  just  amend  a  timely  complaint  about  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

underlying  discrimination  and  add  a  claim  for 

   

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharge  is  because  the  EEOC  considers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  to  be  a  new  incident  of  discrimination.  But  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  actually  amend  a  pending  complaint  because  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

related  to  what  went  before. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  reason  why  you  have  to  amend  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  is  because  it's  a  new  claim.  It's  not  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that's  relevant  to  damages  for  the  underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination.  There's  ­­ there's  ­­ the  employee  is

him  to  take  that  job  at  the  lower  pay? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  You  mean  if  he  had  ­­ he  had

hasn't  taken  all  the  steps,  if  it  does  not  occur,

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  In  Wyoming. 

  

 

 

MR.  GANNON:  And  it  doesn't  say  that  he  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

a  choice  of  doing  that.  He  will  have  already  breached 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  second  sentence  if  he  decides  not  to  retire. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  not  have  the  second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  there? 

 

            

            

MR.  GANNON:  Pardon? 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  have  the  second 

  

 

 

 

 

sentence  there  at  all?  Why  are  you  giving  him  an  option 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  he's  ­­ if  he  hasn't  retired? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  We  do  not  read  this  as  giving 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  an  option.  We  read  this  as  responding  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  There  was  not  reached  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  below,  correct? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  This  was  reached  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

district  court.  It  was  an  alternative  holding  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court.  The  Petitioner  did  not  appeal  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  holding.  And  so  in  the  court  of  appeals, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  was  just  considering  the  antecedent  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  whether  we  should  only  look  to  the  act  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  or  also  the  act  of  the  employee. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  this  factual  question  didn't  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  up  before  the  court  of  appeals.  We  noted  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement  of  facts  in  our  court  of  appeals  brief  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  agreement  included  his  ­­ the  settlement  agreement

included  his  agreement  to  retire,  but  otherwise  we  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  the  case  on  his  premise,  and  the  court  of  appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  not  address  this. 

 

 

 

            

So  we  do  think  that  it  would  be  appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  Court  here,  if  it  agrees  with  us,  if  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  is  sufficiently  clear,  to  say  that  Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  lose  on  the  facts  of  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  want  to  remand  and  have  the  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  consider  whether  the  district  court  was  correct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  reaching  that,  that  would  also  be  appropriate.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  that  this  wouldn't  be  that  different  from  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  did  in  Irwin  where  in  Irwin  the  Court  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  the  court  of  appeals  was  wrong  about  finding  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  no  possibility  of  equitable  tolling; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nevertheless,  there  is  no  way  he  will  ever  satisfy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  tolling  on  the  facts  of  this  case,  so  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loses. 

            

And  I  do  think  that  one  final  thing  I  would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

like  to  say  is  that  the  Court  should  be  able  to  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  comfort  from  the  real­world  evidence  that  we  have. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  much.  We  don't  have  evidence  of  cases  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five  circuits  that  have  adopted  a  version  of  the  notice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  resignation  rule  between  1987  and  2000  that  indicates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  employers  are  being  besieged  with  stale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination  claims  that  are  being  revived  by

employees'  attempts  to  quit  some  months  or  years  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact.  And  so  we  think  that  it's  doesn't  present 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  concerns. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Frankly,  I'm  a  little 

   

  

 

 

less  moved  by  that  because,  from  my  personal  experience, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  stale  claims  generally  don't  make  it  past  a  motion 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  dismiss. 

 

            

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  that  ­­ that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Very  few  of  them  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

appealed  because  if  they're  really  that  stale,  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharge  claims  are  usually  thrown  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  I  ­­

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  case  is  litigated  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other  grounds. 

 

            

MR.  GANNON:  Well,  I  think  that's  right,  but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

­­ and  I  think  that  ­­ but  it's  also  the  case  that  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  cases,  in  fact  in  most  cases,  there  isn't  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  very  much  time  between  these  two  dates,  and  therefore 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  usually  isn't  going  to  be  that  dispositive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  this  case,  we  think  that  the  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  on  the  same  day.  Even  under  Petitioner's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach,  he  had  some  weeks  to  make  his  decision.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  why  he  wasn't  prejudiced  by  being  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  some  weeks  to  make  his  decision  is  precisely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  he  was  using  annual  leave,  he  wasn't  suffering

the  consequences  of  a  hostile  work  environment,  he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

hadn't  taken  the  pay  cut,  he  hadn't  had  to  move  400 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

miles  away,  and  so  this  was  an  unusual  case  where  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  been  able  to  take  that  much  time.

practicality's  sake,  that  ­­ that  it  hasn't  made  a  big 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference.  And  that's  why  we  think  it  would  be  useful 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  Court  to  say  this  is  effectively  the  Ricks  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  should  apply  to  both  cases  of  actual  and  cases  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  termination. 

 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions,  we  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

urge  the  Court  to  affirm.

have  to  ask,  what  was  that  actionable  conduct,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  alleged  to  be  discriminatory,  and  when  did  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occur. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  you  just  sort  of  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  two  synonymous.  But  they  don't  have  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

synonymous.  A  matter  might  mean  the  claim,  not  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  discriminatory  conduct  that's  the  predicate 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  claim. 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  Justice  Kagan,  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

the  EEOC  has,  by  equating  the  Federal  sector  provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  private  sector  provision,  has  suggested  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  of  these  provisions  do  focus  on  the  alleged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful  employment  practice.  In  addition  when  the  EEOC 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

promulgated  this  rule  in  its  current  form,  it  explained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  rule,  quote,  continued  the  rule  that  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  under  the  prior  version  which  used  the  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged  discriminatory  event. 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  think  the  inclusion  of  the  word 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"matter"  by  itself  makes  a  difference.  After  all,  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  just  say  matter.  It  says  matter  alleged  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory,  and  we  think  that  has  to  be  read  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  to  clearly  focus  on  what  is  it  that  is  the  target 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  claim. 

 

 

            

And  that  language  is  ­­ it  does  not  become 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous  just  because  it  might  be  challenging  to  apply

it  in  a  particular  fact  pattern.  I  think  this  Court's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

decision  in  Morgan  is  an  excellent  example  of  that  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  said  we  have  a  clear  rule  that  requires  us  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify  what  was  the  alleged  unlawful  employment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  and  when  did  it  occur,  and  that's  the  analysis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  mean,  this  is  an  unusual 

    

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  claim,  and  it's  an  unusual  kind  of  claim  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  predicate  acts  and  then  there  is  also  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resignation  which  clearly  has  to  occur  before  the  suit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  brought.  And  when  there  is  this,  you  know,  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

composite  set  of  things  that  has  to  go  on  before  a  suit, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  seems  to  me  that  it's  at  least  approaching  the  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  possible  ambiguous  ­­ ambiguous  stage  to  say,  yeah, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  matter,  that's  a  practice  that  both  of  those 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

things  have  to  be  part  of  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  I  think  that  that's  difficult 

    

 

 

 

 

to  reconcile  with  how  Morgan  treated  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"practice."  Always  bearing  in  mind,  as  the  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained  in  a  case  like  Graham  County,  for  instance, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  kind  of  ambiguity  that  triggers  resort  to  a  default 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accrual  rule  is  ambiguity  in  the  literal  text  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision.  There  it  was  unclear  whether  a  particular 

   

  

 

 

 

 

limitations  period  even  applied  and  the  Court  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

literal  text  is  ambiguous,  there  are  clues  that  point  in

one  direction,  we  think  this  default  rule  points  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  direction. 

 

            

But  the  Court  hasn't  applied  that  background 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  to  override  language  that's  ­­ that  otherwise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  calls  for  an  analysis  of,  in  this  case,  what  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  that  the  plaintiff  alleged  to  be  discriminatory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here,  Mr.  Green  alleged  a  discrete  act  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

retaliation  that  he  says  occurred  in  December  of  2009. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  alleges  no  repeated  or  cumulative  acts  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination  subsequent  to  that  date  and  so  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  about  that  he  hasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

got  a  claim?  He  can't  even  ­­ you  can't  come  to  court

MS.  CARROLL:  Well,  we  does  not  have  a  ripe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

claim  for  constructive  discharge.  He  would  have  a  ripe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

claim  for  discrimination  or  retaliation  to  challenge  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying  predicate  acts,  and  in  this  position  ­­

event  that  they  are  almost  contemporaneous?

followed  the  question,  but  let  me  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  When,  under  your  view, 

  

 

 

 

 

when  is  there  a  constructive  discharge  that  itself  leads 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  triggering  the  statute  of  limitations? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  I  think  in  a  constructive 

    

   

 

 

discharge  case  ­­ and  to  be  clear,  that  label  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  to  a  range  of  different  fact  patterns  ­­ it  will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

often  be  the  case  that  the  predicate  conduct  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precipitates  the  resignation  is  itself  alleged  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory.  Take  the  facts  of  Suders,  for  instance, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there  was  an  ongoing  pattern  of  harassing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behavior.  Individual  acts  contributing  to  that  hostile 

  

 

 

 

 

 

work  environment  had  occurred  leading  up  to  and  indeed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  I  believe  the  very  day  of  the  resignation.  There,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  is,  as  Your  Honor  suggests,  not  going  to  matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  all  which  rule  the  Court  were  to  adopt  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  They're  almost 

  

 

 

contemporaneous. 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  They  would  be  contemporaneous. 

  

 

 

 

 

But  in  a  case  like  this,  it's  much  clearer  to  see  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceptual  distinction  between  Mr.  Green's  own 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  independent  decision  to  resign  and  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer's  predicate  discriminatory  conduct.  And  in 

  

 

 

 

 

Suders,  the  Court  made  very  clear  that  those  were  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinct  components  of  a  constructive­discharge  claim.

And  I  think,  you  know,  the  Petitioner  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  position  asks  the  Court  to  extend  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  fiction  that  equates  constructive  discharge. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  the  matter  complained 

  

 

 

 

 

of  here  is  a  constructive  discharge.  In  a  tort  suit  or 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

many  the  matter  complained  of  is  negligent  behavior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leading  to  an  injury.  I  take  it  in  the  tort  suit  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  of  limitations  doesn't  begin  to  run  until  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  harm. 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  I  think  that's  generally  true 

    

 

 

 

 

of  tort  suits  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  If  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

generally  true  in  a  tort  suit,  and  my  guess  is  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  suit  for  breach  of  contract,  if  the  contracting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  sent  the  ships  out  and  you  knew  that  it  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  delivered,  it's  not  actionable  until  it  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delivered  and  I  guess  there  are  ways  around  that,  but  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  generally  in  the  law  where  the  matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complained  of  is  a  certain  kind  of  incident  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world,  negligence  leading  to  harm,  action  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory,  et  cetera,  nature  that  leads  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge,  normally  the  statute  of  limitations  begins  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

run  when  the  harm  occurs. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  why  should  it  be  any  different  here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  In  this  case,  the

discrimination,  the  retaliation  I  should  say,  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

challenged  was  the  forcing  ­­ forcing  of  Mr.  Green  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  settlement  agreement  in  December.  He  alleges  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  retaliatory  and  he  was  harmed  by  that  at  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time,  and  he  could  have  promptly  initiated  counseling  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  complaint. 

 

            

Now,  it  is  true  that,  as  a  consequence  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  discriminatory  retaliatory  conduct,  the  stakes  got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

higher  for  him  at  a  later  point  when  he  decided  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Of  course,  he  could  have, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

but  we're  talking  about  only  the  constructive  discharge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part.  I  mean,  sometimes  defendants  do  seven  bad  things 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  once,  or  at  least  allegedly  bad. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  That's  correct,  but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  we're  only  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

about  one  of  them,  the  one  that  we're  talking  about  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  constructive­discharge  claim. 

 

 

            

So  I  go  back  to  my  question  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

negligence,  because  that  was  the  first  course  I  took  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  school  so  I  remember  that,  but  the  ­­ the  fact  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  should  we  treat  this  any  differently? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  So,  in  general,  we  don't  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  analyzed  any  differently  than  any  other  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  claim,  which  is  that  we  have  to  identify  what  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged  unlawful  practice  and  when  did  it  occur.  Why  is

that?  Because  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Because  you  have  to,  as  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  in  the  a  tort  case  it's  not  just  that  the  person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behaved  negligently,  but  that  negligence  had  to  result 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  harm. 

   

            

            

MS.  CARROLL:  And  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  I'm  just  ­­ that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  simpleminded  analogy  I'm  drawing  and  I  wonder  why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  doesn't  work. 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  I  think  it  does  work  because 

    

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case  there  was  retaliation  alleged  in  December 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  harmed  Mr.  Green  at  that  time.  He  later  suffered  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  painful  consequence,  which  under  Ricks  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trigger  a  new  construct  ­­ a  new  statute  of  limitations. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But  I  want  to  go  back  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Suppose  there  was  evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

that  the  employer  had  a  continuing  intent  to  force 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Green's  resignation.  So  you've  got  emails  that  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Green  is  causing  trouble  for  us  by  charging  us  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination,  we're  going  to  do  A,  B,  C,  D  and  E  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force  him  to  retire.  And  then  on  the  day  when  he  quits 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  another  email  that  says,  Hallelujah,  we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

achieved  our  objective,  he's  retired. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Now  when  would  it  run  in  that  situation?

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Wouldn't  it  run  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

date  of  discharge  because  there  would  be  an  intent  at  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  of  that  date? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  But  if  I'm  understanding  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  correctly,  that  sounds  to  me  like  a  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  analyzed  under  the  Court's  decision  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Morgan,  where  you  have  an  environment  of  hostility  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  composed  of  many  individual  acts,  some  of  which  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  independently  actionable  in  and  of  themselves, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

joined  with  a  discriminatory  ­­

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Let  me  clarify  it.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

nothing  more  is  done.  There  are  all  these  acts  up  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  point,  and  then  45  days,  50  days  pass  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  resigns,  but  the  employer  has  all  along  had  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intention  of  forcing  the  resignation.  So  on  the  date  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  resignation  the  employer  intends  to  cause  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  for  discriminatory  reason. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  I  still  think  Morgan  answers 

    

 

 

 

 

that  question  because  Morgan  says  there  has  to  be  an  act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contributing  to  the  hostile  work  environment  that  occurs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  40  ­­ within  the  charging  period.  And  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  exact  same  analysis  whether  on  the  46th  day  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  decides  that's  it,  I  quit,  or  if  he  simply 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides  that's  it,  I'm  finally  going  to  speak  up  about

on.  It  has  nothing  to  do  with  constructive  discharge. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  the  ­­ now,  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

getting  this  more  clearly  because  your  response  to  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  which  is  now  relevant  to  this  too,  is,  look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plaintiff  was  hurt  on  the  very  day  that  last  act  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performed,  indeed  he  suffered  because  he  saw  the  act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  performed,  and  that  was  one  of  the  things  that  led 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  later  to  quit. 

 

 

 

            

So  let's  count  that  as  the  injury.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  count  the  whole  thing  complete  as  of  that  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  basically  the  argument  for  your  side,  I  think. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

And  now  the  argument  against  you  is  that's 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  a  nightmare.  Because  there  will  be  in  fact 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  whole  range  of  acts,  a  whole  series  in  many  cases  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  then,  in  order  to  run  the  statute  of  limitations, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  get  into  the  question  of  which  of  those  acts  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  there  were  some  he  didn't  know  about  ­­ which  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  acts  actually  did  produce  harm  and  which  did  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  he  just  really  won't  know  when  to  bring  his  lawsuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  compared  with  the  comparatively  simple  thing:  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

quits. 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  Right,  I  understand  that 

   

  

 

 

contention,  but  I  think  that  the  so­called  difficulty  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  different  than  the  difficulty,  so­called,  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arise  in  a  hostile  work  environment  case  where  there  was

no  resignation.  You  would  still  have  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes,  that's  true. 

  

 

 

 

MS.  CARROLL:  ­­ figure  out  what  ­­ were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  acts  within  the  45­day  period  that  contributed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  environment.  Maybe  that's  going  to  be  difficult  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  facts,  but  that's  a  result  of  this  Court's  decision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Morgan,  again,  nothing  to  do  with  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge. 

            

            

Now,  with  respect  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  There's  something  more  than 

  

 

 

 

 

just  simplicity,  which  is,  you  know,  suppose  you  had  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  where  somebody  is  first  demoted  and  then  somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  fired.  You  would  never  say,  oh,  he  was  demoted.  He 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffered  the  injury  then,  it  just  raised  the  stakes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  would  say,  no,  there's  two  independent  things  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  he  can  bring  a  termination  claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  CARROLL:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  the  power  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

constructive­discharge  claim  is  to  say  the  exact  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  really  has  happened  here,  that  once  you  lose  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

job,  it's  more  than  the  stakes  have  been  raised.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  is  a  separate  injury  that  then  becomes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

legally  actionable. 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  Well,  the  analysis  when  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  demotion  followed  by  a  termination  is  not  simply

that  there's  been  a  second  separate  injury,  but  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  been  a  second  separate  violation  of  Title  VII  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employer.  That's  why  it  is  a  discrete  unlawful 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

employment  action  triggering  a  fresh  limitations  period. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

 

In  constructive  discharge,  you  know,  the 

 

 

 

 

analysis  that  the  second  separate  event,  the  employee's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  to  resign  is  itself  the  actionable  thing,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  analysis  that  the  court  of  appeals  had  applied  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Suders.  In  Suders  the  question  was:  Do  we  treat 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharge  as  a  tangible  employment  action 

   

 

 

 

 

for  purposes  of  determining  vicarious  liability.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Third  Circuit  said,  well,  yes,  we  treat  these  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equivalents  for  all  intents  and  purposes,  so  naturally, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  there's  a  constructive  discharge,  that  means 

   

 

 

 

 

there's  been  a  tangible  employment  action. 

   

 

 

 

            

This  Court  rejected  that  analysis  and  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no,  the  legal  fiction  does  not  extend  that  far.  To  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure,  the  Court  says,  we  treat  those  two  the  same  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedial  purposes  in  the  sense  that  an  employee  who  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  constructively  discharged  can  recover  for  that  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  degree  and  for  the  same  extent  as  if  he  or  she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  been  actually  discharged. 

 

 

 

            

That  makes  sense  because  you  have  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background  duty  to  mitigate  and,  in  the  circumstance  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  constructive  discharge,  we  don't  think  the  employee

should  be  tagged  with  the  consequences  of  having,  you

that's  ­­ that's  the  purpose  of  the  legal  fiction  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  if  we're  going  to  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  these  are  different  and  for  some  purposes  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  look  to  the  fiction  and  for  other  purposes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  not  going  to  look  to  the  fiction,  it  seems  to  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  though  here  it  makes  sense  to  take  account  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fiction  in  the  sense  that  the  person  cannot  bring  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  until  the  resignation  has  happened. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  that's  the  kind  of  paradigmatic  case  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which,  boy,  there  is  something  really  powerful  pushing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  yes,  you  can  ­­ you  should  recognize  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharge  as  a  discharge  in  this  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  But  the  limitations  period 

  

 

 

 

 

here  does  not  run  from  the  accrual  of  the  claim,  it  runs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  time  of  the  matter  alleged  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory,  the  unlawful  employment  action.  And  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  explained  in  Suders,  the  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  entails  both  predicate  discrimination  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  do  think  it  has  to  be  independently  actionable.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  Court  recognized  that  when  it  said  in  Suders 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  for  Ms.  Suders  to  prove  her  hostile  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environment  claim  was  quoting  necessary  predicate  to  her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharge  claim,  and  that's  also  the

uniform  holding  in  the  courts  of  appeals.  There  has  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  predicate,  unlawful  conduct  by  the  employer  and  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequent  decision  by  the  employee  to  resign. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  you  have  a  provision  that  singles  out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  start  of  the  limitations  period  one  of  those  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

components,  then  the  fact  that  the  claim  hasn't  accrued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet  is  not  something  that  the  Court  can  rely  on  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

override  that  clear  language.  I  think  this  Court's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

decision  in  Pillsbury  is  a  really  excellent  example  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  where  under  the  Longshoremen's  Act,  there  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  that  ran  from  the  time  of  injury.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  pointed  out,  well,  that  we  can't  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recover  compensation  for  our  injury  until  a  disability 

   

 

 

 

 

 

has  manifested,  so  we  should  say  that  we  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret  injury  to  mean  disability.  And  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  well,  no.  I  mean,  it's  true  that  that  will  run 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  limitation  period  before  the  claim  can  accrue,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  language  says  what  it  says. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  what  it's  worth  here,  I  don't  think  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  reading  is  actually  going  to  cut  off  claims  except 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  cases  of,  you  know,  real  lack  of  diligence,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  it's  not  the  case  that  there's  no  claim  available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  the  initial  act  of  discrimination  by  the  employer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  claim  available,  the  employee  can  initiate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

counseling  on  that,  and  as  a  matter  of  the  conciliation

bring  about  the  best  chance  of  a  prompt  and  informal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconciliation. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  The  language  we're  focusing 

  

 

 

 

 

on  here  is  the  language  of  a  regulation.  What  statutory 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  does  that  regulation  implement? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  The  cause  of  action  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  employees  in  2000e­16(c),  if  I  have  that  right, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  that,  it  extends  a  cause  of  action  to  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  who  have  been  aggrieved  by  the  final  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  an  agency  that  has  been  produced  through  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  process  that  is  all  a  design  of  ­­ of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EEOC  regulations. 

 

            

So  there,  the  ­­ unlike  in  the  private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sector  provision,  the  charging  period  here  is  purely  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creature  of  the  regulation.  The  time  limit  that  exists 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  statute  on  the  Federal  sector  side  is  only  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  limit  for  bringing  the  lawsuit  once  you  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggrieved  by  the  final  agency  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  say  this  isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  a  problem  much.  I  think  it's  going  to  be  a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  a  lot  of  times.  People  are  in  jobs  and  they're,

environment  or  discrimination,  but  quitting  your  job  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  very  big  deal.  I  think  you  have  to  plan  out  when

that's  going  to  be,  and  just  because  you  can't  take  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anymore  doesn't  mean  that  you  could  quit  work  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away. 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  But  this  rule  doesn't  require 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  to  quit  in  order  to  be  able  to  raise  and  seek 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolution. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Oh,  sure,  it  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

require  you  to  quit,  it  just  requires  you  to  tell  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boss,  you  know,  I  can't  take  this  anymore.  And  now  I've 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  to  conciliate  with  you,  but,  you  know,  it  creates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complications  in  the  workforce  if  you  raise  that  type  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue. 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  It  can.  I  mean,  to  be  clear, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  EEOC  regulations  require  that  this  must  be  all  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anonymously  until  the  complaining  employee  says 

 

 

 

 

 

actually,  please  go  ahead  and  tell  my  employer  so  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  can  try  to  pursue  alternative  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  suspect  most 

    

 

 

 

employers  could  figure  out  who  is  complaining  in  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

types  of  situations. 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  Well,  be  that  as  it  may,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  policy  underlying  this  provision  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  that  the  purpose  of  all  of  this  is  to  try  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent  discrimination  and  to  correct  it  as  soon  as  it

provision,  and  the  Court  recognized  in  Morgan  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  short  provision  exists  because  of  the  recognition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  want  these  sorts  of  alleged  discriminatory, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retaliatory  circumstances  to  be  addressed  right  away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  are  safeguards  built  in.  This  provision,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

probably  unique  among  statutes  of  limitations  that  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  of,  actually  mandates  that  it  be  extended  if,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  the  employee  didn't  know  about  the  time  limit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  didn't  know  ­­ didn't  have  a  reasonable  basis  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspect  discrimination.

position  on  the  government's  stance?

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Factual  question. 

  

 

 

 

MS.  CARROLL:  We  haven't  taken  a  position  on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  because  the  court  of  appeals  didn't  ­­ didn't  find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  necessary  to  do  so.  You  know,  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  think  it's  an 

    

 

 

 

 

example  of  the  difficulty  of  trying  to  figure  out  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  discrimination  occurred  if  you  have  this  last­act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  thing. 

 

 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  Well,  to  the  contrary,  I  think

difficult  to  agree  on  when  that  resignation  occurred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  I  ­­ as  I  said  earlier,  I  think  in  our  ­­

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  rule  that  the  court  of  appeals  adopted  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  we  think  it  asks  the  Court  or  the  agency  to  engage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  precisely  the  same  inquiry  that  it  would  have  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  ­­ even  if  there  had  not  been  a  constructive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge.  It's  still,  in  every  case,  about  identifying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  the  alleged  violation  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  do  you  do  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Suders  that  seemed  to  distinguish  two  things;  one  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  hostile  environment,  and  the  second  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharge.  And  the  Court  said  that  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  hostile  environment  is  a  lesser  included 

   

 

 

 

 

 

component  of  the  more  serious  constructive­discharge 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

MS.  CARROLL:  May  I  respond? 

   

  

 

              

I  think  Suders  recognized  that  Ms.  Suders 

 

 

 

 

 

had  to  prove  up  both  pieces.  She  had  to  prove  unlawful 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  by  the  employer,  namely,  a  severe  and  pervasive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  in  the  terms  and  conditions  of  her  employment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amounting  to  a  hostile  work  environment,  and  she  had  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meet  the  constructive  discharge  standard.  And  if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  intent  in  saying  so  had  been  to  equate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constructive  discharge  with  actual  discharge  for  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intents  and  purposes,  then  I  don't  see  how  the  Court

could  have  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  affirmative

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Wolfman,  four  minutes. 

 

 

 

           

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  BRIAN  WOLFMAN 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Your  Honor,  if  I  might,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

would  like  to  begin  where  we  ended.  Suders  considered 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  recognized  a  claim  for  constructive  discharge, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  would  call  in  the  old  days  a  cause  of  action. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At  pages  142  and  143,  the  Court  said  it  was  considering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  a  claim  for  constructive  discharge  lies  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Title  VII. 

 

            

And  then  it  ­­ it  holds,  we  agree  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower  courts  and  the  EEOC  that  Title  VII  encompasses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  liability  for  constructive  discharge.  Not 

  

 

 

 

 

simply  damage  enhancing,  but  liability  for  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge. 

              

I  do  want  to  turn  to,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  question  about  the  government's  position  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

date  of  resignation.  It  is  not  entirely  correct  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Tenth  Circuit  did  not  address  this.  At  Petition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix  2A,  here's  what  the  Tenth  Circuit  said:  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shortly  after  being  put  on  leave  he  signed  a  settlement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  under  which  he  would  choose  either  to  retire

or  to  work  in  a  position  that  paid  much  less  and  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  300  miles  away.  That  was  the  premise  on  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  That's  true, 

  

  

 

 

 

and  that's  why  I  thought  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ that  was  an  open 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question.  But  the  government,  Mr.  Gannon  says  that  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  the  district  court  said  that  you  chose  to  retire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ in  December,  and  you  didn't  appeal  that  finding  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court. 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  That  is  not  correct.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

district  court  was  of  two  minds  on  the  question.  At  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  it  ­­ it  indicated  that  his  ­­ his  agreement  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resignation.  At  another  point  ­­ and  this  is  in  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reply  brief  ­­ the  district  court  said  the  exact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite.  It  said  what  the  Tenth  Circuit  said.  And  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  opinion,  its  legal  ruling  is  not  premised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  that  ­­ what  the  government  is  saying  is  a  finding. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  let  me  also  say  that  the  EEO  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case,  that  is  the  Postal  Service  itself  said  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  at  the  Joint  Appendix  23  ­­ a  fair  reading  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  agreement  reveals  that  he  was  given  the  choice  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retire  or  to  report  to  a  new  job,  and  was  allowed  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  his  career.

Unless  the  Court  has  anything  further. 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  is  your  response  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

her  ­­ I  think  she's  saying  in  most  of  these  cases  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  hostile  work  environment.  Where  there  is  a  hostile 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

work  environment  you  have  45  days  from  the  last  act,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  what  we  should  do  is  look  at  this  injury  as  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  more  injury  caused  by  a  hostile  work  environment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  just  as  you  don't  look  at  the  date  of  injury  there, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  look  to  the  environment,  et  cetera,  we  so  do  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  thing  here.  It's  simpler,  et  cetera. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WOLFMAN:  Right.  There  are  two  answers 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to  that,  Justice  Breyer.  First  of  all,  I  do  want  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  the  premise  of  the  seven  illustrative  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited  in  Suders,  illustrative  for  constructive 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge.  Three  of  them  were  standalone  constructive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

discharges,  untethered  to  any  other  claim;  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  1. 

 

            

Number  2,  even  if  you  have  what  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Suders  called  a  subset  of  constructive  discharge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  that  is  one  arising  out  of  a  hostile  work 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environment,  they  are  still  distinct  claims.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

really  the  point  of  Suders.  They're  distinct  claims, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  separately  actionable,  and  we  know  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separately  actionable  because  the  constructive­discharge 

 

 

 

 

claim  is  not  actionable  until  resignation.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Carroll,  this  Court  appointed  you  to

responsibility,  for  which  the  Court  is  grateful. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The  case  is  submitted.

case  in  the
 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
