CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  15­338,  Sheriff  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gillie. 

         

Mr.  Murphy. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ERIC  E.  MURPHY 

 

 

 

 

 

            

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

         

Given  resource  constraints,  Ohio  law  has 

 

 

 

 

 

always  authorized  its  attorney  general  to  appoint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  counsel  to  undertake  the  attorney  general's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty  of  representing  the  State  in  the  courts.  While 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  attorney  general  may  appoint  general  deputies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today,  special  counsel  remain  integral  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office.  For  example,  the  office  has  only  15 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistant  attorneys  general  dedicated  to  collecting 

 

 

 

 

 

the  billions  of  dollars  of  State  debts  scattered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across  all  88  Ohio  counties.  The  office  necessarily 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  rely  on  special  counsel  to  be  the  frontline 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers  to  collect  these  debts,  yet  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  in  this  case  held  both  that  special  counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  attorney  general  officers  and  may  not  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  general  letterhead  without  risking

liability  under  the  Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act. 

         

         

That  was  mistaken  for  two  basic  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First,  special  counsel  are  State  officers 

 

 

 

 

 

under  that  Act.  And  so  they  fall  within  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  exemption  designed  to  protect  government 

 

 

 

 

 

operations. 

         

And,  second,  special  counsel's  use  of 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  general  letterhead  accurately  conveyed 

 

 

 

 

their  relationship  to  the  office  and  furthered  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  of  the  Act  by  putting  the  credibility  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  office  on  the  line  and  giving  it  a  powerful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive  to  monitor  special  counsel  when  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect  these  debts. 

 

 

         

So  I  would  like  to  begin  first  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  question  presented,  the  officer  question.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  briefs  have  gone  back  and  forth  on  what  officer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  mean  historically  and  on  what  it  should  mean  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Act.  I  think  ­­ I  think  what  it  should  mean  for 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Act  is  ­­ is  that  the  broadest  conceivable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  should  apply,  precisely  because  this 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  is  designed  to  protect  government 

 

 

 

 

 

operations. 

         

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  May  I  ask  you  about 

   

  

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  general  structure  of  the  Act  seems  to  be

in­house  collectors  are  okay,  but  outside 

 

 

 

 

 

collectors,  whether  for  private  or  for  government, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fall  under  the  Act. 

 

 

 

         

But  do  I  understand  your  view  correctly 

   

 

 

 

 

that  that  line  doesn't  exist  for  the  State;  that  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  an  in­house  or  an  out­house  collector, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  equally  exempt? 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  I  agree  that  ­­ I  ­­ yes,  you 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

understand  our  position  correctly.  I  do  not  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  in­house/out­house  ­­ outside  dichotomy 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  sense  for  purposes  of  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption. 

         

And  here's  why:  The  prototypical  ­­ in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative  history,  the  sheriffs  and  marshals,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prototypical  exempt  debt  collectors  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  and  they  are  always  outside  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  creditors  who  are  the  judgment  creditors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  there  are  a  core  group  of  outside  collectors  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  in  ­­ outside  of  the  creditor,  that  is  ­­ who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  prototypical  examples  ­­

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  why  wouldn't  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

have  expressed  that  more  clearly?  I  mean,  that's  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

big  thing  that  you're  saying,  that  the  State  debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collectors  really  ought  to  be  treated  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently,  the  outside  debt  collectors  from  the

private. 

         

And,  on  the  face  of  the  statute,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  and  the  State  really  are  treated  in  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  way.  There  are  two  provisions.  They  read 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

identically  to  each  other.  And  surely  there  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  clear  ways  of  taking  out  the  State  outside  debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collectors.  You  could  have  just  said  State  debts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't  debts  for  purposes  of  this  statute  or  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  debt  collectors  aren't  debt  collectors  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  of  this  statute,  and  yet  Congress  did  none 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  things.  Rather,  Congress  adopted  a  set  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  that  seem  perfectly  parallel  with  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  State  and  corporate  entities. 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  So  I  disagree  that  they're 

   

  

 

 

 

perfectly  parallel  in  these  ways. 

 

 

 

 

         

First,  I  think  "officer"  means  something 

   

 

 

 

different  in  the  government  context  than  it  does  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  private  context.  In  the  private  context,  as  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite  Black's  Law  Dictionary,  the  prototypical 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  is  the  president,  the  CEO,  or  the  treasurer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high­level  managers. 

 

         

But  not  ­­ that's  not  true  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government.  The  prototypical  Officer  can  be 

  

 

 

 

 

ministerial  officers,  like  police  officers  ­­

argument  that  you  can  read  the  same  term  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  ways,  but  Congress  did  use  the  exact  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms. 

         

 

MR.  MURPHY:  But  it  ­­ but  one  is  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  context  and  one  is  in  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context.  So  I  think,  by  definition,  they  have  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  different  meanings. 

 

 

         

And,  number  two,  the  inside/outside,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

can  see  that  with  the  creditor,  because  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor  collects,  the  creditor  has  to  collect  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  own  name.  If  you  look  at  the  creditor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption,  (6)(A)  ­­ a(6)(A),  it  says  they're  exempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  collect  in  their  own  name. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

And,  in  fact,  when  they  don't  collect  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  own  name,  in­house  creditors  become  debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collectors,  showing  how  the  in­house/outside  was 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  work  for  creditors  because,  when  you  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  ­­ Congress  has  made  the  choice  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors,  when  you  put  your  name  on  the  line,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor  will  likely  have  a  repeat  relationship  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  relevant  debtor.  And  so  goodwill  was  enough  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exempt  all  inside  creditors.  You  don't  see  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

dichotomy  ­­

officer  nevertheless  or  an  employee  of  someone?  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  do  it  for  tax  purposes,  but  we  then  look  at  a

It's  hard  for  you  to  argue  these  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees;  correct? 

 

         

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Yes.  We  don't  ­­

MR.  MURPHY:  Well,  not  totally  without 

  

 

 

 

 

supervision.  I  think  that  they're  supervised  by  our 

    

 

 

 

 

 

standards,  and  they  have  to  ­­ that's  a  ­­

MR.  MURPHY:  We're  not  claiming  they're 

  

 

 

 

 

employees. 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what  other  situation 

  

 

 

 

 

have  we  ever,  in  any  setting,  treated  someone  whom 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  called  an  independent  contractor,  an  officer  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company,  government  agency,  anything?  This  is  a

say  this  is  an  independent  contractor,  and  now,  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  we're  going  to  deem  them  an  officer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  I  just  think  independent

employee  distinction  asks  a  separate  question  than 

   

 

 

 

 

the  officer  ­­

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  the  problem  I 

  

 

 

 

 

have  is,  I  certainly  understand  officers  ­­ like, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  corporations.  With  corporations,  officers  are 

  

 

 

 

 

defined  by  their  charter  of  incorporation.  These 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  officers;  these  are  their  responsibilities. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  may  set  an  income  scale  of  some  sort  or  tell  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  agency  within  the  corporation  is  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  that.  And  you  have  officers  of  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

agencies  that  are  defined  by  law.  But  I  don't  know 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I've  ever  seen  an  officer  defined  by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract. 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Well,  so  two  points:  I  think 

    

  

 

 

 

 

the  closest  analogy  would  be  ­­ be  a  common  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogy  that  court  referenced  in  Filarsky,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  the  special  deputy  sheriffs.  Filarsky  cited 

  

 

 

 

 

 

treatises  treating  special  deputy  sheriffs  ­­ those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  sheriffs  appointed  to  undertake  the  sheriff's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duty  for  a  particular  task  ­­ as  officers  within  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  of  resisting  of  officer  statutes.

Filarsky  relied  on  that  history  in 

 

 

 

 

 

determining  why  the  contractors  in  that  case  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  entitled  to  a  qualified  immunity.  So  I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that's  the  prototypical  example. 

 

 

 

         

And  we're  not  ­­ we're  not  arguing  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  contract.  So  the  second  point  would  be,  if  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  ­­ if  all  we  had  was  the  contract,  we  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  here  today. 

 

 

         

For  instance,  we  have  collections 

 

 

 

 

associations  ­­ they're  called  third­party 

 

 

 

 

vendors  ­­ that  we  only  contract  with.  There  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  We  do  not  assert  that  they  are  officers  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  covered  by  this  exemption.  They  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contract  with  us  to  help  us  with  our  collection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activities. 

         

But  special  counsel  are  different.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

is  a  statute,  R.C.  109.08,  that  clearly  indicates 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  just  as,  historically,  sheriffs  delegated  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  deputies,  the  attorney  general  can  delegate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  sovereign  duties  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  thought  that 

    

   

 

 

that  was  just  for  tax  collection.  This  is  not  a  tax 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection  case,  is  it?  I  know  the  attorney  general 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  read  it  as  giving  him  more  power  than  what  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  on  its  face,  but  putting  that  aside,  this  is

not  a  tax  collection.  This  is  a  student  debt 

   

   

  

 

 

 

collection,  a  consumer  debt;  correct? 

   

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  That's  ­­ that's  confusing  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

points,  Your  Honor.  The  statute  ­­ I  disagree  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  reading  of  the  statute  that  suggests  we  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  the  letterhead  elsewhere,  but  that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letterhead  question.  That's  Question  2. 

  

 

 

 

         

On  the  first  question,  whether  he  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appoint  special  counsel  to  undertake  his  task  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representing  the  state  when  collecting  these  debts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  distinction  between  tax  debts  and  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

types  of  debts.  He's  ­­ he's  ­­ they  ­­ he  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appoint  these  individuals  to  collect  any  type  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt  that  is  certified  to  him. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

And  it's  the  appointment  that  I  think  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

key  to  make  these  individuals  special  counsel  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Murphy,  can  I  ask,

MR.  MURPHY:  As  ­­ as  Hobby  Lobby 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suggested,  I  think  the  starting  point  when  something 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  undefined  is  the  Dictionary  Act.  So  I  start 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there,  and  then  ­­ and  then  I  ­­ I  ­­ and  then  you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  ­­ in  ­­ for  determining  what  those  words  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Dictionary  Act,  I  look  to  history. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ­­ can  I  ask  you, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

then,  a  question  about  the  Dictionary  Act? 

   

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Uh­huh. 

  

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Which  says  an  officer 

  

 

 

 

 

"includes  any  person  authorized  by  law  to  perform 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  duties  of  the  office."  And  my  question  to  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ is  just  which  ­­ what  is  the  office  there? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  I  would  ­­ I  would  call  it  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

office  of  special  counsel. 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  office  of  special 

  

 

 

 

 

counsel. 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  So  just  like  ­­ there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

office  of  ­­ literally  no  office  of  special  counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

listed  in  Ohio  law,  but  there's  also  no  office  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solicitor  general.  If  you  look  at  the  Solicitor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  Statute  for  the  United  States,  there's  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office  ­­

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  we  know  that  office

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  ­­ but  ­­ okay.  So  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  what  does  a  statute  have  to  do,  then,  to  ­­ to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorize  the  person  to  perform  the  duties  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office? 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Usually  what  the  statutes  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

or  what  precisely  R.C.  109.08  does,  it  says  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

superior  can  appoint  ­­ appoint  an  inferior  officer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  engage  in  certain  duties.  Like  the  SG  statute  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

help  the  ­­ assist  the  attorney  general  engage  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  duties,  that's  exactly  what  this  statute  says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

R.C.  109.08  says  the  attorney  general  may  appoint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  counsel  to  assist  in  the  ­­ or  to  represent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  in  the  collections  of  these  debts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

So  they  say  it  doesn't  even  list  the  duty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  it  lists  the  precise  duty  that  special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  are  to  undertake. 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  the  question  is 

    

 

 

 

 

whether  it  needs  to  more  authorize  an  office.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know?  A  continuing,  permanent  thing  as  opposed  to, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  these  officeholders  who  come  and  go,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  there  are  more  of  them,  and  sometimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  fewer  of  them,  and  sometimes  they  deal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  X  many  cases,  and  sometimes  they  deal  with  Y 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  cases,  and  it  all  seems  very  fluctuating.

MR.  MURPHY:  I  don't  think  that  matters 

    

 

 

 

 

because,  I  think,  historically,  there  were  plenty  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

offices  that  had  indefinite  numbers.  Today,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instance,  assistant  U.S.  attorneys  have  indefinite 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers,  and  they  get  their  duties  from  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

superiors,  I  think,  obviously  in  the  same  way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

         

And  I  still  think  that  the  special  deputy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sheriffs  are  the  best  historical  example.  And  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sheriffs  were  considered  to  be  officers  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  of  resisting  of  officer  statutes  precisely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  were  trying  to  protect  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functions.  And  I  think  that  purpose  analogy  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

pretty  relevant  here  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

         

The  point  of  this  exemption  is  to  protect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  operations,  and  the  attorney  general  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  relying  on  special  counsel  to  collect  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debts  since  the  time  of  the  Great  Depression. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Special  counsel  have  always  been  in  the  attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general's  Office,  but  debt­collecting  duty  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what  does  your 

  

 

 

 

 

contract  require  them  to  comply  with  the  Act? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Because  we're  also  the 

  

 

 

 

 

consumer  protection  branch  office,  and  we  want  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  complying  with  the  substantive  standards  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Act.

For  instance,  everybody  agrees  that  tax

to  comply  with  the  substantive  standards  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FDCPA  for  tax  debts.  It's  because  we  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  are  appropriate  standards. 

 

 

 

         

What  we  are  concerned  about  are  the

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Are  the  remedies

MR.  MURPHY:  Well,  the  remedies  against

MR.  MURPHY:  No. 

  

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You're  not 

  

 

 

indemnifying.  They  are  contractually  bound  to 

  

 

 

 

 

follow  the  Act.  And  you're,  instead,  trying  to  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  immunity  for  their  acts,  even  though  they  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  breached.  We  can  get  to  that  second  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  moment.  Let's  assume  they  breached  the  Act. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Just  an  assumption.  Don't  go  crazy.

MR.  MURPHY:  Well,  it  would  be  immunity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  FDCPA.  It  wouldn't  be  immunity  from  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws  that  would  apply,  for  instance  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  They're  State  officers. 

  

 

 

 

So  what  other  laws? 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Well,  for  instance, 

  

 

 

 

Section  1983.  I  think  it's  a  double­edged  sword. 

    

   

 

 

 

By  becoming  State  officers,  they  become  subject  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1983.  So  that  would  apply.  Also  State  law.  We 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  give  immunity  even  to  me  for  reckless  conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Is  there  any  case  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  point  me  to  where  they've  been  charged  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  1983  violation  that  you've  indemnified  them? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Well,  we  wouldn't  indemnify 

  

 

 

 

 

them  in  any  circumstances,  but  there  is  one  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  said  they  were  officers  within  the  meaning  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1983.  It  was  in  the  Southern  District  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ohio  ­­ I'm  sorry.  I'm  blanking  on  the  name  now. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  the  Sixth  Circuit  cited  it  in  a  footnote. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  mentioned  two 

  

 

 

 

categories  of  outside  debt  collectors  for  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme.  One  was  this  special  counsel,  for  whom  you

other  category.

How  was  it  determined  which  kind  of  debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector  the  State  is  going  to  use,  the  one  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  subject  to  the  Act  and  the  special  counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  would  not? 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  You  have  to  remember  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

these  are  lawyers.  And  how  the  process  works  is  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JA  124  to  130,  and  let  me  just  explain  it  briefly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

It  starts  in­house.  In­house  employees  of 

  

 

 

 

 

the  office  will  send  letters  for  most  debts  on  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  letterhead  in  an  attempt  to  collect  in­house. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When  that  proves  unsuccessful,  we  go  to  third­party 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vendors,  which  are  essentially  collections 

 

 

 

 

associations  which  were  the  historically  reason  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Act.  They're  not  lawyers;  they're  collections 

  

 

 

 

 

 

associations.  They  send  letters  and  make  phone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

calls.  And  that's  basically  what  they  do. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

         

And  that's  the  second  step.  So  most  debts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  go  through  this  entire  process,  and  so  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  contacted  by  both  these  collections 

 

 

 

 

 

 

associations. 

         

And  then  the  third  step  is  special  counsel, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  reason  why  special  counsel  are  generally  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third  step  is  because  that's  when  litigation  becomes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  distinct  possibility,  so  you  need  lawyers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

And  that's  what  special  counsel  are  here  to

are  involved  in  this  suit  have  done. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

So  that's  generally  how  the  process  works, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  ­­ and  we've  never  ­­ we've  never  contested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  collectors  associations  are  officers  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  meaning  of  the  Act. 

 

 

 

 

         

And  I  think  that  gets  back  to  the  point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  our  position  is  not  ­­ our  position  is  not  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  people  collecting  debts  on  behalf  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  are  exempt.  Our  position  is  officers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are.  And  so  what  does  "officers"  mean? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

         

And  there  I  think  you  should  interpret  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

broadly  because  the  purpose  of  that  is  not  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interfere  with  government  operations.  And  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

this  would  interfere  with  our  operations  in  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  office  has  long  collected  the  billions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars  of  State  debts  that  it  is  required  via 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  to  collect. 

 

 

         

And  getting  back  to  the  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

standards,  I  do  think  Filarsky  has  full  application 

   

 

 

 

 

 

here  for  why  it  decided  qualified  immunity  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  in  the  1983  context.  I  think  the

special  counsel  and  the  attorney  general  staff  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closely  together,  but  then  special  counsel  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ones  left  holding  the  bag  because  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute  that  the  attorney  general  staff  are  exempt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  that  would  pull  in  the  Filarsky  point  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  it  will  deter  the  talented  individuals  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collecting.  Everybody  agrees  that  these  are  vital 

  

 

 

 

 

 

government  operations.  They  are  vital  to  the  fiscal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  of  the  State.  And  that  was  a  factor  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Filarsky  relied  on. 

 

 

         

And  then  I  think  the  third  factor  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Filarsky  relied  on  was  just  the  distracting  nature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  damages  suits  against  the  States.  And  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this,  again,  is  Exhibit  A,  because  imagine  what  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen  if  this  case  goes  to  trial.  It's  not  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  involve  special  counsel.  It  will  involve 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  staff  who  have  to  respond  to  discovery  and  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely  have  to  testify  about  how  the  operations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work. 

         

So  when  they're  so  closely  connected  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  way,  I  do  think  that  it  makes  sense  for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  to  be  interpreted  with  its  purposes  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind.  And  when  you  look  at  the  purposes  and  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  will  happen  if  this  case  proceeds,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  good  indication  that  these  people  are

officers,  and  I  think  they  easily  fall  within  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

historical  definition  of  "officers." 

 

 

 

         

The  special  deputy  sheriffs,  I  think,  is 

   

 

 

 

 

the  most  analogous  example,  and  there's  plenty  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  that  have  treated  them  as  officers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  tell  me  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  definition  is  of  "officer."  Give  me  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition. 

         

         

         

         

MR.  MURPHY:  I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What's  your  definition? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  MURPHY:  Oh,  my  definition. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Your  definition  seems 

  

 

 

 

to  be  tailored  to  this  category.  But  tell  me  how  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  your  general  definition  is. 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  So  the  Dictionary  Act, 

  

 

 

 

 

authorized  by  law  to  perform  the  duties  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office.  And  unlike  collections  associations,  where 

  

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  authorization  for  the  attorney  general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  appoint  collections  associations,  there  is  a  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  specifically  authorizes  us  to  appoint  special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  ­­

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Does  the  law  not 

  

 

 

 

 

authorize  you  to  hire  special  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Well,  just  our  general  ability 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  contract  to  perform  our  services.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  how  is  this 

  

 

 

 

 

different  from  that? 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Because  there  is  a  specific 

   

  

 

 

 

statute  that  express  the  ­­ delegates  the  attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generals'  duty  of  debt  collection  to  special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel.  It's  analogous  to  many  laws  that  suggest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  an  office  position  is  created  is  a  superior 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appointing  an  inferior. 

 

 

         

The  law  in  Hartwell  that  created  ­­ there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  no  office  of  clerk  that  ­­ called  the  clerk  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer,  just  said  assistant  treasurers  can  appoint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  clerk. 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  How  do  you  distinguish 

  

 

 

 

 

Germaine,  Mr.  Murphy?  Because  that  seems  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

similar  kind  of  setup  to  your  own.  There  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  that  allows  a  superior  to  appoint  some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

people,  but  those  ­­ those  contractors  are  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  there  are  more,  sometimes  there  are  fewer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  duties  aren't  precisely  defined,  and  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  says  that's  not  an  officer  notwithstanding  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  So  I  would  distinguish 

   

  

 

 

Germaine  and  several  other  cases  both  legally  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factually.  So  start  legally. 

  

 

 

         

There  is  no  dispute  that  Germaine  was  a

constitutional  case.  It  was  interpreted  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  of  the  Appointments  Clause,  and  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  when  Congress  uses  the  word  "officer,"  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  easily  use  it  in  a  broader  sense  than  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrower  constitutional  meaning. 

 

 

         

The  Court  said  this  in  Steele  when  it  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  prohibition  agents  were  officers  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  of  a  statute  that  only  allowed  officers  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

execute  search  warrants.  And  it  said  this  in  Lamar 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  said  Congress  were  officers.  So  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  repeatedly  said  that  Congress  can  use  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"officer"  in  a  way  ­­

   

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  that's  to  say  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  these  cases,  whether  it's  Germaine  or,  or  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side,  Hartwell,  and  we  put  them  in  a  different  box? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Exactly.  We  always  caveated 

  

  

 

 

 

Hartwell  by  saying  it  was  a  constitutional  officer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

basis.  But,  if  they  are  a  constitutional  officer,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  by  definition  you  should  think  that  they  are  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  Officer. 

 

         

And,  factually,  I  do  think  that  the  surgeon 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  Germaine  was  much  more  like  the  ­­ the  surgeon  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Germaine  was  more  like  the  collection  association 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  the  special  counsel  themselves,  and  let  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  why.

In  Germaine  the  relevant  office  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office  of  pension  commissioners,  and  his  job  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dole  out  pensions  to  appropriate  parties.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  the  official  duty.  And  the  surgeon,  all  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  was  assist  in  helping  with  the  duty. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

But  when  somebody  else  has  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

delegated  that  duty,  like  a  tax  collector  delegates 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  deputy  collector  of  customs,  the  delegation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  duty,  it  makes  all  the  distinction  in  the  world. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

And  Auffmordt  is  on  the  same  basis.  It  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  merchant  appraiser.  And  the  merchant  appraiser 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was  held  not  to  be  an  officer  in  the  customs  office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  weren't  actually  going  out  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collecting  the  relevant  customs;  they  were  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helping  the  collector  of  customs. 

 

 

 

 

         

But  Steele  also  makes  quite  clear  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deputy  collectors  of  customs  would  be  officers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that's  a  situation  where  the  superior 

   

 

 

 

 

officer  is  actually  delegating  his  authority  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inferior  officer  there,  the  deputy.  And  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that's  the  symmetry  that  matters  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  seems  ­­ if  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understood  you  correctly,  that  seems  an  odd  line  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draw.  It's  the  difference  between  delegating  all  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  authority  and  delegating  part  of  your

authority? 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  No.  What  is  the  authority? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

The  authority  of  the  attorney  general's  office  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  authority  of  the  tax  collector  is  to  represent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  in  the  court  and  to  bind  the  State  and  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bind  the  third  party  in  the  court.  Collections 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

associations  cannot  do  that.  Special  counsel 

  

 

 

 

 

absolutely  do  that.  That's  their  main  job. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

         

So  just  as  ­­ for  instance,  assistant  U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys  would  be  consider  officers  because  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  stand  up  in  court,  they  are  representing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  because  the  statute  allows  the  AG  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delegate  those  official  duties  to  the  deputy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Could  you,  Mr.  Murphy, 

  

 

 

 

 

address  the  point,  whether  this  is  misleading? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Sure.  I'll  start  at  a  high 

   

  

  

 

 

 

level  and  then  get  into  the  specifics. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  In  the  course  of  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  says  that  you  cannot  falsely  represent  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

document  to  be  issued  by.  And  if  you  could  address 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  part  of  it. 

 

 

 

         

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Sure.  I  will  start  there. 

    

  

 

 

 

We  think  this  is  issued  by  the  attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general's  office  when  special  counsel  send  a  letter. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

The  official  meaning  of  "issue"  is  to  distribute  in

an  official  capacity.  When  they  send  these  letters, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  distributing  them  in  their  official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity  as  special  counsel  to  the  attorney  general. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  it's  fully  appropriate  for  the  office  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

listed  at  the  top  in  those  circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

           

 

 

I  would  draw,  I  guess,  the  analogy  to 

   

 

 

clerk  ­­ or  courts.  Courts  issue  subpoenas  all  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  through  private  attorneys  nowadays,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clerk  of  the  court  doesn't  actually  sign  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subpoena  anymore,  but  it  has  the  name  of  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  top,  and  a  private  attorney  is  authorized  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  that  subpoena. 

 

 

         

So  I  think  that  analogy  is  ­­ this  case  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  easier  case,  it  seems  to  me,  because  special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  have  a  strong  relationship  to  the  attorney 

   

 

 

 

 

 

general's  office.  But  the  very  fact  that  a  private 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  can  issue  a  contract  subpoena  suggests  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

entities  can  issue  things  through  people  other  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  contract  ­­ or  other  than  employees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  about  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

provision  that  is  allegedly  violated,  the  one  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proscribes  use  of  any  business  or  organization's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

name  other  than  the  true  name  of  the  debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector's  business  or  organization?

logic.  This  strikes  me  as  their  true  name  when  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  special  counsel  to  the  attorney  general.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  general  is  their  true  name.  It's  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  name  because  it  distinguishes  them  when  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting  as  special  counsel  for  the  attorney  general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  when  they're  acting  as  private  counsel  for  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  creditor.

that  necessary? 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  It  was.  As  a  technical 

   

  

  

 

 

matter,  it's  necessary  because  the  money  gets  sent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  them,  so  they  have  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Necessary  for  compliance 

  

 

 

 

with  the  Act? 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Oh.  I  mean,  it  clarifies  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

relationship  even  more.  It  might  be  perhaps  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

closer  question  if  they  hadn't,  but  if  they  had  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  special  counsel,  I  would  say,  as  a  technical 

   

   

 

 

 

 

matter,  it's  necessary  because  how  it  works  is  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  counsel  are  assigned  cases  and  individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send  them  checks,  they  send  them  to  their  address. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  we  kind  of  have  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  about  only  ­­ the

authorized  by  the  attorney  general?  What  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute  says  is  special  counsel  can  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letterhead  stationery  only  in  connection  with  tax 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection.  Doesn't  it?  It  says  ­­ here  it  says, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"The  special  counsels  use  the  letterhead  stationery, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  only  in  connection  with  such  claims  arising  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  taxes." 

 

 

         

This  isn't  a  tax.  So  he  gets  the  letter, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  he  thinks,  maybe  at  least  the  letter  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  letter.  But  it  isn't  an  authorized 

  

 

 

 

 

 

letter  because  the  statute  says  you  can't  authorize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  to  do  it. 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  We  disagree  with  that  view  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute.  We  think  the  statute  says  ­­ the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  statute  says  they  shall  use  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letterhead,  and  the  second  says  "but  only  in." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

We  interpret  that  statute  ­­ not  just  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  general  but  several  other  attorney  generals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  interpreted  this  statute  only  to  require  it  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  tax  contexts  and  to  leave  it  to  the  attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  in  other  context.  And  they  haven't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

challenged  that.  At  JA  114  to  115,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorically  deny  it. 

 

 

         

And  I  think  this  turns  a  virtue  into  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

vice,  by  the  way.  When  they  put  our  letterhead  on

there,  it  shows  to  consumers  that  they  can  actually

rebuttal. 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

         

Mr.  Rosencranz. 

 

       

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  E.  JOSHUA  ROSENCRANZ 

 

 

 

 

 

            

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice,  and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

Your  Honors,  both  questions  presented 

 

 

 

 

really  revolve  around  a  single  point:  Private 

   

  

 

 

 

debt  collectors  retained  as  independent  counsel  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  by  a  State  attorney  general  are  not  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers.  They  are  not  the  attorney  general.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  from  his  office.  And  they  cannot  legally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold  themselves  as  being  from  his  office. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

When  the  consumer  sees  letterhead  that  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Office  of  the  Attorney  General,"  she  thinks  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letter  comes  from  within  that  office,  not  from  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

professional  debt  collector  with  a  personal 

   

 

 

 

financial  stake  in  the  outcome  of  the  ensuing

conversation. 

         

Congress  saw  the  distinction.  And  as  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  questions  from  the  Court  suggested  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg  and  Justice  Kagan,  the  Act  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  built  around  this  fundamental  distinction. 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  in  the  overarching  definition  of  "debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector,"  which  defines  the  Act's  coverage  as  "any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  who  regularly  collects  debts  owed  another." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  then  it's  in  each  of  the  two  provisions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  gotten  a  lot  of  focus  from  General  Murfree's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  this  morning,  the  two  provisions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  carve­outs.  One  says  that  the  Act  does  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cover  any  officer  or  employee  of  a  private  business; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  says  the  Act  doesn't  cover  any  officer  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  of  a  State. 

   

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  If  I  could  clarify, 

   

  

 

 

 

there  may  be  two  separate  questions  that  may  be  part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  your  answer.  But  are  these  officers  under  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  ­­ whether  they  are  under  the  debt  collection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  or  not  is  a  separate  question.  Is  it  right  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  properly  considered  officers  under  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that  is  how  the  attorney  general  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designated  them  and  views  them? 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Absolutely  not,  Your 

  

 

 

 

Honor.  Ohio  law  is  the  same  as  the  law  that's

codified  in  the  Dictionary  Act.  It's  the  same  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  Court  has  adopted  in  Metcalf.  There  has

to  be  duties  that  are  created  by  law,  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That's  not  true 

  

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  qualified  immunity.  There  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  be  a  permanent  ­­ I'm  sorry.  What  was  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  adjective?  Permanent  and  what? 

  

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Permanent  and  continuing 

  

 

 

 

office. 

         

Yes,  Your  Honor,  you  are  exactly  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Filarsky  is  a  qualified  immunity  case.  Filarsky  did 

   

  

 

 

 

 

not  conclude  that  the  person  who  got  qualified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  were  officers.  It  concluded  that  they  got 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualified  immunity  even  though  they  were  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers,  just  like  in  common  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

Common  law  provided  the  posse  comitatus  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  the  posses  who  were  deputized  ­­ qualified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  even  though  they  were  not  officers.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  goes  back  to  whether  we're  talking  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dictionary  Act  definition  or  the  definition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law. 

 

         

Collections  special  counsel  are  simply  not

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  they  authorized 

  

 

 

 

 

I'm  sorry.  Go  ahead. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  think  you  have 

    

 

 

 

recognized  ­­ tell  me  if  I'm  wrong  about  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  special  counsel  could  send  out  a  dunning 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

letter,  and  the  first  sentence  says,  in  boldface, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"We  write  to  you  as  special  counsel  to  the  attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  who  has  authorized  us  to  collect  a  debt  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owe  to  X  government  agency." 

   

 

 

         

That  would  be  perfectly  all  right.  No 

  

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  general  letterhead,  but  that  opening 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  would  be  okay.  "We  have  been  authorized  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  attorney  general  to  collect  a  debt  you  owe  to  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  agency."  No  problem  with  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

         

Honor. 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  That's  correct,  Your 

  

 

 

 

So  just  to  be  clear,  we're  shifting  ground 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  to  point  2  which  is  about  whether  it's  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  the  statute.  And  it  is  a  violation  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  because  ­­ but  I  think  in  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical,  Your  Honor,  the  letterhead  is  the  law

statute  in  this  context  because  they  are  using  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  name  of  the  attorney  general  as  their  own  true 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

name.  And,  in  the  context  that  you  just  described, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  they  are  simply  referring  to  who  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client  is  or  who  it  is  that  has  hired  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  don't  really  see  the 

    

 

 

 

 

difference  between  those  two  situations.  But  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  push  the  point  a  little  bit  further,  suppose  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  created  a  special  seal  for  the  special  debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

collections  program  of  the  State  of  Ohio  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  like  that,  and  they  put  that  at  the  top  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  letterhead. 

 

         

Would  that  be  a  violation  of  the  statute? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Again,  so  now  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

talking  about  the  substantive  provisions.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  happy  to  shift  there.  I  think  it  probably  would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be.  I  would  have  to  know  a  little  bit  more 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  the  seal  says  and  whether  it  conveys 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­

 

         

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It's  the  seal  of  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Ohio,  and  it  says  "The  Program  of  Special  Debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Collection." 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Oh,  Your  Honor,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that  would  be  highly  misleading.  It  would  violate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  provisions  that  we're  talking  about.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  would  it  be  misleading? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

What  would  the  recipient  of  that  letter  think  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  recipient  of  the  letter  would  not  think  if  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipient  received  the  letter  from  the  actual  office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  attorney  general? 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  So  I  think  the  recipient 

   

  

 

 

 

of  the  letter  would  think  the  same  thing  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipient  of  this  letter  thinks.  Let  me  just  turn 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  what  the  recipient  of  this  letter  thinks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

Just  common,  everyday  experience,  when  you 

 

 

 

 

 

receive  a  letter  that  says  at  the  letterhead  "Office 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Attorney  General,"  you  think  that  the  source 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  letter  is  coming  from  someone  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  general's  office. 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I'm  not  sure  what 

  

 

 

 

 

difference  it  makes.  I  mean,  it  seems  to  me  that  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letter  like  this  gives  you  two  kinds  of  information. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One  is  it  says  "You  owe  some  sum  of  money  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State,"  and  that's  perfectly  true.  And  the  other  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  person  signing  the  letter  is  acting  as  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agent  of  the  State,  to  collect  that  sum  of  money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  seems  perfectly  true  too. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

So,  you  know,  the  letterhead  is  just  a  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  saying,  "I'm  acting  as  an  agent  of  the  State  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect  a  sum  of  money  owed  to  the  State.  And,  yes,

if  you  don't  pay  this  sum  of  money,  the  State  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  feel  all  that  good  about  you."  So  it's  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true. 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor,  so  let's  go  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  text  of  the  statute,  and  Congress  was  very  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  that.  The  letters  use  a  name  other  than  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"true  name"  of  the  debt  collectors  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  you  can't  really  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

very  serious  about  that,  because  in  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg's  hypothetical,  they  were  using  the  name  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  attorney  general  too. 

 

 

 

         

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  No,  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  One  uses  name  in  the  text; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  uses  the  name  in  the  letterhead,  but  both  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed  to  do  the  exact  same  thing,  which  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  "I'm  acting  as  agent  of  the  Ohio  Attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  in  order  to  collect  a  sum  of  money  owed  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State." 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor,  they  are  doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

two  different  things.  The  statute  talks  about  using 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  own  true  name,  and  then  what  you  can't  do  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  someone  else's  true  name  as  your  own.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  doesn't  prohibit  referring  to  your  client  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referring  to  the  person  who  hired  you  in  the  text  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  letter.  That's  not  using  someone  else's  name.

That  is  correctly  conveying  information. 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  thought  Justice  Kagan 

    

 

 

 

asked  you  a  functional  question,  and  you  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

responding  with  a  formal  answer.  And  you  may  win  on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

formal  grounds,  but  if  we  could  go  back  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functional  point. 

 

         

Let's  suppose  that  I  received  two  letters. 

   

 

 

 

 

One  is  the  letter,  and  I  owe  a  debt  to  the  State  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ohio.  And  one  is  the  letter  that  was  sent  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case;  the  other  is  a  letter  that's  identical  except 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  is  signed  by  an  assistant  attorney  general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  State  of  Ohio. 

 

 

 

 

         

Why  do  I  have  a  different  reaction  to  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

former  letter  as  opposed  to  the  latter? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Well,  Your  Honor,  my 

  

 

 

 

 

answer  is  the  attorney  general's  answer  on  pages  416 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  17  and  page  334.  The  attorney  general  explains 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  he  and  the  various  debt  collectors  want  to  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  general's  letterhead.  And  they  say  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because,  quote,  they  want  ­­ they  want  to  "get  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtor  to  prefer  the  debt  with  the  State  over  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above  these  other  debts." 

 

 

 

         

The  attorney  general  believes  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

letterhead  communicates  something  that  letterhead  of 

 

 

 

 

 

Wiles,  Boyle  does  not.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  No,  you're  not  answering  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question.  I  wasn't  asking  you  to  compare  the  letter 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  sent  with  a  letter  that  makes  no  reference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Attorney  General  of  Ohio. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

 

 

I'm  asking  you  to  compare  a  letter  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

sent  by  an  assistant  attorney  general,  identical  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  other  respects  to  the  letter  that  was  sent  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  with  the  type  of  letter  that  was  sent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

         

What  ­­ is  there  a  difference  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reaction  of  the  average  consumer,  the  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sophisticated  consumer,  to  those  two  letters? 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  I  would 

    

  

 

 

 

have  a  different  reaction  to  those  two  letters. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

When  I  hear  from  someone  who  is  in  the  attorney 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general's  office,  I  think  I  am  communicating  with 

   

   

 

 

 

someone  who  is  a  public  servant,  who  is  doing  his

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  know,  they  all  the

public  servants.  I  mean,  why  would  you  think  that? 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  know.  I  think  he's  a  public  servant.  Do  I 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  he's  an  officer  or  a  contractor  or  a  ­­ no

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor,  people  react 

  

 

 

 

 

differently  and  I  would  react  differently  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  you  might.  But  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  statute  says,  it  says  the  ­­ here's  what  it  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

literally:  "The  use  ­­ it  is  wrong  to  use  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business,  company  or  organization's  name  other  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  true  name."  Right? 

  

 

 

         

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  if  Filene's  Basement 

  

 

 

 

 

hires  Mr.  Smith,  who  is  an  independent  collector, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Mr.  Smith  writes  a  letter  ­­ just  what  Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg  said.  It  says,  Filene's  Basement  has  asked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  to  write  to  you  to  say  will  you  please  pay  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt.  Okay?  There.  They've  used  a  name  other  than 

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

their  own  name.  The  statute  doesn't  cover  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  it? 

 

         

that's  ­­

 

         

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Of  course  not.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Of  course  not. 

  

 

 

 

Now,  in  other  words,  it  has  to  be  taken  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modified  by  the  first  part  of  this.  There  has  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that's  false,  deceptive,  or  misleading 

 

 

 

 

 

about  it. 

 

         

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  No,  Your  Honor  ­­

that  way,  I  don't  see  what  it  can  mean,  unless  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picks  up  the  ­­ Justice  Ginsburg's  hypothetical. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor,  the  reason  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  "of  course  not"  is  because  referring  to  someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  body  of  the  letter  is  not  the  same  as  using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  ­­ their  ­­

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  isn't?  I  have  just 

    

  

 

 

 

used  their  name. 

 

 

         

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  said  they  hired  me. 

    

 

 

 

 

Isn't  that  using  their  name? 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  It  is  ­­ no.  If  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  statute  ­­

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  In  English.  I'm  not 

  

  

 

 

 

talking  about  in  statutes. 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  No,  Your  Honor.  If  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

what  the  statute  meant,  then  it  would  mean  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  use  the  signatory's  name  either  or  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Of  course.  It  would  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

ridiculous.  And,  therefore,  it  isn't  to  be  taken 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

literally  to  refer  to  any  use.  And  I  guess  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  it  could  be  taken  to  mean  a  misleading  use. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  it  means  a  misleading  use,  I  see  nothing  here 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

misleading.  What  is  it?

and  it  doesn't  mean  ordinary  English  use,  what  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  mean? 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor,  the  ­­ a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

central  premise  of  this  statute,  as  I  said  at  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outset,  is  to  distinguish  in­house  creditors  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  creditors.  Why?  Because  outside  creditors 

  

  

 

 

 

were  the  ones  who  were  guilty  of  the  worst  abuses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Outside  creditors  were  the  ones  who  misled,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  was  trying  to  make  sure  that  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumer  is  talking  to  a  debt  collector,  they  knew 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  they  were  precisely  because  the  reputational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  of  the  attorney  general's  office  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarded  by  people  within  the  attorney  general's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office  in  a  way  that  debt  collectors  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  guard  the  interests  of  the  attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general's  office.  And  an  in­house  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  would

the  heading,  because  now  the  ­­ the  Ohio  Attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  is  responsible  for  all  the  actions  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt  collector  is  going  to  take.  And  the  Ohio 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney  General  is  going  to  be  more  vigilant  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policing  the  actions  of  that  debt  collector.  You

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Well,  Your  Honor,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

may  ­­ in  some  world,  that  may  be  conceivably  true. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  it's  not  necessarily  true.  I  mean,  the  ­­ the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners  have  conceded  that  when  a  debt  collector 

   

 

 

 

 

 

does  this  with  IBM's  letterhead,  it  would  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  precisely  because  ­­

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why?  Why?  Why?  Filene's 

  

  

  

  

 

Basement  hires  a  service,  and  they  say,  here  are  500 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letters,  and  they  all  say  "Filene's  Basement."  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  want  you  to  send  out  on  these  letters  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letterhead  so  they'll  know  it's  us  ­­ you  say  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  say  you're  a  special  representative  hired  by  us 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  pay  the  debt. 

 

 

 

         

Now,  what's  wrong  with  that?  I  would  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  be  ­­ I  mean,  what  worries  me  is  when  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  the  letterhead.  Then  it  it  could  be  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scam.  You  see?  But  when  you  do  have  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

letterhead,  they're  really  getting  themselves  into 

 

 

 

 

 

trouble  if  it's  a  scam.  And  this  isn't  a  scam. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Well,  Justice  Breyer,

letterhead,  you  used  their  name,  because  Section  G 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks  about  the  requirement  that  you  actually  have

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Then  what's  the 

  

  

 

 

 

answer  to  my  question? 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  And  ­­ and  the  answer  is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  made  the  decision.  I  know  ­­ I  know  that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

embedded  in  your  question  is  the  assumption  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  ­­ a  materiality  requirement  built  into 

   

   

 

 

 

 

the  first  provision;  that  is,  the  first  sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  Congress  articulated  a  statute  that  said  it  is  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  to  do  any  of  the  following  things.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  Congress  said  it's  a  violation  to  do  any  of  the

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  don't  think  that  this  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

a  materiality  question.  I  actually  do  think  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  just  a  question  of  is  it  false  or  not.  Is

point  of  clarification.  The  attorney  general's 

  

 

 

 

 

contract  with  these  individuals  says  that  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  an  agent. 

 

 

         

But  the  direct  answer  to  the  question  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  they  obviously  are  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

agent  in  all  the  usual  uses  of  that  term.  They're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting  for  the  Attorney  General  in  collecting  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt.  And  the  question  is,  is  there  anything  false 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  saying,  by  way  of  the  letterhead,  I'm  acting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  attorney  general? 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor,  it's  totally 

  

 

 

 

 

fine  to  say  I  am  acting  for  the  attorney  general. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  can't  do  it  using  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  why?  If  you  ­­ if  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  my  own  letterhead,  somebody  is  likely  to  throw 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  out  before  they  get  to  the  text  because  they've

letterhead  is  a  good  way  of  really  making  the  point, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  am  acting  for  the  attorney  general. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor,  the  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

wanted  individuals  who  are  unsophisticated  to  know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  they  were  dealing  with,  especially  when  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  dealing  with  a  professional  debt  collector  who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

gets  a  cut  of  the  proceeds. 

   

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  they're  dealing  with 

  

 

 

 

 

somebody  who  is  acting  for  the  attorney  general. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  They  are  ­­ yes,  they  are, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  they  are  dealing  with  someone  who  is  acting  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  attorney  general  in  a  context  in  which  Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  deeply  concerned  about  how  those  individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  wrong  incentive  structures  and  will  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  to  get  their  third  of  the  proceeds. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  ­­ but  you're  making 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  argument  somewhat  the  ­­ like  the  argument  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  made  in  the  brief.  The  ­­ the  debtor  gets  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letter  from  the  attorney  general,  says,  oh,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  general,  I'm  really  concerned.  They  ought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  concerned  because  the  State  of  Ohio  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

garnish  their  tax  for  the  unpaid  debt.  It  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  They  ­­ they  ought  to  know  that  it's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  And  you  ­­ you  say  they  don't  ­­ for  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  you  don't  want  them  to  be  intimidated  because

they  know  it's  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

         

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor,  my  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  The  State  has  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

strong  interest  in  letting  the  debtor  know  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ that  it's  its  debt. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor,  my  main  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  Congress  wanted  people  to  know  ­­ that  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumers  to  know  who  they're  dealing  with. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

But  to  answer  the  question,  it  is  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  true  that  every  debtor  is  better  off  paying  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's  debt  than  some  other  debt.  The  Attorney 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  of  Ohio  does  not  have  many  more  powers  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyone  else  has.  And  if  you're  choosing  between 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paying  ­­

 

         

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  ­­ that's  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

debtor's  decision  to  make.  That's  the  debtor's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

decision. 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Exactly.  But  the  debtor 

  

  

 

 

 

needs  to  ­­

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you  ­­ it  ­­ it  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me  that  you  ­­ your  ­­ your  solution  is  almost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misleading  in  ­­ in  another  direction. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Your  Honor,  there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

nothing  wrong  with  the  debt  collectors  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  that  you've  just  described  as  ­­ as  to

what  could  happen  just  because  the  State  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved.  The  truth  is,  the  State  has  very  few 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powers  ­­ I  mean,  they  have  the  power  to  take  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lottery  winnings.  They  have  ­­ I  mean  ­­ and  most 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtors  actually  don't  have  a  lot  of  lottery 

   

 

 

 

 

 

winnings.  They  have  the  power  to  ­­ to  take  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

income  tax  refund.  Most  debtors  do  not  expect  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

income  tax  refund  anytime  soon.  That's  it.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

State  has  no  additional  power. 

 

 

 

 

         

And  it  is  actually  misleading  to  try  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convey  to  these  individuals  why  it  is  that  ­­ excuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me.  It's  misleading  to  convey  to  these  individuals 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  debt  collectors  are  from  within  the  office. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Basically,  this 

  

 

 

argument,  as  I  understand  it  ­­ maybe  you  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  me  ­­ is  that  even  a  private  collector  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  the  name  of  Filene's  Basement  because  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misleading.  It's  telling  the  person,  assuming  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say,  "I  have  been  hired  by  Filene's  Basement  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect  your  debt  on  Filene's  Basement's  letterhead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  sign  it  "debt  collector  X,  Y,  and  Z."  Under

judgment? 

         

MR.  ROSENCRANZ:  Congress  ­­ that  is

judgment  on  the  very  specific  ­­ on  the  very

The  concession  was  about  IBM.  But  it's  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exact  point. 

 

         

Debt  collectors  are  different  from  the  ­­

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice,  and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

I'd  like  to  make  a  couple  of  points  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  question  presented  and  then  try  to  answer  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  on  the  second  question  presented. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

The  FDCPA  applies  to  Ohio's  debt  collection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  counsel  because  outside  the  context  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation,  Ohio  has  chosen  not  to  treat  them  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers  or  employees  of  the  State.  There  has  been

in  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulation.  There  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar  set  of  regulations  that  would  create  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office  of  special  counsel  here. 

 

 

 

 

         

But  even  if  you  were  to  assume,  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sake  of  argument,  that  the  statute  ­­ I'm  sorry  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  the  attorney  general  to  create  an  office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  special  counsel  and  to  treat  the  people  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hired  as  special  counsel  as  officers,  that  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  so  here. 

 

 

         

In  the  retention  agreement,  the  attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

general  has  been  careful  to  say  that  these  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  to  be  considered  employees  of  the  State  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  purpose.  The  agreement  not  only  does  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

indemnify  the  special  counsel;  it  requires  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  counsel  to  indemnify  the  State.  It  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  them  any  rights  to  collect  any  debts.  It  gives 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  attorney  general  complete  discretion  over  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debts  the  special  counsel  may  collect.

does  not  treat  them  as  officers  or  employees.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  retention  agreement,  the  attorney  general  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  everything  possible  to  disclaim  any  inference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  these  people  are  part  of  the  State  government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  true. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  he  authorizes 

  

 

 

 

 

use  of  the  seal. 

 

 

 

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  He  authorizes  the  use  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  letterhead,  but  ­­

 

 

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  that's  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  they've  done  everything  possible  to  separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  from  the  attorney  general.  That  seems  to  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  good  effort  to  connect  them  to  the  attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general. 

         

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  But  as  you  can  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  "Here,  use  our 

  

 

 

 

 

stationery  and  our  letterhead."

discretion  to  bind  the  States.  It  doesn't  create  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office. 

         

You  know,  if  you  have  nine  special  counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  day  and  then  eight  special  counsel  the  next  day, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  don't  think  of  there  being  a  vacancy  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office  of  ­­ office  of  special  counsel.  Generally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  have  an  office,  you  either  have  an  officer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  a  vacancy.  But  here  there's  just  ­­ the  attorney 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  can  hire  any  number  of  special  counsel  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  guess  my  point  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

simply  that  authorizing  use  of  the  seal  does  suggest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  connection  with  the  individual  doing  the  debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection  work  and  the  attorney  general.  And  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  there's  no  way  ­­ or  they've  done  everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible  to  show  there's  no  connection. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  can't  imagine 

    

 

 

 

anything  they  could  do  more  dramatically  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  there  is  a  connection  than  say,  "Here,  use 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  letterhead." 

 

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  I  think  if  you  look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

at  retention  agreement,  what  I  meant  is  they've  done 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  possible  in  structuring  the  relationship 

 

 

 

 

 

between  the  special  counsel  and  the  office  of

attorney  general  to  make  clear  that  they  are  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  office. 

 

 

 

         

Now,  with  respect  to  using  the  letterhead, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  that's  intended  to  sort  of  convey  a  sense  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seriousness  to  debtors  who  receive  the  letters. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  point  that  ­­ that  the  State  has  made. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  expect  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

meant  to  convey  that  this  person  is  working  for  us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  person,  I,  the  attorney  general,  think  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  who's  acting  on  my  behalf. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  it's  true  that 

  

 

 

 

 

outside  debt  collectors  are  acting  on  behalf  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors  who  hire  them,  but  that  does  not  make  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  creditor  organization. 

 

 

 

 

         

You  know,  I  think  if  you  look  at  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  "debt  collector"  and  the  exemptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether,  with  respect  to  private  creditors  or  ­­ or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  creditors,  it's  clear  that  Congress  intended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute  to  apply  to  independent  contractors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

But  it  also  intended  to  allow  creditors, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  private  or  public,  to  use  their  own  in­house 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  without  being  subject  to  the  requirements  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Act. 

 

         

And  so  it's  really  totally  up  to  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  it's  going  to  use  its  inside  people,  then  it

hires  outside  third­party  contractors,  it  does. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

If  I  could  just  address  what  Justice  Breyer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

was  asking  about,  the  use  of  your  true  name,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  filled  out  a  form  that  asked  for  your  name 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  said,  "Have  you  used  any  other  name?"  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  take  that  to  mean  as  your  own  name.  And  so  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  the  sense  in  which  the  statute  means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  use  of  another  name. 

 

 

 

 

         

         

There's  generally  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  this  isn't  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

Nobody  thinks  this  person  is  the  attorney  general  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State. 

 

         

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  reason  that's 

  

 

 

 

underlying  disturbing  me  is  there  is  a  pretty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

well­known  scam  where  people  get  phone  calls  from  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  who  identifies  himself  as  somehow  connected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  IRS,  and  you  better  send  them  $300  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$3,000  immediately  to  a  certain  post  office  box  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  might  find  yourself  in  jail.  Okay?  Now,  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  scam. 

 

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Right. 

  

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  if  you  get  a  letter

official  person  and  there  is  nothing  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letterhead  that  suggests  that  you  are  such,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  well  think,  if  you've  at  least  had  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience  I'm  talking  about,  that  this  is  a  scam. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

And  so  what  the  purpose  of  this  letterhead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  is  it  is  some  indication  to  the  recipient  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  a  scam,  and  the  rest  of  the  letter  makes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  precisely  what  it  is. 

 

 

 

 

         

So  what  I  fail  to  see  is  anything  at  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misleading  ­­ indeed,  to  the  contrary  ­­ in  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  using  a  letterhead.  And  if  there  is  nothing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

misleading  at  all  about  it,  I  think  I  could 

   

   

 

 

 

 

interpret  this  statute  that  requires  the  contrary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  in  some  form  or  other. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  sir,  I  disagree  that 

   

  

 

 

 

there's  nothing  misleading  about  it.  I  think  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

gives  the  impression  that  the  letter  was  issued  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  office  of  the  attorney  general,  because  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  convention  that,  when  you  use  the  letterhead, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  signaling  who  the  sender  of  the  letter  is.  A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  firm  would  never  send  a  letter  using  its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

client's  letterhead  because  that  would  give  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  impression  about  who's  sending  the  letter. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  is  it  not  sent  by  the

people  to  know  it  comes  from  us"? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  Well,  that  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

violation  of  the  Act,  too,  if  the  debt  collectors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  outside  the  independent  contractor  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

         

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  My  goodness,  then  what 

  

 

 

 

we're  going  to  have  is  all  ­­ in  other  words, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ in  your  interpretation  of  this  law,  a  piece 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  stationery  that  tends  to  indicate  that  the  debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ the  debt  collector  is  indeed  speaking  for  whom 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  purports  to  speak  for,  anything  that  indicates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  the  view  of  the  government  violates  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  I'd  worry  about  it  just  as  a  practical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

matter  because  I  think  that  might  lead  to  more  scams 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than  fewer. 

 

 

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  I  don't  believe  that's  our 

    

 

 

 

 

view  of  the  statute.  I  think  the  ­­ you  know, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  FDCPA  is  premised  on  separating  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor  from  outside  third­party  debt  collectors. 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  a  debt  collector  has  to  be  clear  that  he  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  creditor.  And  so  when  they  use  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor's  letterhead,  that  gives  a  false 

   

 

 

 

impression.  If  they're  worried  that  they're  not

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It's  not  being  taken

you're  concerned  about  that.

Now,  remember,  the  only  reason  we're  getting  to  the

to  the  attorney's  office  ­­ attorney  general's

say,  do  you  authorize  me  to  send  this?  And  the

Would  it  be  misleading  under  those  circumstances? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  It  would,  because  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

still  give  the  impression  that  it  was  issued  by  the

misimpression  as  to  any  one  of  those  things,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  per  se  violation  of  the  statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It's  your  ­­ it's  your

the  United  States  that  the  Attorney  General  of  Ohio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  in  violation  of  this  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MS.  HARRINGTON:  No,  that  the  special

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  No.  But  he's  approved 

  

  

 

 

 

MS.  HARRINGTON:  He's  ­­ he  has  sanctioned 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  violation  of  the  law.  But  I  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  under  your 

  

 

 

 

position,  the  ­­ the  attorney  general  of  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Ohio  is  in  violation  of  the  law.  That's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  of  the  United  States  that  you're  arguing  in

MS.  HARRINGTON:  No,  sir.  Our  ­­ may  I

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ERIC  E.  MURPHY 

 

 

 

 

 

            

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Just  a  few  points. 

   

 

         

First,  going  to  Justice  Kagan's  question,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  think  they  are  turning  a  virtue  into  a  vice 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

here.  They're  flipping  the  Act  on  its  head.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ if  you  look  at  the  tax  statute  that  requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  AG  to  give  this  letterhead  to  special  counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  tax  debts,  the  very  next  provision  ­­ the  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

next  provision  of  that  Act,  which  was  known  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Taxpayer  Bill  of  Rights,  the  very  next  provision  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Act  requires  the  AG  to  appoint  problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolution  officers  to  handle  complaints  by  debtors

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  do  they  know  who  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  MURPHY:  Precisely  because  the  AG's 

  

 

 

 

 

letterhead  ­­

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Does  the  Act  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  special  debt  collector  has  to  give  them  the  AG's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem­solving  ­­

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  No.  But  I  think  that  ­­ that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

was  the  point  of  the  law,  was  to  put  the  letterhead, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  they  know  to  call  the  office.  And  then  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  regular  customer  service  hotline  that  they  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call  and  they'll  ­­ they'll  get  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  that's  quite 

  

 

 

 

interesting,  because  the  only  number  that's  in  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letters  is  the  net  ­­ number  of  the  debt  collector. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Well,  that's  right.  But  by

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Is  there  any  obligation 

  

 

 

 

 

in  the  contract  for  the  debt  collector,  when  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receives  a  customer  complaint,  to  give  them  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  the  AG's  customer  service  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  There's  not  an  obligation  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  contract,  but  there  certainly  is  an  obligation

in  the  contract  for  them  to  report  that  complaint  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  AG. 

 

         

And  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  think  that  the  AG  has 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

interpreted  these  problem  resolution  officers  more 

 

 

 

 

 

broadly  to  allow  it  to  handle  all  sorts  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaints.  But  I  think  the  reputational  idea  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

also  significant,  because  when  the  AG  authorizes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  individuals  to  use  the  letterhead,  that's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powerful  incentive  on  the  AG  or  the  AG's  office  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  also  uses  the  word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"issued."  And  so  what  about  "issued"? 

  

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  Well,  I  think  that  ­­ just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  ­­ we're  the  only  party  that  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  cited  the  dictionary  definition  of  "issue." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  dictionary  definition  of  "issue"  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribute  in  their  official  capacity. 

 

 

 

 

         

So  when  special  counsel  send  these  letters, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  distributing  it  in  their  official  capacity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  special  counsel  to  the  attorney  general,  not  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  lawyers  with  their  private  law  firms.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  an  easy  interpretation  of  "issue"  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  authorize  the  ­­

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  if  we  get  to  the  second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  we've  already  decided  that  these  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  officers.  They're  independent  contractors.

They  might  be  agents  in  a  casual  sense  of  the  word, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  they're  not  officers. 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  That's  absolutely  correct. 

  

 

 

 

Our  first­level  answer  would  be  that  they  are  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  ­­

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Right.  So  if  we  assume 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  they're  not  officers,  then  I  think  Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer's  question  holds:  What  does  it  mean  for  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  to  issue  something  as  opposed  to  the  Ohio  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  I  do  think  that  you  ­­ I  do 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  they're  distributing  it  in  their  official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity  as  special  counsel.  Whether  they're 

  

 

 

 

 

independent  contractors,  officers,  or  employees,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  a  separate  question. 

   

 

 

         

And  then  I  think  it  goes  to  the  clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement  rule  with  respect  to  Justice  Kennedy's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comment.  I  think  it's  just  a  fundamental  breach  of 

    

   

 

 

 

 

etiquette,  or  of  federalism,  to  suggest  that  private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  are  the  ones  who  get  to  decide  who  gets  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  an  attorney  general's  letterhead. 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  May  I  ask  you  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  think  that 

    

 

 

 

question 
 

should  be  with  the  attorney  general. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  fine.  But  as 

  

  

 

 

 

far  as  I 
   

 

see  it,  isn't  there  one  of  these  two  cases

where  someone  who  wasn't  the  special  counsel  signed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  letter? 

 

         

MR.  MURPHY:  That's  absolutely  true.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

they've  waived  that  argument  because  their  theory  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  is  that  it's  just  the  letterhead  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misleading.  And  I  can  easily  ­­ I  can  get  into  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

facts  of  that  issue. 

 

 

 

         

 

 

That  issue  was  this  person  got  a  call  from 

   

 

 

 

 

the  person  ­­ from  the  Plaintiff,  the  Plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked  for  her  balance.  She  sent  the  balance  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letter.  It  says,  per  your  request,  here  is  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance,  and  then  the  Plaintiff  turned  around  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued  the  individual  after  they  requested  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letter. 

         

So  I  think  they've  largely  abandoned  that 

   

 

 

 

 

idea  that  the  letterhead  was  misleading. 

 

 

 

 

 

         

Thank  you. 

 

         

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

         

The  case  is  submitted.
