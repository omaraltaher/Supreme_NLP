CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-281, Inyo County, California v. the Paiute-


Shoshone Indians of the Bishop Community.


Mr. Kirby.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KIRBY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. KIRBY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


In this case the Paiute propose and are seeking


a categorical rule that makes Indian tribes, their


casinos, their commercial businesses, and their personal


property immune from search warrants and subpoenas issued


in connection with the investigation of crime and the 

prosecution of crime.


They seek this rule under Federal statutory law,


under Federal common law, and under the Constitution. 


However, such a categorical rule is not supported by the


text, structure, or history of the Constitution, by any


Federal statute, or by any sufficient or rational public


policy.


Further, there is not now, nor should this Court


extend or create a common law right to be immune from


search warrants and subpoenas that are issued in

connection with the investigation of crime and the


prosecution of crime.


It is a --


QUESTION:  Counsel, did the tribe offer to


accept as consent by the employees their employment forms?


MR. KIRBY:  Your Honor, I am prepared to answer


that question.  It does involve matters outside the


record, and I will proceed to answer.


QUESTION:  I see.  I just thought it was a


little curious that if some means of solving this had been


offered, why we're here.


MR. KIRBY:  There was not any means of solving


it at the time, Your Honor, because the Federal


regulations that govern the public welfare act at


question, title 45, part 205, prohibits the information 

from being disclosed.


QUESTION:  Okay, thank you.


MR. KIRBY:  It is --


QUESTION:  That goes for -- they had asked for


edited copies.  They just wanted the last page, and they


said that they could be edited.  Does the -- in your view


didn't Federal regulations preclude even those edited


copies of just the last page from being turned over?


MR. KIRBY:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, because the


information that's precluded from being distributed is the

names of the individuals who are being investigated.


Now, I know that the allegation is made that in


the letter that was sent by the district attorney and by


the Department of Health and Human Services stated that


this was a welfare fraud investigation.  However, that


letter actually did not so state.  It stated that the


investigation was a confidential investigation that


required the payroll information being sought.


The fundamental right and responsibility of


government is to protect its citizens, and one of the main


ways it does that, of course, is through the investigation


and prosecution of crime.  The Federal Government and the


State government have together an integrated law


enforcement regime that allows for search warrants and


subpoenas to be executed and issued in connection with the 

investigation of these crimes or alleged crimes whether


the criminal conduct occurs on the reservation or off the


reservation and regardless of whether the evidence or


proceeds of crime is thought to be on the reservation or


off the reservation.


For instance, in a Public Law 280 State, such as


California, if there is a crime committed off the


reservation, frankly as well as on the reservation, the


Federal Government does not have jurisdiction over that


crime.  Thus, the Federal Government does not have the

ability to issue a search warrant.  If the States do not


have the ability to issue a search warrant under those


circumstances and there is evidence of crime or proceeds


of crime on the reservation, then that property or


evidence remains immune from law enforcement.


QUESTION:  Is California one of the 280 States


that has jurisdiction?


MR. KIRBY:  Yes, Justice Kennedy, California is


a Public Law 280 State.


Now, in a non-Public Law 280 State, the same


situation presents itself because in that situation, the


Federal Government has the right to -- and the -- the


duty, if you will -- as a responsibility to its citizens


to enforce the criminal law with regard to crimes that


occur on the reservation that would be State crimes if 

they occurred off the reservation.  And under the Major


Crimes Act, as well as the General Crimes Act, the Federal


Government prosecutes that crime and, of course, does the


investigation prior to prosecution.  In order to conduct


those activities and to fulfill that mission, if you will,


the Federal Government needs to have the right and does


have the right to execute search warrants and to issue


subpoenas.


Now, as we have seen, there may be a situation


where a crime is committed on the reservation in a Public

Law 280 State and a crime committed in a -- the same crime


in a non-Public Law 280 State, and in those situations,


there must be parity with regard to the law enforcement


regime.  If not, what we end up with is gaps in the


criminal justice system, and that wasn't the intent of the


legislature in enacting Public Law 280.


As the Court will recall, Public Law 280 was


passed by Congress because of a perceived lawlessness on


certain reservations.  That lawlessness arose because


Congress felt that the Federal Government -- due to the


vast distances, if you will, of Federal Government law


enforcement agencies, and the lack of density of those


agencies -- simply wasn't able to enforce criminal laws


throughout the vast acreage of reservations.  And so --


QUESTION: 


Mr. Kirby, here what happened I -- as 

I understand it, was that a search warrant was served on


the tribe itself, and so I think that's what your argument


should probably be addressed to.  I think in Hicks we held


that there could be process served against individual


tribal members.


MR. KIRBY:  Yes, Your Honor.  The search warrant


was issued as to tribal property.  I -- I would point out


that the search warrant itself didn't actually require the


tribe to do anything other than stand by and allow the


officers to go forth and search.  And in this --

 QUESTION:  Well, that's true of most search


warrants.


MR. KIRBY:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  I mean, the person served doesn't


have to do anything except let them search.


MR. KIRBY:  Yes, Your Honor, the point being --


the point being that the search warrant did not hail the


reservation or the tribe into court for the purpose of


responding to a civil judgment for the purpose of --


QUESTION:  What -- what was the tribal property


at issue?


MR. KIRBY:  It was common payroll records,


Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  Were they records of the casino?


MR. KIRBY: 


They were records of the commercial 

business operated there, yes, the casino.


QUESTION:  Where were they kept?  Were they kept


at the casino?


MR. KIRBY:  Your Honor, they were kept in back


of the casino, as I understand it, in an outbuilding that


was secured by a padlock.


QUESTION:  Would you -- would you draw a


distinction between the subpoena of the records of the


commercial operation and a subpoena of the records of the


-- of the government records of the tribe itself?

 MR. KIRBY:  Yes, Justice Scalia, there could


very well be a distinction there.  And the solution that


we believe would address that distinction would be a


solution that Justice White presented in the Brendale


decision when he talked about a tribe having a unique


protectable interest in certain situations.  And the tribe


ought to have a right to go to court -- in this case, it


would be a State court -- to present that protectable


interest so that a -- an interest-balancing assessment can


be accomplished.


In this case the interest of the tribal record


may very well outweigh a minimal interest of the State if


it was a simple minor misdemeanor.  On the other hand, it


may be that if it's a large serious felony of multiple


murder and there is very direct evidence in the records of 

the tribal government, perhaps under those facts the court


may find that the interest weighed in favor of the State's


police power.


QUESTION:  But that --


QUESTION:  Isn't there the obvious --


QUESTION:  Is it that the local magistrate in


each case has to -- and then the law enforcement officer


weigh these interests?  Well, this is a misdemeanor. 


Well, this is a felony.  I -- I don't -- I think that


would be a very difficult rule to implement in practice.

 QUESTION:  What does everybody do?  Sort of


stand around until the appeal is finally exhausted --


MR. KIRBY:  No.


QUESTION:  -- for a couple of years to see


whether they can do the search or not?


MR. KIRBY:  No, Justice Scalia, and no, Justice


Kennedy.


What would happen would be once the probable


cause determination is made that there is evidence of a


crime within the records of the casino in our


hypothetical, the search warrant would be executed and the


property would be seized and brought before the court.  At


that time the tribe, if it thought it had a protectable


interest under State statute, perhaps because of certain


statutory privileges, or under some special protectable 

interest that the tribe may feel that it has because of


its unique domestic dependent sovereign status, could


present that interest balance analysis to the magistrate


immediately.


QUESTION:  But what good did it do to the State


-- to the tribe after the horse is out of the barn?  In


other words, the State -- the tribe is not being


prosecuted for anything in these cases.  It's a tribal


member who's being prosecuted.  And if you're saying,


well, the -- the warrant has to be executed but after the

fact the State -- the tribe, to -- to ease its wounded


feelings, can have this declaration?  I don't follow it.


I mean, the tribe's idea is there is no right to


come on our property and seize our records.  If you're


saying every time the county can do that and that all the


tribe has is an after-the-fact determination by some


magistrate that the county was wrong, it's not much of a


remedy, is it?


MR. KIRBY:  With all respect, Justice Ginsburg,


I believe it's the best remedy available.  The tribe's


desire to have a categorical rule that no search warrants


may be issued with regard to its property has disastrous


consequences when evidence or proceeds of a crime is


located upon the reservation.


QUESTION:  Why?  Why is that? 


I mean, from what 

you've said so far, it sounds to me as if the State or the


county went to the tribe and said, we want your records,


and the tribe said, why?  And the county said, we can't


tell you.  Well, obviously that would be a situation where


they might get their backs up.


But suppose you just said, look, the reason is


that we think there are a couple of people here who are


cheating us.  We think they get welfare from us and you're


paying them too much.  That's why we want to look at it. 


Maybe they would have said, sure, go look at it.  But I

take it you couldn't do that simple thing?


MR. KIRBY:  Your Honor, the Federal regulation


prohibits the --


QUESTION:  All right.  So then isn't the


solution that maybe you need a law to overcome the Federal


regulation or maybe you just go to a Federal official and


say, will you please ask them?


MR. KIRBY:  No, Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  There's no way to do it.  In other


words, under the law the only choice -- your major


constitutional thing is you have to say the only


possibility is the county that wants to prosecute somebody


has to -- goes to the tribe and says, we want to prosecute


somebody.  We won't tell you who.  We can't tell you why. 


Give us all your records. 


I mean, on that circumstance, 

I'd think the tribe would certainly have a point.  And yet


-- yet if -- if you were behaving reasonably and maybe --


maybe if Federal law prevents you from behaving


reasonably, maybe they should change it.


How is this supposed to work out?


MR. KIRBY:  Well, Justice Breyer, looking at the


situation that you've presented, which is our situation,


one must remember that letters were sent by the Department


of Health and Human Services to the three individuals


asking for a reconciliation.  Letters were sent by the


12

district attorney to these same three individuals.  Two


letters were sent to the tribe asking for the information,


which the tribe had honored five times in the last


approximately two years, and the tribe had actually in one


of those occasions asked for a search warrant, which it


then honored.  There was a history of working with the


tribe to obtain this information.


During this circumstance, the tribe took the


position it was no longer going to do that.  It wanted to


have something more, and in fact the tribal attorney


suggested that a search warrant be obtained.  And as it


had been in another circumstance within the preceding 12


months.  So there is a clear history of trying to work


with the tribe.


What ended up happening in this case is what 

could happen in any case.  The tribe, for whatever reason,


depending upon whatever tribal government might have been


elected at the time -- and it -- they may have been


different on that day than they were during the preceding


2 years -- decided, no, we're not going to do that any


longer.  And that's how this situation came to fruition.


And what we're looking at --


QUESTION:  Well, do you have other means to get


the information?  Can you question the people you suspect


of welfare fraud and ask them how much they earned, if

anything?


MR. KIRBY:  Justice O'Connor, that was done on


at least two separate occasions.  Letters were sent to


each of the three casino employees advising them of the


discrepancy and asking that the employees come in and


reconcile the discrepancy.  Those letters, unfortunately,


were ignored.  And so the county was faced with the


situation where it is mandated to have such an


investigation process into potential fraud by the --


QUESTION:  Well, presumably you could question


supervisory employees who prepare payroll records and ask


them how much have you paid these people, if anything. 


Could you do that?


MR. KIRBY:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, that could be


done. 


That presumes, however, that the tribal officials 

would subject themselves and submit to questioning and


providing the information verbally that they have refused


to provide in writing simply by filling out a form


requesting the information.


QUESTION:  Well, we have said that the -- in


Minnesota v. the United States, I think we said that a


proceeding against property in which the United States has


an interest is a suit against the United States.  Do you


take the position that you can file a suit against the


Indian tribe without its consent?

 MR. KIRBY:  Justice O'Connor, when property is


at issue, we have an in rem situation that doesn't require


a lawsuit.  We have the -- I believe it's Minnesota and


the Cass County case which --


QUESTION:  Well, you didn't answer my question.


MR. KIRBY:  I apologize.


QUESTION:  Do you take the position that you can


file a suit against the tribe?


MR. KIRBY:  Not to differ or to draw hairs, yes,


the suit could be filed and if the tribe consented to


jurisdiction, then we could resolve it in court.


QUESTION:  Yes, but -- against its consent.


MR. KIRBY:  Not against its consent.  That's


right.


QUESTION:  No.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kirby, isn't it the case that --


that you can sue -- the United States can be sued against


its -- against its consent if it's operating a commercial


enterprise.  Isn't that the international law of sovereign


immunity, just as under our Foreign Sovereign Immunities


Act a foreign sovereign can be sued in this country


against its will if it is operating a commercial


enterprise?


MR. KIRBY:  That is my understanding, Justice


Scalia, and that is the case we have here.

 QUESTION:  No, but isn't there one difference?


And that is, take the foreign sovereign situation. 


There's a statute of the United States.  And -- and if we


start with the assumption, as I do, that we are in a


different situation from -- from what we faced in Hicks so


that we're talking about, in effect, a claim directly


against the -- the sovereign itself, and if we also


assume, which I think is correct, that the ultimate party


in interest in this kind of a welfare fraud situation is


the United States, why isn't the sensible answer to say,


all right, if the United States wants the tribes to be


treated like foreign sovereigns in a commercial


enterprise, and if the United States wants to regard the


casinos as a commercial enterprise for that purpose, let


it pass a statute comparable to the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act?


MR. KIRBY:  That would certainly be a resolution


of this case, Justice Souter.  However, what we're left


with dealing today without congressional action is the


common law tribal immunity doctrine as set forth by this


Court and the Montana analysis that this Court has set


forth with regard to --


QUESTION:  Has Congress ever adopted a statute


speaking to tribal sovereign immunity?


MR. KIRBY:  No, Justice Scalia.

creation which basically was an adoption of an


international law norm?


MR. KIRBY:  Initially --


QUESTION:  Isn't that what John Marshall thought


he was doing?


MR. KIRBY:  I believe that the tribal sovereign


immunity doctrine commenced with the Turner decision which


was approximately 1919.  And as this Court indicated in


the Kiowa decision, that sovereign immunity doctrine was


created almost by accident.  It was --


QUESTION:  What about Worcester v. Georgia?  I


thought that the -- the tribal sovereign immunity began


long before 19-something.


QUESTION:  So did I.


MR. KIRBY:  Worcester v. Georgia, Justice


Ginsburg and Justice Souter, dealt with primarily treaty


rights and the -- the need for Justice Marshall to try to


-- to put, if you will, or place the tribes who were


nation -- independent nations, sovereigns of this country,


into some category that was different from nation states.

Our Constitution recognizes that Indian tribes are not


nation -- foreign nation states.  In the Commerce Clause,


we speak to the Interstate Commerce Clause as States being


one type of entity, Indian tribes being another, and


foreign nations being another.  So tribes have always been


considered differently.  And here they are domestic


dependent sovereigns which has characteristics totally


different from foreign nation states.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kirby --


QUESTION:  I think we will hear in about a


minute, if we get to the main issue of this, I suspect --


you see, on the one hand if we decide in your favor, that


means that any magistrate in the State, of which there may


be many, in any criminal case whatsoever for probable


cause can allow State officials to go into all the tribal 

documents no matter how many there are, no matter how


related to government of the tribe, whatever they are. 


They're most -- they're most key matters for the tribe's


governance.  But if we decide against you, all it means is


that you have to go to the Federal Government and convince


them that this is really important and then they'll deal


with it.


MR. KIRBY:  Well, Justice Breyer, Congress


certainly has plenary power over Indian tribes.


QUESTION:  I'm not thinking of Congress.  I'm

saying right now -- you go to the Interior Department.


They have people there.  You go tell them what the problem


is, and they say -- you say, this tribe is being totally


unreasonable here, completely.  I don't know why but they


are.  And -- and if they feel it's important that the


Federal Government now has adequate ways of getting you


the information you need.  Now -- now am I wrong?


MR. KIRBY:  Justice Breyer, with all respect,


yes, you are wrong.


QUESTION:  There's no way.  In other words, it's


just we're at a -- at a loss.  Either -- either -- we'd


have to get legislation, in your opinion.


MR. KIRBY:  In my opinion we have to adopt a --


first of all, we cannot adopt a categorical rule that the


tribes propose. 


So what we are looking for is a solution 

that is acceptable to certainly the majority of the


Court --


QUESTION:  All right.  You -- it's acceptable to


you.  You say commercial -- if it's a commercial body like


a casino, that's -- they don't have the immunity, but if


it's noncommercial, it's okay.  But has this been argued


below whether they're commercial or noncommercial?


MR. KIRBY:  It has not been argued below,


Justice Breyer.  However, that's not the distinction that


we're making between commercial and governmental activity

because, as I indicated earlier, if the government


minutes, if you will, the tribal minutes, have direct


evidence of a very serious felony for whatever reason --


QUESTION:  Okay.  The distinction you would be


making is?


MR. KIRBY:  A balancing interest, Your --


Justice Breyer.  And I believe that --


QUESTION:  Why do you want to --


MR. KIRBY:  -- under the Younger abstention


doctrine -- yes, Justice Kennedy.


QUESTION:  You want to do it the hard way.  I


mean, the -- you win this case if we say you can subpoena


the commercial -- the records of a commercial enterprise


being run by the tribe, but you don't want to do that.


MR. KIRBY: 


We'd be happy to win this case on 

that ground, Justice Scalia.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  May I ask, speaking of that -- that


question, does the tribe itself operate the casino or does


it operate it through a corporation of some kind?


MR. KIRBY:  The casino is operated through a


corporation that is chartered by the tribe, not by the


State.  So the tribe has certain policies wherein it


blesses an organization as a -- as a tribal corporation.


QUESTION:  Your -- your petition raises three

questions, and so far, due to no fault of your own, you've


only covered one of them.  Do you want to try to get to


the other two or three?

reserve my time and perhaps address that in reply.


QUESTION:  Very well.


Ms. McDowell.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS IN PART


AND THE RESPONDENTS IN PART


MS. McDOWELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


I would first like to correct one


misunderstanding that the Court may have been left with as


a result of Mr. Kirby's comments.  There is no Federal


regulation or other Federal requirement that would have


prevented the county or the State from sharing with the


tribe the information, the welfare applications, and so


on.  Federal --


QUESTION:  Well, but even so, let's assume


there's a serious felony having been committed involving a


crime of violence where employees of the casino are


implicated.  Surely, the district attorney's office or the

county is not going to share that information with --


necessarily with -- with the whole tribal council.


MS. McDOWELL:  In the first place --


QUESTION:  That seems -- that seems to me a very


disruptive proposal for -- for orderly law enforcement.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, Your Honor, nothing in the


position that's being urged here would preclude a State


from proceeding against individual tribal members and


searching their own --


QUESTION:  No, but the suggestion was that


there'd be a lot of cooperation between the tribes.  But


it seems to me that that may compromise a very serious


criminal investigation.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, and -- and if that's the


case, they would not need to share the information with 

the tribe, but they could proceed against the individual


tribal member.


QUESTION:  No, no.  But -- no, the problem that


he's trying to put -- imagine the most serious crime you


can think of committed off the reservation by people who


have nothing to do with the Indian tribe, for example, but


there is a key piece of evidence that is there in the


tribal document and they want to get it.


Now, what we've just been told is there -- they


can't -- if -- if we decide for the tribe, there's no way

whatsoever they can get it.  It's impossible.  If the


tribe refuses to cooperate, the Federal Government can do


nothing without new laws being passed.  Now, is all that


the case?


MS. McDOWELL:  No, that's not the case, Justice


Breyer.  In many instances, of course, if there was a


serious crime, it's a crime that the Federal Government,


as well as the State, could prosecute, and there's no


immunity bar to --


QUESTION:  But if there -- it's not --


QUESTION:  In the 280 jurisdiction?


MS. McDOWELL:  Even in the Public Law 280


jurisdiction, Justice O'Connor, because there are Federal


statutes, as you're well aware, dealing with firearms,


narcotics, racketeering and so on that could often be used 

in this sort of situation.


In addition, the Federal Government could often


bring the parties together and try to reconcile these


sorts of disagreements.  Tribes, after all, are sovereign


governments.  They have a significant interest in law


enforcement.


QUESTION:  Well, Ms. McDowell, let's talk about


their being sovereign.  I had thought that we -- that our


cases make very clear that their sovereignty is a peculiar


and lesser kind of sovereignty.  It is certainly -- does

not exceed the sovereignty of the States or of foreign


countries.  And I -- I am perplexed at why -- why the


United States wants to accord the -- the tribe's


commercial enterprises greater protection than is accorded


to England or -- or Germany or any -- any foreign


sovereign --


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, of course --


QUESTION:  -- where suit is allowed.  And I'm


sure in the course of suit, you can subpoena documents


relating to that -- to that commercial enterprise.  Why


should we -- and that provision in the Foreign Sovereign


Immunities Act was simply a reflection of what the


international norm had become.  Now, why in the world


should we accord greater protection to this lesser


sovereignty that -- that consists of the Indian tribe? 

MS. McDOWELL:  Well, in the Kiowa case, Your


Honor, the Court extended tribal sovereign immunity to


commercial off-reservation activities of a tribe.  The


Court recognized that any limitation on tribal sovereign


immunity that would exclude a tribe's commercial


activities from the protections of sovereign immunity was


a task for Congress rather than for the judiciary.


And it is significant that when commercial


activities of the United States Government, for example,


have been -- when suit has been allowed against such

entities, it's been a matter of -- of statute, not a

Sovereign Immunities Act is, after all, a statutory


protection.


QUESTION:  I think there was a dissent in that


case that made the point that Justice Scalia has been


pursuing.


I'd like to back up and find out how we got


here.  This is a suit brought by the tribe, not by the


county, right?


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And I think you are urging that 1983


is not available --


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct.


QUESTION: 


-- to the tribe either as plaintiff 

or defendant.


If 1983 is not available, then what is the


basis?  What statute does the tribe's case arise under for


the substantive determination that you would like to have


the Court adjudicate?  If we don't have 1983, what Federal


law does the case arise under?


MS. McDOWELL:  It's generally been understood,


Your Honor, although not specifically addressed in a


decision of this Court, that the Supremacy Clause and the


Federal jurisdictional statutes provide a right of action

for injunctive and declaratory relief when a party is


claiming that State action is precluded by superseding --


QUESTION:  Are you saying it's a kind of Bivens


action?


MS. McDOWELL:  It may be that.  It's -- it's


similar to Ex parte Young.  Justice Kennedy's dissenting


opinion in the second Golden State Transit case discusses


this at -- at some length.  Also the Court's decision in


Shaw v. Delta Air Lines provides a number of -- of


citations to cases that arose in this particular context. 


So it is a settled, although not frequently discussed


basis, of coming into Federal court to challenge State


action.


QUESTION:  Is -- is there a problem on an Ex


parte Young theory here? 


I mean, you're -- we're not --

they're not simply asking the tribe to stop doing


something that's unlawful by going against the officer who


does it.  They are asking for tribal property.


MS. McDOWELL:  I think you're referring to a


situation where a State would sue the tribe.


QUESTION:  Well, they -- that's what's going on. 


The -- the county here wants tribal property, right?


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct.  It has obtained


a search warrant against tribal property.  Interestingly


enough, the return of the search warrant directs the tribe

that if they want the property back, they will have to


come into State court and proceed under the California


Criminal Code.


QUESTION:  Well, is that Ex parte Young?


MS. McDOWELL:  No.  That's not Ex parte Young. 


Ex parte Young is -- is based essentially on what the


Court has called the legal fiction that when a State


officer is violating superior Federal law --


QUESTION:  Right.  So -- so Ex parte Young isn't


going to cover a situation like that.  I mean, an Ex parte


Young analog in this situation isn't going to cover the --


the request here.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, it is when one is


considering the tribe's suit against the petitioners.


QUESTION: 


Well, if -- if the -- what is the 

Federal -- basis for Federal jurisdiction of the tribe's


suit against the petitioners if 1983 is not available?


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, the jurisdictional basis is


section 1331, Federal question jurisdiction, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  But surely the Federal law that the


case arises under is not 1331 itself.  You have to have


another law, and the one exception to that is on the


Federal side when the Court created the Bivens action


because Congress had not enacted a statute like 1983 to


cover Federal offices.

 But you seem to be asking us to create another


such category where there's some right of action implied


from what?


MS. McDOWELL:  From the Supremacy Clause, Your


Honor, because the tribe's Federal common law immunity


supersedes the State enforcement of a State search warrant


against it.


QUESTION:  This is such an obvious way to raise


this kind of issue without that.  The next time somebody


wants something from the tribe, they say no, make them go


to court and appeal it.


MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, but a search warrant is


obtained in an ex parte proceeding, Your Honor.  There's


no opportunity for --


QUESTION: 


Well, I mean, can't you just resist a 

search warrant and say, no, I think it's an unlawful


warrant and go right to the State court and appeal it?


MS. McDOWELL:  No, you can't, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Everybody just has to follow this. 


There's no procedure to resist --


MS. McDOWELL:  No, there's no procedure for


that.  And indeed, a -- a party that resists the search


warrant may subject itself to criminal penalties for doing


so.


QUESTION:  May I ask --

procedure.


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about your


theory that the tribe is not a person within the meaning


of 1983?  You seem to assume that if they could not be


made a defendant, they also could not be a plaintiff. 


Don't you make that assumption in your argument?


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, Your Honor, and


that's because the term person --


QUESTION:  And isn't that assumption plainly


wrong?  Because for -- to be a defendant, you have to act


under color of State law.  So there are all sorts of


persons who can be plaintiffs who could never be


defendants.


MS. McDOWELL: 


Well, it -- it is not necessarily 

the case that a tribe could not act under State law, Your


Honor, because, for example, with jointly administering --


QUESTION:  But in the normal course of events,


it wouldn't be acting under State law.  It's acting under


its own law.


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, or it may be


acting under Federal law.


QUESTION:  So in the normal course of events,


the fact that it might not be a defendant wouldn't shed


any light at all on the question of whether it could be a

person for plaintiff purposes.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, generally, Your Honor, the


Court has applied the interpretive presumption that the


term person doesn't include a sovereign.  The term person


appears twice in the same sentence in section 1983, so it


would be curious if it was construed differently.


QUESTION:  Well, but a citizen, an ordinary


citizen, could be a person for plaintiff's purposes but


not necessarily a defendant.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, that -- that may indeed be


the case, Your Honor.


In the South Carolina Ports decision recently,


the Court recognized that the preeminent purpose of


sovereign immunity is to assure that sovereigns are


treated with the dignity that their sovereign status 

entitles them.  The execution of a State warrant is a


particular threat to the dignity of a sovereign tribe,


even more so perhaps than hauling it into court.  It's


obtained ex parte.


QUESTION:  You think that's so when -- when what


you're doing is getting the records of a casino?  I


mean --


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct.  Now, we're not


saying that every tribal business necessarily is an arm of


the tribe for sovereign immunity purposes, but the

MR. CHAMBERS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


I'm Mr. Chambers.


QUESTION:  Very well.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Thank you.  Thanks, Mr. Chief


Justice, and may it please the Court:


There are three principles of Federal law that


bar this search warrant. 


The first is tribal sovereign 

immunity.  The second is the longstanding principle that


States may not infringe the right of tribes to govern


themselves or internal affairs on their reservation.  And


the third is that there's no act of Congress that


authorizes this search warrant, though two statutes,


Public Law 280 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, do


provide a framework for some assumption of State


jurisdiction over tribes and Indians on reservation -- the


-- reservations.  The county doesn't claim that either


applies here to authorize this act, and they do not.

 I -- I want to address, if I may, Justice


Scalia's question about the commercial and governmental


distinction because basically the Indian Gaming Act by


Congress sets up a framework for tribes to operate gaming. 


This is a tribal enterprise.  It has to be, under the


Gaming Act, owned and controlled by the tribe.  It -- and


the proceeds of the gaming have to be used for tribal


purposes, chiefly tribal governmental purposes.  And they


are by the Bishop Paiute Tribe.


The Bishop Paiute Tribe is a small tribe in a


remote area of California.  It uses all of its gaming


revenues to operate tribal programs on its reservation. 


Like most tribes, the Bishop -- the Bishop Tribe operates


a health clinic, for example, educational programs,


welfare programs --


QUESTION:  May I just interrupt --


MR. CHAMBERS:  Certainly, Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  -- on the corporate point that was


brought up earlier?  Who pays the income tax on the


earnings of the casino?  The corporation or the tribe?


MR. CHAMBERS:  The -- the tribe is not taxable


under the Federal income tax laws, Justice Stevens.  And


-- and the corporation, as an arm of the tribe, is not


taxable.


QUESTION:  So there are no taxes on the

This is a relatively small casino.  It's in a pretty


remote part of California, sort of halfway between Los


Angeles --


QUESTION:  But it is owned by a corporation


rather than by the tribe itself?


MR. CHAMBERS:  Well, Justice Stevens, it's


operated by a corporation that was chartered by the tribe. 


It's wholly owned by the tribe.  And it -- it -- the board


of directors, for example, is removable --


QUESTION:  Well, who owns the real estate that


the casino is located on?  The tribe or the corporation?


MR. CHAMBERS:  No, the tribe, Justice Stevens. 


The tribe owns all the real estate on this small 

reservation in eastern California.  It's an 800-acre real


estate -- or trust land.  It's owned by the United States


in trust for the tribe.


QUESTION:  How about the slot --


QUESTION:  But this -- what you're saying is


true of all --

owns the slot machines?  The tribe or the corporation?

the Indian Gaming Act.  My point is that Congress --

the land.  It doesn't own the slot machines.  What -- what


does it do?

facility rather than having the tribal political leaders,


Justice Scalia, engaged in the day-to-day operation of the


-- of the gaming activity.  But it's --


QUESTION: 


But if -- if what was formerly tribal 

government has now been so infused with a commercial


character, that it seems to me calls tribal immunity into


question generally.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Well, let me try to persuade you


it doesn't, Justice Kennedy.  That the -- I mean here,


first of all, the Indian Gaming Act was enacted for the


purpose of strengthening tribal governments.  That's what


Congress was doing.  Secondly, Congress required the tribe


to own and control gaming operations.  And third, Congress


limited the revenues that the tribe gets from the gaming

operation to be used essentially for the welfare of the

QUESTION:  How is that different from any


foreign country that wholly owns a corporation engaged in


-- in business?  For any foreign country, when it owns


such a corporation, all the revenue, all the profits go to


the treasury of the foreign country to be used for the


public benefit.  At least where that is the case, I think


that the sovereign immunity turns on the nature of the


operation, not on whether the revenues go to the benefit


of the people of the country.


MR. CHAMBERS:  But, Justice Breyer, there of


course the country, the legislature, or the government of


that country could decide what to do with its revenues.


QUESTION: 


And they're all for -- well, what is

percent and the revenues and profits from that shipping


business go entirely to health care, parks, other things


for the people of Finland.  Now, what's the difference


between our Finnish shipping line and the casino here?


MR. CHAMBERS:  There are two differences,


Justice Breyer.


First, the Finnish government, if it wanted to

could decide to invest the proceeds of the shipping line


in the U.S. stock market.  The tribe cannot do that.  The


tribe is constrained by Congress to use the revenues


essentially for governmental purposes or for charitable


donations or a couple of other purposes.  But it's not --


it's like a State lottery I suppose, although even there


the State legislature could decide to use the State


lottery for some other purpose.


The second distinction really was I think


pointed out in -- in Justice Souter's question to -- I


forget whether it was to Mr. Kirby or Ms. McDowell.  But


-- but Congress has enacted the Foreign Sovereign


Immunities Act which provides that a commercial enterprise


of a foreign nation operating in the United States is


stripped of its sovereign immunity.


Congress has never done that for a tribe, and


it's very important to note that while sovereign immunity


in the tribal context is a common law doctrine developed


by this Court, it has been adopted by Congress.  Most


importantly, in the Indian Self-Determination Act of


1975 --


QUESTION:  Why aren't you relying on Kiowa


County?  Because that was as commercial as a deal could be


and the Court said no sovereign immunity.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Justice Ginsburg, as you pointed

out, there was a dissent there, but a difference in Kiowa


County is that you had a tribe engaged in the commercial


operation outside the reservation.  That's not so here. 


This is entirely on the reservation.  It's a tribe --


QUESTION:  That's a fortiori for you I would


think.  I would think that the difference in Kiowa is --


is -- it seems to me one -- one might say when the money


is coming -- when money is sought that comes out of the


tribal treasury, we're not -- we're not willing to take


into account the commercial nature of the enterprise. 


It's still coming out of the tribal treasury.


But this is quite a different matter.  Nothing


comes out of the tribal treasury.  And you're -- you're


just seeking documents that belong to the commercial


enterprise essentially. 


I -- I don't know that Kiowa 

necessarily covers this case.


MR. CHAMBERS:  I hope I can persuade you that it


does, Justice Scalia, that -- that -- the sovereign


immunity basically covers funds and property and the


operation of a tribal or any government, whether it's the


Federal Government, a State government, or a tribal


government.  And it protects that categorically from


judicial process of a non-superior sovereign.


Here the tribe is not subordinate to the State


of California.  The tribe is subordinate to the United

States and the county is subordinate to the State of


California.  But the tribe is not subordinate to


California.  So the tribe's policy cannot be displaced by


California when it's operating its own government.


Now, this could apply to any record of the


tribe, and -- and the tribe operates, as I said, health


care programs, educational programs.  All -- virtually all


Indian tribes do this today, and it's --


QUESTION:  The tribe is subordinate to this --


to this extent, that the laws of the State of California


can be enforced under -- under section 280.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Justice --


QUESTION:  Under law 280.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Justice Kennedy, Public Law 280


confers criminal jurisdiction on California on offenses by 

or against Indians.  That's the language of Public Law


280.  It does not apply to tribes.  The Court held in the


Bryan v. Itasca County case that Public Law 280 does not


apply to tribes, and in the second Three Affiliated Tribes


decision, the Court said that Public Law 280 does not


waive tribal immunity or interfere with tribal rights of


self-governance.  So -- so Public Law 280 -- and the State


doesn't claim -- I'm sorry -- the county doesn't claim


that the State has any jurisdiction over the tribe under


Public Law 280.

 That proceeds really to another reason why the


-- why the warrant is not good here under Federal law.


QUESTION:  Well, but it -- but it has


jurisdiction over individuals who by hypothesis either in 


this case or some hypothetical case might be given --


might be being -- being sheltered by the tribe.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Well, Justice Kennedy, the tribe


isn't sheltering anybody.  This tribe wouldn't shelter


anybody and -- and tribes don't do that.


QUESTION:  Well, why didn't the tribe --


QUESTION:  We're -- we're talking about


hypothetical instances --


MR. CHAMBERS:  Okay.


QUESTION:  -- as to how this -- as to how this


rule that you advocate would apply.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Justice Kennedy, I think how it


should apply is that the rule should encourage cooperative


intergovernmental agreements between tribes and counties,


and that is in fact what happens all over Indian


reservations today, that --


QUESTION:  Well, then why didn't it happen on


your side?


I would like to ask a question of the same


nature that Justice O'Connor asked the county.  These were


employees of the casino.  They had twice received notices


39

from the county saying, here's the payroll thing, what it


says you've got, and here is the welfare payment you


received.  Would you please reconcile these?  And the


employees didn't respond, didn't respond twice.  And so


the county comes to the employer, the casino, and says,


help us out.  These people -- I guess we could lock them


up, but we would prefer just to have you give us the


records that will enable us to determine whether there was


welfare cheating.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Justice Ginsburg, the tribe tried


to avoid this confrontation.  First, the tribe did get a


letter asking for information about three employees


without any specification of why.  The tribe responded


that its policies do not allow a disclosure of employee


information without the consent of the employees.  Then,


without any further notice, the county came to the tribe


with armed officers and insisted on seeing the records.


Now, the reason that -- I mean, the tribe has


security officers in the casino.  They came in a private


part of the casino.  But obviously the tribe doesn't want


that kind of confrontation.  They told the officers where


the records were.  The officers went with deadbolt cutters


into the tribe's building, cut the locks, and seized the


records.


QUESTION:  Are you saying the tribe did not know

that this investigation pertained to welfare fraud?


MR. CHAMBERS:  I believe that is correct at the


time that the search warrant was executed, Justice


Ginsburg.


Now, the tribe took that hit basically.  I mean,


the tribe didn't do anything.  They approached the


district attorney.  They said we don't want to have this


kind of thing happening again and offered to work it out


by accepting simply a copy of the last page of the --


California law requires a welfare applicant to sign an


acknowledgement that employers can turn records over to


the county investigating welfare fraud.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kirby said there was some Federal


regulation that blocked that and then Ms. McDowell told us


that there is no such regulation.


MR. CHAMBERS:  I think Ms. McDowell is right,


Justice Ginsburg.  But -- but I guess one would have to


look at the regulation, and I'm sure the Court will.


QUESTION:  All right.  So what's your suggestion


on this point?  That -- it seems to me that what we have


is an instance where perhaps both sides feel the other was


being very unreasonable, but something that should have


been worked out.  And -- and so because you couldn't work


it out, one way to work it out would be get the Federal


Government involved, but it couldn't be worked out.

 So now we're in a position of either having to


say no matter how unreasonable the tribe is in stopping


the State from getting evidence of a serious crime, well,


that's -- the tribe wins, or saying no matter how


unreasonable the State is in trying to interfere with the


activities of the tribe, they win.


Now, to me quite honestly, neither of those


solutions is satisfactory.  Do we have to choose the one


or the other?


MR. CHAMBERS:  I think that you have to choose a


-- a solution that respects the tribe's operation as a


government.  The tribe --


QUESTION:  If I have to choose, why wouldn't I


just say, if I'm trying to look for a compromise that


preserves the essence of it, very well, if I have to 

choose between two imaginary, unreasonable warring


parties, I will say that where it's commercial, the tribe


loses; where it's noncommercial, the tribe wins.  What's


wrong with that, which is where we started?


MR. CHAMBERS:  Well, what's wrong with that here


is we don't have imaginary parties.  We have real parties


here.


QUESTION:  No.  I understand that.


MR. CHAMBERS:  I understand your hypothetical


and I -- I don't want to say it's not this case.  I know

I'm not supposed to say that.


But I -- but I think that -- that the -- I mean,


here what you have is a tribe that tried to work it out. 


The tribe was willing and is willing to sign an


intergovernmental law enforcement agreement with the


county.


Tribes and counties do this all over the


country.  You know this, for example, from the amicus


brief filed by four States on behalf of the tribe in this


case, four States that have two-thirds of the Indian


reservation trust lands in the country in their borders


and the majority of Indians who live on reservations


within their borders.  Those States say that they work it


out between tribes and counties, tribes and States. 


Tribes have agreements all over the country with counties 

about domesticating search warrants, about extradition --


QUESTION:  Those -- those agreements may be


prompted by at least the uncertainty of what would happen


if they didn't make an agreement.  I mean, we don't know


that those agreements aren't prompted in part by the


uncertainty as to whether, if there were not an agreement,


the State couldn't come in anyway.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Well, Justice Scalia, I -- I


think that ascribes -- tribes do try to operate -- tribes


have a very strong interest in law enforcement too.  And

-- and there were plenty of alternatives here available to


the county.  The county could have gone and gotten a


search warrant against the individuals.  That -- those are


the people they had to prove had the intent to defraud


them anyway.


QUESTION:  But the individuals don't have the


records.  The -- the tribe does have the payroll records.


MR. CHAMBERS:  They would presumably, Justice


Ginsburg, I think have their bank accounts or -- or


cancelled checks or -- or other information.


QUESTION:  Suppose the question were the casino


didn't file whatever was required, the State -- whatever


payroll reports it was required to report to the State. 


So it's the tribe's default.  And the State now wants to


enforce the requirement that -- that all employers in the 

State file certain records about their employees.  Could


the State, which could go after any other operation that


fails to file required papers, go after the tribe?


MR. CHAMBERS:  Justice Ginsburg, the tribe is


required under its compact with the State of California to


file certain information because the tribe, for example,


participates --


QUESTION:  Yes, and if it doesn't -- doesn't --


MR. CHAMBERS:  If it doesn't, there are dispute


resolution mechanisms in the compact and there's a waiver

of tribal sovereign immunity for the enforcement of those


dispute resolution provisions.  So the answer to the


question in -- in that situation is that the State could


get that information.


But here the tribe has filed all the things it's


required under that compact to file with the State --


QUESTION:  May I ask kind of a background


question?  Because I'm really not sure of the answer.


Supposing a tort was committed within the casino


by one non-Indian against another non-Indian.  Where would


the recovery be allowed for that tort?  Could they sue in


an Indian court or State court, and what law would apply?


MR. CHAMBERS:  Justice Stevens, in that case


they would sue in State court because the State would have


jurisdiction over a civil action, even actually in a 

Public Law 280 State between an Indian and an Indian.


QUESTION:  Suppose there was a tort committed by


a casino employee against a patron.  Would the State have


jurisdiction over that suit?


MR. CHAMBERS:  The State would have jurisdiction


over that suit, Justice Stevens, unless the nature of


the --


QUESTION:  Well, could the -- could the litigant


in that suit get discovery from the tribe in that suit --


MR. CHAMBERS:  I was going to say --

 QUESTION:  -- in State court?


MR. CHAMBERS:  They could not get discovery to


the extent that it would intrude on essential governmental


functions of the tribe because that would be --


QUESTION:  Well, the very records that were


involved in this case -- some reason they had to identify


the particular person in the casino who was responsible


for the tort and you have to look at employment records to


find out.  Could they get that in a civil suit in State


court, do you think?


MR. CHAMBERS:  No -- no, they could not without


the tribe's consent, Justice Stevens.  But in the ordinary


course of business, if the tribe understood the nature and


need of the issue, why, almost surely it would comply with


a -- with a request like that.  But --


QUESTION:  You -- you say essential government


records, but these are basically commercial records, are


they not?


MR. CHAMBERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, I see I


haven't persuaded you.  I -- I think they are given the


nature of Congress' oversight and limitations Congress has


put on the operation of this facility and -- and all


tribal gaming facilities.  So this isn't just any tribal


business.  This is a business that's operated under pretty


strict guidelines by Congress for it to be owned and

operated by the tribe.


QUESTION:  Well, if the tribe were operating a


trading post, would it be different?


MR. CHAMBERS:  It could well be different,


Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist.


QUESTION:  Mr. Chambers, you -- the tribe filed


this suit under section 1983.  Is that correct?


MR. CHAMBERS:  It filed it under several --


under 1331 and 1983, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  And one of the questions we have to


answer is whether the tribe is a person under section


1983.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Well, if you -- yes, if the Court


decides that --


QUESTION: 


And I -- I would appreciate it if you 

would address that point because the interpretive


presumption is that the tribe, as a sovereign, which


you're so strongly urging here, is not a person under


section 1983.  Why should we recognize that it's covered


as a person under section 1983?


MR. CHAMBERS:  Justice O'Connor, you should do


so because -- because section 1983 is a broad remedial


statute for violations of Federal rights by States.


QUESTION:  Well, does that mean we should just


go wild construing it for that reason?

QUESTION:  I don't think we will.


(Laughter.)


MR. CHAMBERS:  No, but -- but --


QUESTION:  But it doesn't include States?


MR. CHAMBERS:  No, it doesn't, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  Why would it include the tribe?


QUESTION:  And it doesn't -- it doesn't include


foreign governments.  We said a couple of years ago


Paraguay couldn't bring a 1983 suit.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Yes, you did.  You did in the


context of a pretty late capital punishment --


QUESTION:  No, but I mean --


MR. CHAMBERS: 


-- interception by Paraguay. 

QUESTION:  No.  Sure, it was -- it was late in


the day for capital punishment.  We were deciding a -- a


question of -- of the meaning of section 1983, and I don't


know why that isn't good for your case too.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Justice Souter, it's not good


because there wasn't a history in 1871 of States impacting


negatively on States' Federal rights or on the Federal


rights of foreign states and there was in the case of


Indian tribes.  This Court had decided in 1867 two cases


cited in our brief involving the Kansas Indians and the

New York Indians, and the Court had decided the Cherokee


cases about 30 years before where there were serious


intrusions on tribes' Federal rights by States.


So Congress, when it enacted section 1983, was


not only presumptively aware of those, but in the 1870


committee report relied on by the Government, by the


Senate Judiciary Committee, specifically makes reference


to the Kansas Indian case when it's considering whether


Indians are citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment and


when they're not.


QUESTION:  But -- but you agree, I think, that


the tribe is not suable.  Under -- as a defendant, the


tribe is not amenable to 1983 as a defendant.


MR. CHAMBERS:  That -- that is correct, Justice


Ginsburg. 


But, for example, in the antitrust cases, 

you've held that States can sue as plaintiffs.  You've


held that foreign nations can sue as plaintiffs.  They


can't be sued as defendants under antitrust statutes.  And


I think in the Vermont Natural Resources Agency case on


the False Claim Act, you decided that while a State could


not be sued as a defendant under the False Claim Act, that


it wouldn't necessarily preclude it from suing as a


plaintiff.


QUESTION:  Mr. Chambers, I thought your -- your


first position on this issue was that it was not raised

below.  You raised that in your brief in opposition to the


petition.  Are you abandoning that now?


MR. CHAMBERS:  No, I'm not, Justice Scalia.  I'm


trying to answer the question --


QUESTION:  No, I understand that.  But you --


but -- but you didn't mention a thing about it, and it was


in your brief in opposition to the petition.  It was also


in your brief.  You claim that the 1983 issue was not


raised below.


MR. CHAMBERS:  And -- and should have been if


it's going to be pressed to this Court.  I -- I do agree


with that, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  Then what is county's jurisdictional


basis?  And don't tell me 1331 because it has to arise


under some law other than 1331.


MR. CHAMBERS:  I'm not going to tell you 1331.


QUESTION:  I don't mean the counties.  I mean


the tribe.


MR. CHAMBERS:  No, no.  It arises under Federal


common law when sovereign immunity or the right to self-


government is being pleaded.  And that's --


QUESTION:  And your -- and your best citation


for that proposition?


MR. CHAMBERS:  Two cases, Justice Kennedy:  the


National Farmers Union v. Crow Tribe and the second Oneida

case, both in 1985.


QUESTION:  So is the injunctive relief -- I


looked at the declaratory relief in the complaint and it


didn't seem really directly on point.  The -- the request


for declaratory relief had to do with the Gaming Act, law


280, compacts, et cetera.  So they didn't seem really to


raise the question we now have.  Then there's a section on


damages, which is 1983, and then some requests for


injunctive relief.


MR. CHAMBERS:  Justice Breyer, the -- the first


count in the complaint did raise the right of self-


governance.


QUESTION:  Not the first request for relief. 


The requests for relief -- there are five, and the first


two have to do with the declaratory judgment. 

I think


they're not right on this point, but --


MR. CHAMBERS:  Okay.  Well, I -- I think at


least the -- the count did do that and sovereign immunity


was pled in the complaint.


And then also, the preemptions -- Supremacy


Clause issue that Ms. McDowell was mentioning in the


Golden State Transit, I think, dissent by Justice Kennedy


cites Gibbons v. Ogden and the Cooley case v. the Port of


Philadelphia, going back into the 19th century for the


proposition --

 QUESTION:  Those came up out of State courts,

that -- yes, there wasn't Federal question jurisdiction in


that part of -- of the 19th century.


QUESTION:  So what -- the Federal question


jurisdiction you're saying is Federal common law. 


Anything else?


MR. CHAMBERS:  Well, I certainly think in


footnote 27 of our brief, we cited a number of Indian


cases, the Chickasaw case, the Sac and Fox case, New


Mexico Apache Tribe v. Mescalero, where the Court had


entertained similar claims under 1331.


We're only seeking here prospective injunctive


and declaratory relief against the county, and we only 

brought the action when they threatened the second search


and seizure.  We didn't do anything with the -- with the


first intrusion.  So -- so I would rely on -- on -- I


mean, on -- on the number of cases where you have allowed


tribes to bring preemption type claims against States


without relying on section 1983, though -- though we do


believe the compensatory damages are appropriate under


section 1983 also.


If there are no further questions, thank you,


Mr. Chief Justice.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Chambers.


Mr. Kirby, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KIRBY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. KIRBY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


I would like to address very briefly the flip


side, if you will, of the categorical rule being proposed


by the tribe and the problems with that.  And that flip


side involves not the police power of the State, which we


have already talked about, but the constitutional rights


of a defendant who is faced with criminal prosecution in a


State court when that defendant feels there is exculpatory


evidence in the possession of the tribe.  For instance, it


may be a video surveillance of the parking lot or whatnot


that shows perhaps a self-defense defense for this 

particular person.


Under the tribe's rule --


QUESTION:  It's odd for you to be raising a


tribal member as a defendant when you have potential


tribal members here who might be subject to suit.  You


seem a strange champion for such people.


MR. KIRBY:  It doesn't necessarily need to be a


tribal member who might be a criminal defendant, Justice


Ginsburg.  It could be anyone, a non-tribal member or even


a patron, who feels that there is exculpatory evidence

that the tribe possesses.  And under the Sixth Amendment,


that person has the right to have the State issue


compulsory process to obtain that exculpatory evidence.


Under the tribe's rule that's being proposed,


the tribe would have the ability to trump the Sixth


Amendment right of the accused in that situation and not


produce the exculpatory evidence.  The tribe would also


have the right to trump the Fourteenth Amendment rights to


a fair trial of that particular person.  And that's the


flip side of the categorical rule that's being proposed


and why we believe it's another reason it should not be


adopted by this Court.


With regard to the 1983 action, I would like to


say that not only is the tribe not a person within the


meaning of the statute and the interpretive presumption 

that this Court has set forth in, I believe, the Vermont


Agency it was acknowledged.  But also the right that the


tribe is asserting, the right to self-governance, is not a


Federal statutory right and it's not a constitutional


right, and as such, it cannot support a 1983 action.  And


that is another reason why 1983 provides no relief for the


tribe in this case.


In -- in closing, I would like to say that this


case does not implicate traditional sovereign immunity


which is sovereign immunity from civil suit.  And there

was a question raised with regard to that, I believe by


Justice Scalia, pointing out that the tribe's treasury is


not at issue here.  It's not at stake here.  What we're


dealing with is process, in this case the criminal process


of the court.  And that's a totally different situation.


This Court has never addressed criminal process


as being subject to tribal immunity.  All of this Court's


decisions have addressed the tribe's immunity to civil


lawsuit.  That is not what we have here.  The doctrine of


tribal immunity should not be extended in this case to


include criminal process for the reasons that we have set


forth.


While there may not be any wholly satisfactory


result, Justice Breyer, we believe that our position is


the best position. 


Even if one has to choose between 

either of the two categorical approaches, simply even


looking at the rights of an accused and compulsory


process, that should mitigate toward the county's position


here.  We've also suggested a procedure, as presented by


Justice White in Brendale, as being a potential resolution


of this problem, maintaining the dignity of the tribe and


also allowing the State to exercise its police power and


protect its citizens as it investigates and prosecutes


crime.


If there are no further questions --
