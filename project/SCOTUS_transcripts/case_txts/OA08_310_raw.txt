 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument this morning in Case 08-310, Polar Tankers v. 
City of Valdez.

 Mr. Rothfeld.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice 

and may it please the Court:

 The Valdez vessel tax violates the 

Constitution's Tonnage Clause because it operates as a 
charge on a privilege of trading in the port of Valdez, 
and that tax is apportioned in a way that is guaranteed 
to tax extraterritorial values and values that do not 
have a connection to the city.  That violates the Due 
Process and Commerce Clauses.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's not often that we 

have disagreements as to the basic facts.  The red brief 
says that the tax in question constitutes 11 percent of 
the tax base, and you talk about that in the reply 
brief.  Can you spend just a little bit of time at the 
outset telling us your views of this tax?  And although 
it's the Respondent's statement and not yours, do you 
think 11 percent of the tax base means 11 percent of

what's collected under this tax or under all taxes 
imposed by City of Valdez?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think that it means 

all taxes that are imposed not only by the City of 
Valdez, but they are including taxes imposed by the 
State of Alaska that are collected by the City of 
Valdez.  The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In which case, that seems 

really quite irrelevant.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That is our position.  We 

think that's absolutely right.  I think it is useful to 
focus on the nature of this tax.  It is a tax that is 
directed exclusively at vessels and not on all vessels. 
It's -- by exempting small boats and all boats that are 
engaged in commercial fishing and all boats that dock 
exclusively at city-owned harbors.  This is a tax, a 
property -- it's calls a property tax, but it's a tax 
that falls only on vessels and is directed at those 
vessels, that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, some -- some of those 
vessels, I take it, are taxed under other statutes.  Is 
that correct?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I think -- I think not.  I 

think that -- so far as Valdez is concerned, the vessels 
we are talking about are subject simply to this property

tax.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, do you -- do you take 

the position -- let's say that if the State of Alaska 
taxed all the other property you had mentioned except 
for the tankers and the city taxed the tankers, that 
that would by definition be discriminatory tax and/or on 
some other basis violate the Tonnage Clause?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, that -- that would be 

quite a different situation than what we have here. 
Here, the city --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, the reason I raised 

it was that -- in -- in your response to my first 
question, you said, well, you didn't think the city was 
taxing these other -- these other pieces of property, 
and I'm -- I'm not sure why that is significant.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, there are -- there's a 
huge universe of personal property that could be taxed 
in the City of Valdez.  Valdez has the authority to tax 
all of this property except for a discrete category of 
oil and gas property that is subject to taxation by the 
State.  So Valdez can tax all the ordinary kinds of 
personal property -- movable property, personalty --
that any jurisdiction can tax.  They can tax cars and 
trucks and moving vans and refrigerators and jewelry. 
Of all those innumerable things that they could tax,

they have chosen to tax a single item.  They have chosen 
to tax vessels and, as I said, not all vessels.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but you -- you want us 

to ignore the -- the State tax.  Do you really want us 
to do that?  I mean, it would be the easiest thing in 
the world for the State of Alaska, instead of imposing 
it at the State level, to authorize the municipality to 
do it.  I don't want this case to come back here for a 
second time.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now -- now that the 

municipality is imposing the taxes that the State used 
to impose, don't you think you have to count both of 
them?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I don't think so.  The 

State of Alaska treats oil and gas property as --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You are going to get a 

fragile judgment if -- if we go on those grounds.  All 
it takes is a modification of the -- of the legislation.
 MR. ROTHFELD:  Not so, Your Honor, because 

State of Alaska takes very seriously it's stewardship of 
oil and gas property.  That is something of tremendous 
fiscal importance to the State of Alaska.  I think that 
there is little practical risk that the State is going 
to assign the right to tax that property.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  How about the risk in the 
other direction, that the State will simply take over 
this tax and remit the proceeds to the city?  Would the 
result on your view be the same if it did that?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  The result in my view would 

be the same, but that would be a different and more 
difficult case.  Here, focus on what Valdez is doing: 
It is -- it has the authority, as I said, to tax the 
universe of personalty in the City of Valdez.  It has 
chosen to tax only particular types of vessels that are 
used in the export of oil.  Imagine, though --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There are other vessels, 
too.  It's the -- it's the oil tankers, and there are a 
few other vessels that were included?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Including a -- a cruise 

ship is covered.  I --

MR. ROTHFELD:  There is -- there is one 

cruise ship, Your Honor, that was caught up in the net 
in the first year the tax was imposed.  Otherwise the 
tax falls exclusively on what vessels that are involved 
in the export of oil -- principally tankers, also 
service vessels.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why does that -- why 

does that matter?  I mean, do you concede that if this 
tax were in some sense nondiscriminatory, you would

lose?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  No, I think that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why are we having 

all this talk about -- in other words, you think if 
there was a tonnage tax applicable to everything -- you 
know, your pickup truck holds two tons; it has got to 
pay a certain amount or whatever.  Then do you lose or 
win?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  If a -- if a tonnage tax --
look at what the tonnage tax was initially designed to 
do.  The Framers chose the term "duty of tonnage" 
because at the time -- the time this clause was it was 
written in the late 18th century, tonnage was the 
ordinary way of valuing the value of a ship and the 
ordinary way of imposing tax on a ship.

 If -- if the City of Valdez were to impose a 

property tax measured by tonnage on everything -- on 
vans and trucks and refrigerators and ships -- that 
would be a difficult case for us.  But, obviously, it 
hasn't done that.  It has not imposed a tonnage tax or 
and it has not imposed a property tax on any other type 
of property except particular types of vessels.

 I think you apply the duck test:  It looks 

like a duck --

MR. ROTHFELD:  -- it quacks like a duck --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.  I think you're 

giving up an awful lot.  I mean, what if the Framers --
couldn't they be have been more concerned about making 
sure that there is a free flow of commerce, that ships 
go, and the fact that everything is taxed would be less 
of a concern to them?  But you're -- you're willing to 
say that if it's nondiscriminatory, even if you would 
call it a "tonnage tax," you lose?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I was using a 
response to the previous question, and actually they 
were imposing a property tax and they were measuring it 
in an unusual sort of way.  And the Court has said that 
if there's a generally applicable property tax which 
happens to fall on vessels, the reality of that tax is 
that it is a tax on property and not a tax on vessels.
 But here we have quite the opposite.  Here 

we have tax that falls only on vessels as cargo --
vessels.  And you're quite right:  The Framers were 
concerned with the free movement of commerce.  The 
Tonnage Clause was designed to close the loophole that 
was thought to be left by the Import-Export Clause, 
which bars the taxation of imports and exports.  Taxing 
vessels would be a way of circumventing that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let's -- let's assume that

you're -- that a given tanker came into the harbor at 
Valdez on one occasion and one occasion only.  Would the 
City of Valdez, under its own statutes, by the terms of 
its own ordinance, tax that ship?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  It would, indeed, because the 
city in its code creating the tax conclusively presumed 
that a vessel was subject to the tax so long as it takes 
on cargo worth a million dollars over the course of a 
year.  Oil tankers --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, let me -- let me just 
change the question then.  If -- if it came in and sort 
of took half a tankful that didn't reach the point of a 
million dollars' value, there would be no tax then.  Is 
that correct?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, it would have to take a 

lot less than half a tankful.  I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Whatever it would take to 

get it under the minimum.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Yes.  If -- if it were not --
if it visited the port of Valdez once and took on less 
than a million dollars and never came back to the port 
of Valdez --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  Under the old 

tonnage laws, wouldn't that ship in the 18th century 
have been taxed?

MR. ROTHFELD:  I think that they --

jurisdictions impose all kinds of different variations 
of tonnage duties.  And as the Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, the -- the point that 
I am getting to is -- and I'd -- I'd like you to address 
this -- one of the arguments on the other side is that 
one reason this should not be treated as a tonnage tax 
is that it relies upon the concept of a tax situs.  And 
the -- the implication is that not every ship that comes 
into the harbor is going to be subject to the tax; 
whereas, under the old tonnage laws, any ship that came 
in would be.  And what is -- what is your response to 
that argument?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, two responses.  First, 

I think it is not the case that under the old tonnage 
laws necessarily every ship was subject to tax.  Ships 
could be subject depending upon how -- how large they 
were, and some ships could be exempted.  So I think it's 
not implicit in -- in the nature of a tonnage duty that 
it applies to every ship that -- that enters the harbor.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Where do we -- where do we 

look to find this out?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  One would have to look at the 

practice in the 18th and 19th centuries.  And some of 
the Court's decisions --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Do you know of any source 
that we could look at to support the proposition that 
you just made?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I can't point you to any 
authority directly addressing the point, but I can point 
you to the general treatment of what a tonnage duty is. 
I mean, it's a duty which is imposed on vessels on the 
basis of tonnage.  It -- it does not have to be imposed 
on every vessel that enters the harbor.  But I think 
probably the more important response to your question is 
the reality of this tax.

 Valdez knew what it was doing.  It wanted to 

target -- it was commendably candid in saying what it 
was doing.  It wanted to target the vessels that were 
engaged in the transport of oil.  It knows how big oil 
tankers are.  It knows that the tankers are always full. 
When they come in, they take a full load of oil.  That's 
-- that is the whole point of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you don't -- you 

don't suggest that it matters, right?  You -- you have 
talked to some extent in the briefs about the bad --
evil motive.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  No, I --

going to suggest that the same tax could be valid or

invalid depending on why it was enacted.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  No, I -- I don't, but I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  May I ask one other 

question before you leave this, which is where Justice 
Kennedy started?  Suppose a State says:  In our State, 
we want to tax all oil and gas property, and here's how 
we do it.  We assess the value of all oil and gas 
property, ships and everything else included.  Then we 
impose a tax of 20 mills per dollar of assessed value, 
something like that, on all of it.

 Now, the State will collect all of it, and 

we make one exception.  We define which property the 
State will directly get the money from, and then the 
city can do the rest, if it wants.  Now, here's what we 
do with the State money.  We give it to the city.  So if 
the city wants to, it can put the same tax on that 
little bit of property left over, which is a subcategory 
of oil and gas property.  And by the way, the name of 
that little bit of property left over is called "a 
ship."

 Now, is that a tonnage tax, and is that what 

Alaska has done here?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  If I understand the example, 
that -- that might be a tonnage tax, depending upon the

JUSTICE BREYER:  I described to you the 

entire tax.  We know no more about it.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, if -- if it's a tax on 
oil and gas property, and that is the definition of the 
tax and it happens to fall on vessels as part of the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  The way it does is just as 
I said.  And maybe I was -- it was too much for you to 
take in.  So the point is that it's a tax on oil and gas 
property.  That's Code section 1.  Code section 2 is 
defined subcategories -- (a), (b), (c), (d, (e), (f) --
all of that.  Code 3 says (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e). 
The -- the State government collects and remits it to 
the city.  (G), the city can assess the same tax if it 
wishes.  It doesn't have to -- and keep the money.  (G) 
is ships.

 And the reason I have asked that question is 
I read something from a -- Alaska Department of Economic 
and Community Development which suggested to me that 
that is Alaska's tax.  I might have that wrong.  I just 
read a sentence or two, and maybe I am wrong that that 
is Alaska's tax, and --

MR. ROTHFELD:  Yes, and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But if it's Alaska's tax --

It's a -- it's a tax on all oil and gas property, and 
all they do is they let the city collect some of that if 
they want, and they collect the rest of it and give it 
to the city.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, what's -- what's wrong 
with what's going on here and -- and I think this is an 
answer to your question -- the City of Valdez has the 
authority to tax an entire -- as I said, the entire 
universe of personalty.  And -- and as -- as you 
described it, the City of Valdez also can impose a tax, 
although it doesn't have to, on -- on vessels.  And the 
city has chosen to single out vessels out of all the 
types of property that it could tax, and it imposes a 
tax on them called a property tax.

 The reality of it is that it's a tax on 

vessels.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What I'd like to know is: 
Do you think what I said was a misdescription?  What's 
worrying me about this aspect of this case is a possible 
need to send it back to find out what Alaska's tax 
system is.  Now -- now, if what I just said is a -- is a 
correct description approximately and if the other side 
thinks it is, too, then at least I -- I know how to go 
about deciding it.  And if I don't, I don't know quite 
what to do.

MR. ROTHFELD:  My -- my understanding of how 

the tax system works is that this -- this is a State 
level tax.  Alaska determines what are subject to tax, 
determines the items of property that are subject to 
tax.  It determines which of these vessels are subject 
to -- to the Alaska tax.  It then allows the City of 
Valdez to collect the tax and to use the tax, but it is 
a tax imposed by law by the State of Alaska.

 Valdez has no discretion to tax things that 
are not oil and gas property, that are not taxed by the 
-- by -- subject to the tax at the State level by the 
State.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As you understand it, with 

reference to the tax base referred to in the red brief 
at page 14 where it says it's 11 percent of the tax 
base, is that tax base all city-imposed?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  No.  My -- my understanding 
of what they are referring to is that this is -- Alaska 
tax oil and gas property, including the Alaska oil 
pipeline and the oil terminal in the City of Valdez, 
which are enormously valuable pieces of property.  So I 
think that -- that we are sort of talking apples and 
oranges here.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  If it's a -- a literal duty 
imposed on the -- the cubic capacity of the ship, it --
it's difficult to see how that could really be imposed 
in terms -- on every other item of property.  I suppose 
if the -- if the --

there's some fight about that, obviously.  There --
there is no fight about the fact that this tax is based 
upon how long the ship remains in port, right?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many days.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  How many days it 

remains in port.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, there are two of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which means, the argument 
could go that this is obviously a -- a tax for the use 
of the port.  And that's exactly what the Tonnage Clause 
was directed against, preventing Philadelphia and New 
York from taxing the consumers in New Jersey by imposing 
taxes on ships that bring in goods.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I agree entirely with 

that.  The -- the effect of this tax is to tax 
essentially the charge for trading in the Port of 
Valdez, and that is exactly what the Framers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you don't dispute 

that in light of the benefits provided by Valdez to the 
shipowners, that they could be a legitimate tax on these 
vessels?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That is -- that is absolutely 

right.  There -- there --

what tax authority you think Valdez has?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  There are two ways that 

Valdez could go about taxing these vessels.  It could 
impose a user fee, and the Court has recognized in its 
Tonnage Clause decisions that even a -- a tax on cubic 
capacity, a tax on weight, would be fine if that is a 
user fee which is designed to provide -- pay for 
services that are provided specifically to vessels 
roughly equivalent to the value of the services 
provided.  So that is one way Valdez could do it.

 A second way they could do it is to impose a 

nondiscriminatory property tax.  If they imposed a tax 
on the citizenry of Valdez affecting some broad array of 
personal property, that would impose the kind of 
political constraints that would discourage, you know, 
abusive export of the city's tax burden, which is just 
what the Framers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How much property -- you 
said if they -- if they taxed all moveables, that would 
be okay.  Could they have some exemptions and still --

MR. ROTHFELD:  It -- it may -- I -- I 

suppose the test would be if it's predominantly focused 
on vessels, that would be unconstitutional.  This case 
doesn't provide an opportunity to -- to explore exactly 
how far that goes because this is, as I say, the purest

case of a tax, property tax, all the property tax, which 
applies only to vessels.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you don't think a daily 

-- a daily charge on vessels for remaining in port 
violates the Tonnage Clause?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  It would violate the Tonnage 

Clause.

that?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is this anything else than 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I agree with you, 

Justice Scalia, that however ports, States, or cities go 
about trying to impose a tax on vessels for the -- I'm 
calling it the privilege of trading in the port, as 
distinct from the user fee I discussed with 
Justice Ginsburg, that would be an unconstitutional 
tonnage duty.  That's what the Court has said --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What about a --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was going to say, 

even if it's a flat fee?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  According --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Every vessel has to 

pay, you know, $1,000.

Clause.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Rothfeld, can I ask 

you a question, just focusing on the Tonnage Clause, not 
the elements of discrimination?  If you assume that the 
Tonnage Clause was designed to protect New Jersey from 
being exploited by New York and perhaps other States 
because they don't have their own ports, why does that 
rationale have any application to this case, because the 
only State ships oil out of Alaska is Alaska?  So there 
is no other State like New Jersey who could be harmed by 
the Tonnage Clause.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, if the recipients of 

the property are -- Valdez is taking it -- this is 
really --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  What State is being 

discriminated against in the scenario we have before us 
today?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  All of the States that are 

using the oil shipped through Valdez are paying --
ultimately paying this tax.  I mean, this is what the 
Framers were concerned about.  The -- the danger that --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  But you are saying it's an 

unduly onerous burden on the oil companies and their 
tankers, and they only ship oil out of Alaska.

Constitution, as with the Import-Export Clause, was that 
States with favorable port facilities were going to be 
imposing burdens by taking advantage of their favorable 
geography to impose burdens that are going to be felt by 
the other States.  That is exactly what Valdez has done.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not felt by the other 

States, felt by the consumers in other States. 
Ultimately, it's not going to be the oil companies that 
pay this tax; it's going to be purchasers of oil.
 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that's right.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  All of whom are going to be 

outside of Alaska, since this oil is leaving Alaska, 
right?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that is exactly 

right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a neat tax, you know, 

get somebody else to pay your taxes.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that is precisely 

right, and that's just what the Framers were concerned 
with, the Tonnage Clause in the Constitution.

 If -- if I may, I will move to the 

apportionment issue in the case.  I don't want -- I 
don't want to -- to leave behind -- the Court had 
questioned on the Tonnage Clause.

a -- maybe this doesn't matter.  I have seen the 
capacity of cargo planes described in terms of tonnage. 
Does this clause apply to those?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that is an 

interesting question.  It -- it was written to apply to 
ships simply because in the late 18th century, the only 
way of moving substantial amounts of cargo was by -- was 
by vessel.  And I imagine that if the Framers had in 
mind airplanes and railroads --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It is that we have 

an evolving Constitution, after all.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I will leave that one alone, 

Your Honor.

 (Laughter.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then, do you 
know -- it's not an entirely frivolous point.  I mean, 
do you know if States, localities where airports are 
located charge things that might be viewed as Tonnage 
Clauses on airplanes?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I don't know a definitive 

answer to that.  Generally speaking, airplanes and other 
types of property are -- are subjected to property taxes 
on the value, and not on capacity.  Although, as I said, 
the Framers, I don't think, cared about capacity as 
such.  They just cared about charges that were being

imposed upon vessels that were going to be passed 
through, as Justice Scalia said, to the ultimate 
purchasers or sellers of the imports and exports that 
were -- that were in the vessel.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I thought you said earlier 
or implied earlier that we couldn't draw a distinction, 
really, between capacity and value because tonnage in 
the 18th century was simply a proxy for the -- for the 
value of the ship?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that's right.  And I 

don't -- I hope I didn't --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  So a value tax is going to 

run into the same problem --

MR. ROTHFELD:  That's right.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- as a tonnage tax.
 MR. ROTHFELD:  That's right.  And as for the 
Chief Justice's question, application to moving vans or 
cargo planes, the Court did not consider that because 
this is the purest case.  It is within the plain terms 
of the Tonnage Clause, the historical application of the 
Tonnage Clause.  It's the clear intent of the Framers in 
writing the Tonnage Clause.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If the amount of the tax 

were measured by the number of sailors who were going to 
come ashore and the number of days they would be ashore,

and a small port city wanted to recover the costs that 
they impose on municipal services, would that be --
would that be subject to the same flaw that you see 
here?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  It -- it would, although it 
might be possible for the city to impose some type of 
user fee calibrated in that direction.  The Court's 
cases refer to -- the tonnage principle applies to the 
number of passengers that the ship may carry or the 
number of crew members on the ship.  If -- if it's not a 
proxy for particular expenses that are imposed on the 
jurisdiction, as this concededly is not, that was not 
what the -- Valdez intent in passing this tax, then it 
would be problematic under the Tonnage Clause.

 But I say again we have here the clearest, 
easiest case under the Tonnage Clause.  It's a -- it is 
a tax that is designed exclusively of vessels that trade 
in the harbor.

 On the apportionment question -- and I don't 

want to give short shrift to that, because the Valdez 
tax is apportioned in a way that is guaranteed to impose 
a tax on values that are not present in the 
jurisdiction -- Polar's tankers spend only a small part 
of the year in Valdez.  They spend the rest of the time 
on the high seas or in other ports either unloading oil

or in dry dock.  And, therefore, everybody agrees the 
tax has to be apportioned.

 The ordinary way and the way that this Court 

has approved the apportionment of a tax on physical 
property -- physical property is straightforward.  You 
would put in the numerator of the tax the number of days 
with the number of miles they spent in or number of 
miles traveled in the taxing jurisdiction; you put in 
the denominator 365, the total number of miles traveled 
everywhere.  You multiply that fraction times the value 
of the property.

 And so, for example, if I have a 

transcontinental passenger train moving from New York to 
California that spends 20 percent of its time in 
New York, New York could tax 20 percent of the value of 
the train.

 That is not how Valdez does it.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's -- the train 
is going to be some place throughout its trip, unlike 
the ship that's going to be on the high seas.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That's right.  But the -- the 

Valdez theory does not depend upon the taxation, the 
taxability of a ship somewhere else.  Valdez is simply 
saying that we are entitled to tax, you know, not on the 
basis of physical presence in this jurisdiction at all.

We are entitled to tax on some concept of where 
productive commercial activity takes place.

 And so it does not apportion on the basis of 
amount of time spent in the jurisdiction over the course 
of the year, which is the approach that the Court 
ordinarily has used.  The Valdez approach is precisely 
the equivalent of New York saying, in my 
transcontinental train example, we are going to take 
into account only time spent in New York and Los Angeles 
loading and unloading passengers, and we are going to 
discount all of the rest of the year, all the rest of 
the time that the train has spent moving the passengers 
from place to place.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who can tax for the time 

on the high seas?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  This Court has held in the 

Central Railroad case that the taxing authority goes to 
the domicile.  That for time --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the domicile here is 

Texas.  Is that right?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  The commercial domicile is 

Texas.  The corporation is incorporated in Delaware.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In either case, no ships 

berth in either Delaware or Texas.  Is that right?

ships berth in Texas.  The ship do not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the home port might 

have had in the old days the notion that's really where 
the vessel is berthed.  But, nowadays, Delaware has very 
little to do with where the vessels are berthing and 
where they are being serviced?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  If I may, Your Honor, I'll --

I'll answer that question and sit down to reserve a 
little bit of time.  You are right as to the physical 
location of the ship, but the -- the jurisdiction, the 
authority of a non-domicile to tax has always been 
constrained by -- under the Due Process Clause -- by the 
physical location of the property.

 And so, the fact that the property may or 
may not be subject to tax somewhere else does not give 
Valdez additional authority to tax property that's not 
present there.

 Now, the Court has said that the domicile, 

whether or not the property is present, is providing 
benefits to the owner of the property, and it's those 
benefits that justify the imposition of the tax for 
periods when it is not in any tax situs subject to tax 
by anybody else.

 And if I may, Your Honor, I will reserve.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In the Wheeling case, this Court said it is 

too well settled to question the taxes upon vessels 
based upon their value as property do not violate the 
Tonnage Clause.  In fact, no ad valorem property tax has 
ever been held to violate the Tonnage Clause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it says "vessels of 
all kinds are liable to taxation as property in the same 
manner as other personal property."

 MR. OLSON:  Yes, Justice Kennedy, precisely 
in the same manner as other ad valorem property taxes. 
Now let me answer the question that both you and Justice 
Breyer particularly addressed, which was the oil and --
and gas tax imposed with respect to much of the property 
in Valdez.  Valdez taxes homes, it taxes oil and gas 
property, it taxes barges, it taxes cruises, it taxes 
all sorts of things just like every other jurisdiction 
does.  The oil and gas tax that you ask about, 
Justice Kennedy, and you did, too, Justice Breyer, is 
imposed -- and there is no need to remand this case to 
address this.  It's in Section 43.56 of the Alaska Code.

The State of Alaska imposes an oil and gas tax on 
property used in the oil and gas extraction, 
transportation, et cetera, business, but it also 
authorizes a city under Section 43.56 and 29.45 -- the 
City of Valdez may impose that tax as well.  It's two 
mils, it's just like every other tax that is imposed in 
Valdez.  These are taxes imposed on the same basis.  If 
the city imposes the tax, which the City of Valdez does, 
then the tax by the State -- that tax paid to Valdez is 
a direct credit, dollar for dollar credit, for the tax 
that would otherwise have to go to the State.

 So, in the first place, I think would it 

make no difference as suggested by your question, 
Justice Breyer, whether it was the State or the city 
that imposed the tax.  The constitutional provision 
refers to states.  States divide up their taxing 
authorities in various different ways.  The fact is that 
the State of Alaska through the City of Valdez imposes a 
tax on lots of different things.

 This oil and gas tax that we are talking 

about consists of 60 to 70 percent of the revenue base 
of taxation for the City of Valdez.  The -- the ship 
tax, the tax on the -- that actually applies to vessels 
which include the tankers, include barges, include a 
cruise ship, includes just Alaska ships and -- and

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not fishing ships, right?
 MR. OLSON:  The fishing --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  None of -- none of Valdez's 

fishermen have to pay this tax at all?

 MR. OLSON:  They don't have to pay this tax, 
Justice Scalia, but they pay other taxes.  There is tax 
on -- on the weight of fish and there is tax on the 
value of fish and there's tax -- there's -- fees, they 
use a different dock and they pay taxes there, to.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your answer it seems 

to me does put the issue squarely before us in the terms 
that the Petitioner has presented, that is to say, sure, 
suppose you tax the vessel and you tax trailers and 
small vessels and a lot of other things, but as to all 
of the latter category, you have -- you have an 
exemption.  So the -- the only people that effectively 
pay the tax are the tankers.
 MR. OLSON:  No.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I thought that that 

was the way the case was presented.

 MR. OLSON:  No.  Well, that is not correct, 
if I understood your -- your statement correctly.  This

people's home in Valdez get taxed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the people's homes 

only if they are affixed to the property and they --
MR. OLSON:  No, that's with respect to 

mobile homes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.
 MR. OLSON:  They are taxed as real property 

when they are affixed in that way.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And nonmobile homes are not 

taxed as real property?

 MR. OLSON:  The tax -- cities may impose 

taxes as real property or -- or personal property, 
Justice Scalia.  Some states will tax mobile homes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, the question is what 

is imposed here?  My understanding from the yellow

factual descriptions, perhaps not in its conclusions 
that it draws?

I've given you --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  See, we have a problem 

with the facts here.  But my understanding of the case, 
and please correct me if I am wrong, is that sure, 
Valdez has tax authority and tax statutes which would

tankers pay this tax.

 MR. OLSON:  The -- there are various taxes 

imposed by Valdez on personal property and real 
property.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was my statement correct?
 MR. OLSON:  Your statement is correct only 
with respect to the ordinance that -- that eliminated 
the exception.  These big ships that impose enormous 
burdens on the municipality, you can only imagine what 
three, four hundred --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's a different 

argument.  Can we just get to --

MR. OLSON:  Yes, I know.  But these ships 

were exempt from taxation in Valdez until the year 1999 
when that ordinance that you are referring to, 
Justice Kennedy, was adopted.  It eliminated --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So was all other personal 

property exempt from taxation, they didn't have a 
personal property tax, right?

 MR. OLSON:  Except -- except, under the --

to the extent that that personal property was covered by 
the oil and gas tax, the provisions that I have referred 
to, Valdez had been imposing that tax.

well.  But there is no constitutional impediment to 
targeting the people of New Jersey through taxing the 
oil equipment.

 MR. OLSON:  If the Wheeling case is correct 

and the other cases that have repeatedly said this, 
there is no constitutional impediment for a city or a 
state to impose a property tax on property being 
used in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But Wheeling -- Wheeling 
was, it was a general property tax.  And as I read the 
case, it said if you are going to tax property, you can 
include vessels.  This statute, and I think the Alaska 
Supreme Court treated it discretely, is a tax on one 
kind of property only, these vessels.  I don't know of 
any other property tax that is confined to just one type 
of property.  Is there another?  Is there a comparable 
tax that is focused on a single category of property?

 MR. OLSON:  There -- well, I -- I think what 
my point here with respect to this, Justice Ginsburg, is 
I don't know the answer specifically to that question, 
but we are looking at what the bundle of taxes that a 
community or a state imposes on property used that 
imposes a burden on the community.  Property is taxed 
for the purpose, so that the property owner will bear 
the burden of the governmental services that a city has

to impose.  It -- there is no constitutional provision

all in one statute, collected -- and there is no 
discrimination --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you can't -- you can't 

make vessels bear the overall burden of municipal 
governance.  You can make them bear the burden of the 
services provided to them in harbor.  But you cannot 
make them the instrument of funding all other municipal 
services.  That's what the Tonnage Clause means.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, I disagree in part with 

what you said, with respect, Justice Scalia; these 
shelves pay 11 percent -- vessels pay 11 percent of the 
revenue base for the city; 11 percent.  This is a city 
of 4,500 people.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How do you define revenue 

base?

 MR. OLSON:  This is the amount of tax 

collected by the City of Valdez with respect to the ad 
valorem taxes in the city, including ships, mobile 
homes, cranes, barges, appliances, real property, and so 
forth.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You are counting the state 

tax as well, right?

 MR. OLSON:  Pardon me.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You are counting the state 

tax on oil equipment?

 MR. OLSON:  I am -- I am saying to you that 

the State imposes a tax but the State specifically 
allows valid to impose that very tax.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That makes matters worse.
 MR. OLSON:  Valdez imposes that tax as a 

part of its total taxation package.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's suppose I accept just 

what Justice Ginsburg said, and said it's a hopeless 
morass if we look at all taxes.  Let's look at this tax. 
This tax you call an ad valorem tax on personal 
property levied by Valdez, and then on page 11 of your 
brief you say that's not just on ships, it's also on 
mobile homes, trailers, recreational vehicles, and 
various types of personal property defined under State 
law as oil and gas property, motor vehicle, machinery, 
supplies and maintenance equipment.

 They come back and they say, as to your 

mobile homes, trailers and recreational vehicles, all 
that's happening there is either you have exempted them 
or they are fixed in place, and they are like real 
property and that's what you are doing.  As to the other 
things, you do not impose a tax on those other things. 
Rather, the State imposes a tax on those other things.

And it may be that you help the State do it by providing 
them with the assessment, and it may be even that you 
could do it, but you haven't; and therefore, the only 
thing you have imposed this tax on are the ships.

 Now I think I have that argument right.  If 

I do, what's the answer to it?

 MR. OLSON:  The answer is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If I don't, what's the 

right argument?

 MR. OLSON:  The answer is Section 43.56 that 
allows -- the State statute may impose that tax you just 
described.  And it -- and section 29.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  May impose doesn't help if 

you don't do it.

 MR. OLSON:  Yes, it does impose it, and 

then, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER:  State imposes it or --
MR. OLSON: -- section 29.45.080 says -- I am 
going to read it exactly; this seems to be an important 
point.  It doesn't seem to me that it ought to make any 
difference from the Tonnage Clause standpoint whether 
it's a tax imposed by the State or a subdivision of the 
State, but this provision specifically says a 
municipality may levy and collect taxes on taxable 
property, taxable under AS 43.  That's the one.  The

State does impose this tax but it also allows the city 
to impose it.

 This city does impose it.  And when it is 
paid, that is a credit against what might otherwise be 
owed to the State.  So the city does impose that tax, it 
does collect that tax, and that tax is not --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait a minute, owed to the 
State for what?  What would be owed to the state?  It's 
still a State tax and they are the collection agent, and 
it's a -- a credit against what they owe for their 
collections, right?

 MR. OLSON:  A municipality may levy and 

collect taxes on property under this section.  The city 
levies and collects those taxes.  Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what's it a credit 
against?  I don't understand what it's a credit against.

 MR. OLSON:  The State also imposes the 
liability.  Any individual community in Alaska may 
impose that tax itself.  If it does -- Valdez does --
then you don't have to pay it to the State, you pay it 
to the city.  So it's a city tax.  Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does the city get a 

credit against?

MR. OLSON:  The taxpayer, once he pays $10 
to the city under this tax, doesn't have to pay $10 to 
the State under this tax because he gets a credit for --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I thought it was the 

city that got the credit --

MR. OLSON:  No, it is the taxpayer that gets 
the credit.  The city levies the tax.  The city collects 
the tax.  And then the taxpayer doesn't have to pay the 
State.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And that happens with all 

these other properties?  That is, in Valdez, you pay the 
city -- you pay the city -- for the -- for the taxes on 
that oil and gas property that isn't shipped?

JUSTICE BREYER:  So they write a check to

 MR. OLSON:  Yes.  Now, it shouldn't matter. 

The Tonnage Clause prohibits States from imposing a 
tonnage tax.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, that's exactly the 
question I wanted to ask you.  Supposing the city did 
not impose any taxes on anybody except the people who 
pay this tax, and that's all.  Would it -- would it be 
constitutional or unconstitutional?

 MR. OLSON:  No, it would not be.  In the 

first place --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  It would not be 

constitutional?

 MR. OLSON:  It would not be -- it would not 

be unconstitutional, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Oh, but then why is the --

what other people pay on other taxes even relevant?

 MR. OLSON:  I don't think it is relevant. 
The nondiscrimination issue has been introduced by the 
Petitioner in this case.  It is not in the Tonnage 
Clause.  It is not in any of the cases decided by this 
Court having to do with the Tonnage Clause, having to do 
with wharfage fees, pilotage fees, other things having 
to do with commercial activity in a --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So we can take as a -- as 

a given for the purpose of analyzing the issue, that 
this tax is either the only tax that's relevant to our 
analysis or that it's so much higher than all the other 
taxes, it should be treated as the functional equivalent 
as the only tax we have to look at?

 MR. OLSON:  I'm saying that it would not 
make any difference if this was the only tax that the 
city imposed unless it was a tonnage tax, and the 
tonnage tax -- this Court has repeatedly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the answer to 

Justice Stevens's question is we can take this case as 
presenting to us the fact that the ships pay more than 
other property?

 MR. OLSON:  No.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you say that doesn't 

make any difference.

 MR. OLSON:  No, the ships do not pay more. 
I don't think it would make any difference if -- if the 
city decided to impose a different rate of tax on motor 
vehicles than it did on homes or -- or vessels, as long 
as it was an ad valorem property tax, and this one is.

 The vessels are not based -- the tax is 
assessed every year on the replacement value of the 
vessels.  A big ship that is worth less money because it

would cost less to replace it, because it doesn't have a 
double hull or a double bottom, will be taxed -- it will 
be taxed greater in proportion to its value.  The value 
imposed is assessed every year.

 There's no challenge here -- it's very 

important to understand that there is no challenge by 
the Petitioners with respect to the valuations placed on 
these ships.  There's no contention that the value 
placed upon these ships by this ad valorem property tax 
is based upon cubic capacity.  They have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is it -- do you -- do 

you contest the point that was made in the reply brief 
that back at the end of the 18th century, tonnage was 
considered a proxy for value, that it was the customary 
mode of measuring the value of a ship?

 MR. OLSON:  I do contest that, 

Justice Ginsburg.  The only citation for that is Justice 
Miller.  Justice Miller is cited for that in a lecture 
that he gave after he left the Court.  He was on the 
court from 1862 to 1890.  He joined the Court in the --
in the Inman case, the Wheeling case, the Parkersburg 
case, and here's the quote from the Inman -- from the 
Clyde Mallory case in 1935, which is quoting the Inman 
case from during that period of time.  "At the time the 
Constitution was adopted, 'tonnage' was a

well-understood commercial term signifying the internal 
capacity of the vessel."  This Court has said that over 
and over again.  In the Wheeling case, when it said --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is -- for a 

commercial vessel, is a rough calculation of how much 
it's worth.

 MR. OLSON:  It is not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The more cargo you can 

carry, the more valuable the commercial ship.
 MR. OLSON:  That is not correct, 

Justice Scalia, and it's -- and it's not correct in this 
case.  Experts put an assessment on these ships based 
upon their replacement value.  It may have -- one factor 
may be how -- how the ship is constructed, whether it 
has a double hull.  These have to be Jones Act-compliant 
ships.  The newer ones are more valuable.  If they move 
faster, they're more valuable.  If they're more 
efficient, they have more value.  One of these ships in 
this case is valued 10 times more as -- higher value --
than a ship that carries more capacity because it's 
newer.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But all you're saying --
MR. OLSON:  And --

there are other factors that -- that preclude using

tonnage simply as a single crude measure.  But isn't it 
fair to say that, other things being equal -- the engine 
capacity, the hull construction, et cetera -- the 
tonnage is a rough measurement of the value of the ship, 
for just the reason that Justice Scalia gave?  It 
determines the amount of cargo the ship can carry, and 
what it can charge for it, and that is capitalized into 
the value of the ship.  Isn't that true?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, if -- if everything else 

was equal, the bigger, the more capacity, the more 
valuable the vessel might be, that's true.  But that --
that is not the case.  Different ships are different 
sizes.  They are made out of different materials.  They 
have different structural capabilities --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So as long as you are 

taxing on the basis of the value of the ship, then you 
have no Tonnage Clause problem.  Is that your -- the 
Tonnage Clause was a specific type of measure, and if 
you're taxing based on the assessed value of the 
property, it isn't a Tonnage Clause.  Is that your --
MR. OLSON:  That is what this Court has 

said.  In the Wheeling case, where we were talking about 
steamships, the Court said that same statement that you 
just made about an ad valorem tax property tax 10 times.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  A porthole tax.  They 

charge for portholes.  Anyone who has a porthole who 
comes into our city pays taxed.  That's not a tonnage 
tax.

 MR. OLSON:  That's not a tonnage tax.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So, in your view, a masked 

tax.

 MR. OLSON:  To the extent that the tax is on 
a vessel as an instrument of commercial conveyance, what 
this Court has said --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, but the porthole tax 

applies, by the way, to that ship's captain who has 
retired, who has built his house with portholes instead 
of windows.

written, the Constitution did not intend to take away 
the power from the States to impose taxes.  The 
provision on the import-export prohibition on the States 
and Tonnage Clause was an instrument to protect 
commerce.  It wasn't an instrument to reduce the power 
of States to impose taxes.  The baseline is States have 
the power to impose taxes unless there's an explicit --
and the court has said narrow -- limitation on that tax 
power in the Constitution.

 Now, what this Court has said over and over 
again, Justice Breyer -- it hasn't had a chance to deal 
with portholes -- but it has had a chance to deal with 
most of these various earlier cases in the -- in the 
1860s and '70s had to do with tax on tonnage.  And there 
was one case where New Orleans levied a tax just for the 
entry and departure of the ship, and the Court said, 
well, that's -- that's a tax on the ship as a -- as a 
commercial instrument of commerce, and that would be 
covered also.  But nothing else has been covered.

 And the Court has gone out of its way to say 

that communities, States, are entitled to tax people 
that possess property within their jurisdiction because

okay, well, then why in the world would the Framers have 
adopted a prohibition on a tonnage tax, if you could 
just say it's a tax on value, which is going to have the 
same impact on commerce?

 MR. OLSON:  Because -- because, if you are 

taxing -- I think that the Court had reasons for the 
conclusion it came to.  What I'm saying is not what I've 
invented; it's what the Court has said repeatedly, that 
because property may be taxed as property because the 
users and owners of property are the source of revenue 
for the communities --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, putting aside 
what the Court has said, I'm looking at what the Framers 
have said.  What good does a tonnage tax prohibition do 
--

MR. OLSON:  It does --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- if you are right?
 MR. OLSON:  It -- if it's -- if it's a State 

using a tax on a vessel qua vessel as an instrument to 
limit commerce, that is something that the Framers did 
not want to do.  They -- they prohibited taxes --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It offended them 

aesthetically?

 (Laughter.)
 MR. OLSON:  No, because -- for --

47 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So all the State has to say 

is we are not -- we're not taxing you qua vessel.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. OLSON:  No, Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, what --
MR. OLSON:  What the Framers were concerned 

about and what I was trying to say in response to the 
Chief Justice's question is that there was a limitation 
on the states' power to tax imports or exports because 
of the fact that that would put the states on the coast 
at an advantage and they would pass those burdens on to 
the inland states.  The Tonnage Clause was put there as 
a specific provision to implement and -- to prevent the 
circumvention of the export/import prohibition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Olson --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  But I suppose you could --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- let me ask you something 

about -- about discrimination.  Let's assume that I 
think it is relevant whether the tax is a discriminatory 
tax, property tax just levied on -- on ships or not.

 If that is my position, why should I count 
as establishing nondiscrimination the fact that Alaska 
or Valdez is also taxing -- most of its other property 
tax revenue comes from taxing oil equipment, right?  And 
the burden of all of that tax, just like the burden of

this vessel tax, is paid by people in New Jersey.  I 
mean, you know, that --

MR. OLSON:  You can --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's getting somebody else 

to bear the burden of your taxation.

 MR. OLSON:  If do it would be --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Taxing that equipment 

raises the price of oil, almost all of which the oil 
goes out of Alaska and is paid for by people in other 
states.  Why should I count that property tax as proving 
that either the State of Alaska or Valdez is not being 
discriminatory?  Just because it -- it can't possibly 
violate the -- the Tonnage Clause doesn't mean that it 
isn't as much discriminatory against other states.

 MR. OLSON:  That then might -- that might be 

a Due Process Clause problem --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I --
MR. OLSON:  But it wouldn't be a Tonnage 
Clause problem.  I would submit, Justice Scalia, you 
would be very upset at the -- at Silicon Valley because 
the property tax imposed on Silicon Valley gets all put 
on those chips that we used in all of these computers, 
and everybody else in the country is using those 
computers, so the property that is taxed in that

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if -- if California 

taxed vessels, I would not allow California to come in 
and say, oh, we are just subjecting them to the same tax 
that our own citizens are subjected to.

 MR. OLSON:  And Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wouldn't let them point 

to the Silicon Valley tax.

 MR. OLSON:  You would -- you would, I 

submit, then, say that vessels are exempt from property 
tax.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That may be the only way 
they can accomplish what they want to.  Because as the 
Chief Justice's question suggested a moment ago, if in 
the 18th century the port of Boston said, "We are not 
going to charge tonnage anymore.  We are simply going to 
tax on the value of the ship," that is going to have 
exactly the same effect that a tonnage tax would have. 
So maybe exemption is the only way it can be done.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, it's going to require an 
amendment to the Constitution because what the Framers 
talked about was a Tonnage Clause, and they were talking 
about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Olson, we -- we have 

said it's not just tonnage.  It said that the clause 
bars states, we said, from imposing a charge even if not 
measured by a vessel's tonnage, for the privilege of 
entering, trading in or lying in a port.  So we have 
ruled out the position that it's got to be an 
old-fashioned tonnage charge, and can't be based on the 
assessed value of the property.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, I guess I have to resort 
to the fact that every time this Court has considered 
it, or at least in almost every case, the Court has gone 
out of its way to say, they were not intending to 
prohibit states from taxing the value of property, if 
it's an ad valorem tax.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but in all of 

those cases the vessels were being taxed as one item of 
property in a general moveable property, personal 
property tax.  I asked you before, I think, is there any 
other tax like this, that -- an ad valorem tax that is 
applied to one single category of property?

 MR. OLSON:  If this -- this is an ad valorem 

tax, it has various different statutes and ordinances 
that it comes from, but there's ad valorem taxes in 
Valdez across the board for all kinds of property.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, there -- no.  This

imposes taxes on property based upon their value.  This 
was a separate ordinance that decided to remove an 
exemption that had existed for 27 years --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was the other, the 
State taxes were no part of the Alaska Supreme Court's 
decision in this case.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, I think what we are 
talking about is whether or not this community can 
impose a tax on the people that own property in this 
community.  There's no denial that there is a property 
tax situs here.  The average length of the time in port 
of these ships was 45 days.  The entire fleet has a tax 
situs in Valdez.  So this property, like other property 
in the same manner, is being taxed by the City of 
Valdez.

 The Wheeling case was a case a little bit 
like this in the sense that it was West Virginia that 
passed a statute that allowed Wheeling to impose the tax 
on steam ships.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And on what else?  In 

that -- in that tax that was before the port.  What else

did Wheeling tax?

 MR. OLSON:  The only thing that the Court 

talked about because it was -- like this it was an 
as-applied case, the taxpayer was wanting a refund from 
the taxes and the taxpayer owned steam ships that --
that went back and forth from Wheeling.  And the Court 
talked about the fact that this wasn't a Tonnage Clause, 
this was a state-authorized municipal -

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about the Greer?  You 

haven't mentioned that.  Greer in Norris v. City of 
Boston.  Where he says the -- you know what it says; 
it's on the front page of their brief.  All right.  That 
seemed to me to say, don't interpret the Tonnage Clause 
to apply to tonnage.  Interpret it, same thing as if it 
was mass, it's mariners, power of the steam engine, 
number of passengers, the master or owner of the 
vessel -- all those fall within the Tonnage Clause. 
That's what the paragraph seems to say.

 MR. OLSON:  And what -- what the thrust of 
the overall bulk of the cases including the language by 
this Court repeatedly is that property taxation based 
upon the value of property, not imposing a value -- not 
imposing a tax on the ship.  There are various ways I 
suppose one could say that every time a ship enters a 
harbor without developing a tax situs -- I think Justice

Alito's question focused on that -- this is not --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask a --
MR. OLSON:  You don't get charged a fee for 

entering the port.  Or one of those cases when --
imposes a tax because -- it called it a wharfage tax, 
but you didn't have to touch the wharf to pay the tax.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you a 

question that I don't' think has come up, but I just 
wondered if anybody has argued this.  The duty of 
tonnage, it seems to me, might refer to the cargo rather 
than the ship.  So if the ship made ten voyages it might 
have ten times the tonnage of another vessel of exactly 
the same value.  Has anybody argued that that's what the 
Tonnage Clause refers to?

 MR. OLSON:  I think -- I think you're 

correct, Justice Stevens, that what the Framers were 
concerned about was a substitute for -- export or import 
tax by taxing what was in the ship, and that tonnage 
referred to that, but it wasn't the value of the vessel 
itself because the Court -- the Framers wouldn't have 
wanted to take away the power of the states to tax 
commercial activity using property in their communities 
in the same manner that they taxed other property.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If that's all it applied 

to, then the wharfage tax would have been perfectly

okay.  You can't say that was --

MR. OLSON:  The wharfage tax -- the wharfage 
tax has been upheld by this Court frequently.  The only 
reason why it was struck down in that case is that you 
didn't have to put into the wharf.  So the Court knew it 
wasn't really a wharfage tax, but if it was really a 
wharfage tax, the Court has upheld it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Rothfeld, you have three minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Your Honor.  A 

couple of quick points.  First on this confusing 
question of what the State of Alaska does in the nature 
of its tax.  Mr. Olson began by -- by saying the State 
of Alaska imposes this tax through the City of Valdez. 
That is right.  It is a tax imposed by the State of 
Alaska that is collected by the City of Valdez.  If the 
city did not collect the tax, it would go directly to 
the State of Alaska.  It is an Alaska tax.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where -- where does 
the money go?  If the City of Valdez collects it, where 
does it go?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  If the city collects it, it

keeps it, but it has been authorized to do that by the 
State.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then I think 

we ought to regard it as a city tax, not a State tax.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Uh --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They collect it; 

they keep it; that sounds like a city tax.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  But it -- it is imposed by 
the State.  The State decides decide what subject it 
has.  It identifies the property that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I suppose the 

State can regulate what cities and municipalities and 
counties can do throughout the State.  That doesn't make 
everything those cities and counties do the actions of 
the State.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that's true, but this 
particular tax is a tax that is imposed by the State at 
the State level.  It -- it's notable that Valdez has 
never before, until we reached this Court, said that 
this is a -- that it is taxing oil and gas property. 
The property is subject to tax by the State.  The State 
authorizes Valdez to collect the tax, but it is imposed 
by the tax -- the city -- the State determines which 
items are subject to tax.  So this is out of Valdez's 
discretion.  Valdez chose to tax only particular types

of personal property, and that is vessels.

 Second, on the question of what the Tonnage 
Clause was designed to do and -- and the Wheeling case, 
Wheeling says that a property tax is okay when the tax 
is imposed on vessels the same as other property owned 
by its citizens.  That is not what is going on here. 
Contemporaneous understanding of the rule at the time 
was that taxes that singled out vessels were 
unconstitutional.  We cite authority for this 
proposition in our reply brief.

 To -- to address Justice Ginsburg's question 
as to whether there were other taxes like this, we have 
not found any other tax anywhere that has been imposed 
singling out vessels as -- for -- for property taxation. 
Either now or in the past, we have not found any case 
addressing that, not only not in this Court, but in any 
other court.

 And then finally --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  What about the -- the 

broader tax situation at the -- at the -- in -- in 1789? 
Did -- did ports have sources of -- or exercise the 
authority at that time to tax property generally, e.g., 
real estate in the city to support the activities of the 
ports, or were they dependent solely upon things like 
import-export taxes, et cetera?

MR. ROTHFELD:  My -- my understanding is 

that real estate certainly was subject to tax and that 
ports would have the authority to tax other types of 
property.  Vessels were set aside as a particular item 
by the Tonnage Clause.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  So -- so that the argument 
they are taxing other things, therefore it's okay to tax 
this, would have been an argument just as potent in the 
18th century or impotent, as the case may be, as it is 
now?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That's right.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. ROTHFELD:  And so setting aside vessels 
in a -- in a unique category when other things could be 
taxed would have been problematic --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How -- under your 

view, how is a city supposed to impose a property tax on 
a vessel?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  It -- it should impose a tax 
by imposing a tax on personal property generally.  And 
if it does, it would fall on vessels as items of 
personal property.  It -- it is significant -- well, if 
I may, Your Honor, just to finish, what Valdez has -- it 
could have taxed all of that types of -- or it could 
have taxed particular types of it.  But it has seized on

only one particular type of personal property to be 
subject to taxation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so you think 

we should resolve the tax by seeing how generally 
applicable property taxes are in Valdez?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I think it's an easy 

case when, as in this situation, there is only one item 
of property that is taxed, and that's a vessel.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but your --

your brother suggests that other items of property are 
taxed under other provisions of the tax ordinance.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Again, Valdez does not.  The 
State does.  Valdez does not.  And so I think that there 
is no need for the Court to go beyond and decide how 
broadly applicable -- as I suggested earlier, our test 
would be predominantly on vessels it is 
unconstitutional, and that clearly is the case here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Your Honor.
