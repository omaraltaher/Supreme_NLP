CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

  

 

 

 

 

argument first this morning in Case 16-466, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v. The Superior Court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California. 

            

Mr. Katyal. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The California Supreme Court ruled that 

 

 

 

 

 

hundreds of plaintiffs who were not prescribed a drug in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California, who did not take it in California, who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lacked any injury in California, and who had no other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection to California could sue in California. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The court reasoned there was a sliding scale 

   

 

 

 

 

 

whereby the defendant's other conduct with other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Californians could establish specific jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

Those concepts have some footing in the law, but that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footing is limited to general jurisdiction, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lacking here, and this Court has never permitted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific jurisdiction in such circumstances, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumably why Respondents don't bother defending the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California Supreme Court.

Instead, they mint a whole new test, never 

   

 

 

 

 

 

4 

before seen by any court whereby an ad hoc 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness inquiry with any number of undetermined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balancing factors will create jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You've conceded that 

  

 

 

 

there's fair play and substantial justice.  That almost, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not quite, perhaps, takes away the due process argument, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which basically has to be the argument that you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making here. 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Kennedy, I don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

that's actually what we conceded.  What we did say is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the reasonability -- reasonableness inquiry is with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to the third kind of safety valve factor.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't make the argument with respect to the third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prong, but we absolutely did make the argument that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction here was unreasonable below. 

 

 

 

 

            

At pages 4 and 18 in the court of -- in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California Supreme Court brief, we made very clear.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said it would, quote, "Offend basic notions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

federalism and fairness" at page 4.  At page 18, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, "Instead of achieving jurisdictional fairness, 

 

 

 

 

 

their rule would distribute their burden of defending 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mass torts in a lopsided way." 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  But we absolutely did.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is it 

  

 

 

 

unreasonable --

 

5 

            

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  How to --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- to have -- yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Now, you're not fighting that pending 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction permits a court to take multiple claims of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages nationwide, or even worldwide, and even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unrelated causes of action and bring them to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, correct, by one plaintiff?  So you're not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- you're not claiming that that offends due process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Pending jurisdiction, at least 

  

 

 

 

 

personal jurisdiction, is only applied in some Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts by dint of common law.  We're absolutely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fighting.  I mean, it's not the law in any court -- any 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State court anywhere that pendent personal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do you deal -- so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're saying that pendent jurisdiction for claims that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in some way, are connected violates due process? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  We're saying --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you go any further? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  We're saying that there has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a causation between the underlying cause of action. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  With every single 

  

 

 

 

individual action.  And so you're destroying pendent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction on every level.

MR. KATYAL:  We're not destroying it.  There 

  

  

 

 

 

 

is no -- there is no pendent jurisdiction for State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims as it exists right now.  This Court has said time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and again, starting with International Shoe, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant locus of analysis, Justice Sotomayor --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's assuming I buy 

   

  

 

 

your argument. 

 

            

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  -- is always --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's put it aside. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  But I'm just saying that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been the law, and always is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But your position right 

  

 

 

 

 

now is that in no suit will one court, State court, ever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be able to hear the entire controversy between a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff and a defendant. 

   

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Oh, definitely not.  Heavens be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that is not our position at all, Justice Sotomayor.  So, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example, every place in which there was general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, you can have that court hear it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Only when that's general 

  

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

MR. KATYAL:  No, not -- again, that's one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

place.  So Delaware, for example, here.  But there's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

also the ability for specific jurisdiction in places in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the underlying activity was launched.  So here

they have --

 

 

            

            

marketing --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If --

  

 

 

7 

MR. KATYAL:  -- for example, effective 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If, for example, the 

  

 

 

 

 

drugs that -- that everyone bought all over the country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was manufactured in one place, even though it wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the place of business or the place of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporation? 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Right.  It may be that that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

enough for specific jurisdiction, depending on what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying claim is.  Exactly, Justice Ginsburg. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The question here is can they glom on to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

180 million pills that had -- that Bristol-Myers has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sold in California?  That's the --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's efficient about 

  

 

 

 

having piecemeal litigations across the country? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  For years we've been 

  

 

 

 

 

approving pendent jurisdiction, or at least not taking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any case that disturbed it, and there are cases in which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've just assumed it.  What's the efficiency there? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And what's the reasonableness there? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So -- so first of all, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor, I disagree with the premise.  I don't know

this Court has ever accepted the idea of pendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction of State court claims that are -- are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without causality.  Indeed, our brief, at pages 19 to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21, explains every precedent of this Court winds up on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

the causality principle.  And your most reason decisions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Goodyear and Daimler, I think, make this very clear. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, with respect to the reasonability --

 

 

 

 

 

 

the efficiency, I think the first thing to say is their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule doesn't create any efficiency at all.  That is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just take a look at the facts of this case.  Even after 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the California Supreme Court ruled, you already -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still have action going on in New York, coordinated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions, you have law of MDL in New Jersey, and you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuits in Delaware.  Petition Appendix page 72 says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

before you had lawsuits in Arizona, Illinois, Hawaii --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If -- if this suit went 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward just with the California plaintiffs and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bristol-Myers did not prevail, would there be issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclusion in other States, assuming that judgment was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final? 

            

MR. KATYAL:  I don't think so.  And -- and 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

our brief -- our reply brief does -- you know, cites a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bunch of, you know, literature on this that, basically, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there's no much divergence in the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes of action, collateral estoppel just doesn't work.

they -- if they all allege the same basic flaw in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug, the -- the drug was defective but cost, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined in suit number 1, I take it that would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue preclusion. 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  But the -- the problem is there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are so many different substantive standards as a matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of actual reality as opposed to, you know, kind of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory about deceptive marketing or something.  They do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

differ so much from State to State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let's -- let's 

  

 

 

 

 

assume that New York and California are basically the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same, the facts are basically the same.  If there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California judgment that's valid, I assume, the 

   

 

 

 

 

plaintiff is going to argue for issue preclusion.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- it seems to me that actually helps you because --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it shows that this rule that you're proposing is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not so inefficient as the Respondent would say. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. 

  

 

 

 

There's no -- there's no -- you know, we can, of course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waive -- waive that and -- and seek collateral estoppel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But to go back to --

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Katyal, could we go back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a form of Justice Kennedy's first question, which is, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just could you explain what defendant's interests are at

due process inquiry.  So what is the unfairness here, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given that there is another suit that's going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going forward in California, and what Mr. Goldstein 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants is just for additional claims of the exact same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind to be joined to that suit? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Exactly.  So there's three 

  

  

 

 

 

values this Court's isolated:  Federalism, 

  

 

 

 

predictability, and fairness.  The fact that we --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So could we just start with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fairness? 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely.  So the fairness 

  

  

 

 

 

concern -- and this is going to take me about 45 seconds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to walk through the lifecycle of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You've timed it. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  -- but -- I have. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. KATYAL:  And -- but our view is to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirm Bristol-Myers in -- to affirm the judgment below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or to accept his theory is going to be -- you know, be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complex, it's going to be inefficient and unfair, and do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something this Court has never blessed before internally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Bristol-Myers didn't open itself up to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the first thing that would happen in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

lawsuit is a determination of choice of laws he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledges.  There are 575 out-of-State plaintiffs 

  

 

 

 

 

from 33 States.  So the California court's going to have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

to first figure that out. 

 

 

 

 

            

Second, it's then going to have to apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California procedure to all of these cases, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

markedly different than the procedure in the places in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which Bristol-Myers sold the drugs as to which caused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the underlying injury. 

 

 

            

So, for example, California has different 

 

 

 

 

 

rules about summary judgment.  It's really hard to get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summary judgment, very easy to go to trial.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also -- they don't have a Daubert rule, so they have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very lenient permissive testimony with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experts.  That isn't something Bristol-Myers bought into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

when they sold, for example, a drug in Ohio to an Ohio 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff. 

            

Then you get to the trial.  And this is, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, the most important part, because their reply --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because their brief points it out as, oh, this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

efficient and it's coordinating all of these actions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Take a look at Joint Appendix page 74, which is their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury trial demand.  This is not one jury trial.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are seeking 661 individual jury trials, and in each of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those jury trials, the court is going to have to

determine a whole variety of things which are going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

diverge from case to case; things about different rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about -- legally, different States have different rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on contributory negligence, they ever different rules on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the learned intermediary doctrine, which is a critical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine in failure to warn cases.  Some States don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have it at all.  Others restrict it in all sorts of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various ways.  Could be fact determinations about what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is specific injury or not.  And that is why this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Don't all 

  

  

 

 

 

those issues have to be decided in the 600 individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases anyhow? 

 

            

            

MR. KATYAL:  Oh, they do. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The question is what's 

  

 

 

 

 

the unfairness of coordinating the common questions in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one place when there is so much overlap in the essence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the claim, which is false marketing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So -- so, Justice Sotomayor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

first of all, I don't think that they would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coordinated.  They would be decided at individual trial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by trial.  I don't think they would be coordinated.  To 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the extent you wanted coordination, the Federal system, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously, has a way to do that from the perspective

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it seems you're 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

conflating two things, Mr. Katyal.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

individual -- a lot of individual California claims can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

be joined, and then we can have an argument about what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should probably be joined and what can go off 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individually.  But -- but that's a different question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

than the question in this case, which is, why is it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfair to glom on Texas claims and New York claims to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the California claims, once we already have a mass 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

action which will have multiple injury trials? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So -- and the reasons are both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure and substance.  So procedurally, you'll be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

playing by different rules than what the defendant has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted, and this Court's always said, one of the goals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in specific jurisdiction litigation is to make sure and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tee up to businesses, particularly small businesses, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like the Plack brief points out, look, if you are enter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a jurisdiction, here's what you're going to face.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bristol-Myers doesn't disagree.  When they sold the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

180 million pills in California, they opened themselves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up to the jurisdiction for those pills.  The question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, can the folks from the 33 other States sue on that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then it does create substantive unfairness for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different juries.  There's all sorts of things that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen.

And if I could, Justice Kagan, just return 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to the first two values.  Predictability is really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

important.  There are 4 million people who take Plavix 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in America.  If you accept their rule, it's not as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

if they have to sue in California.  Each of those people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can sue in any of the 50 States.  That's 200 million 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibilities.  That is the --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you already know because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this is a nationwide marketing that you do, nationwide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug, you already know that you're subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction in any of the 50 States and have to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepared to confront jurisdiction in any of the 50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

MR. KATYAL:  But -- but Justice Kagan, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

critically, we know that we confronted with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each individual State's procedure and substance.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't accept the idea that plaintiffs can play by least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common denominator rules and file Ohio claims in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California or Alaska. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess what I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

saying is that I -- the unfairness aspect of this is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what I really want to drive at, because predictability 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just honestly doesn't seem like what's at issue here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given that you know it's perfectly predictable to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation in any of the 50 States.

So the question is, why is it unfair to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

more litigation than you would in one of those States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than another? 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Kagan, it's not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

numbers game.  It's not the amount of litigation.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way in which the litigation unfolds, both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedurally and substantively.  And this Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

specific jurisdiction jurisprudence has always tried to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say to defendants, look, we want you to know the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences that follow when you enter into a new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

market.  And when Bristol-Myers, for example, sells in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ohio to an Ohio plaintiff, I don't think they sit there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and think, oh, that allows me to be sued in California. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Of course they can be sued in --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could you make this as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concrete as you can for me?  And I -- I'm assuming that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your interests are the flip side to the plaintiffs' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests.  So why is it that a person would choose to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue in California, and why is it that Bristol-Squibb 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not want more suits than necessary to happen in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California? 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, I suppose one thing, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs only have one thing to think about, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's kind of jurisdictionally advantageous for them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either procedurally or substantively.  You know, for us,

when we're, for example, thinking about where to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

incorporate and set up our principal place of operations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in New Jersey.  I mean, nobody could say New Jersey is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of a defendant-friendly State.  It's done so for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

all sorts of reasons about employment and things like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

And so I do think this Court has identified 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a concern in this area about forum shopping.  We do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that concern exist -- exists here.  But I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that kind of underlying this is a notion about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

predictability and what their rule does, fairness, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then federalism, which I'd like to get to, because this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's identified it, starting in World-Wide 

 

 

 

 

 

Volkswagen, as a critical thing. 

   

 

 

            

And the idea that the Ohio plaintiffs -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the State of Ohio can't adjudicate these cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they're grabbed by California is something, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, that this Court hasn't --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess -- I guess I'm --

    

   

 

 

 

 

I'm feeling a little bit stymied here because I thought 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

you were going to come at me with saying, look, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juries in California are different or there's punitive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages in California when there's not someplace else or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the substantive rules might be different.  And I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing any of that.

MR. KATYAL:  All of the above, 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

Justice Kagan.  There's a bunch of stuff wrong with this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All of those things.  Now, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

I'm starting here; this is my problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Before International Shoe, I think basic 

   

 

 

 

rule with qualifications, et cetera, a State is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign and can open its doors to whom it wants.  End 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the matter.  No.  That isn't quite, but basic rule. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now, along comes International Shoe, no, you can't, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it's unfair.  Hence the questions. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Now, if that's what it is, if that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic way to look at it -- and I hear the answers you've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given.  Many, but not all, of those answers I could, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, have said the same thing in respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multidistrict litigation.  And -- and so it sounds to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, if I'm right on that -- which I might not be, you'd 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to say which ones aren't -- that what we need here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a rule.  We need a panel.  We need Congress.  We need 

   

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

the multidistrict panel.  But that isn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution. 

            

And then what I fear is if we say it's the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution, what do we do to either the class actions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or maybe even multidistrict litigation?  I think you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

could solve that problem by putting the jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

transfer our court.  But -- but you see, that's why I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

think, what is it specifically that's special -- sorry, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but --

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So, Justice Breyer, we -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think you should write an opinion for us that doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal with multidistrict litigation or class actions, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's easy to do.  The first thing to do is do what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court did in Omni Capital, footnote 5, and say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal is different than States, that the due process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guaranties apply differently, precisely because --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have no idea how you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

draw that line. 

 

 

            

rivalrous --

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Because there's not 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If it is due process, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

then -- and how do you say that it's not due process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merely because it's Federal? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  For two reasons:  Because it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

not rivalrous jurisdiction, it's not Ohio versus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California and every State in between; and because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole question in due process is minimal contacts, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people are deemed to have minimal contacts with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal government as a sovereign.  That's why this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court has always bracketed --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that is not a

Federal claim in -- that is a State law claim that would

be brought in -- in Federal court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

different? 

            

MR. KATYAL:  But -- but the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why would due process be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KATYAL:  The constitutional rule that 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer was asking would apply differently. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's why this Court's always reserved it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And multidistrict litigation, of course, 

 

 

 

 

operates very differently.  It's only pretrial 

  

 

 

 

 

coordination, it's not trial, and so it's a very, very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different process. 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But could Congress make 

  

 

 

 

 

it for trial?  Right now, the multidistrict litigation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

panels is only for pretrial.  It can be a trial if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone consents.  But absent consent, you have to go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to where you began. 

 

 

 

 

            

But would there be any constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

impediment to having a multidistrict statute amended so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that the -- the forum in which the cases are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consolidated could go on to the merits? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Justice Ginsburg, I certainly 

   

  

 

 

think the Court could write an opinion which says that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is perfectly permissible and still reject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Goldstein's theory 100 percent, which is what this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER 

 

 

 

 

 

           

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

This Court in Goodyear and Daimler rejected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approaches to general jurisdiction that would allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff in one State to sue a national company for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product liability in all of the other 49 States, calling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those approaches exorbitant and unacceptably grasping. 

 

 

 

 

 

The California Supreme Court misunderstood this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions when it allowed that same result under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

label of specific jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

            

As this Court explained in Goodyear, 

 

 

 

 

 

specific jurisdiction lets a State exercise authority 

   

 

 

 

 

over activity within its borders, which it has a strong 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in controlling.  But a State lacks a comparable 

   

   

  

 

 

 

interest in exercising authority over out-of-State 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants for entirely out-of-State conduct. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if this were -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this were a case where the nonresident plaintiffs were

suing Bristol-Myer in California, then everything you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

say follows.  But that's -- no one is urging that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California could assert jurisdiction against 

 

 

 

 

Bristol-Myers on behalf of out-of State plaintiffs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's -- essential to this case is that there be a case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Californians against Bristol-Myers, and this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tagged on to it. 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  That's right, Your Honor.  So I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

agree that the question here is whether the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the out-of State plaintiffs have joined their claims in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a single lawsuit with California plaintiffs makes a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference.  And I don't think that it does, if you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked at the interest that the Court has considered in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its specific and its general jurisdiction decisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because I don't think that California has a greater 

   

   

 

 

 

 

interest in exercising control over the conduct of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out-of-State defendants in another State just because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those claims have been joined with in-State plaintiffs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think the principal reason that 

 

 

 

 

respondents suggest that California does have that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest is an efficiency interest.  But this Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined general jurisdiction in a way that allows 

   

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs to bring their suit together in a single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

forum for efficiency purposes --

There -- there are two defendants here.  McKesson is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

California corporation or principal place.  Is there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

another place where these plaintiffs could sue McKesson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well as Bristol-Myers? 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  So I think it's not -- it's not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear.  We agree that personal jurisdiction is defendant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by defendant.  So there may be some cases -- and this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may be such a case -- in which there's not one place 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where any group of defendants can be joined together. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We think generally, there will be, because if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegation is that two defendants have engaged in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course of conduct together, there's going to be some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place where those defendants engaged in that course of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could the plaintiffs here 

  

 

 

 

 

have filed against McKesson and then, under California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure, added Bristol-Myers as a necessary party? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  I'm not -- I'm not sure as a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of California law.  We don't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Assume California law will 

  

 

 

 

 

have that.  Would that be -- would that be consistent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with due process? 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  No.  We don't think that the --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the procedure that was used would make a difference.  We 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that the problem with McKesson here -- and I think

23 

clear is, is it's not clear what the Respondents are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleging that McKesson did.  They're not alleging that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

McKesson distributed the drugs that plaintiffs received. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If McKesson did, then there would obviously be some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct that occurred in California that was connected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to both plaintiffs that would make a lawsuit --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can we go to the logic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of your position?  Assume a foreign corporation.  Under 

   

  

  

 

 

 

your theory, that foreign corporation might be sued in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the particular State in which an injury occurred.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since it has no home State in the United States, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means that in that situation, there's no place for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs to come together and sue that person; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct? 

            

MS. KOVNER:  I think that it might not be in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States.  There will not be a general 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction location for international defendants --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Products are sold here 

  

 

 

 

 

across the United States.  All the marketing, everything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the same.  The theory is the same.  But because it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a foreign State, there's no one jurisdiction -- a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign company, there's no one jurisdiction in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States now under your theory. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  That's true for some.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is an amicus brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

here that talked about all of the criminal laws that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be subject to questioning under your theory of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of constitutional due process. 

 

 

 

            

What is your response to them?  Is it the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same as Mr. Katyal's?  We'll face that when we get to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it? 

            

MS. KOVNER:  No.  I don't think that the --

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has applied its civil personal jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases in the same way in a criminal context.  The United 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States has a strong sovereign interest in regulating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

certain conduct when it occurs overseas --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If due process says that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you can't hail someone into a court with which they've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had no contacts, how do you justify the many criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes we have -- RICO, CERCLA, there's a whole bunch 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of them -- that permit the joinder of all of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants in one indictment? 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Well, Your Honor, if we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking about criminal statutes, these are statutes that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are based on the idea that this is conduct that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercises some --

 

 

            

component. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All of them have a civil

civil component, I mean, courts have looked to personal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

jurisdiction considerations.  We think if it's a Federal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

statute, the relevant question would be a Fifth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment analysis.  But if you look to the statutes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that Respondent cites, we're talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes that exert some kind of -- that involve conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that exert some kind of effect on US citizens or -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, one thing we 

  

 

 

 

 

haven't talked about, we've talked a fair amount about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairness and predictability, but we haven't talked about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

federalism.  I know Mr. Katyal was trying to get to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  I was hoping you might just give us a couple of 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words about what implications there are for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests, say, of Ohio in administering its own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures with respect to its own citizens for torts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that occur in its own State. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Yes, Your Honor.  So going back 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

to World-Wide Volkswagen and continuing --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Or -- or McIntyre, maybe? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. KOVNER:  Yes, and continuing through 

  

 

 

 

 

McIntyre, this Court has made clear that specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction needs to be defined with -- with an eye to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the view that there are 50 different States, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other States are also going to have an interest in

adjudicating conduct that occurs within their borders. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

So if specific jurisdiction is defined in a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

permissive way that allows States that don't have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong interest in regulating the conduct to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So who -- which State are we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worried about here?  Are we worried about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff's State, or are we worried about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's State? 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  I think there are two States 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that have a very strong interest, at least two States 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have a very strong interest in providing a forum 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

for the conduct at issue here.  It's States where the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs were injured, and States where the defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are at home, because States have an interest in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating the conduct of their --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So on the plaintiff's side, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that seems a pretty attenuated interest, if -- because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually when we say that the State has an interest, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in protecting their own citizens and providing their own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens with a forum.  But here the citizen has decided 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he doesn't want that protection, he wants to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someplace else.  It seems, you know, a little bit weak 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say that the State has a very strong interest in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protecting its own citizen that doesn't want to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there. 

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. KOVNER:  I don't think so at all.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

27 

think, Your Honor, that the State has a strong interest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in regulating the conduct that occurs within its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borders, and defining what's fair with respect to how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that conduct is adjudicated.  That's --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it's also true, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would seem to me, that a State A has a very strong 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

interest in confining State B to State B's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

territorial --

 

            

            

MS. KOVNER:  That's right, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Which doesn't -- that's 

  

 

 

 

 

why due process is the same for Federal and State, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a different set of criteria to which you apply 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  The States are limited in their jurisdiction to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide, the Federal government isn't. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  That's right, Your Honor.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that's exactly what this Court has already said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

World-Wide Volkswagen and Nicastro.  And we think if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court applies that principle here, it counsels strongly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against expanding specific jurisdiction to allow States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reach claims in which they don't have an interest, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it does tend to crowd out the jurisdiction.

mass torts? 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is your solution to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

28 

MS. KOVNER:  So we think there are a couple 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

solutions.  Claims like this, which are, I think, mass 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

tort claims can be brought in a jurisdiction of general 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  They can also be brought in Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts and consolidated for schemes like the MDL scheme. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These are both solutions that provide efficiency.  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of course, Congress can step in, if it sees a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of mass tort that it doesn't -- that it wants to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide an additional forum for.  It's done that for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific kinds of -- for instance, mass accidents.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's an additional vehicle.  There are forums where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims like this can be brought efficiently. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  How, if it's 

  

 

 

 

constitutional? 

            

            

MS. KOVNER:  I'm sorry? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  How?  How?  How can 

  

  

  

 

 

Congress step in if it's constitutional? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Because Congress is acting 

  

 

 

 

 

under the Fifth Amendment.  And as this Court indicated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Nicastro, it's --

 

 

 

            

Fourteenth? 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Fifth is different from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. KOVNER:  Well, it's the -- it's

different in the following sense --

 

 

 

 

 

29 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Isn't that what you write? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. KOVNER:  It's different in the sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that the sovereign is different, and so the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contexts that you're talking about in the Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment are contexts with the national sovereign.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that case, you would look to, does this company have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relevant minimum context to make it fair for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national sovereign --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it's context with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

United States as opposed to an individual State.  So if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- if it's a Federal statute, then that -- and not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hemmed in by State boundaries, it can create a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide claim. 

 

            

MS. KOVNER:  That's right, Your Honor, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the court -- courts of appeals have agreed on this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are, you know, nationwide service of process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions in which Congress has exercised that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  And there's been no disagreement in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of appeals -- courts of appeals, although this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has reserved the issue itself in Omni.  We think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a different sovereign, and so a different kind of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

context that would be --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you say how you would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase the rule that you would like us to apply in this

situation? 

            

MS. KOVNER:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

30 

Court could simply say in this case that for purposes of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific jurisdiction, when we're talking about conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that arises out of -- takes activity within the forum, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there has to be something that's connected to the claim, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some causal connection between the individual claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and the forum, the parties in the forum.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Goldstein. 

  

 

 

 

          

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

            

We believe that four facts make -- are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient to establish specific personal jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case.  If I could just very briefly summarize 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them. 

            

The first is that the defendant engaged in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the systematic and continuous exploitation of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market, California, the forum, with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter that gave rise to the claim, so the sale of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plavix. The second is the case was decided below, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certiorari was granted on the understanding that

litigating here would not place a significant additional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

burden on BMS, it wouldn't be unfair because the claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arise not from parallel activity, but the same activity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by BMS.  It's the same legal theory and the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operative facts. 

 

            

The third is that there is a significant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

governmental interest that is implicated by this case in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the courts are able to bring together a large 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

volume of litigation that would otherwise be atomized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across the States. 

 

 

            

            

            

And the fourth is that there is what --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The States or the State? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That would be atomized 

  

 

 

 

 

across the States. 

 

 

            

My point is that, you know, we have a large 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number of cases about Plavix, and what's happening here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the benefit of the States, this is discussed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Keeton, is to bring the cases together so that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multistate judicial process can operate more 

 

 

 

 

 

efficiently. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's really not 

  

 

 

 

 

possible.  And it would be ideal if we could get all the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plavix plaintiffs together in one forum.  We have no way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of doing that because plaintiffs have many choices.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so some individual plaintiffs chose to hook up with the

California, but there's lots of -- there's one footnote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that says all the cases, some are multidistrict cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

some are multiple plaintiff cases. 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- so whatever we rule in -- in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, there's still going to be a lot of -- a lot of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plavix litigation spread around the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah, Justice Ginsburg, if I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can come back that -- in one second, I -- I think it's a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fair point.  I want to give you my sense of why our rule 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is better with respect to that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And could we have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

fourth of -- I interrupted --

   

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah, exactly right.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

why I just --

   

 

            

first --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I interrupted you at 

    

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, no --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what was the fourth? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.  The fourth is that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

this case has what Justice Breyer, in Nicastro, talked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about as a special feature, and that's McKesson.  What 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

we have here is Bristol-Myers' decision to contract with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a California company to distribute this drug nationally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McKesson distributed 700,000 pills of Plavix outside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California a week, and we think that's quite significant

for multiple reasons.  It is a choice by BMS, a contact 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

33 

that involves California in the nationwide distribution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But not necessarily to all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the plaintiffs here. 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  A -- a couple things 

    

   

  

 

 

about that.  It is impossible to trace a particular pill 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a particular person, because what happens is you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted to a hospital, you're given Plavix, you then go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see your doctor who gives you a sample, and then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prescribes it to you, and then you may be in an assisted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

living facility.  It's not possible for us to track 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly to McKesson. 

 

 

            

My point is simply is that they made a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice to contract with a major national distributor of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the drug located in California, and that has a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant point for California-specific interests in 

 

 

 

 

 

this litigation. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

think Justice Ginsburg's question is still pending. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Excellent.  Thank you. 

  

  

 

 

            

And, Justice Ginsburg, you're quite right 

 

 

 

 

 

that we don't have a perfect solution, but what we can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do is aid the States' judicial systems by allowing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation to be centralized.  You just compare our rule

with theirs.  The upshot of their rule, precisely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

because in multi-defendant mass tort actions, you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a common general jurisdiction, is that there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

going to be a bunch of litigation in Ohio and Nevada and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas and --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's a very 

   

  

 

 

patronizing view of federalism.  California will tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Ohio, oh, don't worry, Ohio, we'll take care of you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's not -- that's -- that's not the idea of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal system.  The Federal system says that States are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited. 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sir, let me just analogize 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this case to Keeton, if I might, because there you have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a very similar situation.  And that is, you have the New 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hampshire State courts -- or a New Hampshire court, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is adjudicating a claim --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There was an injury in New 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hampshire to that plaintiff. 

 

 

 

            

            

here. 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's not present 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is absolutely correct. 

  

 

 

 

 

But what the Court said was that that wasn't the special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

feature of it, and that was that that claim would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise be litigated in the 50 States, and that the

35 

            

McKesson --

 

            

If I could just make the final point about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's peculiar to -- to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

libel claims. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I mean, they -- what are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

they called, the single --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Publication. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Single publication. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, yes. 

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Exactly.  And -- and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that -- that's why, I mean, you've cited Keeton twice, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's cited innumerable times in your brief.  It is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely sui generis in that respect. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I -- it involved the single publication 

 

 

 

 

 

rule, and what that is, it says, this is a restatement, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as to any single publication, only one action for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages can be maintained.  All damages suffered in all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions can be recovered in that one action and a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment for or against the plaintiff upon the merits of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that bars any other action. 

 

 

 

 

            

It's a very, very unique situation that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

that, you know, maps on a position you want to apply 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally.  And -- and it seems to me that that's a real 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

overuse of -- of Keeton. 

 

 

 

 

36 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  If I could just give 

   

  

  

 

 

 

you my thoughts about that. 

 

 

 

 

            

It has never been cited subsequently by --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court has cited Keeton multiple times, never limited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that sense.  And though the single publication rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists in most, not all, States, remember Keeton quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly says it doesn't exist in every State, but all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the claims are allowed in New Hampshire, but it still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to be constitutional, is my point.  And that is, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States can make whatever decisions they like, but Keeton 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes quite clear that each publication is a separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

libel, each arises under each individual State's laws. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

My general point is that there are two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

federalism interests here.  I quite take the point that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

California doesn't have an interest in adjudicating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ohio's claim, and it is territorially limited. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On the other hand, the Court has recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in cases like Keeton that the States do have an interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in trying to make this simpler, not more complicated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, how about the interest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the State that Bristol-Myers resides in?  In other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, they might have an interest in not having their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens hailed into court against their will in another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the country.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah.  I don't think that 

    

  

 

 

 

37 

can be right.  And I would point out that Mr. Katyal and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States agree that specific personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction outside the home forum is entirely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate here.  They just want it to be in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New Jersey. 

 

              

I don't understand how any of their 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments map onto the concession that a New Jersey 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

State court, which is not their home State, could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicate the claims from Ohio, Nevada, and Texas, just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like California here, when all of the same things are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true.  That State is adjudicating a claim from another 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

place. 

            

            

If I could just make the final --

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The obvious is that this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your home State. 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It isn't, though. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But let's imagine it's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

home or whatever, and you say that a business is in that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  You make it -- you -- you do business here, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make things here.  I don't care if you're home or not. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Make things here, do business here, incorporate here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, you can be sued in any State still, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under special jurisdiction, where you cause harm, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't be sued in States where you didn't.  Now,

that, I think, is what -- I think that's what they're 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

saying is the special federalism interest of either the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home State or the State where they did the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturing, or the State where they, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever the other one is where you count as a home 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  That does sound special. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, all I can say is that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in New -- the example of New Jersey and specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, they would be adjudicating the claim of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody who was harmed in Ohio, even though it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their home. 

 

            

But I did really want to focus on the -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special interest that California has here because of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

role of McKesson.  You know, the Court is involved in --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, but, Mr. Goldstein, 

  

 

 

 

 

that's a very fact-specific argument.  And we took this, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I thought, to decide the legal question whether we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some sort of causation requirement or permit this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sliding scale business that California engages in, as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal matter.  And on that, I just wonder if -- if we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

move to this all-things-considered approach, are we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collapsing what had been previously two separate due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process inquiries, one was purposeful availment, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other was fundamental fairness.  And as I hear it, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

really, it all just boils down to fundamental fairness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

And as Judge Silverman said, a length of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

chancellor's foot. 

 

39 

            

So I'm just wondering what happens 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrinally to the first test?  Does it have any bite? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And if it doesn't, does that suggest some problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrinally, formally, with your position? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If I could give you a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

narrower answer and then a bigger picture answer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the narrow answer is that our view of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relatedness inquiry that is articulated in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

International Shoe does require that they engage in what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Keeton and International Shoe refer to as the continuous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and systematic exploitation of the market.  That's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact.  And the relationship has to be that it is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same claim on the same operative facts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

There's no general --

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's like saying, 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Goldstein, that the claim relates to another claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that relates to contacts with the forum.  I mean, I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess I'm -- I'm missing what the relationship is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between an Ohio plaintiff's claim and the defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contacts with the forum that doesn't go through another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, here is how we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand that it would operate, and that is, the

California court is providing a forum to adjudicate a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim about the lawfulness of BMS's design and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturing and distribution of this drug Plavix. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is activity that didn't occur in California.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

That is activity that they quite clearly say happened in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New Jersey. 

 

            

So the California court is going to make an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication of that.  Our point is simply that when the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California court has the unquestioned power to determine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under a legal standard that that was lawful and a set of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts, it's not limited --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I understand that that's 

   

  

 

 

 

your point.  But I guess what I've always thought that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

our personal jurisdiction cases require is somebody to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state in -- state something like this:  The plaintiff's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim relates to or arises out of the defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contacts with the forum State.  So here, Bristol-Myers' 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contacts with California.  And I just want you to tell 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me how an Ohio plaintiff's claim arises out of or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relates to the defendant's contacts with California. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Just it -- it does because why? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It does because the relevant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contact is the nationwide activity.  That has to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct, by the way, because just take a company that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to exploit -- it manufactures something in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

New Jersey, hands it off to a distributor, knowing that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

the distributor will exploit the California market. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The only thing the defendant does is do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something in New Jersey, right?  It's not activity in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California that gives rise to specific jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The California court's jurisdiction attaches to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity outside.  It's the same conduct.  It is not --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let me see if I understand 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that, because you're saying -- usually we say how does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the claim relate to the contacts in a particular State, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say in California.  Here we can't answer that question, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really.  So we say now the contacts in California are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide contacts, and the plaintiff's claim relates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to those nationwide contacts. 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It arises from those same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide contacts.  But I have a second answer --

   

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Those nationwide contacts 

  

 

 

 

being a nationwide advertising campaign, a nationwide 

   

   

 

 

marketing campaign, and so forth. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.  Exactly.  But I have 

   

  

  

  

 

a second answer, and that is, there is a critical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional contact here that gives rise to a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant interest of California. 

 

 

 

            

And understanding, Justice Gorsuch, there's 

 

 

 

 

a big picture question about the standard, but then we

do have a set of facts here.  The California court did 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draw on McKesson's role.  It can't just be taken away 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

from us, and it would be very confusing to the lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts to simply cast it aside.  And that is, California 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a very significant interest --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What's confusing, though, 

  

 

 

 

about simply saying here's the correct test, reverse, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand, go apply the correct test? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, you're going to have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to say something about McKesson is all I'm saying. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The -- the other side really wants to put it entirely to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the side.  And there have been a lot of important 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions here about the interests of California.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just don't think you can get rid of BMS's most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant contacts with California and say that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrelevant here.  And that is, California has a very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

significant interest in providing a complete 

   

 

 

 

adjudication of this claim, and so do all of the States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The problem in mass torts is that you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have multi-defendant actions, and you're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require that they be litigated multiple times so that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could one of these

have -- it depends on who we're talking about, but yes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

there could have been a class action.  And I take the --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the necessary implication. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And where -- if -- if so, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where could it be brought? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The -- it could be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

brought -- depending on whether you think McKesson plays 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a significant role, it would have been brought, I think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in California is the place where the class action would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been brought.  I will -- can I just bracket one 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

important thing for you to realize about all of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation, Justice Ginsburg?  It will illustrate, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think, how the States do work together. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You mentioned all of the cases are out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, and Mr. Katyal has stressed that.  He just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't mention that there is a special master that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who is responsible for disputes relating to all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation all around the country, both Federal and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  There is a great deal of collaboration here. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Now, my point about --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Special master is where? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  In New York.  It's by 

  

  

 

 

 

 

agreement of the parties.  And if there's -- there's --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I don't think it is actually

Federal, but it's -- it's a person who resolves by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement all of the discovery disputes, for example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across all of the litigation.  The United States has a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion of this in its brief about how this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relatively common. 

 

            

But the important thing about McKesson's 

 

 

 

 

 

role in the case is that California does have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant interest in providing a single forum where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this case against McKesson can be resolved, because look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the dilemma to McKesson.  If McKesson loses the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case -- remember, the out-of-State plaintiffs 

 

 

 

 

 

unquestionably can sue McKesson in California.  If they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

win against McKesson, what is McKesson supposed to do? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is going to have to go litigate against Bristol-Myers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhere else and try and get indemnification --

why couldn't these 572 or whatever people bring their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases in Federal court?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- but a very large --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- number.  And then that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

very large number is no problem.  They bring the case in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the place where there is jurisdiction, it's consolidated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a multidistrict panel, and the multidistrict panel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sends it to that venue for trial, which is convenient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for all. 

 

            

Now, what they'll say, yeah, I'll agree with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And then they'll say, the solution to this great 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mass tort problem is that's what Federal courts are for. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It doesn't work perfectly, but neither does -- does

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's what --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  McKesson is California. 

  

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's what --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what you do is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Breyer says you 

  

 

 

 

 

could redesign the case. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  Correct. 

  

  

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  A couple things about 

    

  

 

 

 

that -- that's true.  Okay?  A couple of things about 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

Remember that a bunch of Mr. Katyal's points 

   

 

 

 

 

 

about one forum making choice of law decisions, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having its own procedures that are different from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home forum are obviously true in MDL litigation.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raises the same constitutional question. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But in MDL litigation, 

  

 

 

 

 

you're in Federal court.  So the procedures are common 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across courts, in theory. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well -- but remember --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Maybe more in theory than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in practice. 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Maybe so.  And also, choice 

  

  

 

 

 

 

of law is the substantive law, is his concern.  And

the -- so I do think there's a lot of --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the other thing is this.  Two points, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

Justice Breyer.  The first is, yes, there are other ways 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do it, but that doesn't make the way we are doing it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional.  What the Court has talked about here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is minimum due process.  Remember this:  If Mr. Katyal 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

walked up to me in California and handed me a subpoena, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he could sue me in California on absolutely anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, his client sold $918 million worth of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plavix in California and says it violates the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution.  Now, that may not be a lot of money 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily to some people, but it is greater than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gross domestic product of 21 countries.  But --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, we're 

  

 

 

 

dealing with the jurisdictional rule, and when we do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, we want the rules to be as simple as possible. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you have -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

started out with the four different factors and all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  But I'm particularly concerned -- your brief at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 54, you say, well, if there were only a handful of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people from California and hundreds from Texas or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tennessee, that would be a different case.  By which, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, you mean it wouldn't satisfy due process, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  And that is --


  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well, you 

  

  

 

 

 

48 

have 86 in California and 575 elsewhere.  And there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference, I suppose, between handfuls and hundreds and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

86 and 575, but where exactly that difference is, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me is going to be impossible to determine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.  So, Mr. Chief 

  

  

 

 

 

Justice, it's true. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's right. 

  

 

 

 

 

You say handful in California, hundreds Tennessee and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas, no good.  86 in California, 575 somewhere else, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay. 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.  And let me explain 

  

  

 

 

 

 

why that's true.  Because I agree that when the Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

announced International Shoe, it said quite clearly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're not going be formulaic.  They are going to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case-by-case judgement. 

 

            

What happened here is that there were two, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

per se, categorical rules.  The first is there used to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be general jurisdiction because they're doing business, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Pennoyer said that we could get any -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California could adjudicate anything in California, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect -- insofar as they had assets in the State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those were clear, categorical rules.  You were convinced 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that those clear, categorical rules could produce some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfairness.

And so the Court announced a rule that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

much more encompassing of the facts that it accounts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for.  If the Court wanted a clearer rule, clearer rules 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have existed.  The Court has abandoned them in fairness 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to defendants.  It's very hard, I think, to blame us for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, now we're going to look at the factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know, but you're 

    

 

 

 

 

articulating a rule that requires businesses trying to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

figure out where to do business and plaintiffs where to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue and courts whether it's real.  Your rule depends 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon some line between handful and -- and hundreds, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

86 and 575. 

 

 

            

            

Where is it, exactly? 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It -- there -- there is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precise number.  I will say --

    

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If there were 20 in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

California and 575, would that satisfy due process? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I think that it is -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot answer that question, because --

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's your case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

You ought to be able to at least answer --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, I know my case is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Constitutional, Mr. Chief Justice.  All I'm saying is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that when you have the continuous and systematic

exploitation of the market, when you have the ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

bring a bunch of cases together for the benefit of all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the States, it is true that there is going to be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the reason that this is not a practical problem, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will tell you, is that the bar does what it did here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that is, it tries, for efficiency purposes, even if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for its own sake, to bring these cases together.  So you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really don't end up in situations where you have five in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one place, and people try and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Goldstein, it seems to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

me, on your theory, it could be zero California 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs, because here's what you told me.  You told 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me that the reason that this -- that an Ohio citizen's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim arises out of the contacts in California is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the contacts in California are really nationwide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contacts.  And if that's so, it's met regardless of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there are any California plaintiffs are not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if that's your theory, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't matter whether there are 86 or 20 or zero, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the contacts arise out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide/California contacts. 

 

            

            

that. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's not correct.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's not correct, because 

  

 

 

 

 

51 

your test that you've articulated has two core parts to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  The first is, the minimum contacts, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship between the contacts with the State and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  And the second is the fairness of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation, and what is absolutely critical to our case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and was critical to the --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  I don't think that's 

    

  

 

 

 

right, Mr. Goldstein.  Our arising out of relating to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test, has always been about the first part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry, and then all of the four factors is a backstop 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that.  It's an additional test after we decide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether your claim arises out of the forum contacts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I agree.  But we have to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

satisfy both in order for there to be specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  Justice Kagan, remember that it is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case that not that much weight in your prior precedents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has been placed on the reasonableness factors, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these have always been general jurisdiction cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These cases have always been brought as we're describing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Goldstein, go back 

  

  

 

 

 

to articulating for me. 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

of "related to"? 

 

 

52 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is -- it is -- it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the claim that is the same legal claim arising from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same operative facts.  And the conduct is the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct that gives rise to the State litigation.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is, it maps on perfectly.  And that is really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important because it means --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is that a yes to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Kagan's question about it wouldn't matter if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there were no California plaintiffs? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It would relate to, but it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not be constitutional because it would not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable under the second part of the test.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're already in California, en masse.  They are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

facing dozens upon dozens upon dozens of the same claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Remember what the Court said in making the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

move from Pennoyer to International Shoe, which I'd like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to come back to --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, if you don't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

sorry, Mr. Goldstein -- but if you don't need a single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff to satisfy the first prong of the due process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry, again, what function does that first prong have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left to do?  Why doesn't it all just run into the second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental fairness test? 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  What's left? 

  

 

 

53 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, because it gives the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State the power, the territorial power, because it does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the power to adjudicate with respect to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct.  It is both parts that are important. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I had said that I wanted to come back to you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about a bigger picture answer a -- a little while ago, 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

and that is, I do think it's really important that this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may be the beginning or the middle of a multi-decade 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effort to try and take a look at the original 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding of the due process clause, and do that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across the Court's body of precedent. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And we have urged the Court, if it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious about that endeavor, to take a look at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship of International Shoe and Pennoyer, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the founding of the country up through the adoption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was perfectly clear and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undisputed that California could adjudicate this claim, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least up to and including the assets that they have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the State of California.  They are within 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

California's territory.  There is no dispute about that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

International Shoe and Shaffer say we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to modernize our understanding of the Fourteenth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What you're suggesting is 

  

 

 

 

 

that the Court was wrong in -- in Daimler and in the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before it --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Goodyear. 

  

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Goodyear and Daimler. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- Goodyear in confining 

  

 

 

 

 

general jurisdiction.  And in this -- this very case, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was originally argued as a general jurisdiction case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Then we came out with Daimler, and then they said oh, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no, we know it's not general jurisdiction.  It's got to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be specific. 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So one comment that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

that you, no doubt, know has been made about this case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that it is an attempt to reintroduce general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction, which was lost in Daimler, by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backdoor. 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The backdoor.  Yes, exactly. 

  

  

 

 

 

55 

So important things about why that can't be right.  I do 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the driving concern in cases like Daimler and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goodyear about general jurisdiction is that you can hail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody into the forum and sue them about absolutely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything.  And this is a world of difference because 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this is being -- this suit is being brought on behalf --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the basis of their conduct in the State with respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to this drug. 

 

 

            

And the second is, I do think the Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized in Daimler quite explicitly that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrenchment of general jurisdiction, how these cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had always been brought -- and so there's no argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we've -- we're disrupting the legal system -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrenchment of general jurisdiction was going to induce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an examination of the Court's specific personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction to fill in the gaps. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you -- this is answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this in a sense -- all right.  This is -- because you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just started to with Justice Ginsburg, no general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  Why am I here, says defendant.  Because, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

says the judge, you have enough activity in our State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for us to call you into court to answer to one of our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens who was hurt.  That's special jurisdiction, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right?

JUSTICE BREYER:  But why am I here in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

respect to Smith?  Because, you see, Smith isn't a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen of our State. 

 

 

 

            

So where that answer sounded -- this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

logic, and what's bothering about the whole case is its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

logic, and I don't know the practicalities.  All right. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

But -- but the -- you see, the logic doesn't seem the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same. 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I cannot say, because you 

    

 

 

 

 

are a citizen of Texas, because that cuts no ice in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California.  So what is it I say in a single sentence 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that does make it clear to that defendant why he is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here? 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You're already here on this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

claim, and there is nothing unfair about having you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it with respect to another plaintiff, because that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff could quite clearly get you estopped on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis of --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I was here for that 

    

 

 

 

 

purpose, not --

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You're here. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So once I'm here, I can now 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sue him.  And then --

you. 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  On the exact same. 

  

 

 

 

 

57 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that's when lines -- all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Breyer, all --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not disagreeing with 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm trying to get the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer in.  I've got it. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  All right.  Well, all I will 

   

  

  

 

 

 

tell you is this point about nonmutual offensive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral estoppel is a big deal.  And that is when you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the identical claim, identical legal theory, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical operative facts, it -- so take away all of his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's all very different, the premise of this case is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's all the same. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I take you back? 

   

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

same thing applies, just completely flipped.  They could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be doing the same thing in Ohio, saying, we've got a lot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of plaintiffs here from California, but we're going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- we're going to let them sue in Ohio.  And the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing's going to happen in every other State.  I don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see that it increases the efficiency at all.

the -- the -- an important part of our analysis is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is the governmental interest in that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

litigation in this forum does consolidate things and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make it simpler.  The State's interest in having 600 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases litigated together rather than in 50 different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forums, it's material to our case that it does simplify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things. 

            

But at the very least, the role of McKesson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here does distinguish California from every other State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If they contract with a California company for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide distribution of this drug so that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly understandable that the legal issues that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arise from that agreement and the distribution would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this forum, it's completely predictable and does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish California from everyone else, everywhere 

 

 

 

 

 

else. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I take you back to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer's question about Federal courts --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- and multidistrict 

  

 

 

 

litigation?  Because you didn't say something that makes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me think, if you didn't say it, I don't understand. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Assuming that there was subject matter jurisdiction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there's diversity, it still it seems to me that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way -- there's no nationwide service of process here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

So the Federal courts have to mimic the State courts; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59 

isn't that correct? 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.  Then -- then I can 

   

  

  

 

 

 

get to the end of your question, and that is it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally understood that it's the transfer of court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific personal jurisdiction.  So if it's -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would happen, Justice Breyer is saying, is you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a lawsuit, a class action that would be removed to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court, specific jurisdiction would exist under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4K there.  Then it would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be transferred for pretrial purposes to the MDL forum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then returned for purposes of trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so his point, I think, would be that it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be okay in Federal court in the -- in the MDL 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system. 

            

My answer back is that there are still lots 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of other objections about it being inconvenient, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not where he's at, there'd be choice of law issues that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does really -- a lot of the fairness concerns that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Katyal is talking about do arise in MDL, do arise in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the New Jersey example he gives of specific personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  But at the very least, what I would say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the Court can write an opinion that simply says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is not your ordinary case.  If it were your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary case and McKesson wasn't in it, if the members

of the Court believed it, there wouldn't be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 

jurisdiction.  But they made this conscious choice to go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into California with respect to this -- with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this drug. 

 

            

And then the other argument that I do think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to be confronted is that, at the very least, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has to consider that when it went to International 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shoe, it excluded the Pennoyer basis of jurisdiction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the traditional power of the States from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

founding within their territory that always existed.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't seem unfair to me to say his clients did almost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a billion dollars' worth of business in the State of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

California.  They have enormous assets that they have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

placed in the State.  That they could be held liable up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent of those assets is not a violation of due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  If -- if I heard you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

correctly, you said something about overruling cases; is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that right? 

 

            

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If it were necessary to.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

do not think it's necessary to for multiple reasons, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including that if you just simply say that the Pennoyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis of jurisdiction exists, in addition to, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

International Shoe basis of jurisdiction, we clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would prevail up to at least being able to get the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Katyal, assume a set 

   

  

 

 

 

of facts that I know have not been proven. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bristol-Myers sells the drugs to McKesson.  McKesson 

  

 

 

 

 

 

distributes the drugs to all the other States, and all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the plaintiffs have taken McKesson drugs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under your theory, could they sue McKesson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Bristol-Myer in California? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  Well, they might or might not. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's a purposeful availment stream-of-commerce theory, 

   

 

 

 

which we're not trying to, you know, push here.  That's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in a way that 

   

  

 

 

 

62 

wouldn't preclude that suit. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KATYAL:  So, Justice Sotomayor, my 

  

 

 

 

 

theory is exactly what this Court said in Rush, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why his argument in McKesson doesn't work. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's, quote, plainly unconstitutional to 

 

 

 

 

exert jurisdiction over one defendant based on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activities of another.  The requirements of 

  

 

 

 

 

International Shoe must be met as to each. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So McKesson doesn't answer -- help him, nor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does it move the ball.  You still have to show that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying conduct by the defendant did something. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So, here when he talks about $918 million, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have no problem saying we're liable for the sales 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over there.  The question was -- what Justice Breyer was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking is, what about Mr. Smith?  You know, I'm selling 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Mr. Smith in Ohio, and, yes, I'm also separately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling $918 million in California, but you can't add 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those two things up together and confer personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  This Court has never done that, which is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why his rule is a novel one. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

So as Justice Kennedy said, I think that one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the goals here, here in this jurisprudence, has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to stay State A has an interest in combining State B's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicatory authority.

what Bristol-Myers is doing there in the California

MR. KATYAL:  But I think that when -- when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

they make an arrangement with the distributor to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

launch drugs in a particular location, they're liable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for that.  That's -- we've done ceded that below. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's, I think, the way specific jurisdiction works. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

The reason why Federal -- Federal actions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are permissible, and they could have been permissible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, Justice Breyer, is because the Fifth Amendment and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Fourteenth Amendment operate differently.  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Kennedy's point about State A and B doesn't apply to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Federal government vis-à-vis States. 

 

 

 

            

And CAFA allows for jurisdiction right now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over these claims.  The only reason we're not in Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court right now, Justice Ginsburg, is because they filed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less than a hundred claims in each action.  They 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

smirked them.  But, ordinarily, these would be Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court actions right now.  And the rule we are seeking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't disturb that in any way, shape, or form.  All we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are saying is that when they have unrelated claims, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncausal claims in California to -- with respect to the

33 other States, that's something as to which the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64 

States have an interest. 

 

 

 

            

And the predictability here is incredibly 

 

 

 

 

 

important.  Your -- your opinion in Hertz, for example, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picking up on the Chief Justice's question about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business predictability, is important.  This is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional matter and clean rules for businesses to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow are important.  They need to know if I sell to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Smith, what happens?  Their rule doesn't tell you. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
