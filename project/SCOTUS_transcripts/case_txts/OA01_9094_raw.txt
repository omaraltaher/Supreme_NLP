CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-9094, Abu-Ali Abdur' Rahman versus Ricky


Bell.


Mr. Liebman.  I think the Court would like to


hear argument on the questions we asked for supplemental


briefing on, as well as your original petition.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. LIEBMAN:  Okay.  Mr. Chief Justice, and may


it please the Court:


The question I'd like to take up first is why,


in our view, the unusual circumstances of this case


satisfy the two sets of demanding requirements that are on 

the petitioner here to succeed:  1) he has to show that


this is not a successive petition, and 2) he then


additionally has to get over the high hurdle that 60(b)


imposes.


Let me, though, go first to the jurisdictional


questions that Your Honor referred to.  This case was in


the court of appeals in three ways.  It was there because


Mr. -- the petitioner here went into the district court


and he said, here's my 60(b) motion, I'd like to get 60(b)


relief.

 The district court -- and this is on pages 42


through 44 of the record, of the joint appendix -- said


very, very clearly that it was going to make two rulings. 


First it said, this is not a Rule 60(b) motion, it is


something else, it's a successive petition.  Because it's


a successive petition, you cannot get 60(b) relief in this


court, and I'm going to refer or --


QUESTION:  That's the district court judge?


MR. LIEBMAN:  Right.  What I -- but what that


did, Your Honor, was to establish a final disposition.  It


terminated all of the petitioner's rights under 60(b). 


There were no rights left.  He told the district court --


QUESTION:  Couldn't he have moved to -- in the


Sixth Circuit -- to remand the case if he disagreed with


that?


MR. LIEBMAN:  He did.  He did, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Well, but that means that the


district court's decision was not final.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, it was final for purposes of


the 60(b), because the -- for purposes of the district


court's view there could be, would be, never could be any


60(b) relief.


QUESTION:  But it wasn't a final judgment in the


sense that an appeal could be sought from that, because it


was transferred.  The district court judge transferred it.

He didn't dismiss the 60(b) motion, which I would have


thought the district court might have done, and then it


perhaps could have been appealable.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, Your Honor, all of that's


right, and if the belts don't work, let's go to the


suspenders.  He -- the case was transferred to the court


of appeals.  The court of appeals, however, could not take


jurisdiction over the case unless the prerequisite for its


jurisdiction was established, and if you look at


2244(b)(3), which is in our appendix to our brief at


page 1a --


QUESTION:  Page 1a of the blue brief?


MR. LIEBMAN:  1a of the blue brief, it's very


clear under (b)(3)(A) that it has to be a second or


successive application before the court of appeals has any 

jurisdiction to do anything with it, so its jurisdiction


turns on the question whether it was a successive petition


or not.  If it wasn't one, it could not act under this


statute and would have to remand back to the district


court.  That's exactly what happened in the Martinez-


Villareal case.


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what does the statute,


the AEDPA statute contemplate?  That somebody in this


defendant's position could have applied to the court of


appeals for permission to file a successive petition?

Could that have been done here?


MR. LIEBMAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That was not done?


MR. LIEBMAN:  It was not done here because he


was saying all along this was not a successive petition,


if it was, he would not satisfy it.  He --


QUESTION:  Go ahead.


MR. LIEBMAN:  He was saying that he did satisfy


the requirements of 60(b), that the statute recognizes a


difference between certain --


QUESTION:  Well, then, to get an appeal on


that -- it sounds so complicated, because the law has


gotten so complicated with AEDPA, but maybe he should have


sought transfer back to the district court so the district


court could dismiss it and give something from which an 

appeal could be taken.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Oh but, Your Honor, in Martinez-


Villareal, I think it's very clear this case is exactly


the same as Martinez-Villareal, which this Court ruled


expressly on the -- the first question it took up was the


jurisdictional question.  What happened there is that the


petitioner went to the district court, the district court


said, this is a successive petition, I'm transferring, you


can't be in this court.


He then took an appeal, and he went up on a

transfer saying, okay, you've got the transferred motion


in front of you.


The court of appeals actually dismissed the


appeal saying, we don't have that, but it decided in the


context of the transfer -- and this is very standard


procedure here now under AEDPA -- it decided, first


question first, do we have jurisdiction, and it said, you


know what, we figured out that we don't have jurisdiction


because this is not a successive petition, so we remand


back to the district court.


This Court then took cert on that question, and


the first question it asked was, do we have cert here


because of subsection (e) here, and it said, we do have


cert here because (e) is very clear.  The grant or denial


of authorization can't come to the Court.


QUESTION:  Well, let's go back to (3)(A) for a


minute, Mr. Liebman.  It says -- as you point out --


before a second or successive application permitted by


this section is filed in the district court.  You say all


of that is a prerequisite, I take it, for the court of


appeals acting, but supposing it's a second or successive


application that is not permitted by this section.  That


wouldn't deprive the court of appeals of the jurisdiction


to say no, would it?


MR. LIEBMAN:  Absolutely.  In fact, it has the

obligation, not just the jurisdiction, to decide whether


it is a successive petition, because if it isn't, it can't


decide the case, because then it's got to start with the


district --


QUESTION:  Well, but -- so then the first,


the -- the first clause of (3)(A) is not really, strictly


speaking, entirely jurisdictional.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Oh, well I -- I'm not actually


sure it's the first clause.  It says that the applicant


shall move in the appropriate court for an order


authorizing that.  That's what essentially gives the court


the jurisdiction, but it's got to be for an order


authorizing what qualifies under the statute as a second


and successive application.  This was not a second and


successive application. 


Therefore, as in Martinez-

Villareal --


QUESTION:  Well, that's, of course, part of the


issue in the case.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Right, but that -- his position


was it was not, and therefore the court needed to dismiss


that case, and it had two options at that point.  It could


either remand it back, which is the majority approach, or


it could simply have dismissed, and then he could have


gone back and filed in the district court again, which is


what a few courts do.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Liebman, initially in this case,


when the district judge transferred -- I think it got one


on the State's recommendation that that's how you handle


these cases.  On behalf of the defendant, did anyone ever


say, please enter judgment against me under 60(b), I want


to make this -- test whether this is a 60(b) case or a


habeas case?


MR. LIEBMAN:  That did not happen, Your Honor,


although petitioner understood the court's decision, if


you look on pages 41 and 42, to say this -- it expressly


says, you cannot file 60(b) here in this court because


it's automatically successive.  You cannot do it.  You


will never get any rights under 60(b).


QUESTION:  But he could have asked to test that. 


He could have said, please don't transfer.


MR. LIEBMAN:  He could have, but in -- Your


Honor, in the Martinez-Villareal case, there was no such


question, no -- no --


QUESTION:  -- see what Martinez-Real has to do


with it.  I may be missing it, but I thought that in -- in


this case, the reason that you cannot appeal from the


court of appeals order refusing to give you permission to


file a second habeas is because there's a statute that


says you can't come to this court when a court of appeals


refuses to give permission on second habeas, and none of

that was involved, to my knowledge, in Martinez-Real.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Oh, yes --


QUESTION:  That was a question about whether or


not there was a premature decision, or whatever it was,


and they sent -- the court of appeals sent it back for


adjudication on this issue.


MR. LIEBMAN:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  No, it's -- I'm not right?


MR. LIEBMAN:  The provision (e) here says that


the grant or denial of an authorization cannot come up to


the Court on cert, so the fact that the court there in --


QUESTION:  You mean, Martinez-Real was a grant


of a petition for second or successive?


MR. LIEBMAN:  No.  It was --


QUESTION: 


Well, then, what has that statute to 

do with it?


MR. LIEBMAN:  What it said was -- and this is


what the Court said in Martinez-Villareal quite clearly. 


There's a threshold question.  The threshold question is,


do we have in front of us a second or successive petition.


QUESTION:  In Martinez-Real?


MR. LIEBMAN:  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  That was the


question there, because Martinez-Villareal filed a request


to --

was the answer?


MR. LIEBMAN:  It said, the answer is, this is


not a second or successive petition.


QUESTION:  Fine, so then the statute doesn't


apply, I guess --


MR. LIEBMAN:  Oh -- but here the court said --


if I can be clear about this -- the court said two things,


and it said them actually in different orders.  January 18


order, it said, this is a successive petition, so now


we've got to go to the gateway question of whether you can


get into court.  And then a couple of weeks later,


actually almost a month later, February 11, it said, you


don't meet the gateway requirement.


QUESTION:  I -- I just don't see how you get


around the statute that says that you can't come here 

after a court of appeals either grants or denies the


second or successive.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, that's what I'm --


QUESTION:  Which wasn't at issue, I take it, in


the other case.


MR. LIEBMAN:  That's what I'm trying to say. 


The very first thing that our cert petition says in this


case is, we are not asking for cert from the question of


whether or not we meet the gateway requirement.


QUESTION:  Yes, but you -- one doesn't really

ask for cert from -- from a question.  One asks for cert


to review an order, and the order of the court of appeals


is an order granting or denying.


MR. LIEBMAN:  This order had multiple parts,


Your Honor.  It was actually divided up into multiple


parts, and what he said was, we are asking for cert from


some parts of the order, segmented out and given


paragraphs.  We are not asking for cert from other parts


of that decision.


QUESTION:  But I think the question is whether


you can ask for cert for any -- from any -- part of it in


view of the provision of the statute that it's not -- I


just don't -- I'm not sure you can bifurcate the order and


say, we're not challenging the denial, we're challenging,


in effect, the reason for the denial.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, this was not a denial.  What


the statute says -- and I think that's really important --


is the grant -- I'm reading (e), as we go over from (1)(A)


to (2)(A).  The grant or denial of an authorization by a


court of appeals to file a second or successive


application shall not be appealable, but he was not


appealing the grant or denial.  He was appealing the


preliminary question whether it even was, whether the


court even could have taken jurisdiction of that because


it had a second or successive --

 QUESTION:  That's not a judgment.  You -- you


appeal judgments, you appeal orders, you appeal


dispositions of the lower court.  You -- you don't appeal


statements or -- or expressions.  You -- you appeal


dispositions.  The only disposition here was the denial of


the -- of the application.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, Your Honor, then let me go


to the garter if the belts and suspenders haven't worked


here.  Petitioner filed a motion in the court of appeals


on his original appeal, and he said, in this appeal, what


we would like you to do is, rather than issuing the


mandate on the judgment that you issued before, which went


up on cert, we would like you to remand this case in order


for the court below to take up these issues, whether on


60(b) or in other ways, and the court denied that motion. 

It didn't say why, but it denied that motion


without, expressly in regard to that, doing any kind of


gatewaying.  It just said, we deny it.


Now, it gives the reason in the earlier January


18 order that it thought that any post judgment motion in


one of these cases was automatically successive, and


that's our first question --


QUESTION:  All right, but --


MR. LIEBMAN:  -- which is, that was a mistake --


QUESTION:  -- on that -- now, this will get to

25

the merits, which I'm sure you'd like to get to --


MR. LIEBMAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- but I thought that the argument


that what the court of appeals did was right is roughly


the following, that what your client should have done, or


the way it should have worked is that the district court


initially dismissed -- dismissed on the ground that there


was a procedural default -- his initial parts of the


initial petition, because, said the district court, he


didn't exhaust those, and he can't do it now because the


time is up, and your client never appealed that ruling


in -- the first time.


What he should have done is appealed it.  Then,


when he asked for cert and the Tennessee statement came


down, he would simply have amended his cert petition and 

allowed us to GVR in light of our case in Tennessee, but


he couldn't do that, because he hadn't appealed that in


the first place, and therefore he had a final ruling, a


final judgment against him on that issue, and -- and


that's why -- that's why what the court of appeals did was


right, and that's also why it really is a second and


successive, because after all, you -- it's -- you want a


district judge to reopen a judgment where he made a


mistake but you didn't appeal it.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Your Honor, you're absolutely

25

right, the premise, which is that Rule 60(b) or related


motions in the court of appeals cannot be used to fill the


office of an appeal, but there's a very established


doctrine there.  It came up in the Muniz case, in the


Blackmon v. Money remand that this Court made, and the


question there is whether it was reasonably available to


him at that moment to make an appeal.  If it was, 60(b)


doesn't come into play, and that's perhaps the most


important question in this case.


As of the time Mr. Abdur' Rahman filed his


brief, his first brief, opening brief in the Tennessee --


I mean, in the Sixth Circuit on August 5, 1999, this


Court's O'Sullivan decision had come down two months


earlier.  O'Sullivan read a rule of Illinois procedure


establishing a discretionary review process that is 

identical in terms.  The State of Alabama has actually


gone through the terms in its brief and shown that they're


identical.


This Court said, and I quote, without more,


those words are not sufficient to tell us that that


discretionary procedure is outside the ordinary post-


conviction review process in that State.  In this State of


Tennessee at the time, there was that rule, identical to


the rule in O'Sullivan, and nothing more in the law.  In


fact, the State concedes in its brief that there was

21

25

nothing in Tennessee law at the time besides the rule.


So it was not available to him at that point for


the very reason that if he had made that argument, it


would have been a frivolous argument because it would have


run foursquare into the precise holding of a decision of


this Court but two months before.  It was only when Rule


39 came down after the appeal was over, while the case was


on cert, that it said no, no, no, no, the law of Tennessee


has been since 1967 that our discretionary review


procedure in Rule 11 has never been part of the regular


and routine State post-conviction review process that we


have --


QUESTION:  Mr. Liebman, we've decided a couple


of cases, one about 30 years ago, Harris against Nelson,


and then another case called Pitchess, in maybe -- that 

indicate that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and


particularly 60(b), do not apply if they conflict at all


with the habeas regulations.  Now, you don't cite


either -- either of those cases in your brief.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Yes, we do.  We cite --


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I --


MR. LIEBMAN:  We cite both of them on --


QUESTION:  I didn't see them in the index.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, I believe that they are


cited in our -- well, I guess you're right.  I thought we

had cited them in the reply brief, but we make reference


to them where we point out, if I can find it here -- yes,


we do, Your Honor.  On page 3 of our reply brief, the


yellow brief, we cite Pitchess and Browder.


QUESTION:  You didn't cite them in your opening


brief.


MR. LIEBMAN:  We didn't.  The State raised them,


and we responded to them, and the point is that we


actually think that Martinez-Villareal and Slack stand on


top of Pitchess and Browder, so that they were obviously


decided in that same context, and so we cited the more


recent case, but in any event in our reply brief, what we


point out is, this Court has been very clear to say, is


there a conflict between a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure


and the habeas jurisprudence?


If so, the civil rule doesn't apply.  If not, it


does apply, and as almost all of the courts of appeals


have held, there are certain very limited circumstances


when a 60(b) motion does not interfere with the policies


of the habeas jurisprudence, and in those limited number


of cases, which includes this one, it is appropriate to


use 60(b).


QUESTION:  Well, I thought the Second Circuit


was the only case that really supported you --


MR. LIEBMAN:  Oh, no.

 QUESTION:  -- in this area as to whether a 60(b)


rule can be used as a substitute.


MR. LIEBMAN:  No, Your Honor.  We don't at all


stand on the Second Circuit approach to this.  The


majority rule is that it is a case-by-case analysis. 


It's -- for example -- the Dunlap case where Judge Posner


recently cited all of the lower court opinions, and what


he said was, the majority rule is that you have to look. 


You have to say, is this the kind of 60(b) that avoids the


problems that successive petitions are -- cause that we


have a rule for?  If they do, decide the 60(b) motion.  If


not --


QUESTION:  How -- how long after the district


court ruled that your claims were not -- not exhausted,


how much time elapsed between then and the time you filed 

your Rule 60 motion?


MR. LIEBMAN:  We filed the Rule --


QUESTION:  3-1/2 years, wasn't it?


MR. LIEBMAN:  But it was the key point --


QUESTION:  Just answer my question.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  It was 3-1/2 years?


MR. LIEBMAN:  -- I think 3-1/2 years is the


right -- but the reason is that the trigger for the 60(b)


motion did not come down until June 2001.

 QUESTION:  That's true, but the -- now I'm


thinking, when I read the Sixth Circuit's opinion again,


they're not really saying anything different.  I think


they must mean -- I grant you it can be read either way,


but I can't believe that they mean every 60(b) motion no


matter what is second or successive.


It seems to have arisen in cases where they had


good reason to think that the 60(b) motion in that case


was second or successive, as in your case they are looking


at the 60(b) motion as a substitute for a new petition for


the reason that it was dismissed the first time as a


procedural default, which is the end of this matter.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well --


QUESTION:  And you didn't appeal it.  Rather,


for whatever set of reasons, you wait -- I mean, not 

saying it was your fault, but you wait and go back and do


this other thing.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, Your Honor, two points.


QUESTION:  So is there -- is there really a


minority rule at all?


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well --


QUESTION:  Is there some court that really meant


it, that no matter what, 60(b) is always second or


successive?


MR. LIEBMAN:  That is the argument that the

State made here, and it's what the district court said,


and I can tell you the district court believed it, but it


doesn't matter here.  I don't want to get off on that,


because we think that whatever the rule ought to be, this


is the kind of 60(b) motion that is not successive for two


reasons.


First of all, it is -- it relies upon legal and


factual issues that are entirely within the four corners


of the original proceeding.  There's nothing new here. 


The law, the facts, the evidence, everything is the same.


Secondly, so that means you're not getting


out --


QUESTION:  Well, the law's new.  I mean, that's


your whole point.


MR. LIEBMAN: 


Well, but it isn't new, Your 

Honor.  It was a declaration of the law as it existed all


the way back in 1967.


QUESTION:  Well, all right, I'll --


MR. LIEBMAN:  But it's like the Fiore case, Your


Honor, where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said yes, we


came down with this interpretation of the State statute,


and it's true the lower courts had all seen it differently


up to that point, but we were telling you what the statute


meant all the way back, and this Court treated it as,


quote, old law.

 QUESTION:  But then you said you didn't need to


put it in your -- make a cross-appeal of it because you


didn't think it was a tenable argument, so you can't -- I


don't -- I don't see how you could have it both ways, to


say it was the law all along, but we didn't have to say


that that was the law because O'Sullivan --


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, because --


QUESTION:  -- hadn't come down, or had just come


down.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, Your Honor, what O'Sullivan


says is, if there is a clear statement of law by State


law, by rule or decision that says -- as the South


Carolina-Arizona provisions cited in this paragraph say --


that this particular discretionary review procedure,


quote, is not available, then the Supreme Court and 

the Federal courts will respect it, but otherwise, if


we don't know what the law is, or it's not clear, then


we don't need to respect it, so that was --


QUESTION:  But the appellate -- the appellate


brief in this case, the brief in the Sixth Circuit, when


the -- when the prosecutor was appealing on the


ineffective assistance of counsel, that was filed before


O'Sullivan came down, wasn't it?


MR. LIEBMAN:  The State's brief was filed


before, petitioner's brief filed after.

 QUESTION:  But the point at which you could have


filed a cross-appeal was before.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Oh, Your Honor, that's a very


important point.  In our certificate of probable cause to


appeal we asked the district judge, starting with point 1,


the prosecutorial misconduct claims and the procedural


default ruling on them is what we want to take up to the


court of appeals on our appeal, and the district court


granted a CPC -- a certificate of probable cause -- on


that ground, so that was in the case, it was in the


appeal, and it was specifically in the mind -- well, it


was on the paper that this was the issue that the cross-


appeal was going to be focused on.


QUESTION:  I thought you didn't appeal.  I


thought you did not appeal the first time -- we're back in 

the year 2000, or early 2001.


MR. LIEBMAN:  '99, actually.


QUESTION:  '99?


MR. LIEBMAN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  All right.  At that time I thought


you did not appeal the district court's ruling that you


had procedurally defaulted because you hadn't exhausted


claims X, Y, and Z, and the time had run.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, all I would say --


QUESTION:  Am I right about that?

 MR. LIEBMAN:  You're right, but they were in the


certificate of probable cause, which is -- you have to get


that first, but of course the court of appeals doesn't


reach your certificate of probable cause.


QUESTION:  No, no, so I don't see how that helps


you.


MR. LIEBMAN:  Well, I'm just saying -- well, it


does help in this sense, Your Honor, I think, which is


that until O'Sullivan came down and removed the argument


that petitioner thought he had, he was planning to raise


it, but when O'Sullivan came down, after the CPC, but


before he actually got to file his brief, now suddenly


the claim that he wanted to raise looked frivolous,


because there was not a declaration of State law on the


point.


There came to be a declaration of State law, and


when it came sua sponte, it happened to say, because the


court in Tennessee believed that this to be -- was the


case -- that the law of Tennessee has always been since


1967 that this was never part of the post-conviction


review process, so --


QUESTION:  Hasn't the Sixth Circuit had an


opinion on that subject as to whether the rule promulgated


by the Tennessee Supreme Court was a change, or was it


not?

 MR. LIEBMAN:  No, it has not.  The issue is


percolating in the lower courts and in the Sixth Circuit,


but it has not ruled yet.


QUESTION:  But isn't the --


QUESTION:  The Sixth Circuit did -- the Sixth


Circuit had held before in a case arising out of Kentucky


that if you don't go to the top court, you have not


exhausted.


MR. LIEBMAN:  They said that in Kentucky based


upon a Kentucky Supreme Court decision in 1985.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. LIEBMAN:  After that point, there are five


or six decisions of the Sixth Circuit saying that failure


to exhaust that remedy is failure to exhaust.  There is no


similar decision in Tennessee at all in the court of 

appeals before O'Sullivan came down, because the


understanding of practice there, and I know because I


practiced there at that time, was that this didn't need to


be exhausted.


QUESTION:  All right, so isn't the right way to


do this, if you were writing it from scratch, we have the


statute, you simply say, look, this is what second and


successives are for.  When the law changes just in the


middle of the case, bring a second and successive.  That's


the rare case where it should be allowed.

 MR. LIEBMAN:  The law did not change.


QUESTION:  I mean, I don't --


QUESTION:  But I mean what happened to you. 


Isn't that the case that they're there for?


MR. LIEBMAN:  This -- the second and successive


is designed to avoid every change in the law being the


basis for a habeas petition, but this is not a change in


the law.  It's exactly -- every petitioner literally


argued that not only is this discretionary, so it should


not be exhausted, but he also said the nature of this


discretionary process shouldn't be exhausted because it's


different from post-conviction.


QUESTION:  Well, may I ask you one more


question?  If it had merely been a change in Tennessee


law, that would not have been a predicate for a second and 

successive habeas, would it?


MR. LIEBMAN:  Absolutely.  If it is a change


of law, it's preempted by the terms of the successive


statute which says, we've got a rule here for changes in


the law, but that's why this isn't successive, because


this is not a change in the law, it's within the four


corners --


QUESTION:  But doesn't that foreclose you,


because when you're -- if it's not second and successive


as defined by AEDPA, that means those are the only kind

MR. LIEBMAN:  No, Your Honor --

in under Rule 60.


MR. LIEBMAN:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  No --


MR. LIEBMAN:  The State agrees if it's fraud,


if -- Martinez-Villareal, where you've got some State


court decision that changes everything --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. LIEBMAN:  -- it's got to be --


QUESTION:  -- are you suggesting there was fraud


here?


MR. LIEBMAN:  No, no, no, I'm saying, Your


Honor, that there are certain circumstances where 

something that is literally second in time does not


qualify as a second or successive petition that triggers


2244, and so we need to know what that is, and the two


standards are when it is within the four corners of the


first petition and it completely undermines --


QUESTION:  Now, what's -- what's the authority


for that statement?


MR. LIEBMAN:  The authority is Martinez-


Villareal, Slack, and Calderon, and a huge body of lower


court law that establishes those very, very narrow

circumstances where it's so tied into the first petition


because it's the same facts, and it so undermines that


first judgment that there's no judgment left, that you


need something to substitute for it, but you don't have a


successive petition.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Liebman.  I take it


you're reserving your time?


MR. LIEBMAN:  Yes, I am.


QUESTION:  General Summers.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. SUMMERS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,


and may it please the Court:


This Court lacks jurisdiction of this case and


the writ should be dismissed, but if this Court concludes 

that it does have jurisdiction, then the alleged 60(b)


motion was a prohibited second or successive application


because it attempted to revisit a prior final adjudication


based upon alleged error of fact or law.


Turning to the jurisdictional issue, the court


of appeals did not have jurisdiction to review the


transfer order.  The transfer order was not a final order. 


It had no jurisdiction in the district court.  The


district court had no jurisdiction over the -- over the


motion because it considered it as what it was.  It was a

second or successive application.


QUESTION:  Doesn't the jurisdictional issue


really turn on whether or not it was a second or


successive?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  No, Your Honor, it does not. 


Under the gatekeeping authority of 2244(b)(3) of AEDPA,


then the sold province as to determine whether or not a


second or successive application should be granted or


should be denied is in the province of the Sixth Circuit.


QUESTION:  But is it strictly in the province of


the Sixth Circuit to determine that what it has before it


is a request for something that should be called a second


or successive petition within the meaning of the statute? 


If it is, they've got the final word, but whether it is is


a separate question.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Your Honor, our position is


that you can't separate these two functions.  Under AEDPA,


and under the clear enactment of Congress, when Congress


gave the court of appeals the exclusive and sole


jurisdiction as to whether or not a -- an application or


leave for application for a second or successive should be


granted or denied, it also gave them the exclusive


authority to determine whether it was --


QUESTION:  Well, it didn't do so in so many


words.  I mean, is your argument that if we split this

question into a) jurisdictional fact, b) the authority of


the court if the jurisdictional fact is present, if we


split those two questions that there's going to be


constant litigation over the jurisdictional fact, and


that's why we ought to read the statute your way, or is


there some point of text that is not occurring to me that


supports you?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Well, it's one or the other.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Is it text or policy?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  It's the first one, Your


Honor.


QUESTION:  Okay.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  If you were to split those two


decisions that the court of appeal has jurisdiction over,


then there would be a proliferation of appeal of that


first predicate decision.  The decision, the first --


QUESTION:  Well, is it going to be -- I mean, is


it going to be a difficult question in most cases?  I


mean, this is an extraordinary case.  You can see how the


jurisdictional fact question gets raised here, but you


know, in most cases is this going to be even a colorable


issue?

 GENERAL SUMMERS:  Your Honor, I don't -- I would


not -- I don't think this is, frankly, an extraordinary


case to determine whether or not it was a second or


successive.  That is to say that when the Sixth Circuit


got the transfer order, they saw just what it was, and


that it was a second or successive application --


QUESTION:  Yes, you say that, but the relief


sought in the 60(b) motion was not relief from the State


court judgment.  It was relief from the final judgment in


the habeas proceeding because of the Tennessee rule, so


they asked to reopen the habeas proceeding, not to file a


second habeas proceeding, and they asked to reopen it, and


just to have a claim which was undecided in that


proceeding decided, which had never been decided, so there


was not asked for second consideration of a claim, just 

for the first consideration.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Yes, Your Honor.  What they


asked for was the relitigation of a claim that had been --


that -- that --


QUESTION:  Not of a claim, a first litigation of


a claim.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  They -- they asked for -- they


asked for the relitigation of a prior final determination,


which we -- we submit and we -- our position is that this


was, in fact, a second --

 QUESTION:  Did they ask in the 60(b) motion for


relief from the State court judgment which would be the


relief requested in the habeas proceeding?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  They asked -- I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  Did they ask for relief from the


State court judgment in the 60(b) motion, or just from the


habeas court judgment?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  They asked for relief from


the -- from the habeas judgment in the -- in the district


court --


QUESTION:  So then it was a 60(b) motion,


because that's what 60(b) is directed at, where the second


or successive petition would have asked for relief from


the State court judgment.


GENERAL SUMMERS: 


Well, they alleged that it was 

a 60(b) motion, but when the district court received the


motion, the district court put substance over form and saw


clearly that it was a second or successive --


QUESTION:  Well, you call it that, but supposing


instead of the -- the Tennessee rule, they had been able


to demonstrate it -- very improbable, just to give the


hypothesis out -- that a waiver of the claim for the


prosecutorial misconduct had been executed and the waiver


was false, that there was a fraud on the court in -- in


having that issue precluded from review.  Would a 60(b)

motion have been permissible then?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  It would be the inherent


authority of the -- of the district court to take care of


a situation of fraud on the court.


QUESTION:  By granting a 60(b) motion?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well, we don't think it would


even have to be a 60(b) motion.


QUESTION:  Well, wouldn't that be the office of


a 60(b) motion, to correct that very fraud?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Fraud on the court that would


impugn the very integrity of the prior final adjudication


would, in fact, be -- be --


QUESTION:  Well, you go on a different section


of Rule 60, wouldn't you --


QUESTION:  That's correct.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- the section of Rule 60 that


specially deals with fraud.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  That's right.


QUESTION:  But in that situation a 60(b) motion


would be permissible under that section?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  If there was a fraud on the


court.


QUESTION:  Right.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  But that -- but the fraud on

the court would undermine the complete efficacies of the


proceedings, and that the final judgment wouldn't even be


final, because it would be a sham.


QUESTION:  Well, but you have to file a motion


and have those facts developed in order to do it, and


60(b) is the avenue for doing that.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  That -- I mean, that could be


a possible avenue, but that -- but that would only go as


to the fraud on the integrity --


QUESTION:  And here, the relief requested is


precisely the same, namely that one claim was not heard


which was in the case, for a reason that was -- turned out


to be a gross mistake of the law.  They thought the law


was exhaustion because of a rule of law, and it turns out


they were wrong, so you have -- instead of fraud, you have 

a mistake of law.


Now, maybe that doesn't -- doesn't justify 60(b)


relief, but it certainly is a classic case of what 60(b)


is directed to -- to solve.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well --


QUESTION:  Directed at the final judgment in the


habeas proceeding as opposed to the final judgment in the


State proceeding.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Of -- of course, Your Honor,


that argument would fly in the face of the finality

requirements of AEDPA, which only -- which only gives


us -- which only gives us limited circumstances to


relitigate --


QUESTION:  But that's true of my fraud case,


too.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well, but in the fraud case,


Your Honor, the fraud on the court means that the original


judgment is a complete sham, is a complete sham, and there


was no --


QUESTION:  And here it isn't a sham, it was just


a mistake.  They misread the law.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well, they want it both ways,


if it please the Court.  They either say that it was a new


rule or an -- or an old rule that clarified Tennessee law. 


If it was a new rule, then that would contravene 2244(b) 

under AEDPA.


QUESTION:  But that --


QUESTION:  What is the right way to do it?  That


is, in your opinion, how -- suppose we had a -- we have a


defendant, a petitioner, a convicted person, and he has a


whole lot of claims, and there he is in Federal court and


he brought all of his claims up to the State supreme court


but for three, then he suddenly thinks, oh my God, I wish


I'd brought those up, too, and the district judge says,


well, you sure had to, so you lost them, because it's too

late now.  Procedural default.  It seems obviously right,


doesn't even appeal that part of the case.


But while the case is on appeal, this Court


says, he didn't have to go to the State supreme court with


those three claims if the State supreme court agrees, and


then State supreme court then does.


All right.  Now, there he is.  Under the law as


it is right now, he can make his three points.  He can


make his three claims, and yet as it was before, he


couldn't, and it's right on the case, it's still ongoing. 


What's supposed to happen?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  When the --


QUESTION:  In your opinion is there just -- is


there no way a person could say, judge, please read the


supreme court and the Tennessee court, and you'll see that 

your ruling was wrong, and believe me, that's right, so


what is he supposed to do?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  A prior final determination --


a prior final determination by the district court as to


the procedural default should be conclusive.


QUESTION:  So you're saying he's just out of


luck, nothing?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Yes, sir, because --

 GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well, but we -- yes, Your


Honor, but under the provisions of AEDPA there are two


circumstances where he could file a second or successive,


which we say is what he has, in fact, done here.  One, of


course, is if it's a new claim involving a constitutional


law that's made retroactive by this very Court, or newly-


discovered evidence to show factual innocence, but when


that court -- when that district court -- makes a final, a


prior final adjudication, then that is -- that should


be -- that should be final.  He should appeal that


decision.  He should appeal that decision --


QUESTION:  General Summers --


GENERAL SUMMERS:  -- through the normal


appellate process.


QUESTION:  General Summers --


GENERAL SUMMERS:  He did not in this case.


QUESTION:  You -- are you -- you're making the


general point that's not peculiar to AEDPA?  I -- tell me


if my understanding is correct -- that 60(b) is not


supposed to do service in place of an appeal.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So if a district court rules


incorrectly, and you didn't appeal that, and then there's


a clarifying decision by some other court that really


shows the district court was incorrect on the procedural

default, you can't then say, ah, give me the relief under


60(b) that I could have gotten if I had taken a timely


appeal.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Yes, Your Honor.  If the --


QUESTION:  And that's wholly apart from AEDPA.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Yes, Your Honor, that's


correct.  If this petitioner had decided that instead, the


district court found that he had improperly exhausted his


remedies under State law, that he'd showed no cause of


prejudice or fundamental miscarriage of justice, that he


had procedurally defaulted, and that he, his claim was --


it was conclusive that he had no habeas relief, if the


petitioner had wanted to appeal that -- had wanted to find


out whether or not the district court was wrong -- he


should have appealed that case.  He did not.  Under --


under the case law but also under 60(b) doctrine a 60(b)


motion is not a substitute for an appeal.  He did not


appeal that adjudication by the district judge.  He's out


of business so far as that's concerned.


What he filed in the district court, the


district judge got that document, he looked at substance,


and the district court said, this is a second or


successive.  The only jurisdiction in the world to


determine whether to grant or deny second or successive is


the court of appeals.  When that court of appeals got that

transfer order, there was no termination.  They got what


was --


QUESTION:  Is it conceivable that a district


judge might erroneously in some case call something second


or successive and it really wasn't?  Is it ever possible


for him to do -- make that?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well, human beings, it's


certainly possible.


QUESTION:  And if he does make a mistake, what's


the remedy for it?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  There could be a motion to


transfer in the court of appeals.  The court of appeals


if, in fact, finds that it was improvidently transferred,


could transfer it back.  That would be that remedy, Your


Honor.


QUESTION:  But what if instead -- I gave you a


fraud example -- instead of that it was a mistake.  The


judge thought that the petitioner had waived the case. 


They thought there was a document in the file waiving this


issue and he was just dead wrong, and he said, then the --


after the decision -- the final decision in the habeas


case, the judge -- the litigant finds out that the judge


incorrectly relied on a mistaken representation of fact. 


Could he not file a 60(b) to correct that?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  No, Your Honor.  If it was a

mistake of fact, if it did not go to -- to undermine the


integrity of that being a final adjudication, no.


QUESTION:  Well, it -- it undermines it in the


sense that it denied the litigant a hearing on a claim


asserted in the habeas proceeding, namely, the


prosecutorial misconduct.  He just never got a hearing on


that.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  If he were -- if it were


something of the nature of -- of denying him the


opportunity to have a hearing, or if, in fact --


QUESTION:  That's exactly what it was here, too.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well, no, sir.  He did -- he


received a hearing.  He received a hearing, Your Honor,


that -- and in that hearing it was determined by the court


that he had improperly --


QUESTION:  He failed to exhaust.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  -- Failed to exhaust --


improperly, that he --


QUESTION:  And that ruling was wrong.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  -- failed to show cause of


prejudice, that there was no miscarriage of justice, and


that he was conclusively entitled to no habeas relief in


the district court, and that was a conclusive final


determination, and if he had felt like the court was


wrong, he should have filed an appeal in the Sixth

Circuit.


QUESTION:  Well, I understand that argument, but


if -- but I don't understand your position if it was based


on a mistake of fact, rather than a mistake of law.  Here


was just a clear mistake of law.  The parties all


misunderstood what the law, as later explained by the


Tennessee court, was.  It was -- he did not -- he had, in


fact, exhausted.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Your Honor, if he had thought


the judge had made a mistake, he should have appealed.


QUESTION:  He didn't think so.  He didn't know


that 'til Tennessee adopted its rule --


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- which was 2 years later.


GENERAL SUMMERS: 


Well, his argument that 

Tennessee adopted a rule that either is a new rule or an


old rule is not of much import as far as we're concerned,


because the Rule 39 that he relies upon changed nothing in


Tennessee law --


QUESTION:  Right.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  -- so far as appellate


process.


QUESTION:  But they changed the understanding of


the district judge and the litigants.  They thought the


law was otherwise.

 GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well, I think -- I think the


district court knew what the law was when he made that


decision, but certainly the Sixth Circuit knew what the


law was.


QUESTION:  You think he knew what the Tennessee


court was later going to decide?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Well, actually, the --


QUESTION:  Because what he did is flatly


inconsistent with what the Tennessee court decided.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  What the Tennessee court later


decided, Your Honor, did not change Tennessee law so far


as discretionary review at all -- at all.


QUESTION:  But it did demonstrate, did it not,


that the district judge was wrong in his ruling on


exhaustion?


GENERAL SUMMERS:  The district judge was exactly


correct on his decision.


QUESTION:  That's the question.  That's the


ultimate question that I think this Court granted cert to


decide, but then we discovered that there are all these --


this procedural -- the question whether a Tennessee court


saying you don't have to exhaust does service for the


Federal courts.  That is, the Federal courts could say


it's an open question.


You have to exhaust the remedies that are

available to you.  You could have requested review.  You


didn't request review.  We don't care if Tennessee says,


ah, you don't have to, because that's -- that ruling would


be made only for purposes of saying, let's get into the


Federal court.  I take it that's your position.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  The decision as to the


availability of a remedy is a State decision.  The


decision as to what has been exhausted is a Federal


decision, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Yes.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  The Rule 39 that the


petitioner relies upon did not change discretionary review


in Tennessee one iota.  As a matter of fact, the Tennessee


Rule of Appellate Procedure 11 says in its comment that


Rule 39 does not change TRAP -- as we call it, TRAP 11 --

whatsoever.  Discretionary review was in '95, when he did


not appeal to the supreme court, as well as in June 28,


2001, an absolute available remedy under the normal


appellate processes in Tennessee.


QUESTION:  So on your view, the district court


was right when the district court said the first time


around, sorry, you didn't exhaust.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  Your Honor, our view is that


the district court was right in 1998 when he ruled that


the claims were procedurally defaulted, and if this

case -- if this case were to go back to the district court


today, he would rule that the claims had been


procedurally --


QUESTION:  Well, that -- we don't know that 


because I think it's an open question whether -- after


O'Sullivan -- the position taken in O'Sullivan would apply


when the State court says you don't have to exhaust.


GENERAL SUMMERS:  But there's no question


that -- there is no question that in 1998, when the


district court found that the -- that the issues had been


procedurally defaulted, and that there had been no showing


of cause in prejudice, no miscarriage of justice, that


that was a conclusive final determination.


What this -- what this petitioner attempts to do


is to -- under the guise of a post-judgment pleading --

avoid or evade the second or successive restriction.  This


flies in the face of AEDPA, would be a mockery of the


finality requirements of AEDPA, and we would submit to the


Court that the transfer to the court of appeals was a


proper transfer, and that the court of appeals properly


determined the gatekeeping criteria was satisfied, the


writ should be dismissed or, in the alternative, the


decision of the court of appeals should be affirmed.


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Summers.


Mr. Zidlicky, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. ZIDLICKY


ON BEHALF OF AMICI CURIAE, STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL.


MR. ZIDLICKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


I'd like to start by first responding to Justice


Stevens' question, in which he said that the Rule 60(b)


motion didn't seek the relief of granting of Federal


habeas.  It actually did.  In the joint appendix in 170,


the court -- the petitioner sought relief from the State


court judgment in bullet point -- I believe it's five, but


in any event, I think underlying that is the question of


whether there had been a prior --


QUESTION:  You say the 60(b) motion was directed


at the State court judgment, is that what you're telling


me?


MR. ZIDLICKY:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  And not at the habeas -- not asking


the habeas court to vacate the ruling on the -- on --


denying habeas and setting it down for a ruling on the --


on the prosecutorial misconduct?


MR. ZIDLICKY:  For both.  For both, Justice


Stevens.  He asked for both of those, and I think -- he


sought to reopen the judgment, and he also sought -- he


sought in bullet point 5 to -- or, relief from the State


court judgment, and that's in the joint appendix.

 The question --


QUESTION:  But 60(b) just gets him the first


step, and if he succeeds in the first step, then he goes


further and says, okay, relieve me from the State court


judgment.


MR. ZIDLICKY:  Well, I was just responding just


to Justice Stevens' point that he didn't seek that relief


in his Rule 60(b) motion.  He actually did, but the -- but


the underlying question is --


QUESTION:  But he's doing it simply because he


is saying, I guess, that's where I'm trying to get to


ultimately.


MR. ZIDLICKY:  What he's trying to do is, he's


trying to relitigate a claim that had been adjudicated


against him through Rule 60(b), and this Court said in 

Calderon that you can't -- that the requirements of


2244(b) can't be evaded, and one of those requirements is,


you can't relitigate a claim that has been adjudicated.


QUESTION:  Well, he's not relitigating a claim


that's been adjudicated, he's relitigating -- he wants to


litigate a claim that had not been adjudicated.  He wanted


a ruling on the merits of his claim, which he never got.


MR. ZIDLICKY:  No, Justice Stevens, there was an


adjudication of his claim.  There was an adjudication of


his claim by the district court which said his claim was

procedurally defaulted --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. ZIDLICKY:  -- and that he had failed to


establish cause and prejudice, and that --


QUESTION:  Correct, but they didn't get a ruling


on the merits of the claim.


MR. ZIDLICKY:  No, he --


QUESTION:  They just ruled that it was


procedurally defaulted because it had not been exhausted.


MR. ZIDLICKY:  Well, that's -- but I don't think


that's right, Justice Stevens.  In this Court's cases in


Stewart and Slack, the Court made clear that in


determining whether there had been a prior -- the language


that the Court had used was whether there had been a prior


adjudication of the claim. 


Here, there was a prior 

adjudication of the claim.  This Court's precedent, going


back to Wainwright v. Sykes, Coleman v. Thompson, and --


QUESTION:  But the adjudication to which you


refer is a holding that it was procedurally defaulted


because the -- they had not been exhausted in the Supreme


Court of Tennessee.  Is that not correct?


MR. ZIDLICKY:  That's correct, Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  And that amounts to an adjudication


on the merits, but in fact, the merits had never been


decided.

 MR. ZIDLICKY:  No, it is -- it's an adjudication


for purposes of -- it's -- for purposes of determining


whether he can come back and file to relitigate the issue,


come back and --


QUESTION:  Right, it's an adjudication that has


finality, which merits adjudications usually do, but it's


a finality adjudication that does not rest upon any


finding about the underlying merits of the claim that he


wanted to bring for relief.  Isn't that clear?


MR. ZIDLICKY:  That's not the test that this


Court has adopted in --


QUESTION:  I'm not asking you whether it's --


I'm just asking you as a descriptive matter --


MR. ZIDLICKY:  I don't -- you're right, Justice


Souter, he didn't make a determination regarding the 

underlying merit of the constitutional claim, but --


QUESTION:  Okay, and we use the term, I think --


correct me if I'm wrong, we use the term, merits


determination, to refer to a determination that is


binding, i.e., he can't do something back in the State


court and then come back and try again here.  We call that


a determination on the merits, but there are two kinds of


merits determinations.


One is a finding of default which cannot be


cured.  Second is a finding which may involve default, but

may involve a determination on the merits of the


underlying claim, and this is just a default kind of


merits, not an underlying claim kind of merits finality,


isn't that correct, just as a descriptive matter?


MR. ZIDLICKY:  I think it's correct as a


descriptive matter to -- but with one qualification.  What


you're saying is that there is an exception for -- I think


in substance what you're saying is, you can continue to


relitigate claims of procedural default because they're,


quote, not on the merits, but I think the way --


QUESTION:  Well, maybe you can and maybe you


can't.  His argument here is, this is one that I ought to


be allowed to relitigate, i.e., to litigate despite a


finality judgment, because of something very unusual that


happened as a result of the supreme court's rule change. 

What he's saying is, this is a special kind


of -- third kind of case in the middle, and you want to


treat this one for 60(b) purposes like a non-final


determination.  I think that's the argument.


MR. ZIDLICKY:  Justice Souter, and perhaps


this -- this is -- I don't think this is an exceptional


case in this regard.  When he went back --


QUESTION:  Well, he may be wrong that it's an


exceptional case, but that's the argument that he's


making, isn't it?

 MR. ZIDLICKY:  Well, the argument that he's


making is, he's entitled to relitigate a claim that has


been adjudicated against the --


QUESTION:  No, he's not making that blanket


statement.  He's saying that in a case like this, in which


the finality which is claimed does not rest on a merits


determination, I ought to have a chance under 60(b).


MR. ZIDLICKY:  Well, I do think that this is --


this case is fundamentally different than the case in


Stewart and Slack.  In those cases, what the court had


determined was, it wasn't a second or successive habeas


petition.  You weren't seeking to relitigate, and the


reason was because you'd never received an adjudication of


the case at all.  The court didn't say no to your habeas


claim.  It said, not yet.


In Slack, the court said, go -- go exhaust.  In


Stewart, the court said, the case is not ripe.  Here what


the court -- here what the court -- the district court


told him was, they didn't say not yet, the court said no,


you're going to lose, and you're going to lose based on


precedent from this Court starting with Wainwright v.


Sykes.


Really what they're asking is for an -- a


loophole to this -- to the requirement for second and


successive petitions for procedurally defaulted cases, and

25

if that's the loophole, then there's no way to distinguish


that from abuse of -- abuse of the writ cases, because in


both instances, you can make the argument that there


wasn't any ruling on the substantive merits, but there was


a ruling, and the one that's important was, he received an


adjudication, and if he disagreed with that adjudication


he should have --


QUESTION:  Could you describe for me what


portion of Rule 60(b) is still operative with reference to


mistakes, given AEDPA?  Does AEDPA completely supersede


Rule 60(b) with reference to the category of mistakes and,


if not, how would you characterize or describe for us what


remains of Rule 60(b)?


MR. ZIDLICKY:  I think what -- the analysis that


the Court would have to determine is whether there had 

been an adjudication.  If later on there's a claim, after


the court has decided the issue, that there was a mistake


of fact or a mistake of law, the question is, are you


trying to relitigate the issue, and if that's the case


then 60(b) wouldn't apply.


But if you're saying that there was never


adjudication in the first place for the example of a judge


who had been bribed in the first Federal habeas


proceedings, you would say, well, that's not a second or


successive habeas application --

 QUESTION:  As to anything that's been


adjudicated, the category of mistakes is removed from Rule


60(b) when AEDPA is in the picture?


MR. ZIDLICKY:  I think if there's been an


adjudication, and I think that's the sense that -- in your


decision in Slack -- that's the underlying issue.


Now, it -- that doesn't mean that there's no


relief.  You can -- you can try to seek to file a second


or successive habeas application, but this Court in Davis


versus Pitchess made clear that Rule 60(b) is not a way of


circumventing the requirements of AEDPA, and you in


Calderon made clear that what AEDPA prohibits is the


relitigation of a claim that had been adjudicated, and


that's exactly what we have in this case.  There had been


an adjudication. 
 He claims that it was wrong. 

QUESTION:  I think -- I think you're saying that


if there's an adjudication, there's no room for a 60(b)


motion predicated on a mistake.  That's your submission?


MR. ZIDLICKY:  That is my submission.  I don't


think there was a mistake here.  I --


QUESTION:  I understand, but that's your


submission.  In construing Rule 60(b), it simply does not


apply if there's been an adjudication, but my suggestion


to you is that the only time 60(b) applies is when you've


got a judgment you want to reopen.

 MR. ZIDLICKY:  Well, Your Honor -- and the


reason that 60(b) -- you know, one of the arguments that


petitioner makes here is, they say that, well, these


claims will rarely be granted so you don't have to worry


about it, but the -- but what AEDPA requires is, it says


these claims are -- the -- if you're trying to relitigate


a second or successive habeas application, what it does


is, it takes that away from the district court completely,


the delay in the costs that are associated with that


relitigation.


QUESTION:  I agree with everything you say if


you are correct in classifying a particular judgment -- I


mean, a particular claim as a second or successive claim.


MR. ZIDLICKY:  Right.


QUESTION: 


There are some cases, I think, when 

that classification does not fit the facts.


MR. ZIDLICKY:  But I think, though, a


determination of procedural default falls in the heartland


of habeas jurisprudence, and it's the heartland of a


determination that you're not entitled to relief.  In


Slack and in Stewart --


QUESTION:  So in your view, 60(b) necessarily


has a much more narrow application in AEDPA cases than in


other cases, or in habeas cases than in other cases?


MR. ZIDLICKY:  Yes, Justice -- Justice Kennedy,

I think that's right, and I think the reason why is


because, as this Court explained in Davis versus Pitchess,


you can't use 60(b) to circumvent the substantive


requirements of --


QUESTION:  Well, what do they really intend in


Congress if, for example, the court comes up with an


interpretation of a statute that shows the defendant


didn't commit a crime, and there he is in habeas.  He's


got a final ruling, denied.  Lo and behold the Supreme


Court comes up with a case to say, you never committed a


crime.  He looks at AEDPA.  He can't find it's a second or


successive because it says, constitutional ruling.  What's


he supposed to do?  Nothing?  And do you think Congress


meant that there was no remedy at all?


MR. ZIDLICKY: 


I think -- I think what Congress 

did was, it -- it did identify the criteria that -- that a


district court would look to in determining -- it defined


that criteria, but the one -- the one place that you could


look to is, you could then go back to this Court's


original jurisdiction under 2241 for those exceptional


circumstances.


QUESTION:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Zidlicky.

 MR. LIEBMAN:  I would like to direct the Court's


attention to pages 12 and 13 of our reply brief, the


yellow brief.  On those pages, in the footnote in the text


there are a number of cases that are cited.  Every single


one of those cases is a 60(b) case in a habeas or 2255


situation where 60(b) was granted, relief was granted and


it was determined that this was not a second or successive


petition.


In each one of those cases, the reason was


mistake of law, the U.S. Supreme Court or some other court


came down with a new decision, and in every one of those


cases, that issue was not raised on direct appeal to the


court of appeals.  It came back on a 60(b).  In each case


they had to adjudicate the question of whether it was


reasonable for them not to have raised it in the court of 

appeals at that time, and in each case they did on the


ground that the new decision that came down changed


everything, and it suddenly made what looked like a


frivolous claim at that time into what was not a frivolous


claim, but, indeed, one on which there was at least a


right to adjudication on the merits.


In some cases they won, in some they lost when


they went to the merits after they got their 60(b) relief,


but the fact is that those cases, including this Court's


GVR in Blackmon v. Money, which was a 60(b) case on a

successive, or a second, not a successive but a second


habeas petition, were cases where they had not been raised


on appeal, but they -- they were determined to be at least


potentially ones where there was a reasonable basis for


not having done it, and frivolousness, not making


frivolous claims is such a basis.  This Court in Gomez and


other cases has been particularly emphatic that habeas


petitioners should not -- especially in capital cases --


should not be raising frivolous claims.


The second thing I want to point to is that the


2244(b)(3)(E), which says that there is no -- it not only


says the Supreme Court can't take a cert petition, it says


that rehearing petitions can't be held in the court of


appeals, but the court of appeals are unanimous in saying,


if the question is whether this is a second or successive 

petition, that can be reheard.  That's not governed by


2244(b)(3)(E).


We can separate that question out, and we can


decide that, and it's exactly the same thing here.  The


key case there is Mancuso in the Second Circuit, 166 F.3d


97, so the courts have been separating out those


questions, saying if it's a question of jurisdiction --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Liebman.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the


55 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
