CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


first this morning in No. 00-1519, United States against


Ralph Arvizu.


Mr. Schlick.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SCHLICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Since Terry, this Court has held repeatedly that


reasonable suspicion analysis requires a common sense


evaluation of the totality of the circumstances.  The


decision below is fundamentally inconsistent with that


rule because it requires law enforcement officers to


disregard potentially relevant facts when determining


whether investigative stop is warranted. 


This Court's decisions in Cortez and Sokolow are


especially clear in rejecting attempts to put categories


of facts off limits.  In Cortez, the Court held that a


vehicle's route, the timing of its trip, and its capacity


for carrying illegal aliens together established


reasonable suspicion, notwithstanding that each of those


facts independently might be consistent with innocent


travel.

 In Sokolow, the Court rejected a rule that would


have limited officers' ability to consider the personal


characteristics of suspected drug smugglers.  The Court


held that that sort of rule adds to the difficulty of


applying the reasonable suspicion standard.  It does not


ease it.  And the Court further confirmed that innocent


facts, facts consistent with innocent travel, in


themselves may together establish reasonable suspicion.


In this case, the Ninth Circuit attempted to


establish a rule that would bar categorically


consideration of certain facts that the court deemed


innocent.  That -- that rule presents two fundamental


problems. 


The first is that it doesn't accommodate the


subtleties of real world encounters.  For every


categorical rule, there would have to be exceptions and


subrules, and even if law enforcement officers could be


asked to master those, they would still then have to


anticipate new situations, and those rules could not


provide guidance when --


QUESTION:  Mr. Schlick, you said this is an area


in which one can use one's common sense, and I thought


that what the Ninth Circuit was telling us was that some


items in that list under all circumstances wouldn't cast


suspicion.  And one was -- had a certain familiar ring

with me that when you see a police car, you slow down. 


This wasn't a car that came to a screeching halt or was


trying to dodge it, and then it just slowed down.  And


isn't that a most natural reaction? 


MR. SCHLICK:  The problem, Justice Ginsburg, was


that the Ninth Circuit didn't admit of situations in which


deceleration might be relevant.  For example, in the 


Fifth Circuit's Villalobos case, which we cited in our


brief, the law enforcement officer pulled in front of the


vehicle that was suspected.  The vehicle then slowed to


drop back away from the law enforcement officer vehicle,


and the Border Patrol officer in that case deemed that


suspicious, that it appeared that the vehicle had changed


its speed in order to increase its distance from the


law --


QUESTION:  But they weren't talking about that


case.  They were talking about this case.  And I thought


what they were saying was that there was nothing


suspicious about the slowdown here, and if that's all that


you have, it won't do.


MR. SCHLICK:  Justice Ginsburg, we read the


court of appeals opinion as attempting to establish


categorical rules.  On page 12a of the petition appendix,


the court says, we attempt here to describe and clearly


delimit the extent to which certain factors may be

considered by law enforcement officers in making stops


such as the stop here.  On the same page, slowing down


after spotting a law enforcement vehicle is an entirely


normal response that is in no way indicative of criminal


activity.  That -- that appears not to have made a -- the


possibility that deceleration may in some context be


suspicious. 


And indeed, in the Ninth Circuit's Sigmond-


Ballesteros case, decided after this case, the Ninth


Circuit interpreted its decision in this case as holding


that only certain factors may be considered by law


enforcement officers when making stops.  And it's -- it's


that categorical rule that is inconsistent with the


totality of the circumstances test. 


QUESTION:  I suppose it would be suspicious if


-- if you're on a highway that has not only a maximum


speed but a minimum speed, and -- and the car slows down


20 miles below the minimum when it -- when it sees a


police officer.  That -- that wouldn't be a normal


reaction, would it? 


MR. SCHLICK:  No.  No, it would not. 


QUESTION:  And -- and do you think it's a normal


reaction always to slow down when one sees a police -- a


police car even if you happen to be going 10 miles below


the speed limit already?

 MR. SCHLICK:  It may depend on the particular


area, and that's -- that may be a question on which you


would look to the law enforcement officer's experience and


expertise.


QUESTION:  I don't do it.  Maybe you do it.  But


if I'm 10 miles under the speed limit already, I -- I


don't immediately slow down when I see a police car.  I


don't know why you are willing to accept that as a -- as


an image of reality that everybody slows down when you see


a police car.  If you're -- if you're going over the speed


limit, I assume you do.


MR. SCHLICK:  I think your intuition accords


with common experience and the holdings of most courts.


QUESTION:  There was a concrete record here of


what this driver was doing, and he wasn't going 10 miles


an hour.  He was going a -- a normal speed.


MR. SCHLICK:  Justice Ginsburg, on page 57 of


the joint appendix, Agent Stoddard testified that the


extreme deceleration in this case, from about 50 to 55


miles per hour down to about 25 or 30 miles per hour, was


not normal and did set respondent's vehicle apart from


ordinary traffic on those roads.


QUESTION:  What was the speed limit on the


roads?


MR. SCHLICK:  Between 25 miles per hour and 35

miles per hour, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And that's what he slowed down to.


QUESTION:  That was an established speed limit?


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, Your Honor.  In -- in the


joint appendix, there are photographs which show speed


limit signs, and it's 35 miles per hour down near the


southern portion of the roads, 25 in the northern portion.


QUESTION:  What -- what was the portion where --


where he slowed down?  I mean, it was 25 to 35?  No.  It


was either 25 or 35.  What was it, do you know? 


MR. SCHLICK:  I -- I don't know for sure.  I --


I would guess it was 25, but I don't know for sure.


QUESTION:  But that's what he slowed down to. 


So, he had been going above the speed limit.


QUESTION:  That sounds a lot more reasonable


then.  I mean, gee, if you don't slow down to the speed


limit when you see a police car, you're in big trouble.


(Laughter.) 


MR. SCHLICK:  Again, Agent Stoddard testified


that that sort of deceleration, that speed, was not common


in the area, and it --


QUESTION:  You mean they just keep zipping along


at 50 despite seeing a police car.  What part of the


country is this anyway? 


(Laughter.)

 QUESTION:  It's Arizona. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  What was the nature of the road?  Was


-- was it a regularly paved road? 


MR. SCHLICK:  No, Mr. Chief Justice.  The road


on which respondent was apprehended was a dirt road.  It


was a road that Agent Stoddard testified is used primarily


by the local ranchers and by Forest Service vehicles and


by the Border Patrol itself.  It's -- it's not an improved


highway.  And it was extremely unusual, Agent Stoddard


believed, for a vehicle, a minivan, to be on these roads,


and it was a notorious smuggling route. 


QUESTION:  Is this one on exhibit 5 of the joint


appendix, or have I got the wrong road there?  Exhibit 5


is Kuykendall Cutoff Road and Rucker Canyon Road.


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.  The -- the


photographs at the back of the joint appendix depict the


route.  They -- they moved from the southerly portion of


the route up, as you get back to the later pages, toward


the northern portion.  Exhibit 24, for instance, is the


intersection of Kuykendall Road and Rucker Canyon Road,


which is very close to where the apprehension occurred.


The maps in the joint appendix on pages 155 and


157 show the area at issue.  And you can see the first of


those maps on page 155 shows the route beginning at the

bottom of the page in the center, Leslie Canyon Road. 


Respondent then -- and that's -- that's paved for about 10


miles, about the first 10 miles near Douglas. 


Respondent traveled north on that road and then


at the T intersection you see approximately in the middle


of the page, by which point the -- the roads become


unpaved, headed right, away from the Border Patrol


checkpoint, away from the highway, which would take you


north, through the dirt road, proceeded up Rucker Canyon


Road, about three-quarters of the way up the page.  That's


an important intersection.


QUESTION:  Well, he turned left rather than


right, didn't he? 


MR. SCHLICK:  I'm sorry.  Turned -- turned right


at the intersection, at that T intersection where Leslie


Canyon Road jogs right, then stayed on Leslie Canyon Road,


took a left on Rucker Canyon.  And that was a critical


turn. 


Had he gone right, he would have been going


towards the only recreation areas in the vicinity.  And


that might have explained the presence of cargo in his --


in his minivan.  Agent Stoddard could see that there


appeared to be cargo on the floor of the van.  But he


instead turned left, away from the only -- the local


recreation area and on a route that, if he then took --

took a right onto Kuykendall Road, which is -- which is


again almost in the center of the page near the top


between numbers 2 and 3 -- if he took that right on


Kuykendall Road, then he would be circumventing the Border


Patrol checkpoint which is indicated by number 1 on the


left-hand margin of the page.


QUESTION:  The idea that he would eventually go


north on Kuykendall and then take -- go west to rejoin 191


north of the checkpoint.


MR. SCHLICK:  That -- that's right, and then


head up to I-10, which would allow him to go to Tucson --


Tucson or Phoenix, for example.  And it was that route


which Agent Stoddard testified is a notorious smuggling


route, very rarely used by anyone except ranchers and


Forest Service personnel --


QUESTION:  Although it is a route that could


have been used by people going up to the Chiricahuas.


MR. SCHLICK:  It's -- it's possible, Your Honor,


but --


QUESTION:  From Douglas. 


MR. SCHLICK:  -- the district court addressed


that possibility on page 22a of the petition appendix and


said that that would require a 40 or 50 mile trip over


unimproved dirt roads.  The most logical way to go is to


take I-191 straight up I-181 and then across to Chiricahua

National Monument. 


That's particularly significant in this case


because the registration of the minivan was to a block


that was just two blocks from I-191 in Douglas, and that


makes it all the more inexplicable that a -- a vehicle


that should know the roads would go out of its way to


Leslie Canyon Road, rather than just going two blocks,


picking up the highway and heading straight north.  You


know, that's -- that's the route that you would take if it


were a long distance trip. 


I said that the cargo couldn't be explained by


the recreation area, because it had already passed the


turn on Rucker Canyon Road.  Nor could it be explained by


a long distance trip because the highway is the road that


you would take if you were headed on -- on a long distance


with children with suitcases or overnight bags. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Schlick, could I come back to the


-- to the slowing -- slowing up?  I'm not quite sure what


the -- what the Government's objection to the court's


opinion is.  I -- I would tend to think that -- that it is


true, in the circumstances of this case, that if somebody


is barreling along at 50, sees a police car, and slows


down to 25, that is not at all suspicious.  Indeed, I -- I


might consider it suspicious if he continued barreling


along at 50.

 So, you know, if your argument is that in the


circumstances of this case, the slowing down was


suspicious, I -- I don't think I agree with you.  On the


other hand, it is the case that the court of appeals


seemed to have -- seems to say that slowing down can never


be suspicious. 


Now, which of the two are -- are you objecting


to?  Do you really think that -- I mean, that there was


proper suspicion in this case simply because the person


slowed down to the speed limit when he saw the police car?


MR. SCHLICK:  In this case, Justice Scalia, the


deceleration is -- is not a factor on which the case would


turn.  There were other indications of nervousness which


I'd like to discuss in a moment. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  So, as to that factor, your --


your -- really your only objection is you can't be as


categorical as the court of appeals put the point. 


MR. SCHLICK:  That's -- that's exactly right. 


We think it's a good example of the error of the court of


appeals' approach. 


But in this case, even looking at the factor of


nervousness, there were other indications.  After


decelerating, respondent drove past the Border Patrol


vehicle and stared rigidly straight ahead, without looking


at or acknowledging Agent Stoddard, which --

 QUESTION:  May I ask this question?  At the very


page of the opinion that you call our attention to, the


court of appeals said, in reaching our conclusion, we find


that some of the factors on which the district court


relied are neither relevant nor appropriate to a


reasonable suspicious -- suspicion analysis in this case. 


And are you agreeing with Justice Scalia that the slowing


down in this case was not relevant?


MR. SCHLICK:  Justice Stevens, we would say that


it had some relevance.  It was -- it was not a


particularly important factor, but it had some relevance. 


The -- the court of appeals I think --


QUESTION:  Do you think the court of appeals


erred in saying that in this case it had no relevance?


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, Justice Stevens. 


QUESTION:  I see. 


QUESTION:  And what about -- what about, you


know, not -- not waving to the police car as you go by?  I


don't know when I -- if I were ever exceeding the speed


limit and saw --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  -- and saw a police car, it seems to


me I would slow down and -- and try to give the impression


that I wasn't slowing down because I saw the police car.

 QUESTION:  I mean, you know, you don't hit the


brake and wave at the police officer. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  So, why is that a suspicious factor? 


I don't see why in the circumstances of this case that's a


suspicious factor either.


MR. SCHLICK:  Agent Stoddard's testimony was


that both respondent and his front-seat adult passenger


stared straight ahead.  The respondent gripped the wheel


very tightly in -- in a position that Agent Stoddard


deemed characteristic of someone who simply wants to melt


into their vehicle if possible, and --


QUESTION:  Or maybe somebody who had been going


50 miles an hour in a 25-mile-an-hour zone.


MR. SCHLICK:  Again, Agent Stoddard's testimony


was -- was that respondent's behavior was -- was very


unusual. 


And after he saw those -- those and began to


follow the minivan, there was another indication of


nervousness, which was at the intersection of Rucker


Canyon Road and Kuykendall Road.  Respondent turned on his


blinker, well ahead of the intersection, then turned it


off, drove towards the intersection, and just before the


intersection, made a sharp turn and turned on his blinker


again, which again indicated uncertainty or nervousness,

which supported the inference that he was unusually


distracted by the presence of the Border Patrol vehicle. 


QUESTION:  What's the testimony as to the amount


of use this particular route got?  How many cars a day,


anything about how many cars a day or an hour came over


it?


MR. SCHLICK:  The testimony, Mr. Chief Justice,


was that this road -- the sensor hits on -- the Border


Patrol maintains sensors along Leslie Canyon Road and


Rucker Canyon Road, and that the first sensor on Leslie


Canyon Road, which responded to northbound traffic, was


triggered about once every 2 hours. 


QUESTION:  So, that would mean one car every 2


hours? 


MR. SCHLICK:  Correct.  And -- and that's


directly relevant to the expected response.  When you're


in an area where one car travels approximately every 2


hours, you're more likely to acknowledge perhaps a


friendly wave -- another vehicle.  This road was extremely


remote, and again, most of the traffic was local vehicles


from -- from the ranches, and the minivan was a vehicle


which was not only unusual by type for this road, because


it was not a four-wheel drive vehicle, but also had the


capability of carrying a large amount of concealed cargo,


which made it well-suited to smuggling activity.  This

Court noted in Brignoni-Ponce that that is a factor that


is potentially relevant when determining whether


investigative stop is warranted in the border context.


The -- the second problem with the court of


appeals approach, in addition to the fact that it can't


comprehend the subtleties the real world encounters, is


that it's unrealistic to ask officers to put out of their


minds facts that they see before them and believe to be


relevant.  Even if officers could do that, they would then


be left to speculate about the hypothetical import of the


imagined set of facts, and that's going to --


QUESTION:  One -- one of the things the Ninth


Circuit said is just looking at this laundry list and just


to throw everything in and mix it all up and say it's


suspicious that the driver didn't look at the police


officer or didn't wave, but it's equally suspicious that


the children did wave.  So, one characterization of that


was damned if you do, damned if you don't.  If you wave,


that's no good, and if you don't wave, that's no good. 


And I think that the -- the Ninth Circuit can't be faulted


for saying it's not good enough just to list everything

perceive and say it was all relevant.  Some of it is


relevant and some of it isn't. 


Why would, for example, the children -- how old

were the children, by the way?


MR. SCHLICK:  12, 10, and 7.


QUESTION:  And the children were waving in the


back, and something was to be inferred from that? 


MR. SCHLICK:  They weren't simply waving, Your


Honor.  Without turning toward the Border Patrol


vehicle --


QUESTION:  They were waving forward. 


MR. SCHLICK:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  And -- and the car -- the police --


the Border Patrol car was behind them.


MR. SCHLICK:  Correct.  It may be expected that


a Border Patrol agent would have some experience with


children's reaction to him in his vehicle.  And in this


case he said he -- he hadn't seen anything like this.  It


went on for about 4 or 5 minutes.  It was methodical.  The


children waved together, facing forward without -- without


facing Agent Stoddard. 


With respect to the damned if you do/damned if


you don't argument, waving or not waving, the court of


appeals ignored the fact that -- Agent Stoddard's


testimony was that he deemed it suspicious that when the


Border Patrol vehicle was stopped and respondent drove


past, respondent didn't acknowledge him at all.  After


that, he turned and began to follow respondent's vehicle,

and it was only at that point that the children began


their odd waving.  So, it's a reasonable inference that


having failed in his effort to avoid the -- the Border


Patrol officer's attention, respondent then went to plan


B, which was we'll attempt to -- to look like a family on


-- on an outing, and one way of -- of perhaps deflecting


the agent's suspicion is to have the children wave.  But


that resulted, from Agent Stoddard's perspective, in a --


a very odd circumstance, and that's the exactly the sort


of situation that the reasonable suspicion analysis --


QUESTION:  To -- to what extent, Mr. Schlick, do


three judges, say, sitting in San Francisco or Los Angeles


or nine Justices sitting here -- do we defer to the


judgment in these matters of a Border Patrol agent on the


scene? 


MR. SCHLICK:  Ornelas, among other cases,


addressed that, Your Honor, and -- and held that it's


appropriate to give due weight to the expertise and


experience of law enforcement officers and local judges. 


And in this case, both Agent Stoddard and -- and the trial


judge deemed this route to be unusual, to be associated


with smuggling.  It deemed -- the trial judge deemed the


factors that I've enumerated to be significant in the


context of what was going on out there, and I believe


those are the trial judge's words.  We have to look at

this in the context of what was going on out there. 


The cargo, for example.  He considered the


possibility that it might just be camping supplies, but he


said that would be -- that would be a possible inference


were it not for all the other indications of illegality. 


So, he -- he correctly undertook to analyze the facts --


QUESTION:  May I ask this question?  I got the


impression, in reading the officer's testimony, what he


really did is once he checked and found where the car came


from, where it was registered in a high drug area, that's


what triggered his decision to stop the vehicle.  And my


question to you is supposing all he knew was the very


unusual circumstances of a family driving in an area


that's mostly driven through by ranchers and -- and not


families.  That fact, the rare amount of traffic on the


road, and the -- and the location from which the car


originated, would that be enough in your view?


MR. SCHLICK:  If you --


QUESTION:  -- put aside all these rather unusual


things like waving and slowing down and so forth.  Would


those three facts be enough in your view to justify the


stop? 


MR. SCHLICK:  As -- as I understand your


question, no, I don't think they would be.  But when you


start adding factors such as missing the turnoff to the

recreation areas, such as carrying the concealed cargo --


QUESTION:  Well, missing the turnoff is part of


the location, as I say.  The unusual location of the


vehicle at the time of the stop.  Is that -- and the fact


it was not the normal.  You normally see ranchers or -- or


Border Patrol people.  You don't normally see families out


there.  That's a -- that's a road that is not usually


used.  Is the -- I'm just wondering if the rarity of the


-- of the general scene plus the fact that they did --


that the officer did check and find that this vehicle was


registered in the -- in the area known for drug smuggling,


was that enough?  I think you said no.


MR. SCHLICK:  Is -- in your hypothetical,


Justice Stevens, is the fact that it was a minivan?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, yes.  If you knew that it was


a minivan, which was out of character, suited to carrying


aliens, and knew that the route had been taken, that last


turn onto Kuykendall Road, north so that the minivan would


not approach the checkpoint, then yes, there would be


reasonable suspicion.


QUESTION:  In other words, you're saying -- what


you're saying I think is that even if the Ninth Circuit


were correct in disregarding the waving and the slowing


down and the failure to wave once, you'd still have a

reasonable suspicion.


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, Justice Stevens.  It would be


our position that even if you consider only the three


factors that the court of appeals considered categorically


in the analysis -- that would be the route, the fact that


it was a minivan, and the time.  The time was when the


Border Patrol was likely to have stepped down its


surveillance.  The court of appeals held if you considered


those factors, there was no reasonable suspicion.  We


would disagree and say even if you only consider those


factors, there was reasonable suspicion.  But the


appropriate analysis is to consider all the factors


collectively, and then clearly there were grounds for the


stop. 


If the Court has no further questions --


QUESTION:  I have another question, if -- if you


have the time. 


This checkpoint is about 30 miles north of the


border.  Was there also a checkpoint in the --in the town


from which the car originated?  I'm just a little puzzled


at what the -- at the setup here, why there's the


checkpoint 30 miles from the border, and whether or not


there was one closer to the border. 


MR. SCHLICK:  There -- there's a border


inspection station in -- in Douglas, but the Court

explained in Martinez-Fuerte the -- the criteria the


Border Patrol uses to establish its fixed checkpoints, and


I think those criteria continue to hold true today.  One


of them is that the checkpoint should be outside, about 25


miles from the border, because 25 miles is the zone in


which a border crossing card allows an alien to travel. 


So, you would -- so, you would be stopping aliens who were


-- who were legally there because of their border crossing


card. 


Also, you want your checkpoint to be somewhat


remote from -- from the population center.  Douglas is a


town of about 15,000 people.  And you want your -- your


checkpoint to capture traffic which is heading north, away


from the border, rather than just local traffic within


that area. 


QUESTION:  And then the other question I had is


about the sensors.  There were two sensors triggered in


this case, as I understand the record.  Are there -- are


the sensors spotted purely in order to identify every


vehicle that uses this particular road that this -- this


man used?


MR. SCHLICK:  The sensors are magnetic sensors


which are directional.  So, they don't pick up southbound


travel, which would -- which would not be consistent with


smuggling away from the border.  They do pick up all

northbound traffic.  So, it would pick local --


QUESTION:  Well, they picked up not only the


northbound, but also the fact that he turned right the


first time.  No, left the first time.  He passed the


Rucker Canyon Road. 


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes.  In this case there were two


sensors.  One was before Rucker Canyon Road.  When that


sensor was triggered, Agent Stoddard began to drive


towards respondent to -- to check out the sensor hit.  And


then a second sensor was triggered after respondent turned


left on Rucker Canyon Road and away from the national


forest. 


QUESTION:  Away from the recreational area. 


MR. SCHLICK:  That's right. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Schlick. 


Ms. Brambl, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTORIA A. BRAMBL


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. BRAMBL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


I wanted to respond to the question that you


asked, Mr. Chief Justice, about who should we give due


weight to and who is going to know better, the officer in


the field, the district court, or the court of appeals.

And certainly the decision in Ornelas v. United States


does instruct us that we give weight -- we review for


clear error the -- the factual findings that the district


court made.  However, inferences from those findings that


the district court makes and -- and that the officer makes


are reviewed.  They're reviewed giving due weight to


those.  That is not as strict or rigorous as the standard


as for clear error. 


And then finally, Ornelas -- that decision


really wanted and instructed the courts -- the courts of


appeal to issue opinions that were instructive to firm up


the precedent and to offer guidance to everybody, to


officers in the field, to litigants, to district courts. 


And really, the Ninth Circuit in this case -- they handle


the lion's share, over two-thirds of -- or approximately


two-thirds of the border stop cases come from the Ninth


Circuit.  They also have developed experience.  They've


developed both practical experience in seeing these cases


over and over again and seeing neutral and rote factors


offered over and over again that really don't have any


weight.  And they're instructing through this opinion and


several other opinions that they've issued over the last


20 or 30 years --


QUESTION:  All those -- that type of opinion


seems to me contrary to our opinion in Sokolow where we

said you just can't categorize these kind of factors and


say that this kind of thing is never useful and something


else is always useful. 


MS. BRAMBL:  I think that all the parties agree


that the totality cannot have categorical rules because --


QUESTION:  Well, then certainly you -- you must


-- you're not defending then some parts of the Ninth


Circuit opinion.  Is that correct? 


MS. BRAMBL:  I think that some of the language


that the Ninth Circuit used was inartful in that it made


it sound -- if you take one sentence out of the whole


opinion, it would make it sound like they were creating


categorical rules.  But when you read everything, the


whole opinion, in the context, they do cite all of the


cases this Court has decided:  Sokolow, Terry, Cortez,


Brignoni-Ponce, Wardlow.  They say that they consider


everything.


But then they go through factor by factor.  And


I do defend the way they went about that, separating out


the factors and discussing them because it seems that that


would be the only orderly way to go about the analysis,


and the only way to -- to offer an opinion that really


does give some instruction and guidance. 


QUESTION:  How -- how is that?  I was quite


disturbed actually by the opinion because I thought there

were five or six Supreme Court cases that say this is just


the kind of opinion you should not write.  So, then I -- I


went through it, and it says, for example, one of the


factors, the fact the minivan slowed, is prohibited by our


precedent.  Well, my own common sense reaction would be it


all depends.  If he was going 40 miles an hour and slowed


to 10 in -- in 2 seconds, I'd say, why in the middle of


the desert did he feel compelled to slow so much?  I -- I


suspect people don't give tickets in Arizona for driving


50 miles in the middle of the desert.  Maybe they do, but


it doesn't say that.  I think it would depend. 


He says that the fact that a van is registered


to an address in a block notorious for smuggling is of no


significance and may not be given any weight. 


Then there are four or five others which are


listed where the second factor is of questionable value.


The failure -- he has five of them there, which say our


precedent says you give no weight. 


Now, I just don't see how to square that either


with Ornelas, Sokolow, or five other precedents of this


Court, as well as with common sense, because it seems to


me it would all depend. 


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, I certainly agree that --


that there may be circumstances in which where you live or


slowing down could be.  With respect to the first one,

where they do say squarely prohibited by our precedent,


they go ahead and -- and then relate instances where


slowing down -- where they do find that this is


suspicious.  Just merely the act of slowing down they have


determined, using common sense and -- and I think a lot of


the comments this morning illustrate that if maybe not a


universal reaction, it's so common to slow down when you


see a law enforcement officer, that it's meaningless.


QUESTION:  Maybe -- maybe we really don't know


enough to say that.  I -- I was engaging in that


conversation with the Government's counsel.  But -- but in


point of fact, I'm not sure what the reaction is, as -- as


Justice Breyer puts it, out in the middle of the desert.


For one thing, I don't know whether -- whether


Border Patrol officers can give speeding tickets.  For


another thing, I don't know whether it's generally known


that Border Patrol officers cannot give speeding tickets.


And therefore, I don't know whether it's, indeed, quite


common out in the middle of the -- of the vast desert of


Arizona for people to go barreling along at 50 miles an


hour past a Border Patrol agent and ordinarily to wave and


say hi. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  These are all matters that I'm sure


the Border Patrol agent was aware of, and perhaps the

district court.  I'm less certain that the court of


appeals out in San Francisco was -- was aware of all of


those things.  Why shouldn't I give the Border Patrol


agent and the district court the benefit of the doubt?


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, the agent -- like so many of


the factors in this case, the agent didn't really tie down


or tie into his experience why slowing down would be


predictive or indicative of not just speeding but of


criminal activity such as alien or drug smuggling, which


was the reason that he was out there. 


QUESTION:  Well, he said, people, when they see


my Border Patrol car, normally don't slow down.  He


certainly said that, and he found that to be unusual. 


Now, why -- why should I think that that is false?


MS. BRAMBL:  Well --


QUESTION:  Do you know, as a matter of fact,


whether Border Patrol agents give speeding tickets? 


MS. BRAMBL:  I think that that's an open


question. 


QUESTION:  It's an open question whether they


give speeding tickets? 


MS. BRAMBL:  But I believe that generally --


QUESTION:  Don't they have other things to do?


MS. BRAMBL:  They do have other things to do.  I


believe that if driving would be characterized as

dangerous where maybe the public was in jeopardy, that


they would be authorized to make a stop, but just because


someone is speeding or violating an Arizona traffic law, I


don't believe that they would make such a stop.


But I wanted to point out that the Ninth Circuit


opinion went on, after they said that this factor was


squarely prohibited, to say the kinds of ways that slowing


down or a deceleration would be indicative of reasonable


suspicion or would -- would have some weight.  And they


characterized that as evasive driving where -- where


perhaps the Border Patrol is seen and then there's an act


of evasion as well as deceleration.


QUESTION:  Ms. Brambl, the -- the district court


ruled for the Government in this case, and the Ninth


Circuit reversed.  And I don't see that in the district


court's opinion, which the court of appeals was -- was


reviewing, that same laundry list that appears in the


Ninth Circuit's decision.  So, what I don't understand is


if you just take the district court's opinion, what did


the district court rely on that could be questionable? 


The district judge did not rely on the children waving, as


I recall. 


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, the district court judge did


refer to that, but what's -- what the -- the court of


appeals picked up on, which the district court didn't, was

all of the inferences that -- and subjective beliefs that


this waving entailed because it wasn't just -- the


children were facing forward and waving forward.  So, it


was a big leap that they were even waving at the agent to


begin with and an even bigger leap that the agent made


that they were coached to do so, presumably by the driver


or the adult passengers.  And that's what the Ninth


Circuit seized on.


And another big deficiency with this is how does


waving or waving in a mechanical, odd way, as the district


court found -- how would that be tied in to criminal


behavior?  And the record doesn't indicate how.


QUESTION:  How do we know from the record what


kind of wave it was?  What -- what he says in his


testimony is they kind of stuck their hands up and began


waving to me like this.  Well, I'm sorry. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  There we are.  Okay? 


Now, the person who saw that was the district


judge, and the way it was characterized by the policeman


is it wasn't in a normal pattern.  It looked like they


were instructed to do so.  And without being able to see


what he did, it's a little tough for me.  And -- and so, I


don't know.  What the courts both say is it doesn't add


much.

 The odd thing about the court of appeals opinion


is it seems to suggest, because it doesn't prove the case,


it's not relevant.  Now, I -- I mean, what's the response


to that? 


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, I think that -- that goes to


the heart of the issue presented by this case, which is


what can the court of appeals exclude as factors, even if


they do it on a case-by-case basis.  Can they look at


factors and just say, you know what, this is so marginally


relevant or completely weightless that we're not going to


-- to count it in the equation?  And although I don't


defend this --


QUESTION:  But it does seem as though the Ninth


Circuit was trying to suggest that no other court could


consider it in the calculus either in the future and --


and was making some kind of effort to develop some more


rigid guidelines than we've seen in the past.


Let me tell you what concerns me very frankly. 


We live in a perhaps more dangerous age today than we did


when this event took place.  And are we going to back off


from totality of the circumstances in an era when it may


become very important to us to have that as the overall


test?  And I'm concerned that the Ninth Circuit opinion


seemed to be a little more rigid than our precedents


require or that common sense would dictate today.

 MS. BRAMBL:  Well, I certainly agree that


totality and reasonableness has to remain flexible, and


that given the times that we live in, that perhaps


adjustments are going to be made.  Thankfully this case I


don't know presents the -- the specter of that. 


And it -- it seems that what the Ninth Circuit


tried to do in this case was to really provide some


meaningful guidance.  They could have just listed the


factors in a very straight forward way without any


discussion and just said, you know what?  We add all these


together and there's no reasonable suspicion.  And we


probably wouldn't be here today.  However, what they tried


to do I think is to provide some guidance for everybody


because when we get these cases as --


QUESTION:  When we have said that the test is


totality of the circumstances, the amount of guidance that


can be provided by -- by a court is -- is somewhat


limited.


MS. BRAMBL:  It is but there's a surprising

QUESTION:  A surprising repetition of factors by


the Ninth Circuit.


MS. BRAMBL:  Well -- well, even this Court in


Ornelas recognized that certain fact patterns were


similar, such as Sokolow and Royer and a few others, that

really -- given how fact-specific they are, there really


is, especially when you start looking in border areas


where -- for instance, there are a number of stops where


there are checkpoints and -- and people claiming that


perhaps these people are on the road for checkpoint


evasion purposes. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but -- but you know, checkpoints


vary too.  The checkpoint north of San Diego is -- is in a


heavily populated area where things may be quite different


than out here in the Sulphur Springs Valley where there


aren't very many people. 


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, sure.  It seems that -- that


if you look through, for instance, just Ninth Circuit


opinions, or if you go over to Fifth Circuit and Tenth


Circuit, but also look at the -- the border areas, you do


see surprising number of repetition, even though perhaps


some are in very urbanized areas and some are in rural


areas.


QUESTION:  Well, that's -- that's true.  The


officers are -- are trained to tell the district court,


the finder of fact, all of the factors that entered into


their judgment.  It seems to me, though, a fair reading, a


necessary reading of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, that we


now have seven factors that every officer in the Ninth


Circuit must memorize and not rely on.  And I just don't

see how that's consistent with the ability of the police


to perform their work or consistent at all with our


opinions.  And as the court -- as the Government has told


us, the Ninth Circuit itself has construed this opinion in


subsequent cases precisely that way.


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, the Ninth Circuit, even since


this opinion, still examines all of the factors.  They


still look at the totality even in the Sigmond-Ballesteros


case that the Government cited in its briefs.  However --


QUESTION:  You have a point that's a serious


point I think.  The first time I see a case where the


policeman testifies I -- I stopped this individual because


he looked nervous as he came away from the airplane down


to the baggage counter, and he looked both ways, and then


there was sweat on his upper lip and he walked around the


baggage thing, and then, looking around, went over to his


suitcase -- the first time you see that, you think, well,


that makes sense to me.  But when you see exactly the same


thing 15 times, you begin to wonder.  Now, that I guess is


your point.


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, it -- well, it is.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, what do we do about that? 


I had thought that the way to deal with it is -- totality


of the circumstances is the way to deal with it, not


having rigid rules that say you can never consider whether

his -- he was sweating or wasn't sweating.  In other


words, I don't see how a rigid rule helps.  It puts too


many cases on one -- it gets the wrong cases.  It doesn't


draw a sensible line. 


Now, what's your view of that?  I see your


problem.  I want to know the solution. 


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, I think that the solution is


to allow courts like the Ninth Circuit and other circuits


to say, look, we see the same thing time and time again,


and it really has very little or no meaning.  Officers, we


want you to tell us why this factor is suspicious.  It's


not going to be enough anymore to come in and just say, he


looked nervous, he slowed down.  And --


QUESTION:  But that -- and I -- I think your --


your point is -- is well taken as far as you go, but it


seems to me that that's not going to help the Ninth


Circuit opinion here because what you're saying is don't


rely on highly general factors which are so general that


we really, in the abstract, don't know where they point. 


Be more specific.  Give us facts not conclusions.  But


that's not -- that's not what the Ninth Circuit said.  The


Ninth Circuit, in effect, said, well, we're -- we're


simply going to exclude certain categories of fact.


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, as I said, the language the


Ninth Circuit used could have been a lot more clear and a

lot more artful.


QUESTION:  Well, it might have said what you


said, but it didn't say what you said.  I mean, isn't that


so?


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, they did say frequently, and


in effect, when there was a rehearing in this case, they


amended the opinion to add under the circumstances of this


case and in this case on many, many times. 


QUESTION:  Maybe not often enough. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. BRAMBL:  It would have helped. 


QUESTION:  Because -- because initially the


opinion did read categorically we don't consider slowing


down, we don't consider kids waving, and then they threw


in a lot of under the circumstances in this case, not in


-- in every instance, but in a number of cases.  That's --


the amendment seems at odds with what the original opinion


was, which seemed to be saying we have three categories


here: never relevant, sometimes relevant, always relevant.


MS. BRAMBL:  And I think you're right.  They --


I wouldn't say that they were categorical in excluding,


but they -- they certainly did seem to suggest that --


that certain factors were not relevant, and they did add


in this case.  And basically if someone comes into court


with the exact same factor and they're not able to show

why that's relevant or probative in this case, why this


factor isn't neutral and does have an inference of


criminal activity, then that factor, if you follow the --


the other courts follow the Ninth Circuit's opinion it's


going to -- it's going to be excluded.  It's not going to


be considered as relevant or probative. 


I think that that is the kind of guidance that


the circuits should be offering. 


QUESTION:  Well, one thing that the circuit


didn't do and it did puzzle me was when I read the


district court's opinion, I thought the district court was


saying, yes, I could go along with they're in a recreation


area.  But when it came to a certain point and they made a


turn, it made no sense at all because if that's where they


were going to go, they should have gotten right on the


highway.  That seemed to be unanswered, that.  Why wasn't


-- the -- the Ninth Circuit didn't deal with that as


precisely as the district court did.


MS. BRAMBL:  That's true, but the Ninth Circuit


did point out -- and if you look at the map that's on --


on page 157 of the joint appendix -- that's the map that


we submitted in connection with this case and that the


district and the -- the Ninth Circuit considered -- it


shows that -- it's got a lot more detail, as far as a lot


of the destinations.  And when the Government said that

really there weren't any destinations beyond Rucker


Canyon, beyond where the stop occurred --


QUESTION:  Where you turn onto Kuykendall?


MS. BRAMBL:  Yes.  Once you turn onto that road


and you keep going, you can see to the east there's a


number of campgrounds, a number of areas, including --


QUESTION:  The Chiricahua?


MS. BRAMBL:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but to go from Douglas to


Chiricahua National Monument would be -- would be


extremely odd to go the route this minivan took.  You'd go


up -- up 191 and cut over above the checkpoint.


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, the van was appropriate for


that road and the conditions, and I would point out that


when the agent had --


QUESTION:  Well, if it's appropriate, if it's --


it's also appropriate to go on a paved highway, I take it.


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, sure, but --


QUESTION: 

I mean, why would you go up this


very winding road to a place that you can get to much more


quickly by going up a paved highway?


MS. BRAMBL:  It might be a -- a matter of


preference and -- and taste.  But these areas are


beautiful and --


QUESTION:  Well, you know, all of these factors

-- as Justice Breyer suggested, we're not saying that they


would prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or that they


would amount to probable cause.  But all we're talking


about is reasonable suspicion. 


MS. BRAMBL:  But it isn't suspicious for a


family from Douglas to use a road that leads right from


Douglas, that start out -- that starts out 10 miles paved,


to go through a beautiful area up to perhaps Chiricahua


Monument or some of the areas along there on the --


QUESTION:  Yes.  You can't -- it's obviously


nothing criminal.  But what -- what did the respondent


say, that he was going to meet somebody there? 


MS. BRAMBL:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  What's -- how does that tie in with


going to a recreational area?


MS. BRAMBL:  Well -- well, it really doesn't


because we know that he was involved in illegal activity,


but that's the hindsight of what the officer found after


the stop.  And the -- the --


QUESTION:  Would you comment on a -- on a phase


of the case that keeps puzzling me?  The -- the sensors on


the road.  It must be that the -- that there was some


suspicion on every vehicle that went up here because I


guess the first sensor that was triggered caused the


officer to -- to go over and take a look at the vehicle,

and that happened rarely enough, so you make a special


examination of every vehicle that trips the sensor.  And


then if they trip the second sensor, that's -- they're


doubly suspicious.  And how -- how relevant is that in the


whole picture? 


MS. BRAMBL:  Well -- well, I think what's


important to recognize is that when you look at the maps,


there aren't too many roads that lead anywhere from


Douglas because it's right on the border.  So, there's the


main road, the paved one, that the district court that Mr.


Arvizu should have taken, and then there's this dirt road,


the unpaved one, which is quite well-maintained, and they


have sensors on that to catch all the cars that avoid the


checkpoint. 


But my point is that every road that leads away


from the border is suspicious to some degree and can be


labeled that way.  It happened to be --


QUESTION:  It is particularly suspicious if


there's a much more rapid route available, rapid and


comfortable.  If you got three kids in the car, you


generally don't want a bumpy road. 


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, they were going 50 to 55


miles per hour. 


QUESTION:  I know. 


MS. BRAMBL:  And there was no testimony that the

car was flying -- the van was flying all over the place,


which -- which tells me -- and the pictures bear it out --


is that this wasn't -- it was a dirt road and it was in a


-- a fairly isolated area, not full of houses and -- and


whatnot.  But this was a decent road.


QUESTION:  It's not only an isolated area, but


the testimony was that the people who normally used the


road were locals, ranchers or others, that it was not a


road frequently traveled by families. 


MS. BRAMBL:  However, the -- that was the


testimony by the Border Patrol agent.


QUESTION:  Right. 


MS. BRAMBL:  The investigator from our office


testified that this road was used and enjoyed by all kinds


of families.  The Chiricahuas are a beautiful area. 


There are a number of areas within them that -- that are


visited by people from all over, and because they're


basically in the -- in the residents of Douglas' back


yard, people from Douglas frequent that area.  So, we


don't have a record as to how many sensor hits turn out to


be smugglers, how many turn out to be ranchers, and how


many turn out to be people from Douglas visiting the area.


QUESTION:  But we do have a record that suggests


that every time somebody trips the sensor, they go out and


take a look at them.

QUESTION:  Yes. 


MS. BRAMBL:  And -- and it would be a shame if


-- if every family on a road like that or on that road in


a minivan on a holiday would be subject to heightened


scrutiny just because this happens to be a road where


smugglers sometimes use it.  And --


QUESTION:  Is there any indication there ever


has been such a family?  I mean, I imagine if there were


an innocent family that happened to accidentally come from


an area where there is a lot of smuggling, that doesn't --


you know, not everybody is a smuggler in such an area. 


They drive with their family just for recreation 50 miles


out of the way.  Their children wave oddly. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  They screech to a halt, and there


they were, stopped.  I -- I guess they would be sort of


outraged and there might be some publicity about it.  Has


there been such a --


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, one of the problems with --


with Fourth Amendment issues is that the vast majority of


innocent people that are protected by the Fourth Amendment


often remain silent when they are subjected to arbitrary


or -- or random stops. 


QUESTION:  I'd feel much more sympathetic to --

to that person than -- than I would to your client whose


-- whose argument essentially is, yes, I was indeed a


smuggler, but -- and he suspected me to be a smuggler and


he turned out to be right.  But the suspicion was not


accurate.  I don't understand that.  Should we give any


weight to the fact that he turned out to be right?  Does


that -- does that have any bearing on whether the


suspicion was reasonable or not? 


MS. BRAMBL:  It doesn't.  In fact, if we had


that kind of test, then we would have no way to litigate


reasonable suspicion issues because the only way we get to


court --


QUESTION:  I'm not saying it's conclusive.  I'm


just saying, you know, I'm -- I'm more inclined to find


that the Border Patrol agent who stops a smuggler had a


reasonable suspicion than I am to find that a Border


Patrol agent who stops a -- a happy family out on outing


had a reasonable suspicion.


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, the problem is there weren't


really any factors or --


QUESTION:  How would one know about the stops of


someone who is a perfectly law-abiding citizen?  Nobody is


pressing charges against them.  Quite the contrary.  And


very few of them would bother with a Bivens action given


the qualified immunity.  So, we don't hear from those

people.  And I thought the whole idea of the Fourth


Amendment, frankly, is that you have to protect the crooks


because if you don't protect them, then the innocent, the


law-abiding people will lose their protection. 


MS. BRAMBL:  That's exactly right.  The -- the


Fourth Amendment protects all of the law-abiding people,


and it seems like Terry struck a balance.  You -- you can


stop people when you have reasonable suspicion, but that's


the floor below which you cannot go because otherwise


you're casting in a large universe of -- of innocent, law-


abiding citizens who are going to be stopped.  And they're


the people that we're concerned about in this litigation.


And obviously our client is not a sympathetic


figure because he was doing something wrong.  But all of


the objective factors that were available to the agent


pointed not to a smuggler running dope or aliens, but


instead to a family that was on an outing on a -- a lovely


day on a -- a very scenic area. 


All of the factors that the Ninth Circuit found


had some level of suspicion, the fact that it was a


minivan, the fact that it was a road that could be used by


smugglers and could be used to avoid the sensor, and the


fact that it was 45 minutes before a Border Patrol shift


change -- all those are really just the setting.  When you


get to the individualized factors that were listed, those

factors are the ones that fall short. 


QUESTION:  Well, but just before the shift


change is an individualized factor.


MS. BRAMBL:  Well --


QUESTION:  I mean, we're not saying that anytime


someone comes along this road it's suspicious.  We're


saying it's suspicious just before the shift change.


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, it's certainly 45 minutes


before a shift change when perhaps, depending on where the


agents are out in the field, some of them may be returning


back.  But it -- it would seem inappropriate to say,


families, you better find out when Border Patrol shift


changes are because otherwise you won't -- you travel on


these roads, you're going to get stopped.  And --


QUESTION:  Would you explain to me the


significance of the shift change?  I frankly didn't quite


understand. 


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, the Border Patrol claims that


smugglers, in general, are aware of when they change


shifts and --


QUESTION:  But what difference would it make --


does that make? 


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, the thought is that smugglers


would then think they're getting by because all of the


agents are at the -- at the station.  The truth of it is,

we see this factor so often throughout the -- the

that does not work because --


QUESTION:  But the idea would be that the Border


Patrol agents were all at the checkpoint and wouldn't be


out in the field to -- to be able to follow up on any


information from the sensor. 


MS. BRAMBL:  That's exactly right. 


QUESTION:  But I still don't understand because


that would be at the moment of the change.  20 minutes


ahead of time some will be coming in, and 20 minutes after


some will be going out.  They're still within -- within


time to react to a sensor, which they did. 


MS. BRAMBL:  Well, sure.


QUESTION:  It still really puzzles.


MS. BRAMBL:  And that's the point we were able


to make in the -- in the record that the -- the court of


appeals reviewed, which is that when -- exactly when shift


change would occur and when the agent --

Court has further questions, we submit that the judgment

QUESTION:  Tell me.  Explain to me again why the


shift change is so significant. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. SCHLICK:  Certainly, Justice Stevens.  The


-- the testimony was that agents who are out in the field


will, as the 3:00 p.m. shift change approached, head back


to --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. SCHLICK:  -- the checkpoint on I-191.  That


drive would take perhaps 45 minutes, perhaps a half hour,


perhaps as much as an hour, depending on where they were.


So, during that period, a Border Patrol agent who was,


let's say, stationed on Leslie Canyon Road, supervising


the road, would be driving back. 


QUESTION:  He'd be driving back, but at the same


time the sensors are working.  If the sensor is triggered,


they tell him -- they say, turn around and go back, which


is what happened to this guy.  I just don't understand it.


MR. SCHLICK:  That's true.  And Justice Stevens,


you may be thinking more clearly than smugglers.  What


smugglers see is the absence of Border Patrol vehicles,


and they take that as an indication that --

was generally known that there were sensors on this road?


MR. SCHLICK:  The record does not.  It does not

QUESTION:  I had the feeling it might be a


different case if they just put a sign up saying,


strangers in this area are subject to stop if they're not


-- you know, if they're not local people.  We got sensors


that will catch you.  But if they gave them notice, I


wonder if it would be a different case. 


MR. SCHLICK:  Certainly, Justice Stevens, the


smugglers are well aware of the location of the checkpoint


and the route to -- to evade it.


QUESTION:  But not of the sensors you think.


MR. SCHLICK:  I -- I can't answer that question.


The record doesn't reveal. 


QUESTION:  Are there -- is there anything in the


record that suggests at all, or anywhere, that there are


other -- there are families, that sometimes people do use


this for picnics?  They like sightseeing.  They want to go


up there on this old dirt road.  Is there any -- any


evidence on that at all? 


MR. SCHLICK:  The record does include evidence


that the recreation areas off of Rucker Canyon Road -- if


respondent --


QUESTION:  Well, that's one of them, but there's

one further to the north.  So, somebody who likes driving


on old dirt roads, as some people do, might take their


family, drive up there, going further to the north.  So, I


wonder what the state of the -- any evidence at all in


there that -- that families who are not smugglers do use


this road once a week, once a day, once a month. 


Anything?


MR. SCHLICK:  No, Justice Breyer.  The -- the


testimony was that that recreation area to the north


existed.  There was no testimony that any particular


number of -- of families do, in fact, use these roads. 


The testimony to the contrary was that ranchers and Forest


Service personnel and the Border Patrol itself used these


roads.  The district court's finding on page 24a of the


petition appendix was that this route was not a logical


route to get up to the Chiricahua National Monument.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Schlick. 


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:10 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
