CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We  will  hear 

  

 

 

 

 

argument  next  in  Case  14­419,  Luis  v.  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Srebnick. 

 

            

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  HOWARD  SREBNICK 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Sixth  Amendment  has  always  recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

the  individual's  right  to  spend  his  own  money  to  obtain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  advice  and  assistance  of  counsel.  At  the  time  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  adoption  of  the  Bill  of  Rights,  that  was  the  core 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right,  a  time  when  the  right  to  appointed  counsel  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  yet  been  established  by  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  submit  that  the  right  to  representation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  private  counsel  must  allow  a  defendant  to  use  assets 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  she  rightfully  owns,  assets  over  which  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute  that  she  has  good  title,  so  that  she  may  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represented  by  the  lawyer  that  she  prefers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Monsanto? 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  do  you  do  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SREBNICK:  In  Monsanto  and  in  Caplin  & 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Drysdale,  those  were  cases  involving  tainted  funds,  drug 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right.  So  what  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  logic  that  says  it  doesn't  violate  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  if  it's  tainted  funds,  but  it  does  if  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untainted  funds? 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

logic  is  that  no  one  has  a  rightful  claim  to  drug  money. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No  one  can  claim  a  valid  property  right  in  drug 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds.  Ms.  Luis  is  wanting  to  use  assets  that  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  drug  money.  They  are  her  lawful  assets.  They  are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  connected  to  any  crime  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But,  Mr.  Srebnick,  I  mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

compare  two  situations. 

 

 

            

One  is  the  one  that  Monsanto  talked  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where,  yeah,  a  bank  robber  goes  in  and  he  has  a  pile  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  now.  And  Monsanto  says,  you  know,  even  though  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  use  that  money  to  pay  for  an  attorney,  too  bad. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  a  bank  robber  goes  in,  he  has  a  pile  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

money,  he  puts  it  into  a  separate  bank  account,  he  uses 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  bank  account  to  pay  his  rent,  to  pay  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expenses,  and  he  uses  the  money  that  would  have  gone  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rent  and  other  expenses  to  pay  a  lawyer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why  should  the  two  cases  be  treated  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently  for  Sixth  Amendment  purposes? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Because  no  amount  of 

  

 

 

 

 

so­called  dissipation,  as  the  government  would  suggest,

negates  petitioner's  lawful  interest  in  the  property  she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owns  apart  from  any  alleged  criminal  activity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  it  make  sense  the  ­­ the  sort  of  substitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule?  I  mean,  if  you've  got  $10  million  in  drug 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  ­­ money  and  you  had  $5  million,  and  you  spent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$10  million,  you  can't  say,  you  know,  oh,  I  spent  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  money,  you  can't  touch  the  $5  million.  It  seems  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  that's  what  the  statute  is  doing  when  it  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  it's  a  reasonable  substitute  or  assets 

   

 

 

 

 

substituted  for. 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  And  so,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  if  there  is  a  conviction,  if  the  defendant  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found  guilty,  after  the  conviction  when  punishment  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined,  there  may  well  be  the  opportunity  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  to  seek  punishment  that  includes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  penalties  associated  with  the  crime.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

before  that  time,  pretrial,  when  the  defendant  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  owner  of  the  untainted  assets,  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  of  law  that  deprives  her  of  the  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  but  I  ­­ I  thought 

   

   

  

 

 

the  Chief  Justice's  question  was  slightly  different.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  if  you  were  privileged  to  hear  the  exciting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  yesterday  on  tainted  assets.

MR.  SREBNICK:  I  was. 

    

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But,  you  know,  there 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

are  degree  ­­ there  are  degrees  of  taint.  Can  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  you  follow  ­­ can  you  follow  the  assets?  So  just  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  "tainted"  or  "untainted,"  it's  a  ­­ it's  a  more 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  question  than  that. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Well,  in  this  case,  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

simple  answer,  because  here  we  have  a  stipulation,  Joint 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix  161,  that  the  assets  that  are  the  subject  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  dispute  here  today  are  assets  that  are  undisputedly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untainted,  not  traceable  to  the  crime.  They  include, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  example,  family  jewelry,  not  traced  to  any  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity.  They  include  real  estate  that  was  acquired 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  allegations  of  the  conspiracy. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  let  me  go  back  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  ­­ Justice  Kagan's  question  and  ask  it  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  different  way. 

 

 

            

So  you  ­­ we  have  two  brothers  and  ­­ twin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brothers,  and  they  rob  a  bank.  They  get  $10,000.  They 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

split  it  up,  $5,000  each.  And  on  that  very  same  day,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happens  to  be  their  birthday,  and  their  rich  uncle  comes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  gives  each  of  them  $5,000  as  a  birthday  present.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  go  out  to  party,  and  one  of  them  ­­ and  they  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spend  $5,000  partying.  One  of  them  spends  the  money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  bank  robbery.  The  other  one  spends  the  money

that  was  given  to  them  by  their  rich  uncle.  And  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  is  that  the  one  who  spent  the  money  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so­called  "tainted  assets,"  the  money  from  the  bank 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

robbery,  is  entitled  to  use  the  remaining  $5,000  to  hire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  attorney,  but  the  other  one  is  out  of  luck? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Yes,  because  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  sense  does  that  make? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SREBNICK:  Because  the  property  interest 

  

 

 

 

 

a  defendant  has  in  an  inheritance  or  in  a  gift,  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  rights  are  not  negated  simply  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  has  allegedly  committed  a  crime,  simply 

   

 

 

 

 

because  there's  probable  cause. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  the  law  ­­ you  want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  to  say  spend  the  bank  robbery  money  first. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  ­­ that's  your 

  

 

 

 

 

position? 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Well,  the  ­­ the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  concerned  about  what  we  would  ­­ have  described  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  so­called  wily  criminal.  The  defendant  who  spends 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  money,  the  tainted  assets,  faces  perhaps  even  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment  at  the  end  of  the  day  or  at  the  end  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction,  either  through  money  laundering  charges  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise. 

            

So  the  Court,  keeping  in  mind  that

forfeiture  has  as  its  primary  component  punishment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  ways  of  disincentivizing  these  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  transactions  that,  Justice  Kennedy,  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

referring  to.  But  it  doesn't  affect  the  defendant's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  interest  in  assets  that  are  wholly  apart  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  criminal  activity. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  do  ­­ I  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  how  these  things  actually  work.  I  mean,  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  obviously  has  daily  expenses,  and  ­­ and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  freeze  order  apparently  goes  beyond  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  she  has.  What,  does  she  get  an  allowance  or  ­­ or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something? 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  As  of  now  she  gets  nothing, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­ so  if  her  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putting  aside  lawyers,  if  her  daughter's  tuition  bill 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  due,  she  can't  pay  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Under  the  current  restraining 

  

 

 

 

 

order,  she  can  do  nothing. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  she  can  surely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pay  the  rent  or  the  mortgage? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Under  the  current  restraining 

  

 

 

 

 

order,  she  can  do  nothing.  The  statute,  as  it's  being

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  it  your  position  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

government  could  prevent  payment  for  the  tuition  but  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  counsel? 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Our  position  is  that  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  constitutional  right  under  the  Sixth  Amendment  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retain  counsel. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  the  answer  is  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  ­­ the  government  can  stop  the  tuition  payment  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  payment  to  counsel? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  I  would  think  so,  in  those 

    

 

 

 

 

 

kinds  of  instances.  There  may  be  other  cases,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concede,  if  it's  life­or­death  matters,  life­or­death 

 

 

 

 

 

expenditures,  a  different  defendant  might  come  before 

   

 

 

 

 

the  Court  and  say  there's  a  strong  compelling  need  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  money  for  other  reasons.  But  if  it's  ordinary, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

routine  expenses,  our  claim  today  doesn't  reach  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our  claim  reaches  Sixth  Amendment  issues. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  you  really  don't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  statutory  argument.  You're  making  a  Sixth  Amendment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

argument  because  if  it  were  a  statutory  argument,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  you  can  ­­ you  can  restrain  ­­ you  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrain  untainted  assets. 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Justice  Sotomayor,  the 

  

 

 

 

statute,  18  U.S.C.  1345,  which  is  different  than  the

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  guess  I'm  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

understand  what  you're  going  to  say  because  I  read  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief. 

            

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  the  logic  of  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument  would  suggest  that  you  can't  freeze  untainted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets  for  anything,  because  you're  saying  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  has  no  property  right  to  it.  It's  untainted. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  your  money;  it's  not  their  money  until  they  secure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  judgment.  And  so  the  logic  of  your  position  would  be, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think,  they  can't  restrain  untainted  assets,  period, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally  or  statutorily. 

 

 

            

in  our  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Well,  we  do  not  go  that  far 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  know  you  don't  because 

    

 

 

 

 

it's  very  nice  that  you  limit  it.  But  once  we  announce 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  rule,  we  have  to  carry  it  to  its  logical  conclusion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  the  rule  is  it's  untainted  assets  and  it  belongs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me,  how  do  we  then  limit  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Well,  I  suppose  that  if 

   

  

 

 

 

there's  no  Sixth  Amendment  right  at  stake,  if  there's  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  right  to  use  the  asset  today,  I  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  of  any  prohibition,  provided  that  there's  due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process,  that  would  prevent  the  Court  from  restraining

assets  proposed  to  be  used  for  other  purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  you  said  that  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  her  property.  If  it's  tainted,  you  say  she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  own  it,  it's  not  her  money.  But  if  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untainted,  it  is  her  money.  So  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor  has  asked  a  fair  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

 

Isn't  the  logic  of  your  position  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untainted  assets  can  be  used  without  restraint  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  she  wants  to  use  it  for? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Justice  Ginsburg,  from  a 

  

 

 

 

 

constitutional  perspective,  I  don't  think  that  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

necessarily  correct  because  the  courts  can  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunctive  power  to  restrain  assets,  even  assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

currently  belonging  to  the  defendant.  Our  objection  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  such  an  injunction  interferes  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally  protected  right  to  retain  counsel  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice. 

            

And  so  while  the  statute  could 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally  allow,  provided  that  there  is  adequate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearings,  et  cetera,  the  restraint  of  even  a  defendant's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

owned  assets,  lawfully  owned  assets,  that  principle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  extend  to  assets  ­­ the  subset  of  assets  she  needs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  use  counsel  of  choice. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  if  ­­ what  if  the

annual  trip  to  Mecca  every  year?  Wouldn't  she  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  right  to  use  the  money  for  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  So  certainly  she  would  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  right.  And  whether  she  could  then  obtain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  assets  free  from  the  injunction  immediately  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raise  a  separate  First  Amendment  question. 

   

 

 

 

            

The  Sixth  Amendment,  because  the  deprivation 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  permanent,  meaning,  we  need  those  assets  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  trial,  and  the  immediacy  of  the  need  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  assets  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  she  has  an  immediate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

need  to  go  to  Mecca.  I  mean,  if  she  doesn't  get  it  now, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she's  not  going  to  be  able  to  fulfill  what  she  regards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  religious  obligation.  I  don't  know  how  you  can 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

limit  your  ­­ your  principle  to  the  Sixth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  The  Sixth  Amendment  is 

  

 

 

 

 

important  in  the  context  of  the  adversarial  proceeding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  will  determine  the  ultimate  ownership  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets  at  the  end  of  the  day.  And  so  unlike  the  First 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment,  unlike  any  other  amendment,  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  is  a  guarantee  that  the  defendant  will  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

represented  at  the  proceeding  where  that  property  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her  liberty  are  at  stake.  And  with  regard  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

travels  to  Mecca,  those  travels,  while  significant  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  First  Amendment,  don't  bear  on  the  ultimate  outcome

of  the  criminal  case. 

 

 

 

            

 

And  so  because  the  need  for  assets  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  requesting  limited  to  that  amount  needed  to  retain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  of  choice,  limited  to  the  amount  needed  to  mount 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  legal  defense  to  the  very  charge  that  threatens  her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  rights  and  her  liberty  upon  conviction,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs  to  be  an  accommodation  so  that  she  can  use  enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets,  controlled  by  the  Court,  of  course  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Srebnick,  this  goes 

  

 

 

 

 

back,  I  think,  to  the  Chief  Justice's  first  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  seems  that  the  distinction  that  you're  making  is  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Court  explicitly  rejected  in  Monsanto.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  the  Court  said  the  Sixth  Amendment  here  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  exact  same  thing  as  the  First  Amendment.  It  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  that  example  that  Justice  Scalia  gave,  or  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  example. 

 

            

And  ­­ and  so  it  goes  back  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice's  question  in  ­­ in  the  sense  of  there's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  powerful  intuition  behind  your  argument,  but  it's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powerful  intuition  that  was  explicitly  rejected  by  us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  this  case  doesn't  seem  to  present  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  circumstances  than  that  one. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Justice  Kagan,  I  ­­ I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

the  circumstances  are  quite  different  because  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tainted  property  that  was  at  issue  in  Monsanto.

First,  we  know  it  was  drug  money  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Monsanto.  It  had  been  established  by  clear  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

convincing  evidence.  In  our  case,  it's  totally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

untainted  assets. 

 

            

Second,  the  Court  recognized  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  doesn't  have  a  lawful  property  interest  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

drug  money.  No  different  than  a  bank  robber  does  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  lawful  interest  in  the  bank  loot. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Yeah,  but  your  ­­ your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

earlier  argument  was  you  have  a  constitutional  right  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish  that  it  isn't  drug  money.  That  was  your  whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  to  Justice  Scalia. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  In  this  case  there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

dispute  that  the  money  is  untainted.  And  I'm  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  talking  about  the  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  you're  proposing. 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  The  rule  I  proposed, 

   

  

 

 

consistent  with  the  Court's  observation  in  Kaley,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  two  elements  to  establish  forfeitability;  one,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  crime  committed,  and  second,  traceability  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  majority  opinion  in  Kaley. 

 

 

 

 

            

Here  we  have  undisputedly  untainted  assets, 

 

 

 

 

 

not  traceable  to  a  crime.  In  Monsanto,  the  assets  were 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  money.  And  a  defendant  doesn't  have  the  right  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  drug  money  to  represent  ­­ to  be  represented  by  the

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  guess  you're  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

think  this  may  be  Justice  Sotomayor's  point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Your  argument,  you're  distinguishing  tainted 

 

 

 

 

and  untainted  assets,  and  I  understand  that.  I  just 

    

   

 

 

 

 

don't  understand  that  if  you  can  freeze  the  assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

despite  the  Sixth  Amendment  when  they're  tainted,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  understand  why  it's  not  the  same  rule  when  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untainted. 

            

You  may  have  ­­ may  have  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments,  you  ­­ but  if  you  have  arguments,  it  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  to  do  with  the  constitutional  right  to  counsel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I  think  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

has  everything  to  do  with  the  Sixth  Amendment  because, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  its  inception,  the  Sixth  Amendment  only  encompassed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  right  to  spend  one  ­­ one's  own  money  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represented  by  counsel.  There  was  no  right  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appointment  of  counsel. 

 

 

            

So  taking  away  the  defendant's  lawfully  held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets,  whether  it  be  their  pension  funds,  whether  it  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  inheritance,  whether  it  be  their  lawfully  earned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

labors,  to  take  that  away  at  the  inception  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nation  would  have  meant  the  defendant  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left  with  no  counsel  at  all  since  the  notion  of  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appointed  lawyer  is  really  a  notion  of  more  recent

So  indeed,  to  take  away  the  property  rights, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretrial,  of  a  defendant,  at  the  time  when  he  or  she  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  indictment,  needs  those  assets  to  retain  counsel, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  private  counsel  ­­ so  we're  not  talking  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  a  particular  ­­

   

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  what  if  ­­ what  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prosecution  brings  a  case  for  crime  X  and  wins  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  and  it  imposes  a  fine  that  takes  away  all  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's  assets,  and  then  the  prosecution  brings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  case  for  crime  Y,  would  you  be  arguing  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine  had  to  make  an  exception  for  the  defense  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime  Y? 

 

            

            

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  No,  Justice  Scalia. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What's  the  difference? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  SREBNICK:  There's  a  judgment.  Upon 

   

  

  

 

judgment,  a  defendant  can  lose  his  right  to  property 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  execution  of  that  judgment.  So  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  execute  on  that  criminal  judgment  and  take  as  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  defendant's  assets  needed  to  satisfy  the  fine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  objection  is  to  the  government  doing  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  conviction,  before  there's  been  any  judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Locking  down  somebody's  assets  at  the  very  moment  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  or  she  needs  those  assets  to  exercise  the  right  to

It's  ­­ the  two  rights  have  to  coexist.  The  right  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represented  by  counsel  of  choice  under  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  has  to  coexist  with  the  indictment,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Patterson  v.  Illinois,  the  right  under  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  is  triggered  by  the  indictment.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

triggered  by  the  finding  of  probable  cause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To  then  say  that  probable  cause  destroys  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  the  Sixth  Amendment  is  to  then  say  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  coexist.  But,  of  course,  they  do,  because  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Amendment  was  established  in  1791,  and  it's  part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  our  fabric. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  might  just  be  repeating 

    

 

 

 

 

myself,  but  ­­ but  I  thought  that,  again,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  was  the  one  specifically  rejected  in

Monsanto.  I  mean,  Monsanto  could  have  said  Caplin  & 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Drysdale  is  different  because  it's  postconviction.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Monsanto  refused  to  say  that.  Monsanto  said  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  that  applies  postconviction  ought  to  apply  upon  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  of  probable  cause. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Yes,  Justice  Kagan,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

probable  cause  to  believe  the  assets  are  tainted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Probable  cause  to  believe  that  the  drug  money  is  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's  to  spend.  Not  probable  ­­ there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable  cause  here  as  to  these  assets  that  Ms.  Luis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposes  to  use  to  retain  counsel  of  choice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  The  problem  with  this 

  

 

 

 

 

argument  is  that  as  a  matter  of  economics  and  ­­ and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  sense,  money  is  fungible.  To  say  if  the  ­­ if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  so­called  tainted  money  has  been  spent,  and  what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left  is  the  untainted  money,  it  doesn't  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  which  ­­ you  know,  which  pot  has  been  spent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  which  pot  hasn't  been  spent. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Respectfully,  Justice  Alito, 

  

 

 

 

it  makes  a  major  difference.  Our  property  laws,  while 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

money  in  some  instances  is  fungible  when  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commingled,  if  there  is  segregated  property,  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors  try  to  levy  against  property  that's  not  part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  secured  interest,  the  law  treats  it  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  yes,  but  then 

  

 

 

 

 

there's  ­­ that's  all  sorts  of  complicated  rules  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  areas. 

 

              

 

 

I  mean,  let's  ­­ suppose  you  have  ­­

 

 

 

 

and  none  of  that  necessarily  applies  here.  Suppose  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  situation  where  what's  at  stake  is  money  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  used  for  restitution,  all  right?  So  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning  of  the  case,  the  question  is  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  can  spend  that  money  to  hire  the  attorney  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant's  choice,  which  is  certainly  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

powerful  interest,  or  whether  that  money,  at  the  end  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  if  there  is  a  conviction,  is  going  to  go  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victims. 

            

So  how  do  you  ­­ how  do  you  try  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accommodate  those  two  interests? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Well,  to  provide  a 

  

 

 

 

 

restitution  exception  would  just  swallow  the  entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Amendment  out  of  the  Constitution  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  reason.  In  most  cases,  a  victim  has  sustained 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

an  injury.  It  might  be  property  damage.  It  might  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal  injury.  And  if,  for  example,  to  use  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical,  if  someone  were  to  steal  the  Mona  Lisa,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegedly  steal  the  Mona  Lisa  but  the  Mona  Lisa  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found,  there's  no  principle  this  Court  has  ever  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  your  answer  is  that  the

defendant's  right  to  hire  counsel  of  choice  takes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedence  over  the  rights  of  the  victims,  and  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  no  matter  how  strong  the  proof  is? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Until  there's  ­­ until  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  verdict? 

   

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  As  long  as  the  assets  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant  proposes  to  use  are  her  lawful  assets, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untainted,  not  connected  to  the  crime,  not  traceable  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  criminal  activity,  yes,  because  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  seems  to  me  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  ­­ I  don't  know  ­­ not  a  very  persuasive  line. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  relying  on  property  law.  What  you're  saying  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  can  take  away  all  your  money  if  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tainted,  if  there  is  probable  cause  to  believe  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tainted,  right?  It  can  take  away  all  of  your  money  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  judgment.  But  it  can't  take  away  all  of  your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  if  there's  simply  probable  cause  to  believe  that

Sixth  Amendment  case  is  any  stronger. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  What  ­­ what  the  statute  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purporting  to  do  is  give  the  government  a  prejudgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

attachment  on  the  defendant's  assets  based  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

projected  judgment. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  right.  It's 

  

  

 

 

property  law. 

 

            

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  And  the  Sixth  Amendment  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You're  complaining  about 

  

 

 

 

property  law,  not  the  Sixth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Well,  I'm  complaining  that 

  

 

 

 

 

the  Sixth  Amendment,  because  at  its  root  contemplated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  use  of  property  to  retain  counsel,  the  two  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

degree  are  interrelated,  of  course,  because  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  220  years  ago  or  so,  you  couldn't  hire  a  lawyer, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  none  would  be  appointed  for  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  while  the  Court  has  accommodated  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indigent  by  providing  them  with  appointed  counsel,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  a  license  for  the  government  to  render  people  who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  indigent,  indigent.  It's  not  a  license  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

impoverish  them  by  virtue  of  the  accusation  alone.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  simply  write  out  the  Sixth  Amendment  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution. 

            

In  every  single  case  where  there  is  a  victim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  claims  injury,  every  single  one,  the  government  has

by  definition  probable  cause  because  the  indictment  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  probable  cause.  And  it's  not  subject  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  under  the  Kaley  opinion.  And  so  if  we  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  say  that  merely  being  accused  in  this  country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  a  grand  jury  has  found  probable  cause  is  now 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  to  lock  down  all  of  your  assets,  assets  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  owned  for  decades,  perhaps,  because  at  some  future 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  maybe  a  jury  will  convict  and  maybe  a  judge  will 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enter  a  judgment,  and  then  maybe  the  court  will  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  enforce  that  judgment,  really  is  to  write  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Sixth  Amendment. 

 

 

            

And  there  are  ways  ­­ if  the  point  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  case  is  to  inflict  punishment  on  a  defendant, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  ways  other  than  financial  means  to  do  so.  Of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  incarceration  is  the  number  one  form  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment. 

            

And  while  the  needs  of  the  victims  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  important,  what  we're  asking  here  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accommodate  both.  We're  not  asking  that  all  the  funds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  released,  only  so  much  as  are  necessary  so  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accused  can  be  represented  by  private  counsel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  know  this  is  not  part 

    

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  question  asked,  but  I  know  that  it  ­­ it's

MR.  SREBNICK:  I  don't  think  there's  an 

    

 

 

 

 

issue,  particularly  in  this  case  with  that  issue, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  court  which  now  has  control  over  the  assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  manage  the  disbursement  of  funds  for  counsel,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  bar  rules  would  apply.  Just  as  with  a  CJA­appointed 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer,  Criminal  Justice  Act  appointed  lawyer,  goes  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court,  and  says,  here  are  my  hours.  Here's  what  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  for  investigation.  Here's  what  I  need  for  support 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

services  for  discovery.  That  would  be  managed  by  the

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  you're  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not  looking  for  CJA  rates,  are  you? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  No,  we're  not,  Justice.

I  should  add  that  while  we  are  having  a  ­­

following:  "The  Constitution  requires  that  a  court 

   

  

 

 

 

afford  a  defendant  a  fair  opportunity  to  secure  counsel 

   

   

 

 

 

 

of  choice  using  whatever  assets  he  has  at  his  lawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposal." 

            

That's  the  brief  of  Caplin  &  Drysdale  by  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor  General  at  page  42. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  when  the  Solicitor  General's  office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued  this  case  in  Caplin  &  Drysdale  25  years  ago,  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came  to  the  Court  and  said  there  was  a  difference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  tainted  and  untainted  assets.  And  some  26  years 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later,  those  are  being  conflated  as  if  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  the  two. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  we  have  a  new 

   

  

 

 

 

statute.  853  made  a  difference  between  ­­ and  still 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

does  ­­ between  tainted  and  untainted. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  That  is  very  true, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor.  And  to  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  This  section  came  later, 

  

 

 

 

 

and  it  says  substitute  property. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  That  is  true.  So  there  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ a  statute,  the  statute  that's  at  issue  in  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  different  from  853.  853  in  most  circuits  does  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorize  the  pretrial  restraint  of  untainted  assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  all  the  concerns  about  victims,  all  the  concerns  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emanate  from  the  questions  that  have  been  asked  today,

Congress  struck  that  balance  and  did  not  allow  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restraint  of  substitute  assets,  at  least  in  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits  as  it  has  been  interpreted.  The  Solicitor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  has  a  different  view  of  the  statute  as  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressed  in  the  Fourth  Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

But  in  all  events,  though  the  victims  are 

 

 

 

 

certainly  to  be  accommodated,  so,  too,  the  rights  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  defendant  who  needs  to  be  represented  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  of  choice. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  Congress  seemed  to 

  

 

 

 

 

have  singled  out  these  banking  frauds  and  healthcare 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frauds  for  special  treatment,  so  they're  not  governed  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  general  forfeiture  statute,  which  makes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  between  tainted  and  untainted.  They  seem  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  come  down  very  hard  on  these  two  crimes.  So  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  we  interpret  ­­ was  it  1345?  ­­ as  doing  nothing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  being  controlled  essentially  by  853? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  So  1345,  although  it  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

use  the  word  "forfeiture,"  it  doesn't  say  what  happens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  these  assets.  It  simply  locks  them  down,  so  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speak,  until  something  happens.  It  doesn't  even  talk 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  a  criminal  case,  but  it  is  in  the  context  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Title  18.  And  the  one  court  ­­ court  ­­ Fang  case  talks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about,  there  needs  to  be  some  sort  of  criminal  procedure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  follows  the  lockdown.

And  Justice  Ginsburg,  while  Congress  may 

 

 

 

 

 

have  given  in  this  instance  the  ability  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  to  restrain  assets  of  equivalent  value, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding  our  statutory  interpretation  argument, 

 

 

 

 

it  still  needs  to  accommodate  the  rights  of  the  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accused. 

            

If  I  may  reserve  the  balance  of  my  time  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rebuttal. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Dreeben. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MICHAEL  R.  DREEBEN 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  that  the  appropriate  starting  point 

 

 

 

 

 

for  this  case  is  the  last  sentence  of  Monsanto,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Monsanto  specifically  addressed  substitute 

 

 

 

 

property,  but  because  it  adopted  a  principle  that  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  resolves  this  case.  And  the  last  sentence  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Monsanto  says,  "If  the  government  may,  posttrial,  forbid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  use  of  forfeited  assets  to  pay  an  attorney,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surely  no  constitutional  violation  occurs  when  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable  cause  is  adequately  established,  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtains  an  order  barring  a  defendant  from  frustrating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  end  by  dissipating  his  assets  prior  to  trial."

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  that  was  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  context  of  the  government's  submission  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  difference  between  tainted  and  untainted, 

   

 

 

 

 

right?  Your  ­­ your  argument  in  Monsanto  focused  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tainted  aspects  of  the  proceeds. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes,  it  did.  And  that's  why  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  the  principle  that  the  court  articulated  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  sentence  is  what  decides  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  is  that  the  principle? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  principle  ­­ they're  talking  about  money  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  belong  to  the  defendant. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  belongs  to  Smith  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Jones  of  the  bank.  Now,  let's  try  that  principle  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  where  it's  the  defendant's  money.  The  principle  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  government,  without  proving  that  he's  guilty  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  crime  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  can  take  all  his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.  Oh,  because  he  might  be  fined. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

I've  never  heard  of  such  a  principle, 

   

 

 

 

 

frankly.  I've  just  never  heard  of  it.  Now,  if  there  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  case  that  says  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Sixth  Amendment  or  not. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  ­­ now  I  can  imagine  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Justice  Breyer,  let  me  try  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  can  go  from  there  and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

find  interests  on  both  sides,  da,  da,  da. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Justice  Breyer,  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

it's  important  to  start  with,  actually,  the  principle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Monsanto  adopted,  not  because  it  resolved  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual  circumstances  here,  but  because  it's  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  point  in  time  after  the  government  wins  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment.  And  the  principle  is  that  if  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  have  a  right  to  forfeit  that  property  at  the  end  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

cause  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  ­­ if  it  can  show  probable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  ­­ I  understood  that.  I 

    

   

  

 

 

just  wanted  to  try  it  with  the  facts  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  the  first  principle  is  if,  in  fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant  has  somebody  else's  money  that  he's  taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawfully,  and  he  has  to  give  it  up  at  the  end  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial,  we  can  make  him  give  it  up  at  the  beginning  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  sure  it's  there. 

 

 

 

            

Now  let's  try  it  with  the  facts  here.  If  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  has  some  money,  which  maybe  he  will  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay  in  a  fine,  what  we'll  do  is  we'll  take  all  his  money 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away  before  he's  been  convicted  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

doubt.  Okay.  That's  the  difference  in  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

propositions.

And  I'm  saying  it's  pretty  hard  for  me  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  in  a  country  which  says  that  before  he's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted,  you  have  to  release  him  on  bail  except  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusual  circumstances,  that  nonetheless,  you  can  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  his  money  away  so  he  can't  hire  a  lawyer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  know  that's  a  little  simpleminded,  but 

   

 

 

 

nonetheless,  that  seems  fairly  basic.  I  don't  know 

    

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  comes  from. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  Justice  Breyer,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ the  embedded  premise  there  is  that  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  not  suffer  restraints  on  their  liberty  or  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  they  have  been  convicted  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

doubt. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  correct.  That  is 

  

  

 

 

 

the  principle,  and  now  we  make  a  number  of  exceptions. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  one  exception  is  if  you  think  he's  going  to  ­­ I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  I  can  think  of  exceptions  where  we  do  keep  people 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  jail.  That  is,  of  course,  right.  And  ­­ and  here, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they're  saying,  I  think,  in  essence  is,  let's  try 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  think  of  an  exception  for  this  one.  Pretty  hard. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  anyway,  if  there  is  one,  what  he  wants  to  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  for  is  to  make  sure  he  has  a  lawyer.  It's  called 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Sixth  Amendment. 

 

 

            

All  right.  Now,  there  we  are.  That's  where 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ at  this  moment  in  my  mind,  that's  where  the  case

is. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  All  right.  So  can  I  try  to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

break  that  down  a  little  bit?  Because  I  do  think  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  principle  in  Monsanto  is  critical.  The  principle  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Monsanto  is  that  if  the  government  will  be  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeit  the  property  at  the  end  of  the  day,  it  has  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  ensuring  that  it  is  available  and  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissipated.  It's  the  monetary  equivalent  of  flight. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It's  asset  flight. 

 

 

            

And  this  statute,  Section  1345,  was 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  designed,  as  Justice  Ginsburg  observed,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  in  the  banking  and  in  the  healthcare  context  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  money  flows  into  accounts,  money  is  fungible,  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  to  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  think  ­­ I  think  that's 

    

   

 

 

 

a  ­­ what  you  say  is,  look,  this  is  equivalent  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  where  we  keep  the  guy  in  jail  because  he  might  run 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away.  That's  your  point.  That's  not  a  bad  point.  So  I 

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  on  that  on  one  side,  and  I  have  on  the  other  side 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he'd  like  to  have  a  lawyer  which  is  a  Sixth 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  right. 

 

            

So  I  have  a  suggestion  that  I  want  you  to 

   

   

   

 

 

 

focus  on.  The  suggestion  is  ­­ let's  read  this  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  light  of  what  you've  said,  that  there  is  an  interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  your  side  and  there  is  a  constitutional  amendment  on

the  other  side.  Why  can't  we  read  this  statute  to  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  accommodate  those  interests  in  this  way? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  they're  going  to  run  away  from  ­­ with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  property,  then  the  court  has  the  authority  to  enjoin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  alienation  or  disposition  of  property,  say  tainted, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  you  can  ask  for  a  restraining  order  to  prohibit  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibition,  not  just  of  the  tainted  property  but  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  property  of  equivalent  value. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  I  read  that  without  knowing  the 

   

 

 

 

 

background,  I  would  say  a  lot  of  cases  come  up  where  you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  TROs,  where  they're  not  precise  because  you  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  exactly  what  property  you're  talking  about.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  do  you  think  about  reading  this  statute  to  avoid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  constitutional  question  to  say  the  TRO  means  TRO? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  a  TRO  means  where  there's  some  property 

   

 

 

 

 

 

out  there  and  it  may  be  tainted,  mixed  up  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untainted,  you  can  get  a  TRO  on  the  whole  thing.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  have  a  speedy  hearing.  He  has  to  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

represented.  And  your  purpose  of  that  is  to  separate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  two  kinds  of  assets.  That  seems  to  me  to  work  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  purpose,  and  it  also  avoids  the  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  two  things  on  that.  I  hope 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  get  a  chance  to  say  both  of  them. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  I  don't  think  that  it  is  a  serious

constitutional  question  in  light  of  Monsanto,  so  I  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  think  that  there's  a  serious  avoidance  concern 

   

 

 

 

 

 

here.  Monsanto  basically  said  that  if  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  shown  adequately  that  it  will  be  able  to  forfeit  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  at  the  conclusion  of  the  case,  the  Sixth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  override  the  government's  interests. 

 

 

 

 

            

After  all,  Justice  Breyer,  this  is  basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  zero­sum  game.  Either  there  will  be  money  available 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  end  of  the  case  for  the  victims  or  the  money  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  spent  on  lawyers.  And  Congress  made  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  that  the  government  can't  come  in  in  every  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  simply  restrain  assets  upon  a  showing  of  nothing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  it  does  have  a  statute  in  a  very  specific  area  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows  it  to  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  really  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  what  is  it  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

confines  your  ­­ your  rationale  to  a  specific  area?  It

on  a  contingent  basis. 

   

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Justice  Kennedy,  it's  correct 

  

 

 

 

 

that  our  principle  is  not  limited  to  the  types  of  crimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  in  this  case.  It  is  limited  to  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  an  adequate  showing  that  at  the  conclusion  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  it  will  have  the  right  to  the  money. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  but  you're  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

about  probable  cause.  But  ­­ but  there's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Understood. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  The  government  can  often 

  

 

 

 

 

show  probable  cause,  and  that's  usually  the  basis  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  indictment. 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  That's  correct.  And,  I  ­­

   

  

  

 

 

again,  I  think  that  Monsanto  resolved  this  question  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  if  the  government  can  take  title  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  at  the  conclusion  of  the  case,  it  has  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  ensuring  that  it  is  available,  and  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  doesn't  override  it. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Dreeben  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It  takes  the  ­­ it  ­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  establishes  that  right  in  the  same  way  as  the  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  without  counsel  on  the  part  of  the  defendant, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  ­­ I  assume  Kaley  applies  to  untainted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets  as  well  as  untainted.

MR.  DREEBEN:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  add  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

context  of  what  Justice  Breyer  was  concerned  about.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  only  can  do  that,  you  can  do  that  without  giving  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  any  type  of  hearing,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  No,  I  think  the  defendant  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

often  entitled  to  a  hearing.  The  question  is  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

issues  the  defendant  may  raise  at  the  hearing.  Here, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  example,  there  was  clearly  an  issue  of  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  was,  in  fact,  dissipating  assets.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  been  something  that  the  defendant  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  thought  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

thought  under  Kaley,  the  defendant  didn't  have  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided  a  ­­ a  hearing  with  respect  to  the  pretrial  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

assets. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  With  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ seizure  of 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  With  respect  to  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

there's  probable  cause  to  believe  that  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed  an  offense.  That's  what  Kaley  said  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlled. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Kaley  was  a  question  of 

   

  

 

 

 

tracing,  because  it  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  It  ­­ it  was,

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you  don't  have  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

tracing  problem  here.  As  soon  as  he  commits  a  crime 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  say  was  worth  $45  million,  you  can  freeze 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$45  million  worth  of  assets,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Although  there  were  far  fewer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here  because  most  of  them  had  been  dissipated.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  the  reason  why  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  respect  that,  and  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

but  ­­ but  you  agreed  that  these  particular  funds  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untainted.  I'm  told  by  your  adversary  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  We  ­­ we  stipulated  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

technical,  but  we  ­­ we  stipulated  that  there  may  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  unquantified  amount  of  untainted  assets  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets  being  restrained.  We  did  not  know,  and  did  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempt  to  figure  out,  and  that  would  be  an  issue  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later  day  if  the  Court  said  that  that  mattered. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Dreeben,  I  think,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

know,  in  essence  your  argument  goes  like  this:  You  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Monsanto,  you  combine  Monsanto  with  a  ­­ a  simple 

   

   

 

 

 

 

factual  acknowledgment  that  money  is  fungible,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets  you  to  a  judgment  in  this  case.  You  win,  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioner  loses.  And  ­­ and,  you  know,  that's  a  fair, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong  argument,  if  ­­ if  one  is  comfortable  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Monsanto. 

              

I  mean,  there  is  ­­ so  I  think  I  would  just

ask  you,  I  mean,  suppose  the  Court  is  just  uncomfortable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  path  we  started  down  the  road  on  in  Monsanto? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  you  might  be  right  that  it  just  doesn't  make  sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  draw  a  line  here,  but  it  leaves  you  with  a  situation 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  more  and  more  and  more  we're  depriving  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  ability  to  hire  counsel  of  choice  in  complicated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  And  so  what  should  we  do  with  that  intuition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Monsanto  sent  us  down  the  wrong  path? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  ­­ I  would  hope  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

the  Court  sees  that  even  if  there  are  some  uncomfortable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspects  of  Monsanto,  it  actually  rests  on  a  sound  legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment.  And  I  ­­ I  realize  I  have  said  this,  but  I 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

will  keep  coming  back  to  this  because  I  think  it  is  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

touchstone  for  Monsanto. 

 

 

            

Caplin  &  Drysdale  was  a  postjudgment  case. 

   

   

 

 

And  it  said  once  these  funds  are  forfeitable,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant,  if  he  pays  his  lawyer  with  them,  is  paying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lawyer  with  somebody  else's  money,  namely,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government. 

            

Then  the  question  is,  can  the  government  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  to  prevent  dissipation  of  the  assets  before  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtains  the  judgment?  And  the  Court  said  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

automatically,  not  as  a  general  rule  it  can  always  come 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  and  say  this  is  what  we  want,  this  is  what  we  get. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  with  an  appropriate  hearing,  the  balance  of  interest

does  permit  the  government  to  preserve  the  equities. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  this  has  an  effect  on  counsel  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice.  It  has  no  effect  on  the  ability  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  to  be  represented  by  counsel. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Counsel,  how  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  how  these  things  work.  Let's  say  you  get  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  freezing  the  assets,  and  it's  $10  million,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  defendant  comes  into  the  court,  whatever,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  look,  my  lawyer  is  going  to  cost  $100,000,  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  of  the  assets  that  are  at  issue  here.  Then  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  argue,  no,  even  though  it's  only  a  tiny  fraction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  what  we're  seizing,  the  Sixth  Amendment  doesn't  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitle  him  to  one  percent  of  the  assets  that  might  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  end  up  being  forfeitable? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes.  I  don't  think  there's  an 

    

  

 

 

 

 

exception  in  the  Sixth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  this  is  a  statute  in  which  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government  proceeded  through  seeking  a  civil  injunction 

   

 

 

 

 

and  restraining  order,  and  the  district  court  does  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion.  It's  not  a  flat  rule  that  forbids  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  from  releasing  funds  for  counsel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  does  it  work? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Like  the  ­­ you  know,  the  daughter's  tuition  bill  comes

pay  that? 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Not  as  a  matter  of  right.  But 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

this  is  a  civil  statute  in  which  the  judge  can  exercise 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  discretion.  And  if  the  defendant  comes  in  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  why  was  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  would  it  be  ­­ if  he  can  exercise  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion  for  the  daughter's  tuition,  why  ­­ why  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  Sixth  Amendment  is  at  stake?  And,  you  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  of  choice,  it  turns  on  that,  it  would  seem  to  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  there's  going  to  be  a  case  in  which  equitable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion  will  be  exercised,  it  ought  to  be  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

automatically  so.  Here  the  judge  said  one  consideration 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  will  the  defendant  have  representation  in  the  1345 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding  itself?  The  defendant  did.  Mr.  Srebnick 

  

  

 

 

 

 

represented  the  defendant  in  that  proceeding.  So  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  said,  I  don't  need  to  worry  about  that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then  the  court  turned  to  the  question  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  defendant  needed  counsel  in  the  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  and  said,  the  defendant  will  be  afforded  counsel  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  criminal  case,  by  appointment  if  necessary.

first,  and  I  didn't  hear  the  second. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  By  the  way,  let  me  ­­ let 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  remind  you  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  remember  exactly  what  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  I  want  to  say  it, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

because  maybe  you  can  focus  on  this.  We're  in  before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  on  a  TRO.  Our  object  of  the  TRO  is  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  the  assets  that  are  not  this  man's  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets  that  are  this  man's.  So  we  do  that  separation. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  we  say  $10,000  is  not  his,  it's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank's.  $15,000  or  $10,000  over  here  is  totally  his; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  never  been  convicted  of  the  crime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What's  the  government's  interest?  And  why 

  

 

 

 

 

can't  he  take  this  other,  once  we've  had  the  TRO  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  Justice  Breyer  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ to  separate  it? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  ­­ I  think  I  need  to  stop  you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

here  because  it's  not  a  TRO.  The  statute  does  not  ­­

MR.  DREEBEN:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ and  my  suggestion  is  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  those  words  "restraining  order"  as  "temporary

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  want  to  know  what  your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

second  response  was  to  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  My  second  response  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  a  statute  that  contains  two  basic  provisions.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  petitioner  describes  it  accurately. 

 

 

 

 

            

Section  (a)  describes  the  things  the 

 

 

 

 

 

government  can  seek  under  the  statute;  Subsection  (B) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describes  the  procedure  that's  used. 

 

 

 

 

            

Subsection  (A)  first  allows  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  an  injunction  against  fraud  in  (A)(1).  In  (A)(2) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  allows  it  to  restrain  assets  as  the  ultimate  object 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  suit,  not  as  a  temporary  interim  measure. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Temporary  interim  measures  are  described  in 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  (B)  where  it  specifically  allows  the  Court  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose  various  restraints  until  the  Court  has  concluded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  proceeding.  So  it  addresses  temporary  relief  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B). 

            

Subsection  (A)(2)  describes  the  things  that 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  can  seek  as  the  ultimate  object  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  Injunction  against  the  person  who  has  the  funds, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  a  restraining  order  against  any  person  to  restrain 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  funds  that  are  derived  from  illegal  activity,  or

funds  of  equivalent  value. 

 

 

 

            

 

And  just  to  make  one  final  point  on  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  that  makes  sense  in  a  banking  context  and  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  healthcare  context  is  dollars  are  fungible,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito  said  earlier.  They  will  flow  into  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account;  they  will  flow  out  into  other  accounts.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  to  trace  them. 

 

 

 

            

So  Congress  obviated  the  need  to  do  that  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  you  can  restrain  the  defendant,  but  we're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  rely  only  on  restraining  the  defendant.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  also  restrain  the  banks  where  the  funds  are.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  restrain  them  not  only  in  the  amounts  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent  the  tainted  funds,  but  represent  the  monetary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equivalent  of  them. 

 

 

            

            

finish. 

            

So  in  a  sense  ­­

   

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  don't  ­­ go  ahead  and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  think,  in  a  sense, 

   

   

  

 

 

this  statute  negates  the  premise  that  there  is  a  clean 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  between  tainted  funds  and  untainted  funds.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  is  fungible  once  it's  received  by  the  defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  Medicare  fraud  if  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishes  probable  cause,  and  its  financial  interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ensuring  that  it  can  have  a  judgment  to  make  whole 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Medicare  trust  fund  or  other  victims  at  the

conclusion  of  the  case. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I'm  ­­ I'm  troubled  by  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  I  ­­ I  can't  understand  the  difference  between 

    

   

 

 

 

 

(a)  and  (B).  I  don't  think  ­­ the  issue  was  not  raised 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  cert  petition,  and  I  don't  know  whether  it  can  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  in  with  the  Doctrine  of  Constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Avoidance,  because  it  really  has  nothing  to  do  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Amendment.  This  would  apply  regardless  of  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  any  Sixth  Amendment  issue  in  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But,  having  said  that  ­­ Mr.  Srebnick  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  those  in  rebuttal  if  he  wishes  to,  but  having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that,  if  (B)  does  not  refer  to  a  temporary  form  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief,  then  ­­ which  I  understand  to  be  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  ­­ then  I  don't  understand  what  (a) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

contributes. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  (a)(2)  has  two  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sections,  and  it  describes  what  the  government  can  seek 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  ultimate  relief  in  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  started  out  as  an  antifraud  injunction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  Somebody  is  going  around  with  the  boiler  room 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operation  or  a  Ponzi  scheme;  it  takes  a  while  to  get  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  to  indict.  The  government  can  come  in  and  seek 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  injunction  to  prevent  further  fraud. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then  Congress  added  (a)(2)  on  the  theory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  something  else  the  government  needs  to  do,

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  what  they  can  do  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this?  If  we  read  this  literally  under  (B),  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Smith  is  indicted  for  a  banking  law  violation,  he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  $100,000  of  other  people's  money.  The  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  say  that  the  order  ­­ the  restraining  order  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  prohibits  his  wife,  any  other  client,  the  milk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

man,  anyone  in  the  world,  from  taking,  not  the  $100,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  belongs  to  the  bank,  but  any  other  $100,000  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  for  any  other  purpose,  I  guess  including  his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

retirement  fund,  including  no  matter  what. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  that  is  ­­ goes  ­­ it  seems  to  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  it  says  ­­ any  other  person  from  taking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  of  equivalent  value,  and  he  hasn't  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  of  anything. 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes,  but  it's  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

referring,  again,  to  a  person  who  has  ­­ there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable  cause  to  believe  has  obtained  money  as  a  result 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  criminal  violation,  and  then  it  provides  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism  for  restraining  it.  It's  not  aimed  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

restraining  people  who  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless  they're  holding  the  defendant's  money.

innocent  money,  the  defendant's,  not  the  money  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtained  as  a  result  of  the  violation.  The  money  he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  obtain,  that's  what  this  case  is  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  The  innocent  money  versus 

  

 

 

 

 

tainted  money  all  depends  on  a  theory  that  they  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economically  pure.  Now,  the  ­­ the  only  argument  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Srebnick  made  to  distinguish  them,  and  I  realize 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  may  be  members  of  the  Court  who  think  this  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  very  good  argument,  and  maybe  the  question  is  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Monsanto  is  at  root  problematic,  but  at  least  insofar  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  argument  goes,  it's  based  on  a  reading  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relation­backed  doctrine  that's  contrary  to  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 

            

Monsanto  itself  made  this  very  clear.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  the  government  can  restrain  money  that  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

become  the  government's  property  at  the  conclusion  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Dreeben,  you're 

  

 

 

 

taking  Monsanto  out  of  context,  because  853,  by  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature,  was  limited  to  tainted  funds.  This  is  the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  if  ­­ that  I  know  of  that  permits  the  government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  come  in  and  take  untainted  funds.  The  incidence  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  tainted  funds  concept  was,  you  can't  spend  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person's  money.  You  stole  this  money  somehow,  and  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  spend  that  money  because  it  belongs  to  someone

else.  It  really  doesn't  belong  to  you.  But  it's  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until  a  judgment  ­­ and  this  is  what  your  adversary  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  say  ­­ that  the  money  that's  untainted,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  that  ­­ or  the  property  that  he  bought  before  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime,  this  untainted  property  becomes  yours.  It's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

until  that  moment,  the  judgment,  that  the  property  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeitable. 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  That's  true. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  can't  forfeit  it 

  

 

 

 

 

beforehand.  So  now  the  issue  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  That's  true  for  all  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  or  all  money,  tainted  and  untainted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  but  ­­ but  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  becomes,  is  there  a  substantive  difference, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  think  Justice  Breyer  is  expressing  ­­ the  problem 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  this,  as  Justice  Kagan  said,  this  intuitive  sense, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  where  do  we  draw  this  line? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Does  the  right  to 

  

 

 

 

 

counsel  have  any  meaning  anymore? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  think  it  does. 

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Frankly,  I  expect  within 

   

  

 

 

three  to  five  years,  if  we  rule  in  your  favor,  853  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  changed  to  have  this  same  language.

does  permit  forfeiture  of  substitute  property. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Yes,  but  not  pretrial. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  Not  ­­ not  pretrial.  This 

  

  

 

 

 

 

statute  is  different  because  it  has  a  different  function 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  a  different  purpose.  But  the  basic  concept  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture  is  punishing  the  defendant  by  taking  money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  forfeiture  that's  equivalent  to  the  tainted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  if  the  tainted  property  is  gone.  That's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  behind  it.  Now  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  that's  true  of  every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

judgment. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  It  is  true  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Every  judgment  gives  you 

  

 

 

 

 

a  right  to  substitute  property  of  some  sort. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes,  but  ­­ but  the  point  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  tainted  property  and  the  substitute  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  similarly  situated  at  the  end  of  the  forfeiture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  The  government  has  a  property  right  in  each  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them,  but  the  ­­ I  don't  think  the  property  right  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  the  essence  of  what's  going  on  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  fact  that  Section  853  permits  pretrial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restraint  of  tainted  property,  but  it  doesn't  reference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  subsection  that  deals  with  substitute  property,  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

feature  of  that  statute,  but  I  think  that  has  nothing  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  with  the  underlying  point,  which  is  that  if  the

property.  Monsanto  recognizes  that,  and  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  saying  that  the  defendant  has  a  interest  in  paying

made  whole  at  the  conclusion  of  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Dreeben  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  When  did  the  ­­ when  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ when  was  the  first  statute  that  allowed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  to  restrain  the  expenditure  of  tainted  funds? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Does  that  go  back  a  long  time  or  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  the  ­­ the  whole  history 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  in  personam  forfeiture  was  dormant  until  1970,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  Congress  passed  a  statute  that  permitted  this  kind 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  activity.  It  improved  the  statute  in  1984  to  remedy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defects  in  the  pretrial  restraint  of  assets. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it  was  relatively  recently  developed, 

 

 

 

 

 

targeting  basically  drug  conspiracies  and  organized 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  activity. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  ­­ and  the  first  time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  ever  applied  it  to  non­tainted  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  what  year? 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  the  substitute  assets 

  

 

 

 

 

provision  was  added  to  the  ­­ the  basic  forfeiture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  and  it  was  there  at  least  by  1984.  I  think

that  it  may  have  been  earlier  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  provision  is  different,  as  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor  pointed  out,  from  the  basic  forfeiture  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  permitting  pretrial  restraint  of  any  assets,  but  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  it  reflects  the  same  basic  underlying  idea. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  ­­ but  just  ­­ just  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  clear,  so  that  I  understood  your  earlier  answer,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence,  the  necessary  consequence  of  your  position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  any  State  in  the  union  can  provide  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeiture  or  a  freeze  ­­ a  freeze  of  assets  pending 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

trial  in  any  assault  and  battery  case,  spousal  abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  criminal  negligence,  date  rape  cases  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  the  victim  whole,  to  pay  for  medical  costs,  to  pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  pain  and  suffering,  and  can  freeze  those  assets  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  consequences  of  that  is  that  in  most  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  most  people  cannot  afford  counsel. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  if  ­­ if  at  the  conclusion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  case  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  the  consequence  of 

  

 

 

 

 

your  argument? 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  think  that  if  there  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ yes,  if  there  is  a  monetary  assessment  that  will

government  can  show  a  need  to  preserve  the  assets  so

that  they're  available. 

 

 

              

 

 

I  mean,  think  about  the  cases  that  you're 

 

 

 

 

talking  about,  Justice  Kennedy.  They  are  cases  in  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victims  have  been  harmed.  Serious  medical  costs  may  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  issue.  If  the  funds  are  spent  on  an  attorney,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  not  be  available  for  compensation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  and  they're 

  

 

 

 

 

all  cases  in  which  the  defendant  has  not  been  found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty.  And  ­­ and  in  all  those  cases,  I  mean,  all  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  do,  all  the  governments  have  to  do,  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  governments  have  to  do,  is  provide  for  a  fine  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argue,  then,  well,  unless  we  ­­ if  we  don't  freeze  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets,  there  won't  be  money  left  to  pay  a  fine.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  could  apply  ­­ I  guess  this  is  the  point.  This

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  I  ­­ I  do  think  the  Court 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

could  draw  distinctions  among  the  types  of  fines  and  the

although  it's  not  required  by  statute,  it  will  be

saying  that  your  ­­ your  view,  your  interpretation,  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  of  the  statute  is  the  only  tenable  one,  but  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  took  the  view  that  Justice  Breyer's  interpretation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  restraining  order  means  a  temporary  restraining 

   

 

 

 

 

order,  or  it  was  another  interpretation  put  forth  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Americans  for  Forfeiture  Reform  brief,  because  if  ­­ if

plausible.  For  the  reasons  that  I  explained  to  Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  this  statute  doesn't  limit  the  restraining  order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  temporary  relief,  nor  would  it  make  any  logical  sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  that  because  the  purpose  of  this  statute  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserve  funds  so  that  they  would  be  available  at  the

I  also  think  that  the  amicus  argument  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  tenable  one  because  it  simply  reads  "or  equivalent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value"  out  of  the  statute  and  without  any  reference  to

government  be  able  to  be  made  whole  at  the  conclusion  of

difficult  process  of  segregating  out  money  in  banking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  financial­type  crimes. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Dreeben,  if  I  could  go 

   

  

 

 

 

 

back  to  Justice  Alito's  questions  about  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  the  statute,  I  think  what  Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alito  was  suggesting  was  that  (a)(2)(A)  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  subsumed  by  (a)(2)(B)  on  your  interpretation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  don't  think  that  you  got  around  to  answering  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  I  ­­ I  think  that  that  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  is  true.  I  think  this  Court  understands,  from 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  last  week,  that  superfluity  is  no  stranger  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  statutes.  They  do  have  a  different  focus, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

though,  and  I  think  it  was  quite  reasonable  for  Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  clear  what  that  focus  is.  2(A)  is  aimed  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  who's  doing  the  dissipating  themselves,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  who  obtained  the  property  by  fraud,  and  (B) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expands  that  out.

that,  you're  essentially  saying,  yes,  (B)  expands  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out,  meaning  it  covers  everything  that  (A)  covers  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  more. 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes,  but  the  ­­ it's  not  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  a  statute  that  anyone's  reading  gives  off 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  of  fact  because  the  (b)  section,  1345(b) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permits  restraining  orders  or  prohibitions  during  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course  of  the  case  as  are  needed  to  protect  the

other  expenditures? 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  No,  I  don't  think  there's  any 

   

  

 

 

 

 

reading  of  the  statute  that  exempts  counsel.

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  HOWARD  SREBNICK 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  all  of  us  who  heard  the  argument  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Monsanto  and  Caplin  &  Drysdale  when  it  was  delivered  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1989  understood  the  line  was  drawn  between  tainted  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untainted  assets.  And  that  was  a  line  ­­ while  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  bar  had  its  druthers,  was  a  line  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted  by  the  Court.  The  government  proposes  now  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

move  that  line  and  essentially  make  the  line  disappear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

altogether. 

            

            

Justice  Alito  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  don't  want  to  use  up  your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

rebuttal  time,  but  I  do  want  to  ask  you  two  quick 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  about  the  statute. 

 

 

 

            

First  is:  Did  you  raise  anything  about  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  your  cert  petition?  And  the  second  is:  Is  there  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  limit  this  to  the  Sixth  Amendment  context? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  The  answer  to  the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  no.  In  our  cert  petition,  since  we  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constrained  in  the  Eleventh  Circuit  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  that  had  been  given  back  in  1999,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused  on  the  constitutional  issue  in  order  to  suggest

avoidance  should  be  triggered  because  there's  a  Sixth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  problem. 

 

            

The  Eleventh  Circuit  has  concluded  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  is  ambiguous. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  didn't  say  anything 

  

 

 

 

 

about  constitutional  avoidance  in  your  cert  position, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  you? 

 

            

MR.  SREBNICK:  That  is  correct.  We  argued 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  the  Constitution  would  be  violated,  and  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court,  in  its  discretion  and  indeed  in  the  Rumsfeld 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vs.  FAIR  case,  looks  at  a  statute  even  if  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  is  offered  at  the  merit  stage  by  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus,  the  Court  has  considered  those  competing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretations  in  order  to  avoid  the  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue.

about  property,  it  sure  sounded  to  anyone  who  heard  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  and  read  the  opinions  in  Monsanto  and  Caplin  & 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Drysdale  that  it  was  much  about  property.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  by  invoking  the  taint  theory,  which  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

date  back  to  the  founding  of  our  nation,  taints  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  subject,  and  that  is  the  tainted  asset. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  why  it's  called  the  taint  theory.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

counterintuitive  to  suggest  that  untainted  assets  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  treated  as  tainted  assets.

And  because,  as  I  used  the  word  earlier, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there  must  be  a  coexistence  between  the  taint  theory  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  right  to  counsel  of  choice,  Monsanto  drew  the  line, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Caplin  &  Drysdale  drew  the  line  and  said  if  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  can  establish  that  the  asset  is  tainted,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  frozen. 

 

 

            

Nothing  about  Monsanto,  nothing  about  Caplin 

 

 

 

 

 

&  Drysdale,  suggested  that  assets  over  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  has  no  present  property  interest,  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relation­backed  theory,  no  taint  theory  to  speak  of,  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  take  Aunt  Sally's  money  or  a  client's  pension  funds 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed  to  ­­ for  representation  to  use  those  assets  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retain  counsel.  Nothing  in  this  Court's  precedent  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  cases  suggests  that. 

 

 

 

            

And  naturally,  as  a  member  of  the  defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

bar,  we  would  welcome  a  revisiting  of  Monsanto  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Caplin  &  Drysdale  because  the  parade  of  horribles  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  today.  The  government  says  quite  candidly  there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  line.  If  the  fine  is  $1  million,  the  defendant  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  pony  up,  ante  up  $1  million  up  front  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  his  right  to  counsel.  The  right  to  counsel  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice  will  have  a  price  tag.  And  it  is  whatever  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  says  the  maximum  fine  is.  Whatever  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

maximum  restitution  is,  that  will  be  the  price  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  must  pay  in  advance.  It's  an  advance  fee  that
