 As the Government concedes, INA subsection 
10
11  101(a)(13)(C)(v), added by IIRIRA, does not expressly 
12  mandate retroactivity.  Under Landgraf, applying that 
13  new provision would attach new legal consequences to 
14  pre-IIRIRA offenses, penalizing both those who travel 
15
16
17  visit their parents abroad without being forced to 
18  abandon their children here.  They would be removed from 
19  the country or else confined here.  Either way, they 
would lose an ability they had under pre-IIRIRA law 
20
21  based on pre-IIRIRA offenses.  Thus, applying the 
22  subsection to them would be impermissibly retroactive. 
 The settled expectations at issue here are 
23

17  they -- the person who -- who is here and then the new 
18  law is passed -- could that person have petitioned for

 MR. BIBAS:  Yes, Your Honor, that is a 
20
21  possibility.  That is not the same as the automatic 
22  ability to travel, and, in fact, in this case the 
23  discretionary relief was denied.  It depends on a 
24  different set of factors from the automatic pre-IIRIRA 
ability to travel.  But it is a theoretical possibility

19  seem to me that this issue enters into the expectations 
at all when the pertinent act, which is the commission 
20
21  of the crime, not the pleading guilty, takes place. 
22
23  practical impact is a new travel disability or penalty,

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What's the difference
 

1  to it was impermissibly retroactive.  In Hughes 
2  Aircraft, filing false claims with the government had 
3  been illegal for years; yet, broadening the class of 
4  people who could file suit and removing a defense -- no 
5
6  expectation that there would be no additional
 
7  consequences attached to that.
 
8
9  between someone who commits the crime just before the
 
Act is passed and someone who commits the crime just 
10
11 
after the Act is passed?  The person who commits the 
crime just after the Act is passed had the expectation 
12 
13 
prior to the passage of the Act that if he did certain 
things, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't have this consequence

from his conduct.

18  is passed is that the consequences are fixed in time. 
19  And if Congress decides that the potential unfairness is 
20
21  retroactive --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  But the person who -- who 
22
23  commits the crime just after the Act is passed had the 
24  expectation prior to that time, that had -- if he did

certain things in the future, he wouldn't suffer certain

2
 MR. BIBAS:  And yet, Congress has -- has 
3  affirmatively warned and put everybody on notice that 
4  now there is this new consequence.  You may be deterred 
by this new consequence.  We may be punishing you by 
5
6  this new consequence.  But the consequence has been 
7  announced. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Bibas, I have -- this 
8
9  is almost a question of personal privilege.  You -- you 
make your whole argument on the basis of Landgraf.  So 
10
11 
does the Government.  You do not cite -- the Government 
cites but does not discuss the relevant portion of a --
12 
13 
of a later case which involved the same question, 
Republic of Austria v. Altmann.
14 
15
16  thought that the test that the Court was using, 
17  upsetting settled expectations, was indeed the proper 
18  test for constitutional provisions forbidding ex post 
19  facto laws, which is where the Court derived it from, 
20
21  constitutional case. 
22
23  test for -- for the other issue of retroactivity, 
24  namely, constitutionality aside, does this statute mean 
25

to be applied only in the future or in the past?  And 

 I concurred separately in Landgraf because I

 "Our approach" -- which postdates Landgraf. 

1  for that, I propose -- well, I'll read you what we said 
2  in Altmann: 
3
4  "Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus 
parallels that advanced by Justice Scalia in the 
5
6  concurrence in Landgraf."  Quote, and it's quoting the 
7  concurrence:  "'The critical issue ... is not whether 
8  the rule affects 'vested rights,' or governs substance 
9  or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity

21  United States, and it is clear that this statute applies 
22  only to prospective entry into the United States.  It 
23  doesn't apply to past entry so that those people who 
24  came in, in violation of this statute, can be deported. 
Now, why shouldn't we apply that rule in this case, as 
25

that the rule regulates.  Absent clear statement 
otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs 
after the effective date of the statute is covered. 
Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and 
hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct 
that occurred before their effective date.  But other 
statutes have a different purpose and therefore a 
different relative retroactivity event'" -- "'relevant 
retroactivity event.'" 

 And that is what we have here.  The -- the 
event that is sought to be regulated is entry into the

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, there are five 

different then from a felon in possession statute, where 

1  not just the innocent post-IIRIRA travel.  What we have 
2  is future lawful travel, concededly lawful, nothing 
3  nefarious needs to be shown of it.

9  this man, because of that past offense, can't buy a gun 
10
11
12  pertinent distinctions.  Permit me to unpack. 
13
 The first and most important is that the 
14  Landgraf test should have a broader scope than the ex 
15
16  Congress can override it expressly. 
17
18  State and Federal legislatures from acting at all, the 
19  deprivation of power must be narrow and careful so State 
and Federal legislatures can continue to regulate felon

22  Government advances.

25

to have a presumption against retroactivity sweep more 

post facto context in these criminal cases because

 The third and related point is that felon in 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why isn't the -- the 

1  broadly, as Congress is free to override it and, as I 
2  will explain, does override it regularly. 
 Secondly, felon in possession is inherently 
3
4  dangerous conduct.  This is a protective law.  It's not 
5
6
7  possession laws are tailored.  There's a nexus to a 
8  danger, a threat to people suffering firearm -- it's 
9  narrowly tailored.  Fourth --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  are quite different.  Felon in possession is limited to 
firearms in the hands of proven dangerous people.  Here 
20
21  we have a law that says you can stay in the country 
22  indefinitely; we're going to discourage you from going 
23  abroad and leaving the country because we'll make it 
24  harder for you to come back.  That's not tailored at all 
25

government, Congress, making the exact same judgment 
here?  If the activity to be regulated is entry, and 
Congress is making a judgment that we do not want 
dangerous people to enter, and we're using the 
conviction, the prior conviction, as a marker for who is 
dangerous, and that's exactly what Congress has done in 
the felon in possession statute. 

to protecting the people inside the United States. 

 MR. BIBAS:  Your Honor, I believe the two 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

expectations being upset by felon in possession laws. 
 And the final one is Congress can do that 

1
2  possession statute, as this Court noted in Heller, is 
3  part of a long tradition of forbidding such activity as 
4  a crime.  So, it's hard to say there are settled 
5
6
7  simply by being explicit, and it has done so repeatedly 
8  in laws such as IIRIRA.  Elsewhere in IIRIRA, section 
9  321(b) says the aggravated felony definition applies to 
convictions entered before, on, or after the statute's 
10
11 
effective date.  It knew how to do it; it did it more 
than a dozen other times in IIRIRA, as this Court noted 
12 
13 
in St. Cyr.  It didn't spell it out here.  The point of 
this --
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23
24  noted, in the criminal context, this Court in Witte and 
Gryger notes it's a heavier punishment on the new crime 
25

criminal enhancements, instead of the felon in 
possession?  And assuming your arguments, what limits 
can Congress put on anyone with respect to future 
conduct if it's going to be a burden?  Under your view, 
it stops people from traveling.  Career criminal 
statutes put on the distinct disadvantage of a longer 
sentence. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about the career 

Official 

 I'd also point out that the felon in 

 MR. BIBAS:  Yes, Your Honor, and as we 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

say that that's punishing the past offense because the 

1  because it's aggravated, because it's repeated.  And 
2  because Congress has more leeway in the ex post facto 
3  context and because recidivism enhancements have a long 
4  tradition, it's entirely legitimate.  There's no need to 
5
6  future offense -- it --- it's permissible to increase it 
7  under the Ex Post Facto Clause. 
 And that's an inquiry that's different from 
8
9  the Landgraf test here because all Congress has to do is 
spell out expressly we want to apply this to convictions 
10
11 
entered before, on, or after the statute's effective 
date, which it did in 321(b), which it didn't do here. 
12 
13 
So, if we were looking at the function of --
14
15
16  conclusion that Congress intended to rescind the Fleuti 
17  decision -- but you assume that's what its intent was? 
 MR. BIBAS:  We've assumed arguendo because 
18
19  that's the premise of the question presented.  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, if we assume that, 
20
21  if we assume that was Congress's intent, doesn't that 
22  start -- give you the conclusion?  If Congress intended 
23  to undo it, doesn't that prove that they intended to 
24  effect it retroactively?
25

 MR. BIBAS:  No, Your Honor, it doesn't.  All 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does that argument that 

you've just made go more to whether or not the BIA's

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you assume Congress 

1  the case law, the legislative history, the other 
2  discussion was about certain other aspects of entry 
3  doctrine that needed to be changed.  The discussion was 
4  express about saying we're changing the definition from 
entry to admission because we don't want people who have 
5
6  snuck into the country outside of --
7
8  to the basic premise. 
9
10
11  intended to rescind the prior doctrine, isn't that proof 
12  itself that it intended to apply the statute 
13  retroactively? 
 MR. BIBAS:  No, Your Honor --
14
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  To this conduct? 
15
16
 MR. BIBAS:  No, Your Honor.  Congress can 
17  intend to rescind -- to -- to abrogate a statute such 
18  that it will have no effect going forward, but as this 
19  Court noted in Landgraf, the -- the background default 
20
21  laws will apply prospectively.  That has the virtue not 
22  only of giving a clear background rule which -- against 
23  which Congress legislates, against which it did 
24  legislate in IIRIRA; but it also forces Congress to 
25

rule that the public and Congress expect is that new 

advert to the potential unfairness of retroactivity and 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

open.  If you think it's beneficial to make this
 

disability, the Government's argument seems to boil down 
to that, because there is one event that must happen 
after the statute's effective date, therefore there can 
be no retroactive effect. 

1  decide that the benefits outweigh it. 
2
3  makes perfect sense, and that clear statement rule 
4  serves the function of having them smoke out into the

19  government has picked the event that it wants to 
20
21
 MR. BIBAS:  Yes, Your Honor, but this is an

23  have to take a commonsense functional view of what the 
24  effects are, the new legal consequences.  As --

 So, to go back to our primary point, with
 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Why would -- why would the Government 

1  your answer to my colleague would be:  No, what they 
2  want to regulate is the staying in the country, and 
3  they're trying to make that as uncomfortable as possible 
4  in order to encourage the individual to leave.  If he 
can't go to the, you know, parent's party, the cousin's 
5
6  wedding or whatever, he's just going to leave, and then 
7  once he does, he can't come back. 
8
9  care -- it's a question for them, I'm sure.  Why would 
they care whether somebody that they don't want to be 
10
11 
here stays here?  It seems to me the exact opposite. 
So, I would have thought your argument -- your answer 
12 
13 
would be, no, what they're trying to regulate is not the 
coming and going, but simply the staying.
14 
 MR. BIBAS:  Yes, Your Honor, you're right 
15
16  that, particularly given the strange way in which it's 
17  written, it's hard to understand it as something other 
18  than a penalty and possibly a deterrent, but certainly a 
19  penalty based on past crimes, to make life 
uncomfortable.  And that does not speak of a protective, 
20
21  forward-looking exclusive function, if that's the test. 
22
 But to go back to the earlier point, if that 
23  were -- if we were to follow the approach Justice Scalia 
24  outlined, that would be the right response.  But we 
25

don't even need to get there because the primary test

he was not convictable. 

1  under Landgraf is not the point or function or purpose, 
2  but an effects test.  The effect, as the Government 
3  concedes, is to force him to choose between his parents 
4  in Greece and his wife, children, career, and home here.
5
6  but there are a lot of statutes which we interpret to be 
7  valid, and not retroactive, which have a substantial 
8  effect.  You can pass a statute altering the rules of 
9  evidence which have the effect of making someone who 
10
11 
12
 And we don't just look to the effect and 
13  say, well, it has that substantial effect; so, it's 
14  operating retroactively.  We say, no, it's a rule of 
15
16  can come in. 
17
18  approach.  There are often adverse effects upon 
19  activities that occurred before the statute was enacted, 
but we still regard the statute as prospective only and, 
20
21  therefore, not subject to special rules for people who 
22  are affected. 
23
24  difference between the ex post facto context and the

conduct. 

 The disability in St. Cyr of not being able 

1  distinction which I know Your Honor didn't sign on to. 
2  It's also relevant that here it is directly expressly 
3  tied to a past conduct.  It's a precondition.  It's not 
4  even a piece of evidence or something one can draw an 
inference from.  It is a precondition for ineligibility 
5
6  under 101(a)(13)(C)(v).  And, therefore, it looks like 
7  the disability that Justice Story said; a disability has 
8  to involve future conduct.  But if it's expressly 
9  disabling future conduct, that's a penalty on past 
10
11
12  to apply for future discretionary relief.  The 
13  disability in some other cases of this Court that we 
14  found after briefing and alerted opposing counsel to, 
Cummings v. Missouri and Ex parte Garland in volume 71 
15
16  of the U.S. Reports.  Even though the law there forbade 
17  teaching in the future or holding office or preaching or 
18  being a member of the bar, the Government's theory would 
19  say those are post-enactment things; just refrain from 
20
21

prerequisite.  This Court can rule for Petitioner and 

goes away.  The Government concedes the court of appeals 
implicitly was wrong on that. 

1  potential unfairness of retroactivity is worth it. 
2
 Now, the final point here, I believe there 
3  was some reference earlier to reliance in the offense. 
4  And as the Government concedes, reliance is not a 
5
6  not even bother with reliance.  But the presence of 
7  reliance here is an extra factor that -- that shows the 
8  retroactivity to be obvious and severe.  So, the court 
9  of appeals' whole premise that reliance is necessary 
10
11 
12
 As a practical matter, our point is that 
13  defendants rely on the known consequences of offenses 
14  when they decide to plead guilty.  As this Court

17  plead guilty? 
18

 MR. BIBAS:  We don't claim that there's a 
22  reliance interest in committing the crime, but in the 
23  decision to plead guilty, as a practical matter, the 
24  defendants weigh a number of consequences.  And one of 
those is whether they might have a 4-month discount off

7  your position is that only those who have entered a 
8  guilty plea are entitled to the presumption against 
9  non-retroactivity, but not those who've been found 
10
11
12  is that because reliance isn't necessary, all of them 
13  benefit from it because they all have settled 
14  expectations.
15
16  if reliance isn't necessary?  St. Cyr is all about 
17  reliance. 
 MR. BIBAS:  Yes.  And at the end of this 
18
19  Court's opinion, the Court said that the presence of 
this reliance made the retroactive effect especially 
20
21  obvious and sincere -- especially obvious and severe in 
22  St. Cyr.  That did not purport to overrule holdings in 
23  Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft, where there had been no

Congress when they passed this was that it would only

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you have any case

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

1
2
3
4  please the Court:
 As the discussion so far this morning 
5
6  reveals, the Court's retroactivity analysis takes 
7  account of a number of different factors, but the one 
8  that is most significant and, indeed in this case, 
9  virtually dispositive is that the application of section 
1101(a)(13) to Petitioner was triggered only because he 
10
11 
engaged in voluntary conduct that postdated the 
12 
enactment of the statute. 
13
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  What do you take the trigger 
14  to be?  Because in your brief you kept on talking about 
15
16  that you would have talked more about the activity being 
17  the attempt to enter the country. 
18
19  closely connected together in time, and they both -- but 
they both postdate the enactment of the statute.  But 
20
21  what -- the thing that is being regulated by section 
22  1101(a)(13) is the entry of aliens into the United 
23  States.  The statute sets out a comprehensive scheme for 
24  determining when an alien arriving at the border seeking 
25

the trigger being the trip.  And I would have thought 

to come into the United States should be regarded as 

 MR. MILLER:  That's -- I mean they're 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company

1  seeking an admission.  So, that's conduct that takes 
2  place in the future. 
 Part (A) of 1101(a)(13) sets out the general 
3
4  definition of admission, and then (C) sets out a number 
of exceptions.  And so, taken together, they are part of 
5
6  a comprehensive effort to codify Fleuti in some 
7  respects.  And, in particular, Romanette (ii), the 
8  180-day provision, is actually a fairly generous 
9  codification of Fleuti, probably extending beyond what 
would have been regarded as a brief trip under Fleuti. 
10
11
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I have 
12  to -- I just don't understand this statute.  This is 
13  somebody we would not allow into the country.  And yet, 
14  the only thing we say is you can't leave.  I just don't 
15
16
 MR. MILLER:  I think there are -- there are 
17  two points to be made about that.  And the first is that

2  turpitude was a basis for inadmissibility but was

4  1-year sentence and was committed within 5 years --

7  deporting the person.  But here I would think the one

19  obliged to tell a defendant faced with a criminal charge 
what the legal -- what the immigration consequences will 
20
21  be.  And here, suppose before the -- at the time of the 
22  plea in this case, the attorney had said, once you've 
23  served your time, you will be able to take brief casual 
24  trips.  That would have been accurate advice, right?

consequence for me?  And the question that's asked is, 
will I still be able to visit my mother in Greece?  What 
should the lawyer -- what should the lawyer at that time 
have answered? 

 MR. MILLER:  Well, I think -- I think the 
1
2  most important point about the consequence of the plea 
3  is that, as an immediate result of the plea under 
4  pre-IIRIRA law, so at the time he pleaded guilty in 
1994, he made himself inadmissible.  So, that's not 
5
6  anything that has changed.  So, he knew that he was --

19  would have been, yes, you can make trips abroad,

 MR. MILLER:  That's -- that's right.  And I 
22  think you might also have said that under a current law, 
23  you will not be regarded as seeking an admission if you 
24  take a brief, casual, and innocent trip.  But the change

very real has happened to the life of this person. 

 MR. MILLER:  That's -- that's right, I mean, 

1
2  what's going to be important to the person, right?  It's 
3  not inadmissible and all the legal terms.  Am I going to 
4  be able to make short trips to visit my mother?  Yes, 
you are going to be able to make short trips to visit 
5
6  your mother. 
7
 And then you wake up the next morning, and 
8  Congress has passed a statute, and now you're not able 
9  to take short trips to visit your mother.  So, something 
10
11
12  and there is no question but that there is a serious 
13  consequence as a result of the change in the law.  But 
14  the Court has made clear in Landgraf and in a number of 
15
16  statutes can impose burdens. 
17
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true, but in -- in 
18  St. Cyr, as I read it, on pages 322 and 23, the Court 
19  focused directly, not on the crime point of time, but 
the time of the guilty plea.  And what the Court says 
20
21  there is that a person who is thinking of pleading 
22  guilty might well have taken into account the fact that 
23  he could ask the Attorney General later when he's about 
24  to be deported to exercise discretion in his favor.

will never see them again.  Now, that seems to be the 
question. 

1  say why I'm not reading them correctly, but that's how I 
2  read them.  And then, having read it that way, I thought 
3  the question in this case is whether the person who's 
4  sitting at the table and deciding whether to plead 
guilty or not is likely to think, well, if I plead 
5
6  guilty, I can always ask for discretion.  That's St. 
7  Cyr. 
 Well, if I plead guilty, I can still visit

9  my aging parents and grandparents, a matter that could

15
16  There isn't that much chance of getting discretion.  It 
17  might be important to some people to visit their aging 
18  parents and grandparents.  So, go ahead.  Answer the 
19  question.  Is the one more important than the other? 
20
21
22  described the reasoning of the Court in St. Cyr, and I 
23  think that that reasoning highlights two ways in which 
24  this case is significantly different.  And the first is 
25

I don't know the answer.  I mean, maybe it would be. 

And if not, why not? 

 MR. MILLER:  I think you've correctly 

that, in St. Cyr, it was the guilty plea, the 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but I'm really asking 

MR. MILLER:  -- is not the guilty plea. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- isn't my question the 

1  conviction, that was legally significant under the 
2  provision of IIRIRA at issue there.  And the Court 
3  emphasized that a guilty plea is a quid pro quo.  It has 
4  to be knowing and voluntary.  The Court cited 
Santobello v. New York, a due process case about guilty 
5
6  pleas.  And then -- so, one difference in this case is 
7  that the legally significant event here --
8
9  you --
10
11
12  key question?  Now, you can answer that "no."  But -- I 
13  mean, I suppose you could prove that the only thing that 
14  mattered to -- to LPRs who plead guilty, the only thing 
15
16  grandparents, a matter I doubt; but, you can say, even 
17  on that situation, it would make no difference, or you 
18  could say I think the one is as important as the other, 
19  or you could say they're not.  I just want to get your 
full answer, all -- your whole answer to my question. 
20
21
 MR. MILLER:  The conclusion to the first 
22  part of the answer is that it wouldn't make a difference 
23  because what matters here is not the guilty plea; what 
24  triggers the application of 1101(a)(13)(C) is the 
25

that mattered, was visiting their parents and

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I can't imagine that it's 

1
2  Mr. Miller, as a formal matter that that's true, that 
3  that's the words of the statute.  But how many times has 
4  the Department of Homeland Security tried to declare a 
person inadmissible on the basis of the commission of a 
5
6  crime without putting into evidence either a conviction 
7  or a guilty plea? 
8
9
10
11  hand.  I mean, that's the way people prove crimes in 
12  this area, isn't it, by convictions or guilty pleas? 
13
14  is a statue --
15
16 
17
18  by -- in the first instance, by customs officers at the 
19  airport or at the land border crossing.  They have 
20
21  records of convictions but also things like arrest 
22  warrants.  And an arrest warrant by itself would not be 
23  enough to show that a person had, in fact, committed an 
24  offense, but it might well trigger some further inquiry 
from the customs officer that would lead to them finding 
25

access to a number of databases which include not only

3
4  the way the commission of crime is proved in this area 
is through showing a conviction, does your distinction 
5
6  stand up at all? 
7
 MR. MILLER:  I mean, there is still, I 
8  think, a significant formal distinction, and then 
9  there's also another important distinction from St. Cyr, 
which is that that was a case where, as a result of the 
10
11 
guilty plea plus the change in law, the person there 
faced immediate deportability with no prospect of 
12 
13 
discretionary relief.  And the Court said that there is 
a clear difference, for purposes of the retroactivity 
14 
analysis, between a possibility of deportability and a 
15
16 
certainty of deportation. 
17
 Here, not only is he not deportable, but 
18  there's no immediate consequence for him at all.  The 
19  statute only has any effect on him when he engages in 
20
21
22  characterization?  Which seemed to me to make common 
23  sense.  Yes, the trigger is that he has gone abroad and 
24  is returning.  But the target, they say, was the crime. 
That's why the law -- the law really doesn't care about 
25

the post-enactment travel.  And I think --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 In those cases, you had statutes that were 

 MR. MILLER:  I -- I don't think that's 

the distinctions between this case and Cummings v. 

here is that the statutes are imposing punishment for 
the completed acts.  To the extent there was any doubt 
in those cases themselves, this Court discussed them 
both in Harisiades v. Shaughnessy and said that it 
viewed them as cases about punishment.  This is not a 
statute --

1  the travel back and forth; what it cares about is that 
2  this person was convicted of a crime. 
3
4  correct, Your Honor, and I think that highlights one of 
5
6  Missouri and Ex parte Garland.

8  nominally prospective in application, but the Court 
9  actually said that we think that what's really happening 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  here, meaning -- it goes back to the Chief Justice's 
18  question, which is what they're trying to do is punish 
19  those individuals, those LPRs, who have committed this 
kind of crime, by not letting them travel or come back 
20
21  in.  That's really what their argument is, is -- you 
22  know, you are imposing a punishment, a disability, for 
23  having committed the crime.  You're not imposing a 
24  disability merely for the act of traveling.
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But isn't that the case 

 MR. MILLER:  I mean, I think when you look 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And then you have -- have this one, which is 

distinction between inadmissibility and deportability. 
And I think it recognizes --

1  at the statute as a whole, you see that it's a -- it's a 
2  comprehensive regulation of crossing the border, which 
3  has always been regarded as a legally significant event. 
4  There are six subparts to 1101(a)(13)(C).  Five of them 
have nothing to do with past conduct.  They're about the 
5
6  nature of the trip and what the alien is doing as he's 
7  coming in. 
8
9  of a piece with the long history of drawing a

22  over many, many years that it is one thing to say to an 
23  alien, all right, we're not going to go and try and find 
24  you and take you and kick you out of the country.  It is

9  reflected -- you know, this Court has recognized that

15
16  to pick up all of these people and send them away.

 And it's true that that conduct was

8  analysis, the Court didn't focus on whether it was 
9  lawful or unlawful.  What matters is that it was conduct 
10
11 
12
 And so, here, although the -- the trip is 
13  not unlawful in that sense, it is future conduct.  And 
14  here, as in Fernandez-Vargas, there is ample warning --
which was another point that the Court emphasized in

 If you have a statute that, for example,

6  makes it a crime to have engaged in certain conduct in 
7  the past and then, you know, something -- some 
8  commonplace, utterly trivial activity in the future, I 
9  think a court looking at that would say this is not --
although it is nominally prospective, this is really a 
10
11 
statute aimed at punishing the prior conduct. 
12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I -- I don't know. 
13  I think it would be prospective and unconstitutional 
14  because it's irrational.  I mean, not everything that's 
unconstitutional is unconstitutional -- not everything

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, yes.
 MR. MILLER:  I -- I think that's the best 
10
11  reading of Landgraf, and I think under -- under the 
12  analysis suggested in your concurring opinion in 
13  Landgraf --
14
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  Yes.
 MR. MILLER:  -- I think one would look at 
15
16  that statute and say this is really a statute that's 
17  aimed at regulating the past conduct, and that -- that 
18  has a retroactive effect. 
19
I would just say that there is a narrow category of 
20
21  cases where you have what is in form a prospective 
22  regulation that's really aimed at -- aimed at burdening 
23  or punishing a past act.  But this is not that.

 So, I mean, to finish that thought, I think 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And how do we separate those 

two?  How do we decide that this is not that, and that

 MR. MILLER:  I -- in the criminal context, 

legitimate prospective regulatory purpose. 

 And so, that's why, for example, statutes 

Mendoza-Martinez to figure out whether a statute is --

1  it's instead something else, that it's a regulation of 
2  future conduct? 
3
4  the Court has used the analysis of Kennedy v. 
5
6  is imposing additional punishment for past conduct.  And 
7  that looks at a number of factors, and the most 
8  important factor under that test, the Court has said, is 
9  whether the statute appears to be related to a 
10
11
12  like 922(g), the felon in possession statute, which was, 
13  I would point out, amended just back in 1996 to add 
14  misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, which had not 
previously been something that would subject one to a 
15
16  firearms disability -- that was added. 
17
18  the question has held that it doesn't violate the Ex 
19  Post Facto Clause and, I think, implicitly has held that 
20
21
22  pleaded guilty to spousal abuse? 
23
24
25

 MR. MILLER:  I'm not aware of any cases --

it does in fact reach that conduct. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even -- even if you had 

 Every court of appeals that has considered

Alderson Reporting Company

 Nor does it mean that it's appropriately 

viewed as imposing a disability.  I mean, I think that 

1  question, but -- but, yes, because there you have a 
2  statute that is regulating future conduct.  It only 
3  applies to somebody who engages in the future conduct. 
4  The sex offender registration laws are another example 
that this Court has upheld.  That kind of law obviously 
5
6  imposes a very significant burden on people on the basis 
7  of prior conduct, but the fact that there is some burden 
8  by itself does not mean that the statute is retroactive. 
9
10
11  the Court in Landgraf quoted Justice Story's formulation 
12  of a disability as referring to statutes that impose a 
13  disability in respect to transactions that are already 
14  passed.  So, it is not enough that there used to be 
something that you could do, and now, in the future, 
15
16  you're not going to be able to do that.  That's not a 
17  disability in the relevant sense, and if it were, I 
18  think the Court would have a very difficult line-drawing 
19  problem to figure out why it is that statutes like 
20
21  any number of --
22
23  think the Chief Justice's question and the ambiguity of 
24  the statute are relevant.  Like with SORNA you would 
25

apply it backwards, because that's a pretty clear 

922(g) are okay, or sex offender registration laws, or 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- that's why I

 MR. MILLER:  I think, if you're -- if you're 

at step two of the --

disadvantage to the person pleading guilty, that 

1  intent. 
2
 I don't know about, you know, like, "three 
3  times and you're out" statutes, et cetera.  But -- but 
4  here you have the disability on the one -- the 
5
6  problem, on the one hand; and, on the other hand, you 
7  have the policy that with a -- fill in the blank --
8  with a statute that doesn't talk about it but simply 
9  uses a new definition of admission or admissibility. 
10
11
12  asking whether Congress has specifically addressed the 
13  temporal scope of the statute, we -- we acknowledge 
14  under St. Cyr that it hasn't.  And so, that's why we're 
15
16
 JUSTICE BREYER:  More than that, what is --
17  I'm ignoring -- more than that, I'm saying what's the 
18  policy on the other side?  The policy that favors the 
19  retroactivity despite the fact that the person might not 
have pleaded guilty?  And that's why I was interested in 
20
21  the Chief Justice's question and also the ambiguity of 
22  the language in the statute that they used. 
 MR. MILLER:  I think that the -- the policy

 If there are no further questions --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could you go over 

1  concept of admission.  They're trying to redefine a 
2  comprehensive scheme for regulating the treatment of 
3  aliens arriving at the border.  And I think that you

7  of the statute. 
8
9
10
11
 MR. MILLER:  I think it's twofold, Your 
12  Honor.  The first is that, in St. Cyr, the legally 
13  significant event was the conviction.  It was the guilty 
14  plea.  Here, the guilty plea is significant because it 
makes Petitioner inadmissible, but that was true under 
15
16  current law. 
17
18  -- that the significance of what the individual is 
19  giving up makes a difference?
 MR. MILLER:  That's our second point, is 
20
21  that St. Cyr said there is a big difference between 
22  immediate deportability and the potential --
23

plead guilty?  I've always had difficulty with St. Cyr

account, or if St. Cyr prohibits that? 

 MR. MILLER:  No, I think it is certainly 

1  and the notion that, say, someone pleads -- is facing,

3  years, that the -- the reason they did that is to, you 
4  know, avoid one of these immigration provisions.  It

8  the relative significance of what is at issue under the 
9  immigration law is something that we can take into 
10
11
12  appropriate to take into account, that however --

22  discourage people from leaving the country, to keep them 
23  in.  So, any idea that the purpose is to get them out

 Third, let me make clear that we have 

prerequisite is that it is the misconduct that is being 

helpless to undo.  That is all that is required under 
Landgraf.  If Congress thinks it important, it can 
expressly require retroactivity, but it hasn't done so. 

1  post-IIRIRA innocent travel may be the trigger here, the 
2  obvious target is the pre-IIRIRA offense.  The statute 
3  is tied to misconduct.  The natural inference of making 
4  misconduct not just a piece of evidence but a 
5
6  penalized. 
7
 Second, the impact, we suggest, is the 
8  relevant test.  The impact is a penalty.  It is a 
9  disability based on a past act that Mr. Vartelas is now 
10
11 
12 
13
14  alternative theories here.  Reliance is something that 
makes the case worse.  It is something that exacerbates 
15
16  the problem, makes it obvious and severe.  And our 
17  amici, the NACDL brief, points out very movingly how 
18  important these kinds of considerations are in 
19  immigrants' decisions to plead guilty.  Here, for 
example, my client received a 4-month discount off his 
20
21  sentencing range.  It's entirely plausible to believe 
22  that immigrants in his situation might value the ability 
23  to stay in the same country with their 4-year-old and 
24  2-year-old child as much as 4 months in jail.
25

 But our broader theory is that the violation 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

business, et cetera -- that is sufficient.  Just as in 

1  of settled expectations is sufficient, whether or not 
2  there's reliance.  The settled expectation that one has 
3  of planning one's life in this country and yet having 
4  relatives abroad one will tend to or care for their 
5
6  Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft, there were no legally 
7  cognizable reliance interests in discriminating or in 
8  submitting false claims, but changing the penalties is 
9  enough.
 Fourth, this Court's decision in St. Cyr, I 
10
11  believe, strongly helps our case.  The first reason is 
12  that it imposed a disability, a disability on filing in 
13  the future for discretionary relief, but as a practical 
14  matter, it's burdening past conduct.
 Secondly, St. Cyr didn't purport to change 
15
16  the holdings in Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft that those 
17  are other ways of showing impermissible retroactivity. 
18  The logic in St. Cyr is ineluctable that because you are 
19  burdening a decision, a decision that, as the -- the 
Court and the amici in St. Cyr noted, matters greatly 
20
21  and factors into things like the plea bargaining 
22  calculus, that the retroactivity is especially obvious 
23  and -- and severe. 
24
25

this same statute, a privilege, not a right, a privilege 

 And let me note that St. Cyr was decided under 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Finally, let me talk about the
 

discretionary relief, there is a privilege to not be
 

1  that Congress can abrogate at any time.  That did not

3  right/privilege distinction is dead in this area of law.

23  trying to say this law is forbidden.  Smith v. Doe 
24  involved a law where the Court's opinion said on its 
25

introduced Smith v. Doe and mentioned some of the sex 
offender cases.  I've explained why the criminal cases 
in ex post facto are different, but let me go into some 
more detail as the Court is well familiar with 
Smith v. Doe.  That was a civil case that Doe attempted 
to turn into a criminal case under the very demanding 
standard in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez.  But that's a 
very uphill fight.  As the Court's opinion recognized, 
the court must be very deferential before turning 
something facially civil into criminal because then it's 
categorically forbidden and it comes with the criminal 
procedure protections in the Bill of Rights. 

 That's not what we're doing now.  We're not
