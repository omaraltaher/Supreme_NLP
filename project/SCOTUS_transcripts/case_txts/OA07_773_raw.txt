 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Vaden v. Discover Bank.

 Mr. Ortiz.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ORTIZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 This case poses two substantive issues: 

First, whether section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act 
impliedly repeals section 1331's "well-pleaded 
complaint" requirement?  Only if it does can a district 
court look through a petition to compel arbitration that 
itself contains no Federal question to ground Federal 
subject matter jurisdiction on a Federal question 
lurking somewhere in the dispute sought to be 
arbitrated.

 And, second, if section 4 does repeal this 

part of section 1331, can a completely pre-empted 
State-law counterclaim in a pending State-court lawsuit 
furnish look-through jurisdiction?

 Your Honors, at bottom this is ae dispute 
between two radically different conceptions of Federal 
question jurisdiction.  One view, Respondents', is so

broad as to allow parties to compel arbitration in 
Federal court of nearly any dispute concerning credit 
card debt; and one, Petitioner's, narrowly confined 
subject matter jurisdiction to those disputes where the 
arbitration agreement itself arguably arises under 
Federal law.

 But, Your Honors, the ordinary, the original 

meaning of section 4, the structure of the overall 
Federal Arbitration Act, and the purposes of the Federal 
Arbitration Act all militate strongly in favor of the 
Petitioner's view of subject matter jurisdiction here. 
First, the language.  The words "save for such 
agreement," Your Honors, as the words "save for" 
themselves suggest, necessarily imply that the agreement 
exerts some negative effect on otherwise existing 
jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That simply means 

that you can't bring an action in Federal court because 
the agreement says you can't.  The agreement says you've 
got to arbitrate.  So if you throw the agreement out 
save for such agreement, the question is whether or not 
you could then bring the action in Federal court.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, the -- those words 
"save for such agreement" were originally intended to 
refer to the hoary doctrine of ouster, which barred the

Federal courts from subject matter jurisdiction in such 
suits.  The words "but for" suggest that the agreement 
itself somehow impairs jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Ortiz, why isn't 

section 2 of the Arbitration Act sufficient to take care 
of the ouster doctrine, whatever may have been left of 
it?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, section 2 says that 

an arbitration agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, 
and enforceable.  At the time when section 2 was 
enacted, the Federal courts were still split between law 
and equity.  Section 2 by itself could well have made 
such arbitration agreements enforceable, but only in 
law.  Section 4, "save for such agreement," makes clear 
that there is no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm not sure that I 

follow that, because it seems to me -- where did this 
doctrine of ouster come from?  It came from the court. 
The courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration 
agreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction.  Why 
would a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule 
never made any sense in the first place, so we're not 
going to follow it?  It's not any rule that Congress has 
imposed on the courts.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, section 2 by itself

would not have made clear that in -- such agreements 
were enforceable in equity.  As Justice Story wrote in 
Tobey v. County of Bristol, bills in equity were thought 
in the Federal courts to be ill-founded in point of 
jurisdiction to support a motion to compel arbitration. 
And so although under section 2 such an agreement might 
be enforceable in law -- damages might be available, 
penalty clauses might be enforced in law, a party might 
also be able to recover the expenses incurred in an 
arbitration that was revoked before the arbitration came 
to its conclusion -- that would not be clear that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That may have been the 
historic model.  This was never a notion that Congress 
enforced on the courts.  They imposed it on themselves.

 So my question remains why shouldn't the 

Court then say this agreement has been declared 
enforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to 
recommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any 
more; we can change it?

 MR. ORTIZ:  No, Your Honor.  It is true that 

Congress in the Federal Arbitration Act abrogated the 
ouster doctrine.  The only question is whether section 2 
would do so by itself or whether section 4 was necessary 
because of the division between law and equity at the 
time.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm just not getting the --
I have never understood this argument and I still don't 
understand it now.  What is it in the text of section 2 
that would seem to leave it inadequate to touch equity 
as well as law?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, section 2 says that 
arbitration agreements shall be valid, irrevocable and 
enforceable, but it does not say how they could be 
enforced.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Exactly.  And why, 

therefore, would anyone -- why would anyone be drawing 
distinctions as to how?  It would be enforceable in any 
way that an agreement might appropriately be enforced in 
the courts of the United States at the time -- or any 
courts, for that matter, at the time the act was passed.
 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, if Congress wanted 
to be very clear that ouster in all of its forms was no 
longer any kind of issue in enforcing arbitration 
agreements, it took the extra step in section 4.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  It -- it made a categorical 

statement in section 2.  Why did it need to be any 
clearer than that?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, because, Your Honor, it 
would be the case that arbitration agreements could be 
enforceable, but just not enforceable in the way that

might be most helpful.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it could be, but why 

in the world would anyone draw that inference?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, because there were 
separate bars at law and equity at the time -- at the 
time of ouster.  Under law, there was some room in some 
jurisdictions for there to be enforcement, not across 
the board.  In equity there was an even higher standard 
at the time against jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I have the same problem 
that Justice Souter does, especially since section 2 
refers to equity.  It says they will be irrevocable and 
enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or 
in equity for the revocation of any contract.

 Obviously this -- this section was meant to 
apply to equitable actions.  You wouldn't dismiss them 
in law for a -- a ground that only existed in equity?
 MR. ORTIZ:  But that particular section, 
Justice Scalia, is meant to refer to ordinary State 
contract doctrines in law and equity, which would make 
the overall contract unenforceable.  The "save for" 
language is specifically directed at ouster, which is a 
jurisdictional doctrine rather than one of substantive 
contract law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know.  When it says

they are enforceable and makes an exception only for 
grounds that enable revocation in law or in equity, I 
would -- I would think that the general command was 
meant to apply to both law and equity.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, the Respondents' 

view also doesn't take into account the other provisions 
of the Federal Arbitration Act itself.  Under their 
view, the "save for" language is literally read out of 
section 4 of the agreement, since the rest of section 4 
would accomplish exactly what they think the 
look-through doctrine that they are arguing for without 
those four critical words.

 Also, sections 203 and sections 205 show 

that when Congress wanted to expand subject matter 
jurisdiction, it knew how to do so clearly and 
unequivocally.  And in fact, when Congress adopted 
Section 205 in 1970 --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I hate to interrupt you 

here, but would you explain why the words "save for such 
agreement" cut back on the jurisdiction?  I didn't quite 
understand your point.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Justice Stevens, the point is 

that "save for such agreement" instructs a court to jump 
over the historical ouster doctrine.

the court to decide whether, if there were no such 
agreements, would there be Federal jurisdiction in the 
underlying dispute?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  So in this case there 

would be.

 MR. ORTIZ:  No, Your Honor, because the 

underlying dispute between the parties in this case is 
a -- concerns the arbitration agreement, not the 
underlying bank debt.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, it's not the 

underlying bank debt, but it is an underlying dispute 
over which this Federal -- if you had brought your class 
action as an original case, there would have been 
Federal jurisdiction.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  So then why doesn't the 

language read on this case?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, Your Honor, the language 

in -- the language -- the particular language of section 
4 is meant to say, save for such agreement but for the 
doctrine of ouster, setting aside the ouster doctrine 
whether there would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The text says nothing 

about the ouster doctrine.

MR. ORTIZ:  No.  But read in its historical 

context, Your Honor --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Rather than literally.
 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, literally at the time it 

would have been understood to refer -- to refer to that, 
because ouster was the whole problem against which FAA 
itself was first enacted.  FAA --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is a tough --

it's a tough sell.  When you say "save for such 
agreement," which I agree with Justice Stevens seems to 
me you've put the agreement aside and then you say right 
away then you look at the agreement to see if there is 
Federal jurisdiction and only the agreement, not through 
that.  So you're throwing it out and then you bring it 
right back in.  It seems --

MR. ORTIZ:  Not quite, Your Honor.  What --

the rest of that sentence in section 4 instructs the 
court to look at a suit concerning the subject matter in 
controversy, which would be a suit seeking specific 
performance of the arbitration.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of the arbitration 

agreement?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Yes, sir.  So you are -- what 
the court is instructed to do under the "save for such 
agreement" clause is to ignore the historical problem of

ouster and then to see whether in a suit brought to 
specifically enforce the arbitration agreement, there 
would be Federal subject matter jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  And I guess 
it's -- I mean, you say if it said save for the historic 
doctrine of ouster, then it would be easy to say, and 
then you look at the arbitration agreement.  But it says 
"save for such agreement" and then you look at the 
agreement.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, you're not quite looking 

at the agreement.  And this makes clear, I believe, that 
ouster was the problem being referred to in those four 
words in section 4.  It says a suit arising out of a 
controversy.  It's instructing the Federal courts to 
determine Federal subject matter jurisdiction for a 
section 4 proceeding, which was completely novel at the 
time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You just -- you just used 

the words "arising out of the controversy."  "The 
controversy" is used in several sections of the 
Arbitration Act, and "the controversy" in other contexts 
means the underlying dispute between the parties.  "The 
controversy" is not over the enforcement of the 
arbitration agreement.

Ginsburg, it's a little bit more complicated than that. 
The Federal Arbitration Act uses the word "controversy" 
four times, twice in section 2, once in section 4 and 
once in section 5.

 In section 2, the word "controversy" is 

embedded in a larger phrase:  "Controversy arising out 
of such contractor transaction."  It is that context for 
the word "controversy" that makes clear that in section 
2, both instances in section 2, it is referring to the 
dispute which is sought to be arbitrated.

 In section 5, by contrast, the simple word 

which appears the middle of 4A of the Petitioner's 
brief, either -- section 5, which deals with the 
appointment of arbitrators or umpires, it says "either 
party to the controversy", it's clear in the section 5 
context that the word "controversy" by itself refers to 
the controversy over arbitration, not to the underlying 
dispute.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  In Moses H. Cone, didn't the 

court say that the controversy was the underlying 
dispute?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, that -- this Court, 
in that footnote 32 of Moses H. Cone, mentioned language 
that refers to the underlying dispute.  In the context 
of both the sentence, the footnote itself, and the

overall case, it is clear that the Court could not have 
meant that.

 That phrase is followed immediately by a 

semicolon and then the word "hence."  And after the word 
"hence" in that same sentence in the same footnote, this 
Court says, "Hence an independent basis for jurisdiction 
needs to exist," which in context makes it clear that 
it's not referring to look through.

 Also that sentence cites a Fifth Circuit 

case, Commercial Metals Company, and the other -- points 
to the other cases in it.  They basically show that an 
independent -- stand for the proposition that an 
independent basis of jurisdiction exists, not that there 
is look through.  And, in fact, one of them dealing with 
Federal-question jurisdiction says that the Federal 
issue has to appear on the face of the complaint.

 The rest of footnote 32, Your Honor, is all 
directed towards -- towards the jurisdictional inertness 
of the FAA overall.  And the case of Moses H. Cone, 
itself, if look through had been rigorously adopted 
there, it would have defeated subject-matter 
jurisdiction because there would not have been complete 
diversity among the parties.

diversity and the amount in question?  In other words, 
not in the Federal-question context, but if it's 
diversity, you say we do look through the arbitration 
agreement.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, that seems a 

somewhat different sense of look through; but, to the 
extent that ordinary, background 1331 or 1332 principles 
authorize such look through, that is appropriate in 
arbitration cases as much as it is appropriate outside 
of arbitration cases.

 It is Petitioner's contention that section 4 

      

If under 

has no independent look-through force.  To the extent 
that look through is appropriate, it is because it is 
appropriate under section 1332, itself. 
Respondents' view section 4 operates independently to 
authorize look through, then it would presumably 
override 1332's normal principle that you do not look 
through in determining complete diversity.  And it would 
have the overall effect of paradoxically reducing the 
number of petitions to compel on the diversity side that 
could be brought in Federal court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Say that again.  I didn't 

follow that.

 MR. ORTIZ:  The -- the point is a simple 

one, but it's sometimes hard to express.  If you -- if 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

this Court says that section 4 operates independently to 
authorize look through in section 1331 and section 1332, 
the courts, district courts, will be in the position of 
looking through section 1332 petitions to determine 
whether the parties are completely diverse.

 It will not be basing the complete diversity 

determination on the parties before it in the 
arbitration -- in the petition to compel, itself, but it 
will be looking through to the underlying dispute.

 Now, in Moses H. Cone, if the Court had done 

that, it would have picked up the architect who was 
dropped from the actual -- between the actual underlying 
lawsuit and the petition to compel arbitration, and 
completeness of diversity would have been defeated 
there.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is that point argued in 

Moses -- Moses Cone?  Was that point argued in that 
case?

 MR. ORTIZ:  I do -- I do not know, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why wouldn't 1332 

require complete diversity and require the court to 
assure itself of that anyway?

 MR. ORTIZ:  No, Your Honor.  The question --

1332 does not authorize look through for purposes of

determining completeness of diversity, so if section 4 
independently authorizes --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought you said it did 
have a look through, an automatic look through, itself.
 MR. ORTIZ:  Not under the completeness of 
diversity, Your Honor.  To the extent it has anything 
equivalent to look through, it's on the amount-in-
controversy side of Section 1332.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.  I see.  You are --

you are -- you are limiting it to the amount.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Yes.  So, under Respondents' 

view, there would be -- section 4 would authorize a look 
through one part of section 1332 and not with respect to 
another part of section 1332 under --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I am not -- I mean just --
I have to be sure I follow.  Why couldn't it require the 
same look through in a diversity case as it does in a 
Federal-question case?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Because, Your Honor, if this 

Court authorizes look through in Federal-question cases 
through the arbitration agreement, itself, to the 
underlying dispute, then if that look -- and that look 
through comes -- authorization comes from Section 4 --

Court would be looking through not only for 
amount-in-controversy purposes --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Complete diversity.
 MR. ORTIZ:  -- but also for complete 

diversity.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  What's wrong with that?
 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, that would have the 

effect, Your Honor, of not allowing the petitioner to 
define the contours of the lawsuit and would actually 
reduce the number of section 1332 petitions that could 
be brought in Federal court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Maybe it would.  So what?
 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, Your Honor, if that is --

that is an implication that is -- is lurking in 
Respondents' position, and it is also -- in a case like 
this it is a little bit worrying as to why ordinary 
section 1332 principles should not apply.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There is a dispute between 

people.  You look at their underlying dispute, the 
underlying one, and you say:  Is there diversity? 
What's the problem?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, Your Honor, that's not 

actually the way you use Federal -- lower Federal court 
now.

just what I said, just what we started with?  You take 
out the arbitration agreement, and then you look to see 
what this dispute is about.  And if it's about something 
that happens to involve all people from one side in one 
State and from another State on the other side, there is 
jurisdiction.  Why is that a problem?  I don't 
understand.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, it -- it removes the 

Petitioner's ability or the plaintiff's ability or the 
-- similar to the plaintiff's ability in an ordinary 
lawsuit to define --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?
 MR. ORTIZ:  -- the parties.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?
 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, because, Your Honor, 

someone could not bring a section 4 petition in Federal 
court against maybe one party seeking to force that 
party into arbitration if there are other parties 
involved in the underlying dispute where there is no 
diversity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  So you define 

"look through" as -- under our hypothetical here as 
looking through to all people who might potentially be 
parties under this arbitration agreement.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, that would be the

implication of taking the kind of look-through theory 
that Respondents are arguing for in this case and 
applying it evenhandedly.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I will think about that. 

I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't -- it wasn't clear to me that 
that was so.

 MR. ORTIZ:  But, Your Honor, there are also 
several jurisdictional gaps in the act that are created 
under Respondents' view.  The critical --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I hold up just a 

second to make sure I understand it.  You are saying 
that, let's say, Person A has an arbitration agreement 
that implicates Persons B and C.  C is diverse, but B is 
not.  They could decide to compel arbitration with 
respect to B and leave C out of it.  But if you follow 
the look-through doctrine, you would say, well, the 
dispute is between A and B and C; and so you would be 
depriving A of their right to frame their own complaint 
in a way that doesn't create Federal jurisdiction.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Exactly, Your Honor, and that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's not quite so, 
because the -- the action could proceed with just A and 
C, and then it -- it could come to a complete judgment 
as to them.  In the look through for the -- the claims 
that are involved, the action couldn't possibly proceed

without taking account of the pre-emption claim that the 
Federal -- the Federal claim.

 You couldn't -- you could decide the case 

completely in No. 1, the diversity case, but not in No. 
2.  So there -- so there is a difference.  It's true, 
you don't decide it completely as to all parties.

 MR. ORTIZ:  When the -- no, Your Honor. 

But there -- there could under your situation be large 
parts of the underlying dispute that are not covered 
under -- and still left to be decided.  It is, you know, 
not the case that necessarily everything would be 
subject to arbitration.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course, I suppose 

how that works depends on what the rules are about how 
you frame the dispute once you do look through.

 I mean, if there is a pending State suit 
between A and B, even though C may -- you could have 
sued C as well, I mean the judge can say, well, I am 
only going to look through to what the -- the actual 
litigation is; and if I look at that, that's not a 
Federal case.  And -- and -- and so your position 
follows.

 MR. ORTIZ:  This Court could; and, 

interestingly, that wasn't the situation in Moses H. 
Cone, itself.  There, there was a preexisting lawsuit,

and this Court did not look through.  The court found 
that there was no problem with the architect being 
absent from the petition to compel arbitration, itself.

 Well, Your Honors, there is also, as I 

mentioned, strange jurisdictional gaps that are created 
under Respondents' view of this case.  Section 4 is the 
only section of the arbitration -- in the Federal 
Arbitration Act that has the critical "save for such" 
language, which under Respondents' view authorizes 
look-through jurisdiction, in particular, Sections 7, 9, 
10, and 11, which allow a court, a Federal court, to 
compel the attendance of witnesses at ab arbitration. 
That is Section 7; and then 9, 10, and 11, which 
respectively allow a Federal court to confirm, vacate, 
or modify an arbitration once it has happened.

 None of those sections contain language 

which under Respondents' view or the Fourth Circuit's 
view are necessary for there to be look through.

 In all those cases -- situations, Your 

Honor, the Federal courts would be in the position of 
being able to compel arbitration under section 4 but not 
being able to compel the attendance of witnesses at the 
arbitration or to subsequently confirm, vacate, or 
modify an award coming from an arbitration that they, 
themselves, compelled.

Coming from an arbitration that they 

themselves compelled.  The closest Respondent comes to 
sort of explaining this or trying to jump or leap over 
this gap, are two amici, two law professors, who argue 
that this Court should find jurisdiction, subject matter 
jurisdiction under sections 7, 9, 10 and 11 as an 
emanation from sections 3 and 4, only one of which 
actually has the necessary "save for" language.

 Also, Your Honors, this look-through 

approach to Federal subject matter jurisdiction violates 
the core purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act.  The 
Federal Arbitration Act was meant to get things to 
arbitration quickly and to have arbitrators, not judges, 
decide them.  These --
jurisdictional inquiries undermine both those aims.

sometimes often complex 

 Here this case has been pending in Federal 
court just at the jurisdictional stage for many years 
now.  In the Strong case which is now en banc before the 
Fifth Circuit -- I'm sorry, the Eleventh Circuit --
Justice -- Judge -- excuse me, Judge Marcus wrote a 
32-page opinion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, and what really 
leapt off the page at me in that opinion, he gets to the 
end, I think he basically presents your position and 
then he says:  Thus, on my reading the relevant portion

of section 4 could be rewritten this way.

 Well, I mean that to me is a confession of 
error if you have to rewrite the statute to get to your 
position.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, Your Honor, he didn't say 
it had to be rewritten.  He said if you wanted to make 
it even clearer what was originally intended under 
section 4 that is how you would do it.  That's a far cry 
from saying that you need to do violence to the statute. 
Here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, his rewriting 

doesn't look very much like section 4 to me.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, if his rewriting, 
given the disappearance of the ouster doctrine -- he's 
trying to make it clear to present context what was 
originally understood at the time the Congress 
originally enacted the FAA.  There is no memory, 
historical memory or otherwise, of the ouster doctrine, 
no realization how it actually played out; and against 
that absence of knowledge, Judge Marcus is trying to 
educate his readers and the lower courts as to how 
things need to be done.

 But certainly the language as originally 
understood would have -- that save-for language would 
have been all about, which it is clear from the time was

thought by Congress to be the major obstacle to 
arbitration.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the fact that 

that was not included in the New Jersey statute, nor was 
it included in -- was it included in the Uniform 
Arbitration Act?

 MR. ORTIZ:  No, Your Honor.  Now --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What's the explanation for 

that?

 MR. ORTIZ:  The explanation, Your Honor, is 

that in New York law and equity have been merged.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I know.  And you're saying 

New Jersey; it was, you know, a very complicated 
argument about the status of it.  What about the Uniform 
Arbitration Act?

 MR. ORTIZ:  By the later times it appeared 
that it was closer, coming -- the law and equity across 
many jurisdictions was coming closer, but at the time in 
the Federal court system at least, if only because of 
Justice Story's hostility towards jurisdiction, finding 
jurisdiction in the Tobey case to build equity seeking 
specific performance kinds of things, that language is 
necessarily clear.

 Your Honors, if there are no further 

questions I would like to reserve my time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Phillips.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 It seems to me that if the argument that 
just ended doesn't prove anything, it suggests that 
perhaps the Court ought to follow the simple expedient 
of read the statute as it's written, apply it as written 
and come to what strikes me, at least, as a reasonably 
easy resolution of this particular case.

 The statute says that a party aggrieved by 

the alleged failure to arbitrate -- and we have that 
precisely in this case because the other side has filed 
a lawsuit against our indemnitee arising out of an 
underlying dispute -- may petition any United States 
district court which, save for such an agreement -- it's 
pretty clear that everybody agrees that in this context 
you just simply put the agreement aside -- and then you 
say would have jurisdiction under Title 28 in a civil 
action of the subject matter of the suit arising out of 
the controversy between the parties.

 It seems to me reasonably clear to interpret

that language as saying you look to the underlying 
dispute between the parties.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's the question 

that I have, Mr. Phillips.  What is the underlying 
dispute between the parties?

 It seems to me that your look-through 

argument is look-through only halfway.  That is, if you 
look -- if you consider the controversy, the suit that 
was brought in the State court, the controversy is here 
we have a customer who hasn't paid the amount charged. 
So we have a suit on a debt.  Why isn't that the 
controversy?  You have to make the counterclaim the 
controversy, which comes up only defensively.  It wasn't 
brought as a lawsuit.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice Ginsburg, the 

language of section 4 actually talks about the subject 
matter of a suit arising out of, not the existence of a 
suit; and section 4 doesn't require that a lawsuit have 
been filed.  So it's not appropriate simply to say to 
yourself look at what litigation actually exists, 
because in as many cases as not there is not going to be 
any litigation ongoing.  So the court has to make the 
hypothetical:  would the court have had jurisdiction 
over the subject matter of this dispute?  And the 
dispute in this case, which Professor Ortiz was very

explicit about -- he said specifically that if he had 
brought this as an affirmative lawsuit it would have 
arisen under Federal law.

 It seems to me that's as clear a concession 
that the nature of this dispute is a question of Federal 
law.  And therefore --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Who gets to frame --
who gets to frame the complaint?  Normally if you're a 
party and you have a dispute that may implicate Federal 
law, you have control over the complaint.  You don't 
have to have a -- you don't have to well plead it in a 
way that implicates a Federal question.  You can go out 
of your way to do it in a way that does not implicate a 
Federal question; and therefore it would not be, you 
could not bring it in Federal court.

 Just as in the diversity example, you can 

specifically avoid suing people who would create 
diversity.  But in your position the judge has to in his 
mind write a complaint and see whether there is 
jurisdiction or not; and how does the judge decide 
whether to sue diverse parties or not to sue diverse 
parties?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I think what the judge has to 
do is to take -- is to give the plaintiff in the section 
4 complaint the benefit of his allegations.  And we have

made an allegation here that the subject matter of this 
dispute arises under Federal law, and we did that not 
just based on our own assessment of the situation in the 
abstract, but we did that on the basis that she had 
filed a very specific claim against us asserting that we 
had violated essentially section 20.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but she chose to 
assert it only defensively; and it's not a complaint --
the counterclaim if it had been brought as an 
independent action, everybody agrees qualifies for 
Federal jurisdiction.  But the litigant who has this 
claim is asserting it only as a defense to a claim that 
you admit does not qualify for Federal jurisdiction.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  But Justice Ginsburg, I think 
the difference is that we are not seeking to remove her 
original lawsuit.  That's not -- if that were the case, 
then I think the argument you're making is a legitimate 
one.  All we are seeking to do is to assert our 
independent section 4 rights and that's not at all 
dependent on the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in the practical 

effect, what happens?  Now you have asserted that you 
can enforce because of the counterclaim that asserts --
that arises under Federal law.  But you say it's is not 
the same as removal because the underlying claim, your

suit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State 
court; but what happens to that claim once you have this 
arbitration?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there are a couple 

possibilities.  I mean, first of all, the arbitration 
agreement is quite explicit in saying that if, if you --
if this starts off as litigation and then a subsequent 
claim is made by either of the parties, the parties have 
the right to enforce the arbitration as to that 
particular claim.  So that's specifically what we did in 
this particular case.

 So in theory, at least the collection action 
would remain in State court as a State cause of action, 
although it would certainly be available to the 
Petitioner in this case to say, well, no, if you're 
going to arbitrate that portion of the case then I'm 
content to arbitrate the rest of the case as well.  So 
they could do it that way or we could arbitrate the 
Federal law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Phillips --
MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry?
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Clear up one thing for me. 

Is it correct, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, that the 
counterclaim was purely defensive?  Didn't it ask for 
additional relief?  The counterclaim, wasn't it a class

action?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, right.  Yeah -- no --

exactly.  That's absolutely true.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  So it was not merely an 

defense to the action, the State court action.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I meant -- I didn't mean 

to say you couldn't get affirmative relief on a 
counterclaim.  Of course you could.  But this --

MR. PHILLIPS:  But I couldn't -- I couldn't 

remove it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Chose not to --
MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that was the point 

she was trying to make.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- chose not to litigate 
the case, chose to -- well, I'm being sued, so I'm going 
to bring up this claim.  It wasn't as an original 
matter.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  I -- I understand 

that, Justice Ginsburg, but the -- the -- but the point 
I am trying to make here is that the language of section 
4 just talks about the subject matter of the controversy 
between the parties.  It doesn't specifically talk about 
an existing lawsuit, and frankly it doesn't envision the 
existence of a specific lawsuit.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The controversy between 
the parties is the credit card company says, customer, 
you're in default $10,000; and the customer said, if 
that's so, then I have certain offsets because they 
charged me too much interest.  How do you --
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, in that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- how do you -- it's all 

part of the same controversy, isn't it?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  But -- no -- well, I mean you 

could -- you can certainly view it as part of the same 
controversy, but the -- but the bottom line is, the 
question is:  Would a Federal court have jurisdiction 
over the dispute that arises under Federal law between 
the Petitioner and the Respondents?  And the answer is 
clearly yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the dispute?  You 
say the dispute is not defined by what -- what has been 
brought in a complaint.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  It's defined by our complaint 

in section 4.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you -- from your 

argument, I would gather that a court would be able to 
imagine a counterclaim.  Once it finds out, you know, 
what -- what -- what the principal complaint is about, 
the court could imagine that there would be a

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I'm not sure -- I'm not 

even sure --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's very strange to decide 

Federal jurisdiction on the basis of -- of imagined --
imagined complaints.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I -- I mean the problem 

with that -- I mean the difficulty arises, Justice 
Scalia, because the language of the statute does say 
that the court has to determine whether it would have 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy. 
And then that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the problem with his --

I mean with his interpretation, you don't have to 
imagine anything.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, with his 

interpretation, you have to imagine everything.  In 
point of fact, you have to imagine that this had 
something to do with ouster when it doesn't use the word 
"ouster."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --
MR. PHILLIPS:  It has to do with equity and 
law when it uses "equity" and "law" in other contexts.

complaints.  You -- you don't have to invent litigation.
 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, no.  That's true, but 

what it -- but -- but the flip side of that is that this 
is a section, a fundamental provision, of the Federal 
Arbitration Act that apparently was designed to provide 
a basis of Federal jurisdiction for the Gila Indian 
Tribe claims.  It seems inconceivable to me that 
Congress had that narrow an interpretation of section 4 
in mind when it passed this particular law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's close to inconceivable 

to me that Congress wanted us to -- to construct 
litigation that is not yet in existence.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  But I think all of this 

really is talking -- I mean this is not significantly 
different --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- answer that the 

litigation does exist.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but your position is it 

doesn't have to exist.  Had that litigation not been 
brought, had the motion to arbitrate been brought before 
a lawsuit was filed, that the court would still have to 
consider what is the dispute between the parties and 
what kind of complaints could that dispute have 
generated.

MR. PHILLIPS:  And it may well be, Justice 

Scalia, that in that context the answer is that the 
court will say that the claim is unripe; that we don't 
know for sure whether or not this is going to congeal 
into a real dispute between the parties.  And if that's 
the case, obviously, then the court does not have to go 
forward.  But you don't have to worry about that in the 
context of this particular litigation because that 
dispute has congealed.  The parties are at loggerheads 
over the particular issue in this case.  And -- I'm 
sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There would be nothing 

inappropriate about a State court entertaining that 
excessive interest claim, but applying Federal law to 
it.  I mean the -- 1831(d) says that Federal law governs 
the interest --

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Not state usury law.  So 

you could have this case going on in State court.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the State court would 

be perfectly competent to apply the Federal law.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Although, you know, 

that's to the -- obviously, that sets aside the

aside?  This is the thing I guess I don't understand 
about the case, and that is what is really driving your 
side, given the difficulties that I share with the 
Justices on my right and left here.  And the -- the 
tacit assumption seems to be that you in fact are going 
to get shortchanged on your arbitration right if you 
have to bring your arbitration claim in a State court. 
And I don't see that.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, first of all, section 4 

doesn't apply in --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I know section 4 doesn't, 

but section 2 does.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  To be sure, section 2 does, 

but whether or not --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  You can -- based on the 

Federal act, you can in State court claim your right to 
enforce the arbitration agreement.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but the flip side of 

that is --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why don't you do it in the 

State court instead of going through these gymnastics?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Because we have serious 

doubts as to whether or not in fact we will have our 
Federal rights protected as zealously as we would in a

Federal court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Speaking of gymnastics, 
can I ask you if you had foreseen this problem, could 
you have brought a declaratory judgment action to 
establish that your Federal claim --

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- controls this dispute 

and could you have then said that you wanted this 
arbitrated?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.  I 

believe we could have done both of those.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why didn't you do that? 

Why are we here?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, because we brought the 

action under section 4, which I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, could you still do 

that after this case?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Assuming there's no statute 
of limitations issue, and I don't know that there would 
be, but that would available.  But it still seems to me 
that the bottom-line question is:  Are you entitled to 
bring an action under section 4?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So your theory -- I mean 

basically I think you concede that the other side has a 
point in sometimes it will be difficult to say what the

dispute is precisely and, therefore, difficult to know 
if precisely this dispute does or does not -- one that 
you can get into Federal court on.  For example, it 
hasn't even arisen.  You know, there is no lawsuit.  And 
I guess what would happen, what the judge should say is 
they should say to you you'd like to have this in 
Federal court, wouldn't you, this dispute?  What's it 
about?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And once he says what's it 
about, both sides will say, well, basically it started 
off -- it's just about collecting some money from 
in-state parties.  So that's not Federal.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So that, you know, 

something could happen here.  It could happen that they 
could decide they want to sue in a big class action and 
get huge amounts of money under usury laws of the State 
which don't exist, so they have to proceed under an FDIC 
reg, and then it could be Federal.  And the judge might 
say to you:  "What?  You're just imagining."  And that 
would be up to the judge.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, and the judge would 

have the discretion to decide --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's a kind of a defense.

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But you'd say then it might 

be the case that it wouldn't be so hard to decide.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  There could be a 

letter that says, look, what you're doing here violates 
Federal law, and if you don't stop it, we are going to 
take action against you.  And then we have to sit there 
and wait.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  A real suit.  And --
MR. PHILLIPS:  But they are here.  They are 

here.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And in a real suit, there 
is a class action brought not just on behalf of the one 
you're trying to sue but on behalf of everybody, where 
they have to proceed under a Federal reg, and they are 
going to get a huge amount of money, and you say that's 
what we want arbitrated.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  And that's precisely what 

we've asked for here, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So this one is not so hard 

to figure out.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  There might be some that 

are.

question about that, and it's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's hard to 

figure out, you have, let's say, a franchisee, and you 
have a dispute with the franchisor.  And the franchisee 
says it's an antitrust violation, and I'm going to sue 
you under the California antitrust law, and he does. 
And the Federal court says, we've looked through and 
says, well, you could have sued under the Federal 
antitrust law.  And you --
yes, I could have; I 
deliberately didn't.  And then they say, well, this is 
something that could have been brought in Federal court. 
And that really deprives a plaintiff of his right to 
frame his complaint as he sees fit.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  And I understand that, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  And in the right case, you know, I'm 
not sure how I would come out in that particular --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, in his case, in the 
Chief Justice's case, wouldn't you say they don't get 
into court, probably don't because they are bringing 
this under a State law?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  You see, I would comply with 

the original complaint.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  But you just 

say, is the dispute one that could have been brought in 
Federal court?

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Well, that's exactly 

what the Eleventh Circuit held.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's a violation of 

the Sherman Act.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course, it could 

be brought in Federal court.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well -- and in the right 

case, the Federal -- you know, if I had to go that far, 
I might well make that argument, Mr. Chief Justice, but 
in this case I don't have to go that far.  And I think 
all the Court needs to resolve is in a situation where 
the parties have a very concrete dispute between them, 
one that arises exclusively under Federal law, and a 
party seeks to have that claim arbitrated under section 
4 pursuant to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That claim doesn't --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me get one fact.
 MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is the State court suit 

still pending?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, the State court suit is 

pending.

MR. PHILLIPS:  The State court has stayed 

its hand pending the outcome of the Federal litigation. 
So we'll see what happens.  But, obviously, as I say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there could be 

nothing left for the State court to do after you have 
the arbitration.  I mean, not that you arbitrate about 
interest due on a nonexistent debt.  I mean, you have to 
have the two things together.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, in some ways, 
as I say, it seems to me that's Petitioner's right or 
potentially -- or ours.  I suppose either side could ask 
to have that arbitrated, but the truth is if you took --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I just can't envision a 

case where what you haven't effected is taking a case, a 
debt, simple debt, no diversity a State court case.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you remove the State 
court from the picture and gotten it over into Federal 
court to order the arbitration and any follow-up to the 
arbitration.  It just seems to me you have effected --
accomplished what you could not have accomplished by the 
-- by removal, which you admit that you can't remove on 
the basis of a counterclaim.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  But see, Justice Ginsburg, I 

think that's not right.  I think that actually what

happens is you eliminate what I perceive to be the 
Federal question in this through the arbitral process.
 You still have the underlying collection 

action.  If the Court says, no, there is no violation of 
the usury laws, you have not overcharged, you have not 
made any mistakes, the question we still have is a claim 
on the debt and her obligation to pay it.

 Now, whether she wants to adjudicate that in 

State court or resolve it as part of the arbitral 
process, that's really up to her as far as how that 
goes.  But the arbitration agreement could not be 
plainer in saying that you can divide up the claims for 
purposes of seeking arbitration, and that seems to fit 
perfectly well with an effort to say that there is a 
specific claim here that arises exclusively under 
Federal law, and that, therefore, we can enforce our 
arbitration rights pursuant to that section 4 right.

 And that's, frankly, all we are trying to 

accomplish here, Justice Ginsburg.

 The second part of the statute which is 

the -- you know, the one that has obviously created the 
greatest amount of controversy here, is, you know, 
"would have jurisdiction over the subject matter." 
Again, it seems to me that this is the easiest case the 
Court is going to face in this area, because here is one

where there is no question --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what worries me. 

That's what worries me.
 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If we accept your theory, 

this is the easiest case, what about the hard cases that 
are further down the line?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think what's going to 
happen -- I candidly don't think they are going to come 
up that much, in part because these issues have been 
around a long time.  You know, it's not like there have 
been dozens of these kinds of issues arising over time. 
I don't think it's likely to be that big a problem.
 But again, it seems to me that district 

courts have the authority to resolve this, because if 
they don't believe that there really is a Federal claim 
that would justify exercise of section 4, they can say 
that.  If they do, then they will -- then they will send 
it.

 I mean, look -- the other thing about this 

is, you know, the other side makes a big fuss about 
federalism, but we are not asking to take the issues 
away from the Federal court -- from the State courts to 
the Federal courts.  What we are asking for is what 
everybody has agreed to here, which is to have these

disputes resolved by arbitration.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you could have asked 

for that in the State court as well, and --

MR. PHILLIPS:  There is no question about 
that, Justice Ginsburg.  The problem is that there is 
some lack of confidence in the State courts that we will 
get the same treatment under section 4 that we would get 
in Federal court.  And Congress created that right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then bring that up here on 

appeal from the State court.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I wish it were that 
easy to get this Court to grant review of everything 
that I bring up here in the first place.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  You don't have any 

trouble.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. PHILLIPS:  I appreciate that.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's not really -- of 

getting constants from Federal judges; the arbitrators 
can decide this question.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  The arbitrator might 

decide there is no preemption.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But the -- and that's 

fine and we have to live with that.  And obviously,

since we can't change the standards of review on the 
back end under sections 9, 10 and 11, we are going to be 
pretty much stuck with that -- with that determination. 
But the truth is the bigger risk is that the trial 
judge, the State court will not send it to arbitration.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this, I haven't 

reread the Moses Cone case, but is your adversary 
correct in saying that there would have been no 
jurisdiction in that case it we followed your view?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Because the arbitrator was 

not of diverse citizenship from the other parties?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I mean, It wasn't litigated. 
It's not clear on the face of the opinion.  So if there 
is something he knows that I don't know, maybe.  But 
I -- I -- certainly nothing in there that reflects 
that -- that view of the world.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But -- if, in fact, were a 

nondiverse party in the Moses Cohen, there should have 
been no jurisdiction?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, now, the nondiverse 

party issue, it depends on how you read section 4.  You 
know, section 4 talks about the parties.  And the 
parties there I don't think means parties to the 
underlying controversy.  I think there parties refers

specifically to the dispute in front of the court.

 So I don't think the pass-through problem 

for 1332 applies in that particular context for complete 
diversity.

 I don't think Congress envisioned you would 
look beyond the immediate dispute under section 4 to see 
whether there are additional parties, except to the 
extent, obviously, that you would have necessary and 
indispensable party litigation that might bring them in.

 I think the assumption is you take the 
complaint as it's written, and then you look to see 
whether or not there is amount of controversy.  For that 
you have to go beyond because the dispute with respect 
to arbitration is not going to get you anywhere near 
that number.  And you have to look beyond for Federal 
questions to see whether or not there is a Federal issue 
there to be enforced.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is this right?  I'm asking 
if it may sound favorable to you, then I'll get a good 
response in rebuttal.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm not going to give a good 

response?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If you read it the other 

way -- if you read it the other way, the way the 
Petitioners want to read it, then is this so or not?

That then you look to see if there is Federal 
jurisdiction of the arbitration agreement; is that 
right?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Under their interpretation?
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, under their 

interpretation.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So, what you could have is 
you could have two parties sign an arbitration agreement 
that lasts for a year that governs all disputes between 
them, and one is from Vermont; the other from 
California.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So there is jurisdiction. 

And all the disputes happen to involve just pure matters 
of -- that never could come into Federal court.  I mean 
there are such matters you could argue about.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Sure.  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But nevertheless, we have a 

Federal court issuing this injunction, under their 
theory.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Assuming the amount 

of --

controversy -- I mean, it could have an amount --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, I see.  The arbitration 

agreement has to meet the amount in controversy.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  It has to have an 

independent basis for Federal jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So then 

probably no arbitration agreement in itself meets the 
amount.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that's exactly our 

point.  That's why you have to look through.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So if you didn't look 

through, then this would apply to nothing?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Pretty much that's our view 

of the case.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If the arbitration --
MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  I'm sure my opponent 

will say something different than that.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The arbitration agreement 

has to -- they talk about the arbitration agreement, 
then you could have really important Federal questions 
in substantive issues --

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.

because the arbitration agreement doesn't?  Or you could 
have State questions that would suddenly come in because

the arbitration agreement does.  The arbitration -- but 
now you're saying, well, that second case is never going 
to arise.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Probably not.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Probably not, because no 

arbitration agreement has -- so then it becomes a 
nullity of the statute?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Except to overcome the 

ouster.  Okay.  We've got your side of it.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it makes a nullity of 

it, except that it gets into the Federal court the 
decision on the arbitration agreement, which was the 
object of this stuff, whatever -- whatever the 
underlying claim is, whether it's a Federal claim or 
not.

 As I understood the purpose of the 

Arbitration Act, it was to make sure that arbitration 
was -- was honored not just in Federal cases but in 
State cases as well.  And it's entirely compatible with 
that, that sometimes a Federal court will -- will direct 
arbitration in a case this involves an underlying 
controversy that's purely non-Federal.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh absolutely.  I mean, you

know, in a situation -- it depends on how you interpret 
it.  If you interpret it the way that the Petitioner 
does in saying that you can't have any look through --
now he softens that and says, well, no, you can have 
look through for diversity.

 But if you accept the idea that section 4 
only makes you look at the dispute at the arbitration 
level, then the reality is you're going to have no cases 
that are going to be covered, because you're never going 
to satisfy the amount in controversy.

 And then the issue is why do you get to look 

through for diversity purposes and never get to look 
through for Federal question purposes?  And it -- it 
seems to me the much easier way to reconcile the 
language of the statute is to say, of course, you look 
through to see, particularly if you have an unquestioned 
Federal question dispute that's being litigated between 
the parties; we know that; there is not an issue before 
us.  In fact, he has conceded as much even here in court 
today.

 And so, it seems to me that's the solution 

to this case.  Now admittedly, there will be other cases 
where you may have right in these questions, and there 
will be other cases where the parties will have to fight 
at the Federal district court level as to precisely

what's at issue and what the plaintiff really means to 
be fighting over.  And it may be in some instances you 
won't get an order that directs arbitration.  But that's 
not this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why isn't it proper to 
look to see -- the party who wants arbitration has a 
dispute; the dispute is we are owed money by the debtor. 
Why shouldn't the court say, well, we'll see what your 
case is about; if your case would qualify for Federal 
jurisdiction, fine.  But we are not going to look to see 
what the defendants cases is or might be.  We'll just 
look at your case and that's how we will define the 
controversy.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there are two problems 

with that.  First of all, the statute talks about the 
subject matter of the controversy.  It doesn't talk 
about the specific controversy.

 And second of all, the statute clearly 

envisions that there are going to be situations where 
there is no complaint, there is no underlying State 
court cause of action, and it still envisions in that 
situation that a district court is going to have to 
determine whether or not it would have jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then you'll have not 

only a hypothetical claim, because nothing has been

brought, but an hypothetical answer by way of 
counterclaim to that claim.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  But it seems to me that's 
precisely what the language "would have jurisdiction 
over the subject matter of the controversy" asks this 
Court to make a determination of.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you would come into 
the court and say there is no suit going on anywhere, 
but if we were to bring this suit in State court, the 
defendant could have brought this Federal counterclaim? 
That's a lot of hypothesis.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  But it seems to me, Justice 
Ginsburg, the better way to think about this is what if 
we were getting letters from the Petitioner saying you 
are engaged in usurious conduct, you're outrageous, you 
got to stop what you're doing, we are going to bring a 
class action against you, you had better change your 
behavior tomorrow, and they don't sue us, and they don't 
sue us, and they don't sue us?

 And then the question is are we entitled to 
go to court to get that resolved and are we entitled to 
have the resolution to that issue as a matter of 
arbitration?

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Phillips, the answer 
to a better hypothetical is what if there had been no

original collection action but they had brought such an 
action.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Well, that's --

actually, you're right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's the case you're 
really saying.  You're saying that is like this case.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  That is this case.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And Justice Ginsburg is 

suggesting it's not, because it happens to arise out of 
a different -- quite different dispute.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  I thought your 

question absolutely nailed it because you said, would 
this -- you know, if you brought that suit could you and 
would you, and the answer is yes, you could, and 
therefore you know as -- without any question that it's 
a Federal suit.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Excuse me --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  As I understand your 

opponent, they would agree there was no jurisdiction 
even in that case.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  I think that's no 

doubt that that's their position.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do with the 

assertion that sections 9 through 11 are not in sync 
with your view, because they would not give you -- you

could go in and -- to compel arbitration but once the 
arbitration was award -- an award was made, you would 
not have access to the Federal courts to enforce the 
award?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean the interesting 
thing about 9, 10 and 11 is if anything the language is 
broader than our language.  If we didn't have the "save 
for" and "would have jurisdiction under," this would 
clearly be an action that arises under Federal law, 
because the question, you know, section 4 says have you 
been aggrieved, do you have a right of action, and do 
you have a remedy for that action?

 I mean, without this rigamarole that we've 
been talking about this whole time, we would have -- we 
would easily have a 1331 action.  So if anything you 
would argue that 9, 10 and 11 arise under Federal law 
regardless.  Now if you don't want to go that far, then 
it seems to me you just say you read sections 9, 10 and 
11 and pairing material with the limitation in Section 4 
and you wouldn't read it any broader than that.

 But there is no basis for taking the 
unlimited languages in 9, 10 and 11 and somehow 
distorting that to more narrowly limit the rights that 
we have under Section 4.  So I --

never clearly clarify the particular Federal on which 
the jurisdiction rests on this case.  What --
can you 
clarify that?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  This case arises under 

section 4 through Section 27.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Section 4 creates the 

Federal --

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, it does create it, 

because section 4, without the "would have jurisdiction" 
language clearly would be arising under jurisdiction, in 
my judgment, and the only thing -- and then it places an 
additional requirement on you.

 You can't just use the contract that gets 
you into Federal court.  You have to then look to see 
whether you would have had an underlying cause of action 
or an underlying Federal claim or whether there would 
have been diversity jurisdiction on the underlying 
claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why can't you have 
sort of modified look, through like a modified limited 
hangout or whatever it was?  That is to say, you can 
look through for the purpose of determining whether the 
arbitration agreement raises a Federal question.  But 
that doesn't mean you have to look through to determine 
whether the underlying controversy raises a Federal

question.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Because I think -- I think 

the reference in the statute to controversy clearly 
envisions the underlying dispute between the parties, 
because it's not just the arbitration agreement and it's 
not even just the controversy; it's the subject matter 
of the controversy, and you compare that to section 2 
and it's clear that what the Congress has in mind there 
is the underlying dispute between the parties.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the Petitioner's -- I'm 
sorry I didn't get a chance to ask the Petitioner -- is 
the Petitioner's argument for a limited look through 
compromised in any way by the Beneficial Bank case which 
allows removal if there is a Federal defense?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, I don't know if 

it's compromised by it.  I think it -- the Beneficial 
case makes it absolutely clear that we have here a 
Federal claim and therefore --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's of course in the 

context of a defense, as opposed to a counterclaim.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But again I don't 

think -- I don't think section 4 is asking the courts to 
make that determination.  I think what section 4 is 
asking the Court to look at is the subject matter of the 
controversy, and is it -- is it clear under the

circumstances that there is in fact a Federal claim 
underlying it?  And here there is no question on that. 
I ask you to affirm.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Phillips.  Mr. Ortiz, you have three minutes 
remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ORTIZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Just a 

few quick points.

 I think this Court should be exactly clear 
how much Federal question jurisdiction the look-through 
theory would create.  So long as a Federal issue can be 
imagined anywhere in the lawsuit, there would be Federal 
question jurisdiction under this theory, and this is 
almost by definition going to be the case in any dispute 
concerning credit card debt, either because of the 
theory of complete pre-emption from the FDIA, or because 
of the theory used in the Strong case before the 
Eleventh Circuit that RICO's prohibition on the 
collection of unlawful debt --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What about a Federal 

defense?

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That isn't quite true, 

because here there is a definition in the Federal claim

in your counterclaim.

 MR. ORTIZ:  I'm sorry, Your Honor?
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  There is a definition of 

the controversy in your counterclaim and in their 
response.

 MR. ORTIZ:  No -- there -- in general, if 

you accepted their theory, as long as there is an issue 
that could be spun as a Federal issue which there will 
always be in a credit card debt collection case and 
just -- in most States, that on look-through theory 
would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  You're suggesting that 

every credit card debtor would have a class action?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Your Honor, every -- it does not 
have to be a class action to establish what would serve 
--

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's your view, but I 

mean believe me, I think I can keep that problem under 
control.  That was your original point.  I see the 
point, it's going to spread too far; you'd have to have 
some rules that cabin it.

 Assume I got that under control; maybe I 

don't.  This is a case of "well, his brother was worse." 
What do you want to say about the criticisms of the 
horrible things that happen if we adopt your position?

MR. ORTIZ:  Well, Your Honor, Respondent 

argues that this is an easy case, or at least over time 
the courts will decide these things to make the 
jurisdictional inquiry -- inquiries clear.  Petitioner 
does not believe that is true.

 For example, here the real party in interest 

dispute consumed much of the court's time.  The lower 
courts have gone both ways on this issue.  It's 
incredibly fact-dependent.  There is no easy answer for 
it.

 Also, Your Honor, Petitioner does not 

believe that the Declaratory Judgment Act would have 
been appropriate in this case.  Declaratory judgments 
are discretionary and in this context of where you have 
a pending State court lawsuit Petitioner believes that a 
Federal district court would be very cautious before 
permitting one.

 Also Your Honor, if in the context of 

declaratory judgment action presumably the district 
court would have to take the State court admission into 
account, and in particular here it was admitted that the 
account was with Discover Financial Services not with 
the bank.

 Also, Your Honors, this -- Respondents try 
to portray Petitioner's position as siphoning off all

Federal question jurisdiction.  That is not true.  Under 
Petitioner's view, a lot of Federal question 
jurisdiction -- some would remain.  It would just be 
that the arbitration agreement itself would have to 
sound in Federal law.  ERISA arbitration agreements 
would still be covered.  Some labor agreements would 
still be covered.  There would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, what do 

you mean would still be covered?

 MR. ORTIZ:  Would still be covered under 
Petitioner's theory of what section 4 means.  So for 
example, Mr. Chief Justice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which would still be 

in Federal court.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Would still be in Federal court. 

Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
