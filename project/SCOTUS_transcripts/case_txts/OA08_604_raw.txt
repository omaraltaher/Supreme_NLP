 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-604, Union Pacific Railroad v. 
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen.

 Mr. Ballenger.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BALLENGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Section 3 First (q) of the Railway Labor Act 
says that the findings in an order of the division shall 
be conclusive on the parties, except that the order of 
the division may be set aside for one of three specified 
reasons.  As a matter of plain dictionary meaning in 
this context, "except" means that there are three and 
only three exceptions to the otherwise conclusive nature 
of these awards.

 In the Sheehan case, this Court explains 
that the dispositive question is whether the parties' 
objections falls within one of the three reasons 
specified within the statute.  This Court explained that 
the statutory language means just what it says and that 
a contrary conclusion would ignore the terms, 
purposes --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, the circuit 

court did things in an unusual order.  Instead of 
reaching the statutory question, it reached the 
constitutional question, in par, because it viewed the 
two as intertwined.

 Why isn't its judgment that there's a 

statutory violation what's at issue before us, because 
that's what they said?

 MR. BALLENGER:  Well, Your Honor, it 
certainly would be this Court's prerogative and 
appropriate for this Court to choose to reach the 
statutory ground first, but we think that the 
Respondents have no viable claim under the statute, and 
so then --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why not?
 MR. BALLENGER:  Their only claim under the 
statute is under the second statutory ground of review 
for an award that fails to confine or conform itself to 
the board's jurisdiction.  An arbitrator's 
jurisdiction --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  It's an award that 

is contrary to the act.

 MR. BALLENGER:  But, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the --
MR. BALLENGER:  They -- they have never made

that argument, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I saw it in their 
brief to the Ninth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit analyzed 
the requirements of the act and of circular one and said 
the board's ruling is not based on those.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Your Honor, on -- on page 5 
of their brief to the Seventh Circuit, they waived any 
argument based on that first statutory ground of review. 
There was a first count in their petition for review 
that was based on that statutory ground, and on page 5 
they renounced it.

 The only --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the same argument --
it's the same argument, as if you had an APA case, and 
the words in the APA are "arbitrary, capricious, abuse 
of discretion," so somebody who has an unfair procedure 
says it violates those words.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Well, if --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And I don't really see that 
it's any different, except we normally go to those words 
before we would decide a due process question.  It's the 
similar kind of question.  Why wouldn't we do the same 
thing here?

 MR. BALLENGER:  Your Honor, I think that 

there is an important difference.  The first ground of

review under the act provides review for violations of 
the plain terms of the RLA itself.  The second ground is 
for an act in excess of jurisdiction, which the lower 
courts have correctly understood to be a reference to 
this Court's Steelworker trilogy standard of review for 
labor arbitration generally.  An arbitrator's 
jurisdiction is to interpret and to apply the parties' 
agreement and the relevant arbitral rules.  An 
arbitrator exceeds his jurisdiction if but only if, 
under this Court's well-settled case law, his decision 
isn't even arguably construing or applying the relevant 
principles, and this decision clearly satisfies that 
standard, Your Honor.

 I would urge the Court to look at the 
board's decision in this case, and one of the five 
appears at pages 65 -- 65a to 72a of the petition 
appendix.  The relevant reasoning starts on 68a to 71a. 
The award contain five pages of careful reasoning by the 
board.  The board says that, quote:  "We carefully 
studied the arbitral and judicial precedents cited by 
both parties in support of their respective positions"; 
and that "An evidentiary process after the appeal to 
this board would have been contrary to the procedural 
requirements contained in circular 1, as well as the 
weight of arbitral precedents supporting the carrier's

position."

 Well, what are those requirements?  Section 
301.2(b) of circular 1 expressly says that, quote:  "No 
petition shall be considered by any division of the 
board unless the subject matter has been handled in 
accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor 
Act," which includes the statutory requirement that a 
conference must have occurred.  The board has reasonably 
understood that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask, just to be --
do you -- do you contest the question of whether there 
was conferencing?

 MR. BALLENGER:  It's a complex question, 
Your Honor.  In the arbitration, Union Pacific went --
when this issue came up, Union Pacific went back to its 
records and determined that it had proof in its own 
records that two of the five cases had been conferenced. 
And so we essentially conceded that point in the 
arbitration.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  You conceded that there 

was conferencing?

 MR. BALLENGER:  We didn't contest that point 

in the arbitration.  Of course, the arbitrators 
correctly determined that it was irrelevant.

 As to the other three, the -- Union Pacific

did not have in its files the paperwork that it would 
expect to see there if conferences occurred.  So --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm not sure that answers 

my question.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Well, we took the position 
in the arbitration that we don't know for sure whether 
conferencing occurred and that it's Respondent's burden 
to prove it, and that the proof that they proffered in 
the arbitration was not convincing and sufficient to 
satisfy their burden.  We think that constitutes 
contesting the issue in an ordinary legal sense.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you didn't contest it 
in two.  Two cases, you concede that there was in fact a 
conference.

 MR. BALLENGER:  In two cases, that appears 
to be correct, Justice Ginsburg.  But, of course, the 
board properly determined within its discretion that 
that fact is not relevant because the board enforced its 
procedural rule that the evidence of conferencing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but the board can 

make rules of procedure.  It can't make rules of 
jurisdiction.  The dismissal of all these petitions was 
for want of jurisdiction.

 Now, if the board has no authority to set 
its jurisdiction -- and I think that's plain; Congress

has that authority, not the board -- then it is required 
to exercise the jurisdiction that Congress gave it.  So 
why isn't that the very first question that this Court 
should deal with?

 The board threw these cases out for want of 
jurisdiction.  Whatever the failing was, it was not and 
could not be jurisdictional because the board has no 
authority to describe its own jurisdiction.

 MR. BALLENGER:  But Your Honor, the 

board was -- I think the board is entitled to mean 
different things by the word "jurisdiction" than perhaps 
an Article 3 court would mean.  This Court often means 
many different things when it uses that word.

 What the board held was that the -- under 
the language of circular 1 and the weight of arbitral 
precedent the board cannot consider information that is 
not included in the parties' initial submissions.  The 
board has understood for a very long time, consistent 
with the language of circular 1, like Section 301.2(a), 
that it is an appellate body that makes decisions on the 
basis of a record that is before it, that was organized 
on property and presented by the parties in their 
initial submissions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you say this is just a 

mistaken use of words, rather than -- than the board

saying, under our rules, we don't have power to handle 
this?

 MR. BALLENGER:  The substance -- I think it 
can -- you can get tied up in the word "jurisdiction" in 
a way that makes it more confusing than it needs to be.
 What the board held was that the confluence 
of the procedural rules, specific procedural rules, in 
circular 1 established two propositions:  First, that 
the board cannot consider a matter unless conferencing 
in fact occurred; and second, that the only evidence 
that the board is ever allowed to look at under its own 
procedural rules is the evidence that is in the initial 
submissions.  If you put --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you -- do you dispute 

what your opponent tells us, that some panels of the 
board, even when there has been no conference, let alone 
no proof of a conference, but some panels have stayed 
proceedings to allow the conference to occur, and then 
the board will pick up?

 MR. BALLENGER:  That -- we don't contest 
that, Justice Ginsburg.  But, of course, this isn't 
ordinary agency adjudication of the sort conducted under 
the APA, where the board has to stand behind as an 
entity every decision that is made by any panel.

 This is a peculiar sort of agency-supervised

arbitration, and it's perfectly appropriate in this 
context for two simultaneous panels of the board to 
reach different interpretations of the same language. 
And a Court really --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's true generally, 

but if the board believes that as a matter of law it 
can't hear this dispute and consider normal grounds for 
excusing a failure to include something in the record 
because, in its own language, we can't do it, the law 
doesn't permit us to do it, we have no jurisdiction to 
consider matters outside the record, we don't apply 
normal rules of waiver or forfeiture or any of the other 
rules that attend themselves to a failure of a party to 
immediately raise a defense like you could have done and 
waited two and a half years to do, doesn't that suggest 
that the board is not reaching -- merely resting its 
decision on a merely procedural rule, it's resting its 
decision on its erroneous view that the law deprives it 
of jurisdiction to hear the case?

 MR. BALLENGER:  I don't believe so, Your 
Honor.  First of all, this Court squarely rejected in 
the Sheehan case itself the suggestion that there is 
independent judicial review just because a question of 
law is at stake.  That was the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but that -- this is

not merely a question of law.  This is a question of 
jurisdiction:  Is it entitled to hear a dispute by law?

 MR. BALLENGER:  There is no question, no one 

has ever disputed in this case, that the board was 
entitled to hear this matter.

 For instance, the question of arbitral 

jurisdiction, no one has ever disputed that this Court 
-- that this dispute was properly before the board.  The 
board resolved it.  The board simply resolved it on 
procedural grounds.  And the explanation that it gave 
was that considering material outside of the initial 
submissions would be contrary to circular 1 and to the 
weight of arbitral precedent directly on the point.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I am looking at the 

decision and they are all identical in this respect. 
The board said it has no jurisdiction to consider any of 
the remaining procedural or substantive issues 
associated with this claim.

 "No jurisdiction," that sounds like they are 
saying:  We have no authority to consider anything about 
this case; we must toss it out because there is no proof 
of the conference.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Again, Your Honor, I think 

the important point is that the board is not required to 
use the word "jurisdiction" in precisely this sense.

There is no question that the board has jurisdiction 
over this dispute.  It is a minor grievance under the 
Railway Labor Act within the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Don't you think there is 

a big difference between the adjudicator saying:  I 
could, but I choose not to because there is no reason 
for your failure, from:  I won't because I can't.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Those are -- those are 

two very different concepts.

 MR. BALLENGER:  They're -- they certainly 
are in an Article 3 court, Your Honor.  But this Court 
has said many, many times that the word "jurisdiction" 
is a word of many meanings, too many meanings.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you -- could you go 

back for a minute?  I mean, this reads as if it's very 
complicated, but for me, I read the AFL-CIO brief and 
that's what I am thinking of and it seems this is not 
such a hard case.  Basically, there is a statute filled 
with words of procedure, and it isn't too difficult to 
interpret that statute as meaning that the board should 
have fair procedure, not unfair procedure.

 Now, if you are willing to make that giant 

step, the remaining issue in the case is whether the 
procedure here was fair or unfair.  And the Seventh

Circuit is filled with pages of opinion that explains 
why it was unfair.  And the reason basically it was 
unfair is because no one in his right mind previous to 
this case would have thought that you should fill up 
your brief with a lot of facts that nobody's going to 
contest.  And after this case, the board said:  By the 
way, you have to put in a whole lot of jurisdictional 
facts even if nobody is going to contest them, and since 
you didn't do it, you are out, and we won't even give 
you a chance to do it now.

 Okay?  So I read that.  I thought, is there 
something wrong with that?  And then I thought I'd ask 
you, because you would know.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. BALLENGER:  I think that there are 

several things wrong with it, Your Honor, starting from 
the premise that the statute guarantees in all instances 
procedures that are, quote unquote, "fair" in an 
untethered sense.

 This statute guarantees specific procedural 
rights, which if you put them together do guarantee fair 
procedures.  But it doesn't guarantee fairness in the 
abstract.  So what you have to look at are whether the 
specific procedures that are guaranteed by the statute 
were complied with, and they were.

Now, taking a step back, even if we are 

going to talk about what is fair and unfair, there is 
absolutely nothing unfair about what happened here.  As 
the board explained, referencing its own prior 
precedents and the plain language of the regulations 
that are governing, the Respondents clearly were on 
notice that they had to do this.

 Several prior decisions of the board had 

dismissed grievances for precisely the reason that there 
was no evidence of conferencing in the on-property 
record.  That is if you look at page 40 of the joint 
appendix 18679 from the first --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are there any -- is there 

any rule describing how one has to get this into the 
record?  It's just-- how -- what would have been the 
proper way to prove that conferencing occurred?

 MR. BALLENGER:  As the board has explained 

in prior cases, the ordinary method of proving that 
conferencing occurred is that the last exchange of 
correspondence on the property between the carrier and 
the union, references the conference that had occurred 
and what happened.  And then both parties or -- or 
the -- the union use that exchange of correspondence 
to -- in their initial submissions to the board pursuant 
to section 301.2(a), which requires, consistent with the

text of the statute itself, that every submission of the 
board will include, quote, "A full statement of the 
facts and all supporting data bearing on the dispute."

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But that doesn't refer to 

conferencing, does it?

 MR. BALLENGER:  A full statement of -- of 
all of the facts and supporting data, which includes 
conferencing.  Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Implicitly includes con --

not expressly includes conferencing.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Well, that's how the board 

has understood it, and, of course, the board is entitled 
as an arbitral body to interpret its own rules.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I see.
 MR. BALLENGER:  Within the enormous 

discretion that this Court has established in the 
Steelworkers trilogy standard of review, which is that 
as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or 
applying the appropriate principles, his decision has to 
stand.  There is no real question, I think, if you look 
at the five pages of careful reasoning and the expressed 
text of Circular 1 here that this -- this is an 
exemplary arbitral award.  The arbitrators were careful, 
they were construing and applying the relevant 
principles.  And this Court has said --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And it's going against 

another panel that says, not only you don't have to have 
the proof, even if you didn't have the conference we are 
not going to throw you out.

 Now, there is different panels, but it is 
the same board.  Why shouldn't the grievants here say, 
we don't understand this?  It's conceded there was a 
conference, at least in two of the cases.  Our buddies 
didn't even have a conference and this same board, a 
different panel, allowed them to cure it.  And I can't 
cure it now.  That is the height of arbitrary behavior 
by the board, it seems to me.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Your Honor, exactly the same 

thing happens to litigants in courts all of the time. 
Three identically situated litigants go to three 
different trial courts in the same State with identical 
claims under the same statute and they present those 
claims and they get three different answers from the 
State trial courts.  That is not a violation of due 
process.  Sometimes --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm not -- I'm not 

talking about due process.  I'm talking about conformity 
with the act, the act's requirement.  I --

of the Railway Labor Act scheme that different -- each

panel of the board is its own discreet interpretive 
universe and is to be judged by the Federal courts 
according to the standards set up in the statute.  It 
will happen that boards -- that panels disagree about 
the proper resolution of an issue.  That's happened --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So does the board as a 

whole apparently, because I am looking at the 
instruction about joint exhibits and it tells the 
parties, when you are going to make a submission don't 
include unnecessary documents, and among things don't 
include things that aren't in dispute --

MR. BALLENGER:  Three things about --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- like letters 

requesting conferences.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Three things about that, 

Your Honor.  First of all, that instruction sheet 
doesn't apply here at all.  It applies only when the 
parties get together beforehand and agree to file a 
joint -- a joint submission to the board, so that they 
really have talked about what is in dispute and what 
isn't.  It wasn't even promulgated until after the 
submissions in this case were made.

 And it's not clear how the board is going to 

understand that language.  It doesn't say that the 
parties can omit evidence of conferencing.  It says they

can omit, if they don't dispute it, letters requesting a 
conference.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It must be what they think 
of as an interpretation of the rule and the statute that 
they already had promulgated.  The rule and the statutes 
say, the rule says you have to include all known 
relevant argumentative facts.  So if the circular says 
we mean it, we mean the facts that people are having an 
argument about.

 And then the statute says, a full statement 
of the facts bearing upon the dispute.  And the circular 
and then this document say we mean a full statement of 
facts that somebody might think have something to do 
with an argument that people are having.

 And, so, only after this case did the board 

say, oh, no, you have to include some disputes that 
nobody is disputing, some facts that nobody has ever 
disputed or seems to.

 Now, what's -- what's the response to that?
 MR. BALLENGER:  Again, Your Honor, there is 

nothing unique or new about what the board did here. 
The board has done this before.

 Now, as to the circular, it remains --

they did?  Is my statement of what they did, which was

meant to be as pejorative as I could possibly make it --

(Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and you are going to 

say, that's right, that's the correct statement of what 
happened?

 MR. BALLENGER:  No, I'm -- I'm disagreeing 
with the -- the characterization that this is the board 
saying, we're going to make up a new rule that we've 
never applied before.  That's not what happened here. 
The board said that the weight of arbitral precedence 
supports the carrier's position.

 Now, as to the -- the instruction sheet, it 
remains to be seen how the board is going to interpret 
that.  And in an appropriate case, a court, if they 
interpret it in a manner that was wholly arbitrary and 
without reason and would violate the Steelworkers 
trilogy arbitral standard of review, then of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then the board is telling 
people, I will go back a sentence:  "Representatives may 
wish to omit documents that are unimportant and/or 
irrelevant to the disposition of the dispute."

 I mean that -- that seems to me is trapping 

people, if the board says, please don't dump on us 
unnecessary paper.

case could have legitimately relied on that instruction 
sheet, whatever it means.  And the -- the board has not 
yet construed what it's going to mean.  But it doesn't 
by its own terms apply here, because a joint submission 
was not made.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then if -- then a person 
following this is obliged not to pay heed to this advice 
because if you don't put in every document, if you don't 
put in enough evidence of conferencing, you are going to 
be out and never have your grievance heard.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Your Honor, in an 

appropriate case, if a board panel interpreted that 
language in -- in a manner that would be inconsistent 
with something that that panel then did, then there 
might be an inherent conflict that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do I understand you to say 

that that provision was not applicable here anyway?

 MR. BALLENGER:  It's not applicable at all, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does the other side contest 

that?

 MR. BALLENGER:  Not that I am aware of. 

It -- it only applies in the case of joint submissions, 
and it was not promulgated until after the submissions 
here were filed.  So no one could legitimately rely on

that instruction sheet.

 And in any event --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They are not relying on 
it as applicable in this case.  They are relying on it 
as the board's indication that it's sound to tell the 
parties, don't dump on us unnecessary paper.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Well, the board obviously 

does not consider evidence of conferencing unnecessary, 
Your Honor.  It has held for a very long time, going 
back, I think, 40 years to Award 18679 at least, that 
evidence of conferencing is essential to the board's 
consideration of any dispute under the terms of the 
statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Some panels of the board. 

Other panels think this is an eminently curable defect.
 MR. BALLENGER:  That's right, Your Honor. 

But an arbitral decision does not violate the 
Steelworkers standard of review simply because other 
arbitrators disagree.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's a decision on the 
merits.  Here we are talking about a threshold barrier 
to even get your case heard.  And that is being decided 
differently by different panels.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Your Honor, this Court has 

made clear that issues of procedural arbitrability,

threshold conditions to arbitration, are governed by the 
same standard as merits issues in arbitration.  In the 
Misco case, for instance, there was a question of 
evidence, and the arbitrator refused to consider certain 
kinds of evidence.  And this Court said questions of 
procedure are for the arbitrator.

 In John Wiley v. Livingston, which is in 

many ways very similar to this case, it involved a 
procedural precondition to arbitration that the parties 
have to meet in conference prior to beginning the 
arbitration.  And the question in John Wiley & Sons, was 
whether that precondition of conferencing should be 
waived on the grounds that on the facts of that case it 
would be futile.  And the party -- one party tried to 
get a court to intervene on that question, because it 
could have precluded the arbitration entirely.  And the 
Court said that procedural questions arising out of the 
arbitration and bearing on its disposition are for the 
arbitrator, not for a court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question. 
I may have an incorrect impression about it.  Is the --
the thing that's at issue is whether or not conferencing 
occurred.  Is it also important to know what happened at 
the conferencing?  You may not know this.  Is the -- is 
there some sort of -- of factual description of the

negotiations that took place during conferencing an 
important part of the submission?

 MR. BALLENGER:  Not ordinarily, Justice 

Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  So the only -- the only 
importance is to just to establish the fact that there 
was a conference?

 MR. BALLENGER:  It was very important to the 
congressional plan and so it's written into the statute 
that the parties make one last effort to settle these 
grievances before it comes to the board.  That is a 
precondition of the board's consideration of any 
grievance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And in two cases you 

concede that that condition was met, that there was a 
conference?

 MR. BALLENGER:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So we are not even 

talking about a conference requirement.  We are talking 
about a pleading rule, how you plead.  Everybody 
concedes that the conference occurred in two cases.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's how you plead that.
 MR. BALLENGER:  Yes, Your Honor.  Every 

adjudicative body has to be able to enforce its

procedural rules.  And the board has a procedural --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can -- can we -- I'm 

sorry.

 Let's assume that in a published opinion 

there are two procedural defaults.  One, the union does; 
the other, the railroad does.  The board says, you know, 
I am resolving this dispute.  I'm not forgiving the 
union's procedural default, but I will forgive the 
railroad's procedural default, because they're an 
important lifeline business for America and we've got to 
make sure that they're protected at all costs, and union 
members are just not important enough to that scheme.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Your Honor, in that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In your theory, there is 
no due process violation in that case?  They have heard 
the arguments, they have given you a full opportunity to 
make your point about the procedural default.  They are 
announcing a new rule.  It's okay.  So what's wrong with 
that?

 MR. BALLENGER:  That case would be 

reviewable, Your Honor, and properly so under the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under what theory?
 MR. BALLENGER:  -- statutory ground of 

review for exceeding jurisdiction.

MR. BALLENGER:  Because in that case the 

arbitrator is not even arguably construing or applying 
the rules; he is dispensing his own brand of industrial 
justice, as this Court said in the Enterprise Wheel and 
Car case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, point me to any 
rule, that --- you know, anybody could point to a rule 
and says it commands a result.  They -- there are rules 
here that say disputes should be submitted to the board 
and resolved.  And they are resolving the dispute, the 
dispute, and they are saying, you have defaulted, you 
didn't.

 MR. BALLENGER:  But every -- every 

adjudicative body has to have the ability to set and 
enforce procedural rules governing its procedures.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they can do that. 

That's what -- that's what the circuit said.

 MR. BALLENGER:  In the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They could have passed a 

rule that told people, warned them, and said this is a 
procedural rule we are going to apply.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Well, they did, Your Honor. 

They have Sections 301.2(a) and (b), which if you put 
them together give at least fair warning of --

interpretation of rules that don't command a result 
become improper, outside the board's jurisdiction? 
According to you, never.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Under the -- under the 

Steelworkers standard of review for arbitral decisions, 
there will be a point at which the board's 
interpretation isn't even arguably grounded in -- in the 
rules, and it will be reviewable.  As a matter of 
constitutional due process, which is what we are here 
talking about today, there probably is no point outside 
of the substantive interpretation of a criminal statute 
where that kind of interstitial gap-filling or 
interpretation could be unfair.  It happens to litigants 
all of the time that they come to a court and are 
surprised by how a court resolves a disputed procedural 
question.

Respondent would like to stress is that we are not here 
reviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of the contract 
or here under the review standards set by Steelworkers 
trilogy.  We never received an interpretation of the 
contract, and by that I mean the contract in any 
aspect -- procedural rules of the contract, substantive 
rules of the contract.  No contract interpretation for 
these five engineers.  And the reason that the 
Respondent urged both a statutory and due process 
violation is that without any interpretation of the 
contract, these five cases were dismissed invoking 
Circular 1, Code of Federal Regulations, as the basis, 
and denying these five engineers any determination of 
their contract claims.

 They never got to what the Railway Labor Act 

with its mandatory arbitration procedure promised the 
engineers and the carriers:  a resolution of their 
contract claims for the purpose of industrial peace.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it didn't -- it didn't 

promise them that categorically.  There were certain 
things they had to do, right?  One of which was to have 
conferencing, and in three of these cases they didn't. 
So that promise didn't extend at least to those three 
cases.  And in the other two, where there was 
conferencing, the act also provides, as any sensible act

would have to, for the adoption of procedural rules. 
And the procedural rule here, according to the 
arbitrator, required the submission of that evidence 
of -- of consultation with the complaint, which didn't 
happen.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, I respectfully 
disagree.  These cases -- the panel never said that the 
three cases were not conferenced.  Union Pacific has not 
said that these three cases were not conferenced.  The 
panel said that, no matter how convincing the evidence 
that these other three cases were conferenced, that all 
five cases were conferenced, it would not consider that 
evidence because it was not attached to the original 
submission.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do -- do you say that all 
five were -- were conferenced?  Is that your position?
 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Oh, absolutely.  We have 

correspondence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But we have rules 
like that -- we have rules like that all the time.  No 
matter how clear it is what happened below, if it wasn't 
included in the question presented, we say you can't 
raise it.  This is just a rule like that.

conferencing in -- in the record at a particular time. 
You didn't do it, so we are not going to -- the fact 
that on the facts, on the real facts, it occurred is not 
an adequate challenge to the procedural rule.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, that would be 
true if there was a rule that required these documents 
to be attached to the original submission.  There is no 
such rule.  301 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You think there is 

now?  In other words, this is -- rulemaking by 
adjudication is not unheard of.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Rulemaking by adjudication 

is not unheard of, Your Honor.  But this is not 
rulemaking by adjudication because this particular 
panel, which is an arbitration panel, a division, it's 
five members, it's a division of the adjustment board, 
has no power to make rules.  Congress in section (v) of 
Section 153 of the act delegated the rulemaking power 
under this act on a one-time basis.  In fact, it put in 
the dates.  It had to start in June 1934 and be done in 
19 -- October 1934.  That is the only power that this 
34-member adjustment board has to make rules.

 A panel has no power delegated to it by the 
Congress under this act, and the act is very specific, 
because Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is it -- is --
where is the rule that there has to be conferencing?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  The rule -- there is no rule 

that there has to be conferencing.  There --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think -- you 

think that was where the board erred, in requiring 
conferencing?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's in the statute, isn't 

it?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  It is in Section 152, which 
is not a statute, by the way, that the NRAB administers.
 We are not disputing that we have to prove 

conferencing.  We're happy to prove it.  We have 
evidence of conferencing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's -- can 

the board adopt procedures about how you go about 
proving conferencing?  You say there is no rule because 
there wasn't a rule adopted in 1934.  There is a rule 
that there has to be conferencing.  Does that mean that 
at any point in time you can just pop up and say, oh, by 
the way, there was conferencing?  Or can the board say, 
this is how you go about establishing it?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  We believe that, given there 

are no rules on this point -- and the Seventh Circuit

is to facilitate the purpose of the act, which is to get 
a contract interpretation.  We have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So they can -- the 

board can never have a rule that says, you have to 
establish conferencing, you know, before the date of the 
first arbitral proceeding, or within 30 days?  The fact 
that all that has to happen under the act is that there 
be conferencing, you are free to establish it at any way 
you want, at any time you want?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  No, you're not.  Your Honor, 
you are not free to establish it any way you want.  You 
have to have relevant evidence that the conferences 
occurred, relevant probative evidence that it is not 
prejudicial.  The only rule that has been cited here for 
keeping this evidence out is 301.5, and that is at page 
50 -- 62a.  And it is the rule that the Seventh Circuit 
focused on, and it describes what should be in the 
original submission.  And it says, if I may quote part 
of it, at 62a, the Court can read along with me:  that 
"Under the caption 'position of employees,' the 
employees must clearly and briefly set forth all 
relevant argumentative facts, including all documentary 
evidence submitted in exhibit form quoting the agreement 
or rules involved, if any; and all data submitted in 
support of employees' position, must affirmatively show

the same to have been presented to the carrier and made 
a part of the particular question in dispute."

 That rule is referring to the investigative 

process as to whether -- for example, one of the 
engineers ran a red light, it's alleged.  So we are 
going to argue about that.  They put on testimony.  We 
have witnesses.  There is cross-examination.  And then 
the investigative officer makes a decision about whether 
that's going to be put in the record.

 The conference is an informal phone call. 

It's not specified in the collective bargaining 
agreement.  There is nothing in the collective 
bargaining agreement about it.  But it's an informal 
phone call that takes place after the whole contract 
grievance procedure has been exhausted, and then, 
before, it can be 30 seconds -- you know, Charlie 
Ridenour, can call up Mr. Stone and say -- you know, can 
we settle this?  No.  We can't.  Okay.

 That's -- that's a conference.  That's all 

it is, and what has to happen under the Act and, 
unfortunately -- and it is unfortunate, we did not put 
in the joint appendix, Section 2, Part 6, 152, Part 6, 
of the Railway Labor Act, which describes what happens. 
The union has to send a letter requesting a conference.
 I hope it is not out of turn, given that we

have been describing evidence, but we've got letters 
about all of these conferences, saying, we want to have 
a conference.  Once that happens, that triggers a 
process.  They have to specify -- both sides have to get 
together and specify a meeting take place.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where -- where does 
it say the unions have to send in letters requesting a 
conference?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Oh, it's in Section 2 of 

Part 6 of the Railway Labor Act.  We did not cite that. 
It's in the statute.

 The conferencing, by the way, is in Section 
2 of the Railway Labor Act.  The board and its power and 
procedures is in Section 3.  Section 3 has no mention of 
conferencing whatsoever in it.  There isn't -- the word 
doesn't appear in the section which describes what the 
board is supposed to do or the board's procedures.

 And it doesn't appear in the CFRs either. 
The CFR's has this rule, Your Honor, that says -- you 
know, trial type evidence has to be presented at this 
investigative hearing below.  Why?  Because it's an 
appellate court mand you don't want to get surprised --
you know, the union can't come forward in this case and 
say, well, we have a surprise witness that shows 
Mr. Smith didn't run the red light.

I mean, that's just out of bounds.  It 

surprises.  It's blind-siding.  You can't do it.  The 
Seventh Circuit said:  Wait a second.  This rule doesn't 
have anything to do of proof of whether this phone call 
occurred after the whole written record has been created 
below.  There are no rules about this, and, given that 
there are no rules -- and given that the union -- and 
the panel says this in its opinion -- is waving before 
the panel -- you know, Mr. Neutral, we have letters --
you know, back and forth between the parties about the 
fact that conferences occurred, and they don't dispute 
that two of them occurred.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I still don't 

understand your answer to the Chief Justice's question 
about how the panels -- how these panels -- how the 
board, in your view, is supposed to go about making some 
sort of sensible procedural rules about establishing the 
that conferencing took place.

 They can't do it by rulemaking, and you seem 

to argue that they can't do it by adjudication, so 
what -- they can't do it at all?  There -- this is just 
going to be chaos, that there is no way to establish a

question.  I think the answer is that there are no 
procedures on this because it wasn't -- it's not part of 
the -- the process was set up to develop the trial type 
evidence -- you know, whether the red light was run or 
not.

 It wasn't set up to determine how 

conferencing occurred, and it's artificial to put the 
rulemaking in here.  The Seventh Circuit said: 
Giving -- given the how and why of it, it should be done 
in a way that is least prejudicial to the parties.

 The Union Pacific could have raised this 
issue when we filed the notices.  They didn't.  They 
didn't because the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said, on that point 
in your brief, that, normally, the carrier will raise 
the absence of conferencing as an impediment at the time 
the union files its notice of intent to file a 
submission.

 What is -- what is the basis?  You didn't 

give any citation for that.  You say, ordinarily, that's 
what the -- the carrier will -- would do, and then you 
are tipped off, and then you put in your evidence about 
conferencing.

 What -- what makes you -- what backs up this 
statement that, normally, carrier raises the absence of

conferencing as an impediment at the time the union

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, the answer is 

past practice.  Although this is not a collective 
bargaining situation, we are not applying the 
contractor.  That was the past practice.  That's what we 
alleged.  This case was to show --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So could the 

board -- could the board adopt a rule requiring that?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  The adjustment board could 

adopt a rule.  That is the agency -- and it still 
exists.  It has got offices here in Washington, D.C., 34 
members.  They were given this explicit rulemaking power 
by Congress.  They were delegated with the authority. 
If there is an agency out there that is entitled to 
Chevron type deference, that is the agency.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do they do anything else? 

What do they do?  What does the adjustment board do?
 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, I'm not sure.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't want to get you in 

trouble, but I'm not sure they do anything.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  I --

I will take you off the hook.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to be clear, 
you say it's established practice that the railroads 
normally file their objection at a -- you know, at a 
particular point, and you think the board is without 
power to say:  Look.  This is the established practice. 
You, railroad, did not follow it, and so we're not going 
to consider your objections.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  No, no, Your Honor.  Our --

our position is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  No.  You mean 

that they -- the board can't do that?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  We don't think that the 

board can or should do that.  What we do think is that, 
if there is -- the rule that I just read from, 301.5, 
says that you raise relevant argumentative facts.

 Union Pacific, when the parties exchanged 

the submissions, did not say that there wasn't any 
conferencing.  Now, their -- their comeback to that in 
the reply brief was, well, we didn't know you had not 
conferenced until we saw that you didn't have any 
evidence of it.  I mean, that's just not -- slightly, in 
our view, disingenuous.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could they -- could they 

adopt a rule that says that, if the -- if the parties go 
through -- do everything that is necessary prior to the

time of the adjudication, they can't pop up at the very 
last minute and send in a letter saying:  Oh.  By the 
way, there was no conferencing; could they adopt a rule 
like that because it's just a big waste of everybody's 
time to leave it to -- to the last minute?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, in our view, the 
panel couldn't, but the adjustment board could, and the 
adjustment board comes out with these little procedures, 
like the one read here that -- which they say is not 
relevant, that says -- you know, let's have these joint 
submissions, let's keep evidence of conferencing out.

 They are trying to -- these submissions that 

come in for these arbitration cases are not to be 
believed.  I mean, they are like six feet high.  So 
there is a constant effort on the part of everybody in 
the process to pare down the submissions to what is 
actually in dispute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought, under the 

Steelworkers trilogy, the arbitrators has broad 
deference to adopt these sorts of modes of procedure.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  But, Your Honor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That we would review 

only for whatever it is.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  This is not the Steelworkers 

trilogy.  The Steelworkers trilogy is about private

arbitrators determining private contracts and 
determining the procedures under private contracts. 
They are -- they are applying the procedural rules of 
the contract.  There is nothing like that here.

 We are here because a government-funded 

panel, under a mandatory procedure, funded by the 
government, was applying the Code of Federal 
Regulations, not rules that the parties agreed to 
themselves, so the deference that is given to -- by this 
Court to a private arbitrator applying private 
procedural rules that the parties agree to, and so on 
and so forth, isn't present here because this is 
governmental action.  It is a governmental agency.

 Now, we can -- the AFL-CIO gets into an 
argument about whether it's a state action.  But the 
bottom line is that these are arbitrators paid for by 
the government.  The arbitrators are selected -- or the 
eligible pool is selected by the government.

 They are applying the Code of Federal 

Regulations to keep us from getting to any procedural 
rule or any substantive rule under a private collective 
bargaining agreement.  That looks a lot like 
governmental action blocking the people from getting 
their -- resolution of their private contractual claims. 
That's why --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the review -- the 
review of government arbitrators arbitrating provisions 
pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the 
standard of review of that is different than private 
arbitrators under the Steelworkers trilogy?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  It should be, and, in the 

hornbook sense, it is, the reality of it is, and that's 
true here.  We can say it's de novo review.  We can say 
it's a different standard than -- than Steelworkers or 
John Wiley, and this is not a John Wiley case.

 But the reality is you aren't going to get a 

court's attention, unless they did something that is 
actionable under the Steelworker trilogy, too.  And the 
Steelworker trilogy has the Enterprise Wheel case, which 
says, if the arbitrator starts making up rules 
willy-nilly, dispensing "his own brand of industrial 
justice," not drawing their essence from the collective 
bargaining agreement or, in this case, the CFRs.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you don't think 
that this is that.  I mean, if you say:  Look.  Here's 
the rule.  You have got to file these things by this 
date, that is not imposing your own rule of industrial 
justice.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  But there is no such rule,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm saying that, if 
the board adopts a procedure exactly like that, you may 
challenge it as-- as violating due process because you 
didn't have notice, any number of things, but you can't 
say that the board is imposing its own brand of 
industrial justice.

 That sort of seems, to me, goes to the 
merits in the standards of arbitration, rather than 
procedures like this, unless it's a procedure like was 
hypothesized earlier, that only applies to one side and 
not the other.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, all I can say, 
in answer to that, is that there are governmental rules 
that have very specific procedures that are in place.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought your position 
was -- at least I thought I heard you say earlier, that 
these individual panels do not have rulemaking authority 
for the board.  I'm looking at something that says, 
"National Railway Adjustment Board, Uniform Rules of 
Procedure, Revised June 23rd."  That's put out by the --
the board, the one that you said that is --

MR. GEOGHEGAN:  The adjustment board down

your -- because there's nothing in this statute, nothing 
in any regulation, that gives an individual panel the 
right to proscribe rules of procedure that all parties 
to these disputes are obliged to follow.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That -- that authority is 

vested only in the board, not in the panels.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Arguably, in the board.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know how that could 

possibly be true.  I can't imagine being an arbitrator 
and not being able to say:  All right, you know, we are 
going to have a conference next Tuesday.  I want you to 
have all of the -- all of the papers relevant to this 
particular point that we are going to discuss in by two 
days before.

 Can't do that?
 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would not know how to run 

an arbitration without -- without establishing some 
rules of procedure.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, that didn't 

happen here.  If I may explain, there is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, at least back off 

from your statement that an arbitrator cannot set rules 
of procedure.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  I -- well, Your Honor, an 

arbitrator can set rules of procedure within the 
parameters of what is allowed by the act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, all right.  That's a 

little different.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  But the act itself, and the 
CFRs, are very clear that there is no requirement that 
this evidence has to be submitted in the original 
submission.  And once the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you're making sense. 
It says that, or it just doesn't address the question of 
whether they have to be included in the original 
submission?  I mean, I assume there is no provision that 
says -- or I missed it, there is no provision that says 
the conferencing materials do not have to be included in 
the original submission?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  There is no CFR that says 

that the conferencing materials have to be in the 
original submission or the case is dismissed.  There is 
nothing like --

none that says they don't have to be.  In other words, I

take it that this is an issue that is simply not 
addressed by the CFR rules?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Well, in any specific way. 
I understand Your Honor's point, but the fact of it is 
that the record that you attach to the original 
submission is only about the relevant argumentative 
facts that are in dispute.  That doesn't mean that 
that -- that there isn't other evidence in the record 
down below.

 What happened here, and this is different 

from all the other cases, is that the union came in and 
said:  Oh, we've got evidence.  And we've got evidence 
that relates even to correspondence between the parties.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you are just 

disputing the validity or applicability of the rule. 
You don't want to comply with the rule.  I mean, is it 
any different than saying:  Look, okay, we've got this 
arbitration that is going to go forward.  We are going 
to meet at 10:00 Monday morning.  It is the first 
meeting.  One side doesn't show up and then they say, 
well, there's no rule that says we have to be there at 
10:00 Monday morning; that's just the arbitrator saying 
that to -- to move the procedure along, so you can't 
penalize us in any way for not showing up at 10:00 
Monday morning.

MR. GEOGHEGAN:  I think that an arbitrator 
could penalize a party for not showing up.  But the --
the fact of this is that there is no authority in the 
arbitrator to bar evidence of conferencing simply 
because it wasn't in the original citation.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I take it your point is 

that there is a rule?  It's called 29 CFR 301.7(b).  If 
that rule happened to say, you must show up by 11, that 
would be a fair inference you don't have to show up by 
10.  And that rule says you have to submit the 
argumentative facts, so there is a fair inference you 
don't have to submit the facts that are not 
argumentative.

 I take it that that -- suppose that you are 

wrong -- suppose that you are wrong on that.  I think 
maybe you are right, but suppose you are wrong.  Suppose 
they have loads of authority to make rules.  Again, you 
have a strong argument they don't, but suppose they did.
 In your research -- and the same question is 

really addressed to your fellow counsel.  In your 
research on this, did you find any instance in which 
either a court or an agency does change a rule, and 
says:  Now you have to say the date right underneath the 
caption, whereas previously it was stamped by the clerk. 
Okay?  They changed the rule.  And they have every good

reason in the world for doing it.  And then they apply 
it to the case in front of them, which didn't know about 
it, and then they won't let them change it.

 Now, is there any case at all which said 

that that was lawful?  I can think of lots of cases that 
say you cannot apply rules retroactively where it is 
unfair to do it, even if you had have all the power in 
the world to make the rules.  I have lots of cases like 
that.  What I wondered is if anybody found a case along 
the lines that I just said.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  We did not, Your Honor, and 

the Wells case in particular, where there was no 
question that the rule was valid, was a case where the 
Fourth Circuit found a violation of due process because 
the parties did not have reasonable notice, or the 
carrier in that case did not have reasonable notice that 
it was the postage date that was the date for the brief, 
instead of the postmark.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you recall the 

situation -- do you recall the situation Justice Breyer 
described, and we can debate about it, whether it's 
rulemaking by adjudication, which does take place, you 
would say that in the situation you described, it 
violated due process, right?

in excess of the arbitrator's power under the act 
because this arbitrator does not have rulemaking power.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And because -- I mean, in 

the normal --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought you said he did 
have rulemaking power, so long as it did not contradict 
--

MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, you were asking 
me whether he could require the parties to show up at a 
certain time.  I mean, there are certain rulings that 
are in the case.  I don't want to get hung up on -- on 
rules.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's not get -- can I ask 
about argumentative facts?  I frankly have never heard 
of a phrase like argumentative facts.  You seem to think 
it means only those facts that are in dispute.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that would be a 
pretty incomprehensible statement of the -- of the 
event, if you write in your brief statement of facts and 
you only write down the facts that are disputed and none 
of the facts that are agreed to.

 It couldn't possibly mean that.  I would 

think that argumentative facts simply means facts 
relevant to the argument, and one of the facts relevant

to the argument is whether you did the necessary 
consultation.  But I don't know how you could interpret 
argumentative facts to mean only those facts that are in 
dispute.  What kind of a statement of facts would that 
be?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Well, Your Honor, you may be 

correct in your view of it, but the parties have 
interpreted this as being the facts that are in dispute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --
MR. GEOGHEGAN:  And remember, this is a 
procedure that is not about conferencing or proving 
conferencing, it is a procedure that -- about what 
happened at the trial.

 So when you are looking at that 301.5, you 
are looking at a rule that is designed to make clear to 
the arbitrator and the panel what it is that is being 
disputed, after the investigative hearing where the 
carrier superintendent signs off and says, you know, we 
are going to discharge this guy because he ran the red 
light.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What does the government 

party define --

MR. GEOGHEGAN:  In that context, it is not 

about conferencing at all.

the grievance know exactly which facts are in dispute at 
the time when they made the submission?  Here, there's a 
dispute about whether there was a dispute about 
conferencing.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Yes.  Well, that's because 
this particular rule is so focused on what happens at 
trial.

 Your Honor, if you look at the collective 

bargaining agreement and the trial-type procedures, they 
are elaborate.  It is like a state court proceeding. 
There is not a neutral party.  There is a carrier's 
officer behind it.  But you have union representatives 
who are better than most lawyers, I must say, in terms 
of putting in the exhibits and evidentiary record and 
cross-examination.  This is all transcribed elaborately 
in the transcript, so that it's like at the end of a 
trial.  I mean, the parties know, at the end of a 
contested criminal or civil trial that may go on for, 
basically, all day, what the facts are that are in 
dispute.

 But at any rate, this is the regulation that 

was created in 1934, and it was not about proving 
conference --

a common-law adjudication method of developing new 
rules.  And that there is precedent out there for 
dismissing these arbitrations because the conferencing 
was not established in the record at the time the 
proceeding started.  Is this a reference to the -- to 
precedent, correct?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, this isn't a 

system of precedent.  There is certainly no strict stare 
decisis here.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, I understand that, 
but were there presidents that might well have put you 
on notice that you better get this in the record?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  No, Your Honor, not in or 
our view.  I mean, the cases they cite are arbitration 
awards where the arbitrator says, looking at the whole 
record, not what was attached to the original submission 
-- there isn't a single arbitration award that says, we 
are only looking at the original submission and we won't 
look at any evidence that might have been in the record 
below and you want to add now.  There isn't any case 
like that.  So -- but there are only a handful of these 
cases that they cite in the joint appendix.

 Your Honor, there are probably 60,000, 

70,000 of these cases.  They are not codified online.

a system where the procedural rules are maybe in 4 cases 
out of 80,000 that are not codified --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, that's really not my 

-- but you do concede, do you, that there are half a 
dozen cases out there which were dismissed because there 
was the failure of the record to show that there was 
conferencing below?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  We do admit that, but we say 
that in our particular case, the record would certainly 
include or we would be allowed to supplement with the 
evidence from the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So your -- your objection 
is -- is two-fold.  One, that you think the requirement 
that the record show it affirmatively is not supported. 
And secondly, there -- you should have had an 
independent right to -- to make an offer of proof that 
would have cured the defect.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  That's correct and we don't 

know of any case that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You did -- you did make 

an offer of proof as to --

MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Yes.

make your initial filing.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, I don't -- I 
wish I had made that point earlier.  I mean, they --
they -- originally we passionately objected to this, and 
the -- and the neutral members said, oh, fine, you know, 
we will -- we will reconvene for -- we will reschedule 
this in three months, come back.

 So everybody came back with the evidence. 

Union Pacific came back with what -- I mean, they found 
out that, in fact, they have -- probably two of these 
cases had been conferenced, we came back with our 
letters, we said here it is, and -- and the neutral 
member said, oh, no, you don't understand, I didn't 
really want you to do this.  So, you know, why -- why --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think you 

could submit that offer of proof at any time during the 
proceeding and the board would have to accept it?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  We think of it as relevant, 
probative evidence as to conferencing when the objection 
had not been raised at the time that these cases were 
conferenced, at the time that this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why wouldn't the 

other side say we don't have to raise the objection at a 
particular time.  You can't make a rule telling us we 
have to do that.

MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Your Honor, I'm afraid there 
is such a rule, and that is 301.5.  And it says that the 
parties have to praise relevant argumentative facts in 
the original submission.  That doesn't mean that it only 
has to be in the original submission, but there was only 
one submission here, and they did not raise 
conferencing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your answer to my 

earlier question is that you can submit that offer of 
proof at any time, and it has to be considered?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Well, any time that the 

objection is raised.  If -- if it is not done in a way 
that prejudices the other party, the answer is yes. 
There is no rule that prohibits that.

 And the purpose of the Act, Your Honor, is 

to get the parties to have contract interpretations. 
And the way this was done -- the way these cases were 
dismissed without any hearing and what the Seventh 
Circuit called blind-siding and what the union 
dissidents said was gamesmanship is the kind of thing 
that should be of concern of this Court, because it 
really undermines the integrity of the arbitration 
process, and it's very important to keep that.

here.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are there also cases out 
there in which the record doesn't tell us whether there 
was conferencing, but nevertheless, the merits were 
decided?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  Oh, sure.  I mean, but it --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  There are least six -- six 

or are there more than that?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN:  I don't think that there 

are -- there are the cases that we cited where it turned 
out there wasn't conferencing and the arbitrator said go 
back and conference.  I mean, you can step outside the 
hall and do it in 30 seconds.  You know, it's a -- it's 
a statutory procedure that is not really part of this 
proof process that is set up by the collective 
bargaining agreement.  Well, my time up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Geoghegan.

 Mr. Ballenger, you have three minutes 

remaining.

looking for are at pages 40 and 45 of the joint 
appendix, and also we would suggest that you look at 
first division award 23883, which is easy to locate.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Were any of those 

decisions that were boardwise or did they apply to one 
panel?

 MR. BALLENGER:  All these decisions are 

rendered by one panel.  The board never sits as -- as a 
body.

 The Respondent suggests that the Steelworker 

trilogy standard that this Court has articulated for 
labor arbitration generally doesn't apply under the RLA. 
There is no authority for that, that many I am aware of. 
The lower courts have understood it the same way, and 
there is every reason to think that's correct.  Congress 
was quite clear in the legislative history to the '66 
amendment that it anticipated that the standard of 
review under this statute would be the same as that 
applied in ordinary private labor arbitration.  And, of 
course, the Sheehan case rejects the idea that there is 
some kind of special judicial review for question of law 
under the RLA.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there is a 

difference between governmentally ordered arbitrations 
and private contracts.  In private contracts the parties

negotiate the rules and they set them forth, and the 
arbitrators then follow --

MR. BALLENGER:  The difference, Your Honor, 
I believe, is that in the ordinary arbitral context when 
you have a procedural question, the question is what the 
parties would have wanted.  Here the question is what 
Congress would have wanted, but there is no -- about the 
correct standards of review.  But there is no reason to 
think that Congress wanted anything other than what the 
parties ordinarily want under this case law, which is 
for procedural questions to be resolved by the 
arbitrator.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is it your position that 

if you go through the first phase and as everybody is 
walking out the two adversaries in the first 
investigative space say this is never going to be 
settled, this is the most important case in the history 
of this -- the railroad system.  Let's go take it to the 
board.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That they can't waive 

the grievance procedure, that they just can't go 
straight to you?

 MR. BALLENGER:  That -- that's correct, Your 

Honor.  The statute in section 2 Second requires a

conference.  And Respondents argued initially in this 
case that the statute shouldn't be read that way and 
there should be an exception read in from section 2 
Sixth.  That was rejected by the district court and they 
chose not to appeal it to the Seventh Circuit.  It's not 
before this Court.

 Now, Respondent focuses a lot on section 
301.5 in its language about argumentative facts.  I 
think that our interpretation here today of that 
language isn't ultimately the point.  That this is a 
question for the arbitrators to resolve unless -- even 
if a court is convinced that the arbitrators committed 
serious error.

 But the more important maybe threshold point 

is that the arbitrators didn't say that they were 
resting their opinion just on section 301.5.  They never 
invoked 301.5.  They said circular one and the weight of 
precedent under the arbitration.  And if this Court 
looks at section 301.2(a), which requires the parties to 
include all facts relevant to the dispute in their 
initial submissions, I think that resolves the 
question.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But we disagree with 

you.  You say if the board was just plain wrong.  If we 
look at the Act and circular one and say we can't find

what they said anywhere in there, does that doom your 
argument?  Have they asked -- acted outside, has the 
board acted outside its jurisdiction?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You may answer the 

question, counsel.

 MR. BALLENGER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 The relevant standard is if the board is 

even arguably construing or applying the relevant rules 
and its decision stands, even if a court is convinced 
that the arbitrator committed serious error.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you counsel. 

The case is submitted.
