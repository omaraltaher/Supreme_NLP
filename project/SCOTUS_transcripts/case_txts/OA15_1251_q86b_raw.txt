ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

The Vacancy Reform Act's limitation on an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

individual serving as both the nominee and as the acting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official for a single office applies only to someone who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is currently the first assistant in that office and is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting pursuant to the automatic service rule set forth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Subsection 3345(a)(1). 

 

 

17 

            

Both the GAO and OLC adopted that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

interpretation of the Act shortly after its passage. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And in the nearly two decades from passage of the Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until the D.C. Circuit decision here, Presidents of both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties have made scores of nominations and designations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on that interpretation of the text without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recorded objection from even a single Senator or staff 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

member. 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General Gershengorn, can I 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

ask:  As you read this statute, suppose you just took 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out these words "notwithstanding Section" -- "Subsection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1)."  What would then the effect of the statute be? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

think that our textual argument would be much more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult, and the effect of the statute would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively to override (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

The "notwithstanding" clause really is the 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

anchor of our textual interpretation.  But its strength, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think, comes not only from its text, but also how it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fits so well with both the history, structure, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemporaneous interpretation, and practice. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just focusing on text 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

for a minute. 

   

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If that's true, if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

entire textual argument really does rest on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1)" -- I mean, typically 

   

 

 

 

 

when you have a "notwithstanding" clause, it means, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, take away Subsection (a)(1), not, you know, close 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your eyes to Subsection (a)(1).  But it doesn't do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything more than that. 

 

 

 

            

So why do you think it should be taken to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something more than that in this case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, we think 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

that because it's a routine application of the expressio 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unius canon in the context of the "notwithstanding" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause.  And so we think it has power for at least three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

reasons. 

5 

            

First -- and we're on pages 82A and 82 --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

83A of the government's brief -- the -- the expressio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unius implication is very strong here, because if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read the statute on page 82A, (a)(1) sets out the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistant rule, (a)(2) sets out the -- the PAS rule for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a Senate-confirmed official, and (a)(3) then sets out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the act -- the career official or the agency with --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency official with substantial service. 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

The very next words in the statute are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

"notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1)."  So after (a)(1), 

  

 

 

 

 

(a)(2), and (a)(3), Congress said, "Notwithstanding only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

(a)(1)." 

17 

            

We think the expressio unius counter is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

particularly powerfully, because Congress could have 

 

 

 

 

 

said, if we're -- we wanted to do a respondens se, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding subsection (a), but it did not do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it's particularly powerful as well, because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"notwithstanding" clause, as Your Honor suggests, is one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress uses all the time.  Congress will say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding any other provision in the code, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding any other section of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But can I give you a hypo? 

   

   

  

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So the hypo is, I'm at a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

            

4 

5

restaurant, and I -- I'm talking to my waiter, and I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place three orders.  I say, number 1, I'll have the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house salad.  Number two, I'll have the steak.  Number 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

three, I'll have the fruit cup.  And then I tell the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waiter, notwithstanding order number three, I can't eat 

   

 

 

 

 

 

anything with strawberries. 

 

 

10 

            

So on your theory, the waiter could bring me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

a house salad with strawberries in it, and that seems to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me a quite odd interpretation of what's a pretty clear 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

instruction:  No strawberries. 

  

 

14 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

think this really is fundamentally different for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number of reasons. 

 

 

            

First of all, we have before us, in contrast 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to your -- your waiter hypothetical, we have before us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the very history of this clause which suggests an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation very much in line with the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

interpretation. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I -- I take it, you know, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

you have some arguments, some strong arguments on -- on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history and on practice, but, you know, again, I'm just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of -- isn't that just a peculiar way to understand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

1 

the, you know, notwithstanding order number three, no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

strawberries? 

3 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So I don't think it 

   

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

is, Your Honor, and I -- I -- in a footnote, the -- if, 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example, you had been a routine -- a regular member 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that restaurant -- regular diner at that restaurant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and had always understood that you couldn't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strawberries with only one of those things, then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waiter would be justified in interpreting it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently, and we have that contemporaneous practice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

here. 

12 

            

But given Your Honor's textural point only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

for the moment, I do think that's exactly what this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court held in Preseault, in -- in -- where there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"notwithstanding" clause, that said, notwithstanding the 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions of the Act, funds -- that you have to rely on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advance appropriations, and this Court said, no, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't override the existence of the Tucker Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I point the Court as well to the case cited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in our brief, SEC v. Mount Vernon Memorial Park, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a situation extremely similar to this, if I could 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

just take a sec on that because I think it will help. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That was an interpretation of the Investment Company 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act, and it said, "An investment company is an issuer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who meets one of the following:  (a)(1), (a)(2), and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

1 

(a)(3)." 

2 

            

And for (a)(3), there was something called a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

(b)(1) limitation, and it said "Notwithstanding (a)(3), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an issuer is" -- "you're not an issuer unless you're in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the business of issuing securities."  And what the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said was that the issuer who fell within that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitation, the same (b)(1) limitation, nonetheless was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an investment company under (a)(2) precisely because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introductory limitation was limited to notwithstanding 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(3), and that case is cited in our brief.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shomberg is the same. 

 

 

 

            

Our point, Your Honor, is not that it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inevitably that way.  The expressio unius canon is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

never -- is -- is a canon.  It's an aid to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation, and it may be that, for example, in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restaurant hypo, that would be a -- it would be clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from context.  But here we really do think that all of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other aids to statutory --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't there another 

  

 

 

 

explanation for why the "notwithstanding" clause of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)(1) refers only to (a)(1)?  If it -- without that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there would be a direct conflict between (b)(1) and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1) because (a)(1) says "shall," the first assistant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall perform.  Whereas (a)(2) and (a)(3) say that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President may do certain things.  So there isn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

same kind of direct conflict between the remainder of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)(1) and (a)(2) and (a)(3) as there is with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

(a)(1). 

4 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, that 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

is the argument that respondents make, and we simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree with that.  We think there is a direct conflict 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

between (a)(2), which says the President may appoint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this person as an acting, and (b)(1), which says the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President may not appoint -- appoint a person as an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting when that person is also the nominee. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That (b)(2) is a very -- is a designation 

   

   

 

 

 

 

and delegation of power to the President to make a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designation, and it is every bit as broad as the -- as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the (a)(1) example. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But it's not quite the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of conflict.  To -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restaurant scenario and modifying it a bit, if she -- if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she were to say, or if I were to say to the waiter, "You 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may bring me the soup of the day, but you may not bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me soup that contains shellfish because I'm allergic to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it," there wouldn't be a conflict of the same sort, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would there, between those two statements? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I do 

   

  

 

 

 

think that there -- I do think there would be, and I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think in particular, even apart from the restaurant hypo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

10 

itself, the whole purpose of (a)(2) is to give the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President the power to make a designation when he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

believes there's a superior official serving elsewhere 

   

 

 

 

 

in the government.  That grant of power is every much 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restricted by (b)(1) as (a)(1) absent the introductory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause.  The -- the (b)(1) says the President may do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  (b)(2) says in some circumstances he may not do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, and that is precisely the kind of conflict that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was getting at.

8 

9 

10 

            

But even if you thought the text had some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

ambiguity here, I really do think that the other aids to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory construction which this Court's have looked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- this Court has looked to -- over and over, really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do work in our favor and really not at all in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's favor here. 

 

 

16 

            

The -- principally, if one looks at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

contemporaneous interpretation and consistent practice, 

 

 

 

 

what one sees is the sponsor of the legislation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified precisely the government's interpretation. 

 

 

 

 

Both GAO and OLC adopted that interpretation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

President --

 

22 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You went into detail 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

without any elaboration.  It's just a question, and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

here's the answer, and there's no reason for the answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from OLC.  As far as GAO is concerned, they didn't say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11 

1 

precisely what happens with category two and three. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

think -- so, two points -- a number of points, but two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responding directly to both of those. 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

With respect to OLC, our point is not that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

this Court should defer to it or defer to the reasoning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in it.  Our point -- our point is, from the very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning, from the moment the statute was passed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was aware of the interpretation the Executive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Branch was putting on it and raised no objection. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

And with respect to GAO, the GAO letter I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

think is quite significant because GAO recall under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 3349 is the Congressionally-designated watchdog 

 

 

 

 

 

for the Vacancies Act, and when GAO issued its letter, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which I -- I respectfully disagree, Your Honor, I think 

   

   

   

 

 

 

the GAO letter is quite clear. 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

If you look at it, what it says is there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

four ways to make an acting appointment, and for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number 1, (a)(1), it says "And you can't be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

nominee." 

21 

            

For the other three, it does not have that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

and the whole point of that letter was to give guidance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Congress.  So that letter was circulated not just to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Senate majority and minority committees, but to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Office of Presidential Personnel, to the White House 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

counsel's office, to OPM and OMB. 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think you're 

   

  

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

putting a significant burden on Congress to sort of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

speak up.  There's sort of an estoppel against Congress. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If they don't speak up in every instance where they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think some prerogative or interpretation is -- is being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misapplied or prerogative taken away from them, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there can -- deemed to have acquiesced in it.  And this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a context in which that might be particularly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

inappropriate, because maybe the particular appointment 

 

 

 

 

 

contravenes your -- your theory. 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

But a significant number of people in 

   

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

Congress want to see that vacancy filled, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under -- even though it contravenes these more general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions, and that might not be a particular battle 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they want to fight at that time.  I -- I think it's a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very serious burden to impose on the Legislative Branch. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, if --

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

we're not imposing a burden on the Branch, but we are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking you not to turn a blind eye to what really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened in this context. 

 

 

 

            

What lead up to the Vacancy Reform Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- was decades of Congress raising exactly the kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of objections that one would expect.  There were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

oversight hearings.  There were GAO letters.  There were 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

congressional research reports.  There were letters back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and forth to the Attorney General complaining about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way the Justice Department and the Executive Branch was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handling the vacancies, and -- and ignoring the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

Vacancies Act. 

 

6 

            

Then what we have is an interpretation --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

then what we have is the Vacancies Reform Act and an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation set out by the author of the very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision we're talking about, Senator Thompson, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opened discussion by GAO, the watchdog of the Vacancies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act, designated by Congress and by OLC, and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

silence.  So we're not putting a burden --

   

  

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you have on the other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

side -- was it Senator Thompson, you have Senator Byrd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who seemed to be putting on it the construction that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

Respondents do. 

 

17 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

think that actually Senator Byrd is quite -- is quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vague about that and omits the "notwithstanding" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

language. 

21 

            

But even if you thought that was sort of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

draw, I would note that Senator Byrd, who again was not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shy and had weighed in on these Vacancies Act issues, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never raised an objection when the -- when Presidents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across three administrations continued it into --

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm sorry.  I think it 

    

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

should be noted that, you know, it's one thing to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consult legislative history to understand the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole context in which the -- the Congress was acting, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it's quite another thing to rely on an isolated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement and later contradicted by -- by another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Senator, and even for those who at times find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative history helpful, I think this is where it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

at its weakest and most unpersuasive. 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

disagree -- I don't -- I don't disagree with Your Honor. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is merely one, though, of a consistent stream given 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the OLC and GAO opinion. 

 

 

 

 

            

So I really would like to get back to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief Justice's point, if I could.  It is not at all an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estoppel by Congress.  It is -- the reason why this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has put -- should put particular weight on this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

silence here is because it reflects a contemporaneous 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and uniform interpretation of Congress' understanding of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how its own powers are being -- are or are not being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

infringed. 

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is that -- I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

sorry. 

24 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  And given the past 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

history --

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is that not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

how is that not an estoppel? 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  It's not an estoppel, 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

Your Honor.  What it is, is further evidence that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of the plain language that we're putting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward is correct.  The language supports it.  The --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody understood and has acted for 20 years on that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

assumption. 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sounds like the 

  

 

 

 

 

point I was trying to make, is:  You are putting weight 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the fact that they didn't do anything.  And you say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've got other arguments, too, and I appreciate that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

but what did they do, then? 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Absolutely, Your 

  

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

Honor.  No, I am putting weight on what they didn't do. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To me, it is very much the dog that didn't bark. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress had been barking quite loudly and vociferously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for decades on this very issue.  And then it adopted a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that was interpreted by its own watchdog in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain way, and then the barking stopped.  And it seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me this Court is really ignoring reality to not -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not see that that has important weight. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What would be the 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

consequences if we affirm?  Your brief didn't list a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

great parade of horribles.  It seems to me that our

system is quite capable of accommodating the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's argument.  And on that point, eight judges 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have looked at this, and every one of them has come to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conclusion that the Respondent's reached. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

believe there are important consequences. 

 

 

 

 

            

So, first, Congress understood that there 

 

 

 

 

 

are often important positions that don't have first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistants to take over.  To cite one at page 11A of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chart, there's an appointment of Linton Brooks, who was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- who was named as the director in the National 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nuclear Security Administration.  They're the folks that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

oversee nuclear counterterrorism. 

 

 

            

When the Senate-confirmed director of that 

 

 

 

 

 

agency left, there was no first assistant, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President, President Bush, put in Linton Brooks both as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nominee and to act to take over. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So Congress was well aware that there often 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't first assistants around. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask you about the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

consequences going backward? 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Your brief did not talk 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about this, but do you think that if we find against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you, that that subjects to some uncertainty actions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

1 

these 100-plus officials took? 

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

4 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If so, what actions? 

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, it 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

does -- and that's the second point to Justice Kennedy's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

question.

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

It does subject the past officials to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial uncertainty.  In truth, we don't know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exactly the extent of it, because we don't know when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'll have defenses of waiver.  We don't know when we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might, for some things, be able to ratify.  But there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no doubt that there are significant reliance interests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Executive Branch --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What did Judge Henderson 

  

 

 

 

 

say about that?  This is not going to be a floodgate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation, because you would have to raise it.  Here, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was raised before the ALJ.  And for these other cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the vacancy was long filled, there would be no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility of making, very late in the day, an argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you didn't make before. 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I'm in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a tough position, because I don't want to argue too hard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against defenses that we're going to want to assert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later.  But I do think what Judge Henderson was talking 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about in particular was the NLRB situation, which is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

different situation, because there are particular 

 

 

 

 

 

hearings and the NLRB has an ability to ratify that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other agencies don't. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose you didn't have 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

those defenses, because, you know, I'm not sure why you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would necessarily, given that the statute says they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

void ab initio if people take it as against these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures.  So if you didn't have those defenses, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you look down the list of these officials, what kinds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions are you most worried about being unsettled? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, we 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

have, for example, Adam Szubin, who was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Undersecretary For Terrorism and Financial Crimes.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

does the terror-sponsored designations in the Treasury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department.  We have the deputy attorney general.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have the head of OPM.  These are people who issue -- may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue regulations, who make designations, who make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important decisions in the Executive Branch. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It is, I think -- the reliance interests of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Executive Branch are quite strong here.  This is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation -- and we have put very senior officials in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place at the -- with the understanding that what they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were doing based on -- that what they were doing was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawful at the time based on the -- based on the language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the statute and the interpretation provided on it.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I just press you a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, those are all very 

    

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

little bit? 

 

3 

            

4 

            

5 

6

important positions that you named, but it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely clear to me that those -- that there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories of decisions that those people take that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be worried about.  And if there are, I would like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to know about those categories of decisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

can't list them chapter and verse.  But I do think the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of things we're worried about are rulemakings by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the heads of agencies, the -- particular designations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by -- by the senior officials, and decisions on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation and other things that may be subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

challenge. 

17 

            

We have not gone back and catalogued all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the potential ramifications, but we do think that with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over 100 officials over the course of 20 years, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effects of this are really quite significant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does that 100 include or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exclude military officers?  Do you know? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  It is not including 

  

 

 

 

 

military officers, Your Honor.  These are -- these are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the acting officials in the Executive Branch, but I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

don't think they're military officials. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

The interpretation that the -- that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Court is putting forward -- if I could make a couple of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points on the structure and why we really don't think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this is -- that this is the right way to reason and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why our way makes sense -- we think what's reflected in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Vacancies Act is a judgment by Congress that before 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an individual serves as both the acting and the nominee, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there be one of two protections:  that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual either have been Senate-confirmed before, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they meet a length-of-service requirement. 

   

 

 

 

            

So in (a)(2), what one sees is that that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a prior Senate confirmation.  In (a)(3), it's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

length of service.  And if one looks at (c)(1), which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addresses Senate-confirmed officials whose terms have 

 

 

 

 

 

expired, again, it's Senate confirmation. 

 

 

 

 

            

The entire purpose of (b)(1) is to extend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those protections to first assistants.  So what (b)(1) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does is, for first assistants, it puts on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

length-of-service requirement.  And then in (b)(2), it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exempts from that length-of-service requirement what --

 

 

 

 

 

 

the very individuals who have received prior Senate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirmation.  The package works as a seamless whole. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

Congress was not putting on a 

 

 

 

 

 

first-assistant requirement on a PAS appointee from 

   

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

elsewhere in the government, and it was not putting on a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first-assistant requirement on a career agency official 

   

 

 

 

 

moved into an acting position.  What it was doing was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making sure that first assistants who were both nominees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the acting had -- had one of the two protections. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

It's also consistent with the way the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

legislative history is, and the drafting history, with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect -- I think this is very important -- to the PAS 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

positions.  It had been the President's prerogative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

expressly under the Vacancies Act, back to 1968, to take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a PAS officer and put him into an acting position and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then still be able to nominate him.  The first draft of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bill preserved that. 

 

 

 

14 

            

So after all of the rancor, after all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

unhappiness of the Vacancies Act, the first draft of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bill allowed an acting officer to come in automatically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under (a)(1), whereas a PAS under (a)(2), and the (b)(1) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restriction, only applied to (a)(1).  There's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

dispute. 

20 

            

And so then what happened?  Then there was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

an objection that the bill didn't give enough authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the President, and so changes were made to give the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President more authority.  And what Respondents would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have you believe is that Congress overturned sub 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

silentio, without a single complaint, 130 years of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22

Executive Branch practice. 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why do you -- why and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

how do you think that that change was made, then? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because the change clearly was made.  In the initial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draft, it obviously applied only to first assistants; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then in the final draft, not so obvious at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And, you know, I agree with you there's no explanation, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but there is a change. 

   

 

 

9 

            

Are you suggesting it was, you know, just a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

mistake that somehow happened? 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Absolutely not, Your 

  

 

 

 

Honor.  And if you'll bear with me, I can explain that. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The initial draft of (a)(1) required a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

provided that the person be a first assistant to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer.  And (b)(1) read as it does. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

When Congress -- Congress changed that to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow the appointment of officers who were not -- who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were -- after the officer dies, and so they changed it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to first assistant to the office.  The significance of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is that somebody could be appointed first assistant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even after the vacancy arose.  That was a very big 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

change.  If Your Honor looks at page 19A of the -- of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Appendix to the petition where the bill is set out, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the original bill, the way the bill read, it -- it put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the restriction only on the person who was serving at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

the time of the vacancy.  So if the -- if Congress had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left (b)(1) the way it was, it would have created a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

odd situation where at the current serving first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistant would be subject to (b)(1), and the after put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in, that someone put in later, was not subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

(b)(1). 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

So what did Congress do?  Congress changed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it so that the limitation applied to all first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistants.  But then it added "notwithstanding" (a)(1), 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and that is the critical thing.  So in other words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress did it, made this change to (b)(1), precisely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to deal with the after-appointed first assistants, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then it added the "notwithstanding" clause to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding only (a)(1).  And so it does seem to me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor, that it was a very important change. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think if Your Honor chases -- chases 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

through the legislative history and looks at 19A and way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the provision works, you will see that that was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason -- that that was the reason for the change. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If you -- if your -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your interpretation is the correct one, what is your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer to the horrible that appears in the -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's brief at 33 to 34?  They say if you read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute the way the government does, then you could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have somebody in there who has never been read --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

approved by Congress, by the Senate.  You could have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone there upwards of, they calculate, 630 days. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, the 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

response to that is there's no doubt that someone can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serve for that length of time, and that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood that.  That's the consequence of the time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits in the Vacancies Act. 

 

 

 

 

            

What Respondents are arguing is that should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only be true for first assistants but should not be true 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for -- for individuals that the President appoints 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under -- designates under (a)(2) and (a)(3).  And it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that irrationality that we think the statute -- it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that difference that we think the statute just doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

justify. 

15 

            

So just to be clear:  It is -- it is crystal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

clear under both Respondent's view and our view that an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual can serve for a very long period of time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's the consequence of the -- of the 210-day --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

210-day period and the various ways you can extend it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

The question before you, though, is whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

it makes sense that Congress decided only the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistants could do that.  But there are real reasons to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt that.  (A)(2) and (a)(3) were put in precisely to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give the President himself -- and it could only be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President; it's not delegable -- the chance to choose a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

superior -- a superior officer, a better -- a better 

   

   

   

 

 

 

placed, the more talented officer than the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistant.  It seems very odd in that situation to say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the 1100-day scale, or however many days, could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only served by the first assistant but not by someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chosen by the President for that very reason under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(2) and (a)(3). 

 

 

            

If I could reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Dvoretzky. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

            

Four features of the FVRA's text and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafting history compel our interpretation. 

 

 

 

 

            

First, Congress used the broad terms "a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person" and "this section." 

 

 

 

            

Second, "notwithstanding" is a term of 

   

 

 

 

expansion.  It does not contract the broad meaning of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"person" and "section." 

 

 

            

Third, the government's interpretation makes 

 

 

 

 

Subsection (b)(2) superfluous in multiple ways. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And fourth, at the time that Congress added 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

(b)(2), it deleted language from the initial draft of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)(1) that expressly limited the provision to first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistants.  The revised language encompasses all acting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

officers. 

5 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I agree that "person" 

    

   

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

and "section" are very strong arguments for you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Suppose what the statute said is "notwithstanding (a)(1) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and (a)(2)"?  And what -- what would then be your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument with respect to whether or not it affected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

(a)(3)? 

11 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  I still think in that 

    

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

circumstance that "person" and "section" would apply to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(3).  But the reason that that would be a different 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case is that there is no meaningful distinction between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(2) and (a)(3) and the role that they play in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

statute. 

17 

            

There is a meaningful distinction between 

   

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

(a)(1) on the one hand and (a)(2) and (a)(3) on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other hand.  And it makes sense because of that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction that Congress would single out just (a)(1). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't get that, 

    

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Mr. Dvoretzky.  And maybe this follows the government's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

line of thought, but, you know, I've been -- the (a)(1) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, "The first assistant shall be the acting officer." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then (b)(1) says, no, she may not be.  Right?  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27 

(a)(2) and (a)(3) doesn't use the words "shall," but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, the President may appoint any of these people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then (b) comes along and says, no, the President 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't appoint some subset of them. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

So the basic conflict seems to me to be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

same in both cases, which is that the second clause says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not so fast, not with respect to those people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Justice Kagan, the 

  

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

difference is that (a)(1) is a self-executing provision. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

It automatically places the first assistant into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacant office, and (b)(1) then takes the person out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(A)(2) and (a)(3) are grants of discretion that has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be understood side by side with --

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But those grants of 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

discretion are very broad, and then (b)(1) again takes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the person out, takes the person out of the grant of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion, just as it takes the person out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self-executing provision before them. 

 

 

 

19 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  They -- they are broad only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

if read in isolation, but they can't be read in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isolation as a statutory matter.  And oftentimes, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

President doesn't read them in isolation as a practical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

matter. 

24 

            

In other words, there is no way to avoid the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

conflict created between (a)(1) and (b)(1) because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

28 

1 

(a)(1) puts the person in the job and (b)(1) takes them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

out. 

3 

            

If the President, however, simply reads 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

(a)(2) and (a)(3) together with (b)(1), then he knows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the limitations are on his discretion, and he can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoid that ripping out.  It's that ripping out of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nominee from acting service that creates a particularly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

stark conflict that Congress sought to address through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the "notwithstanding" (a)(1) clause. 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I have to say, I find it a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

little bit odd to think of this drafter thinking of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of distinction you're making.  Say, well, this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self-executing and this is not self-executing.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

only a broad grant of discretion.  And then not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

realizing that just by virtue of saying "notwithstanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1)," the statute creates -- raises this question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about, well, you've said (a)(1) but not (a)(2) or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(3).  What does that mean? 

  

 

 

 

              

I mean, that seems just like a very strange 

   

 

 

 

 

 

drafter to me, somebody who is so in the weeds that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't figure out that pretty obvious objection to what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

they're doing. 

 

23 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, perhaps one way to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

think of it, and this goes back to your first question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the argument, what if you had a statute that didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

have any "notwithstanding" clause at all at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning of (b)(1)?  In that situation it would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear that "person" and "section" would make (b)(1) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable to (a)(2) and (a)(3). 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

There would be a question in that situation, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

though, whether (b)(1) also applied to (a)(1), first of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all, because of the starkness of the conflict between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1) and (b)(1), and second of all, the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argues that the general versus specific canon would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply there, but it wouldn't necessarily because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general versus specific canon is typically invoked in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order to avoid superfluity where you have one general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision and a specific provision that would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

meaningless if not read as an exception to the general. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

Here, however, in -- in the hypothetical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

statute without the "notwithstanding" clause, you 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't have superfluity concern because (b)(1) would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply to (a)(2) and (a)(3).  And so you'd be left with a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular question, not about (2) and (3), but just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about (1).  And so it makes sense that Congress singled 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out (1) because of the particular role that it's playing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the statute. 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what about (c)(1)? 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

Isn't, under your reading, it -- it will never be in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

effect? 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. DVORETZKY:  No.  No, Your Honor.  First 

  

  

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

of all, the officials under (c)(1) are not acting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officials.  They are receiving term extensions.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

language of (c)(1) talks about those individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuing to serve in the office. 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

(a)(1) through (3) all talk about performing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

the functions and duties of the office temporarily in an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting capacity.  The legislative history likewise talks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about three categories of acting officials, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistently talks about (a)(1), (2), and (3).  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)(1) is just functioning separately.  That's just a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

different thing. 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why aren't (a)(2) and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

(a)(3) functioning separately from (a)(1)?  If -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)(1) can function separately, and that was the thought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the drafters, why don't we carry it to its logical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion?  (a)(1) is separate from -- they are written 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost identically.  "The Presidents may direct," "may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

appoint," may -- they are all sort of exceptions to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

rule. 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  The reason that (c)(1) 

  

 

 

 

 

functions separately is that it describes the work that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the official is doing in a different way.  It describes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuing to serve in the office.  (a)(1) through 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(3) all describe the work that the official is doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

in the same parallel way, performing the functions and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duties of the office temporarily in an acting capacity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's why the three categories of acting officials are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1) to (a)(3), but (c), by its text, is just doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1

something different.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why -- why -- the thing --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd like to go back to the Solicitor General's last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, and that's where I'm having -- I have a puzzle. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd like to hear what you have to say. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, for the purposes of this question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm assuming all the text, which sounds to me, if a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person came from Mars, that's what he would expect a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal argument to be like. 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the number's all over had the place, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I will also assume that for every chef salad there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a countervailing strawberry shortcake; all right? 

   

 

 

 

 

So -- so everything balances out.  Assume. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, it seems to me that this exception here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is saying this.  We have the Secretary of the Treasury. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He has five assistants.  Each is a presidential 

   

  

 

 

 

 

appointee.  One day, secretary -- Assistant Secretary of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Treasury number two dies, and now the President can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fill that role with any one of three people on an acting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis:  His first assistant, some other assistant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

secretary or deputy in the treasury department, or a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

Have I got it right so far? 

   

 

 

 

 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm using examples.  All 

  

  

 

 

 

Now, what this statute as you read it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

GS-18. 

2 

            

3 

            

4 

            

5 

right. 

6 

            

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

seem to say, if you appoint whichever one you choose, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put any one of those three people in, go ahead, do it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now, if you nominate those, one of those three to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presidential position roughly, they are out.  All of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them are out.  Oh, wait.  There's one exception.  The 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

first assistant is not out if he served for 90 days as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

first assistant. 

 

14 

            

15 

            

16 

            

Have I got the statute right? 

   

 

 

 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I would just wonder, 

    

  

 

 

 

17 

were I from Mars, what's the point of such a statute? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

(Laughter.) 

19 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is it you're perfectly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

willing to have stay there and do the acting job the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first assistant, if he served 90 days before, but you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not willing to have served the acting job this guy who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a GS-18 in the same department, or the person who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was an assistant secretary of the Treasury, number two. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why?  I can't think of an answer given your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

1 

interpretation. 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

              

I can think of an answer given their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation.  I say what they were worried about on 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

their interpretation were our friends number two and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number three, the GS-18 and the Assistant Secretary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number two.  They can continue to serve, on their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

interpretation. 

8 

            

Hey, why did they do this?  The name of that

17

20

22 

23 

24 

25 

explanation is called Bill Lann Lee.  Because that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the problem that gave rise to the statute, and on their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation they passed some words that solved that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  So there we are. 

  

 

 

 

              

I get an explanation for his, assuming that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you like purposes more than you like numbers.  I get an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explanation on his, and I don't get an explanation on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yours.  So that's what I would like you to respond to. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  So I'd like to respond, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

first of all, to why it makes sense to treat first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistants differently, and second of all, to Bill Lann 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lee and how that is relevant to the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The legislative history explains in multiple 

 

 

 

 

 

places that first assistants are particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

well-suited to be the acting official because they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent continuity and regularity in the office. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We know from (b)(1) that Congress was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

concerned with at least some acting service by nominees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the reason that it created an exception for first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistants, even as nominees, is that they are the least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely to represent change in the agency.  It's just the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deputy being pushed up one spot, and that's continuity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

and regularity. 

 

7 

            

On the other hand, particularly when 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

Congress added for the first time in the FVRA this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category of GS-15s, potentially thousands of employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within an agency, there's no accountability there to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress and there are potentially much greater concerns 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about those individuals serving as acting officials 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while the nominee.  The facts of this case illustrate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

that concern. 

 

15 

            

The President designated Mr. Solomon to 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

serve as the acting general counsel.  Some months later 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he nominated Mr. Solomon.  Perhaps emboldened by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nomination, Mr. Solomon then took some very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversial actions that led the Senate promptly to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make clear to the President that this individual was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be confirmed. 

 

 

 

22 

            

Rather than at that point finding a new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

nominee, the President allowed Mr. Solomon to continue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serving even -- even after the nomination had been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

returned by the Senate, waited four months before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

2 

3 

renominating the same individual, and then only a few 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

months later after that, finally came up with a nominee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Senate approved. 

 

 

 

4 

            

In the meantime, Mr. Solomon served, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

though the Senate quite clearly did not consent to him, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

served in the job for -- for over three years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

And so it is that kind of concern about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

GS-15s that's fundamentally different from a first 

   

 

 

 

 

assistant who represents continuity and regularity in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

the office. 

 

11 

12

19 

20

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If -- if Mr. Solomon had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been confirmed, you -- you say that that would be all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, even -- even with the erroneous nomination of him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while he was acting. 

 

 

 

            

But -- so he's confirmed for the permanent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office.  Yet, under your reading, everything that he did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while he was acting is invalidated; is that right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, it's not necessarily 

  

 

 

 

 

invalidated.  It's subject to the defenses that the D.C. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit identified at the end of its opinion, but under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our reading of the statute, when he was nominated, he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed to step aside and he couldn't serve as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permanent official until the Senate confirmed him. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So his confirmation would 

  

 

 

 

 

be irrelevant to what happens to what was done prior to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

36 

1 

the confirmation?

MR. DVORETZKY:  That's right.  His 

  

  

 

 

3 

4 

5 

confirmation does not in effect ratify the actions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he took when, in our view, he was improperly serving as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an acting official. 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If -- there's one other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

peculiarity of this.  This is why I mentioned the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

90 days, but a first assistant who is also what they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call a PAS, presidentially-appointed, 

   

 

Senatorial-confirmed, such a first assistant without any 

   

 

 

 

 

90 days can simultaneously be acting; and a nominee. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But why couldn't the people in category two, that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people who are presidentially-appointed, 

 

 

 

Senatorially-confirmed in other agencies, why wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

the same -- why wouldn't they be treated the same way if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the stress is on having someone that the Senate wants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

approved? 

18 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Because Senate confirmation 

  

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

for one position is not fungible with Senate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirmation for another.  When you're talking about a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Senate-confirmed first assistant, that again is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination of Senate confirmation and somebody who's in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a first assistant position representing continuity and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regularity in the position. 

 

 

 

25 

            

Somebody who is confirmed for a completely 

   

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

37 

unrelated Senate position is much more of an end-run 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around the Senate's advice-and-consent role for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacant office, and the legislative history includes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples -- includes discussion of Congress' concern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about PAS officials who are being moved around from one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position to the other.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- you want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

respond to Justice Breyer's point about Mr. Lee? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  I do want to get back to the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

point about Mr. Lee. 

 

 

 

11 

            

The concern about Mr. Lee was not just that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

he was brought in from the outside at the last minute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is what the government emphasizes.  If that were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the concern, Congress could have imposed a restriction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

on short-serving first assistants as acting officials. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

Instead, what Congress imposed was a 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

restriction on acting officials -- acting officials who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are also the nominee, and there's no reason to think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress' concern about nominees serving as acting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officials was limited just to first assistants.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

text doesn't support that concern, and as the example of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Solomon's own service illustrates, in practice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress can have very serious concerns about people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside of the -- the first assistant category serving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the acting official while also the nominees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

            

And -- and that's a vivid illustration of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

the example in our brief of somebody who can serve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost an entire presidential -- presidential term as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the permanent -- as the acting official, even though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has made clear that the individual is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody that -- that the Senate will consent to as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

permanent nominee. 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask Mr. Dvoretzky 

   

  

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

about the post-enactment history?  Because, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're generally reluctant to demand that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objects to things. 

 

 

            

But on the other hand, the -- the history 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here is so strong.  All of these appointments, 100-plus 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of them, in a time when Congress and the President -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, this is -- this has been a time where there's been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a lot of partisan bickering over appointments, and you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would think that in that context, if anybody had thought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this statute could be read differently, we would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have heard about it, and yet we hear absolutely nothing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So how do you explain that? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Several points in response 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

to that. 

 

23 

24 

25 

            

First, just identifying these FVRA 

 

 

 

 

violations is not an easy thing to do.  It took the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government months of study to do it, and it's an arcane 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

1 

technical issue. 

 

2 

            

Second of all, even if Congress had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

identified the violations, what was it supposed to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about them?  If the nominee is somebody that the Senate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants to approve, there's no point in rejecting them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on their past improper service.  That's not what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FVRA requires.  And doing so would only prolong the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacancy with another acting official that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

hadn't approved. 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

            

If Congress doesn't approve of the nominee, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

odds are it has a reason for doing so that is much more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a headline issue than the FVRA.  The FVRA does not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make the front page of the Washington Post.  It's other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

objections. 

15 

16 

17 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't know.  Wouldn't you 

    

  

 

 

 

say something like I don't like this nominee, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyway, it's illegal for the President to make this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

nomination? 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  You might add that, but it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be a gratuitous addition to what is really the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental concern with the nominee. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Seems like it gives it some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

real extra oomph, right? 

 

 

 

24 

            

(Laughter.) 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's not just -- it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

just a matter of my preferences versus the government's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

preferences.  Now the President's preference is illegal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It's off the board.  Congress has said he can't do it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Who wouldn't say that in that circumstance? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Somebody who then was going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

to be pressed and had to explain the technicalities of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why the appointment was illegal. 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

(Laughter.) 

9 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You -- you have been -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

I understand -- you've been concerned about instances in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which there is controversy over appointment.  But there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are thousands of jobs in the government where they have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to run departments where there's no controversy, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

know. 

15 

            

And people leave, or they die, or something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

happens; there's a vacancy.  And the main institutional 

   

  

 

 

 

 

imperative is keep the job being done.  Keep the office 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working.  So an obvious person is to say Mr. First 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Assistant, you carry on.  Okay?  And maybe you bring in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody from next door.  And maybe you look for a GS-18 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the department.  You know, the guy next door has a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presidential appointment.  So you put him in the job. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's all.  No problem. 

  

 

 

24 

            

And why all of a sudden Congress would, in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

these thousands of instances where there's no problem, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

or hundreds anyway, Congress would say, if you decide to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appoint him permanently, you have to take him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately out of the acting position, and there's more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disruption in the department.  Why would anyone want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

do that? 

 

6 

            

Now, I could see they might want to do it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

with the first assistant where it's a runaround, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they have an idea that it's a runaround when he hasn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

served as first assistant for more than 90 days.  Then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you might say, well, why him?  Maybe they were just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to get this controversial guy in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

In other words, as -- as an administrator in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

noncontroversial matters, I can understand their 

   

 

 

 

interpretation more easily.  But you will tell me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm wrong because? 

 

 

16 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  The -- the first assistant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

restriction in (b)(1) reflects that Congress clearly was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about some acting officials who are also the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permanent nominee.  Congress saw that as a particular 

   

  

 

 

 

 

affront to its advice and consent role, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemplifies a lot of the problems that led to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enactment of the FVRA in which the Presidents --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Presidents of both parties were putting in their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate choice for a position long term without Senate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

confirmation. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

1 

            

There's no reason to think that that concern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

is limited only to first assistants coming in from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside.  Those concerns are equally applicable to any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the thousands of GS-15 employee within an agency. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it's not surprising that, in the same set of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revisions when Congress added (a)(3), it made -- made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those GS-15s eligible to serve, that it also thought, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, perhaps this has the potential for mischief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Perhaps this has the potential to allow just as much of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an end -- of a runaround of our advice-and-consent role 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the first assistants. 

 

 

 

12 

            

Likewise, with respect to the PAS officials, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

it's true that PAS officials had previously been able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serve as both permanent nominees and acting officials, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but the FVRA rethought this entire area of vacancies. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it's not surprising that, while -- while Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was also prohibiting GS-15s, this new category from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serving as acting officials while nominees, that it also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

swept in the (a)(2)s as well. 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

There's also a practical point about how 

   

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

this actually operates.  Much of the time, over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 percent of the time, the President nominates and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designates, either at the same time, or -- or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President nominates first and designates second after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparently becoming impatient with the confirmation 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

43

process. 

2 

            

And so, Justice Breyer, your hypothetical --

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

your hypothetical was asking why does it make sense to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take the official out of the job once they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nominated?  Often that doesn't even happen.  Often the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

President is nominating the person and then making them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the acting official later.  So you're not taking the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person out of the job. 

 

 

 

 

            

Moreover, our interpretation of the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

removes one person from the pool of acting officials. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There -- there is not -- this is not a situation where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are taking out the thousands of GS-15s or PAS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officials.  There are lots of people available to serve. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're taking out the one person that reflects the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biggest affront to Congress' advice-and-consent role if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed to serve while also nominating. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And defeating the 

  

 

 

 

efficient running of the department at the same time, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because if the person has been running the department, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now you're going to put it through a second dislocation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of having that person removed and somebody else step in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Again, in practice, over a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

third of the time, that doesn't happen.  It's also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that the --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It hasn't happened 

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

because no one's read it the way you have and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalidated that person's actions so far. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, no.  What I mean is if 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

you look at the government's chart, a third of the time, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if you applied our interpretation, it would not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result in the nominee being taken out of acting service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the nominee isn't even put into acting service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until later or at the same time as the nomination. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

            

Moreover, the President --

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Senate is taking a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

long time to confirm, even when they're not objecting. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  So in -- in this particular 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, after Mr. Solomon had served for some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-and-a-half years, when the President put up a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permanent nominee, the Senate confirmed him in a matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of months.  And so the Senate doesn't always take a long 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

time. 

18 

            

Moreover, the Senate has confirmed 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

approximately 85 percent of PAS officials during the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current President's administration.  And so the Senate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is confirming these officials.  What the FVRA requires 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the official not do the job without Senate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirmation because that would recreate the very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems that the FVRA was intended to combat in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

first place.

or Senate-confirmed first assistants, but that makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy sense because of the continuity and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regularity that they bring to the job. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

I'd like to address the -- the question that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

was raised earlier about the consequences of ruling in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our favor retroactively in terms of past decisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

No court has considered the "no force and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

effect" language.  But what I can tell you is that the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government has been shoring up a defense that would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tied to the language in 3348 about the functions and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duties of a particular office.  The only actions that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have no force and effect are those that are taken in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performance of a function and duty of a vacant office. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

In response to a Senate inquiry about a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

deputy EPA administrator who had been serving for two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, the EPA took the position that that individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had not taken any actions whatsoever that were actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tied to the functions or duties of the vacant office. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

On the GAO website, there are approximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

two dozen reports of time violations over the years of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FVRA.  And the GAO reports that agencies had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reported to it that none of those two dozen individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who served in violation of the FVRA took any actions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that were tied to the functions and duties of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

3 

office.  And so the government is already shoring up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments for why the "no force and effect" language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not undo actions taken by these improperly pointed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

officials. 

5 

            

With respect to the GAO, the -- the Acting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

Solicitor General referred to the GAO as a watchdog --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The way you described that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

you sound a bit skeptical of those defenses. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

(Laughter.) 

10 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, skeptical only in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

sense that they're not at issue in this case, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't been litigated.  But if it were, if ruling in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our favor were going to lead the sky to fall, you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expect the government to -- to tell you that.  And not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only has the government not told you that, but the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the surrounding context shows that the government thinks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it has pretty good arguments for why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you say that you can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

bring those cases, too? 

 

 

 

20 

            

21 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  I'm sorry? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Telling us -- so that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

you can bring those cases, too, or for other people to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring them?  They're in a real catch-22 situation. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  The fact is, though, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

their burden to show the consequences of their actions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

And the government's track record on this shows just the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposite; shows that these officials supposedly are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing anything that would actually be invalidated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So is Mr. Solomon's case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

atypical, the general counsel to the NLRB? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. DVORETZKY:  Well, it's atypical in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

sense that it is, under 3348(e), the "no force and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect" language doesn't apply to the general counsel of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the NLRB.  It's -- the -- his actions are only voidable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than void, and that's why the D.C. Circuit looked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the harmless error doctrine and the de facto officer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine as additional defenses. 

 

 

 

13 

            

But even in a case where the "no force and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

effect" language did apply, again on the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory, challengers would have to show that the actions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were -- that the actions that were taken were ones that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could only have been taken by an individual in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacant office.  And the government doesn't believe that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that happens very much. 

 

 

 

20 

            

With respect to the cases that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

government cites for the first time in its reply brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

none of those are on point.  The Preseault case, the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the operative language there was "under this act." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what made clear that the particular provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there applied only to the statute at issue and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

separately to the Tucker Act.

The Mount Vernon case out of the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3

7 

Circuit, interpreting the "notwithstanding" clause --

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the language in the "notwithstanding" clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there to apply to all of (a) would have created 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

superfluity which is not the case here.  To the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary, here the government's interpretation makes 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

(b)(2) superfluous. 

 

9 

            

Congress specifically added (b)(2) when it 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

expanded (b)(1) to apply to more than just first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistants, and if (b) -- if (b)(1) did not apply to all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of (a) in the first place, there would be no need under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)(2) to create an exception for Senate-confirmed first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistants.  Those Senate-confirmed individuals could 

  

 

 

 

serve under (a)(2), anyway.  So the only reason that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress would have had to add that (b)(2) was because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)(1), pursuant to these -- the changes to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory language otherwise applied to all of (a). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

The government argues in its reply brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

that (b)(2) serves the -- serves a purpose because it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saves the President from having to designate someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under (b)(2).  That's not a plausible account that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Congress would have gone to all the trouble of adding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)(2) solely to achieve that goal. 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

And -- and, again, I would return to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

core language here, which is "person" and "section." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those are broad inclusive terms.  If Congress had meant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to accomplish what the government argues that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute is accomplishing --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wasn't that the argument, 

  

 

 

 

 

is that language, "person" and "this section," were in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prior bill, where it -- it applied only to first --

10 

            

11 

            

What do you call it? 

 

 

 

 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Only to first assistants. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- first assistants? 

  

 

 

 

MR. DVORETZKY:  Because -- because the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

that's true, but the language in the prior bill had an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

old version of (b)(1) -- this is, again, at 19A of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cert petition -- that made clear that the only persons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we were talking about were persons who are serving as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first assistants.  There was immediate qualifying 

  

 

 

 

 

language that made clear and narrowed what "person" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

meant. 

19 

            

Congress specifically deleted that language 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

and it added a new (b)(2) that would be unnecessary if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)(1) applied only -- if (a)(1) applied -- I'm sorry --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if (b)(1) applied only to (a)(1). 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

If Congress had simply meant to achieve in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

the draft what the government ascribes to it, the edits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have been much simpler.  It could have simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

changed 180 days to 90 days in order to shorten the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the required period of acting service, and it could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

edited the existing (b)(1) to say, such person serves in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the position of first assistant to the office of such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer.  It made much broader changes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

Justice.  I'd like to make a number of points. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

First, Justice Kagan, your account of what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

would have happened in Congress had there been any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason to believe there was a problem with the Executive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was doing is exactly right, and we know that because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after the D.C. Circuit ruled, in fact, what you said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would happen is what happened. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

Senators started raising objections to the 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

President's nominees, arguing that they were serving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegally.  That's what happened in the years prior to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Act, and that's what happened as soon as the D.C. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit ruled.  That in-between period, I submit, is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

23 

very significant. 

 

24 

            

Justice Sotomayor, you raised Section 

 

 

 

 

25 

(c)(1).  I think you're exactly right.  What their 

    

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

reading of the statute does is read the notwithstanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1) to mean notwithstanding (a)(1) -- to mean that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies to (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3), but not (c)(1). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that's a very odd thing to express with the term 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

"notwithstanding (a)(1)." 

 

6 

            

Justice Breyer, you were asking about why it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

would make sense to treat the (a)(2) and (a)(3) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently, and I think you're exactly right.  It does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

not. 

10 

            

What Respondent said was there needs to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

accountability to Congress.  Congress put in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

accountability.  It said that these individuals under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(2) and (a)(3) need to be personally designated by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the President.  It cannot be delegated.  That is the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of responsibility that when Congress puts that in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the President, this -- it's not surprising then that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those folks should be able to serve while they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nominated because they have gotten not only a Senate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirmation or long-standing agency service, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal approval of the President. 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

Counsel tried to distinguish the cases that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

we raised.  I think they are worth raising because it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does change, I think, the way this -- this Court has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read the "notwithstanding" clause the way we say it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Preseault is a perfect example.  It said, 

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

52 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

notwithstanding this Act, but Congress then didn't read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the remainder of clause to provide -- to apply to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole code.  It limited to the Act, which was what was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specified in the "notwithstanding" clause.  We think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that that's what this Court should do here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

And then finally I'd like to address this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

the treatment of PAS officers, which I think is really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important.  What Respondent said was, oh, Congress swept 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in (a)(2) as well.  With that blithe assertion, he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributes to Congress the intent to overturn 130 years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of practice that had raised no complaint.  There is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence anywhere in the congressional record that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was concerned about Senate-confirmed officials 

 

 

 

 

 

also -- who were also nominated, and it was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reflected in the initial draft.  The idea that Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blithely did that and swept in (a)(2), I think is just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not supported by the record. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

And I'm sorry.  One more point.  One final 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

point.  Justice Ginsburg, I think you're exactly right 

   

  

 

 

 

 

on the person/section point, which Justice Kennedy also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had raised.  That language was in the prior bill.  There 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is no doubt that the provision it was in applied --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied in addition to only -- applied only to first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistants.  And our point is that "person" and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"section," of course it's broad.  But all that does is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

53 

1 

set up the conflict.  Congress understood that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

So how did it resolve the conflict?  Not in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

the most natural way under -- that Respondent would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court understand, by saying, notwithstanding 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection (a), which would have taken out all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  Instead it said, notwithstanding 

  

 

 

 

Subsection (a)(1).  And the idea that Congress did that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there was no conflict between (a)(2) and (a)(3) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and (b)(1) just doesn't hold water. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Finally, on that point -- I know that's my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

third finally, and I apologize, Your Honor.  But the --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it does seem that the notwithstanding (a)(1) doesn't do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any work in their reading.  If Congress had just said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a)(1), and then had had (b)(1) without the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"notwithstanding" clause, this Court would have 

 

 

 

 

 

understood (b)(1) to be a limitation on (a)(1)'s 

   

 

 

 

 

 

authority without a doubt.  And so what "notwithstanding 

   

  

 

 

 

 

(a)(1)" does is specify the order of operations, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specify the provision that is overridden.  And this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court should give that -- that congressional decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

respect. 

22 

            

Thank you. 

 

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company
