CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this  morning  in  Case  14­723,  Montanile  v.  The  Board  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Trustees  of  the  National  Elevator  Industry  Health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Benefit  Plan. 

 

            

Mr.  Stris. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  PETER  K.  STRIS 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  this  ERISA  case,  a  fiduciary  has  sued  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiary  to  establish  and  enforce  an  equitable  lien 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  agreement. 

 

            

As  this  Court  has  repeatedly  acknowledged, 

 

 

 

 

 

an  equitable  lien  is  enforceable  only  against  specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  and  its  traceable  product  in  the  defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possession. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Stris,  there's  some 

  

 

 

 

 

fuzziness  about  the  facts  in  this  case,  and  maybe  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outset  you  can  clarify  them. 

 

 

 

 

            

Different  figures  are  given  about  how  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  from  this  settlement  was  actually  delivered  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  client.  And  also,  what  did  your  client  do  with  it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Did  he  put  it  with  his  general  assets,  or  did  he  keep  it

in  a  separate  fund? 

   

 

            

questions. 

            

            

Maybe  you  can  start  by  answering  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  STRIS:  I  think  I  can,  Justice  Ginsburg. 

    

   

 

 

 

So  I  ­­ I  want  to  start  with  what's  in  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  and  then  I  want  to  add  some  color  that  I  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  provide  context. 

 

 

            

So  as  far  as  what's  in  the  record,  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  genuine  issue  of  ­­ of  material  fact  on  how  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissipation  there  was.  One  thing  that's  clear  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  is  that  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Before  we  get  to 

  

 

 

 

 

dissipation,  how  much  did  he  receive? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Yes.  So  that's  clear,  he 

  

  

 

 

 

 

received  over  time,  after  all  expenses  were  out,  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$200,000. 

            

            

record. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  200. 

  

 

MR.  STRIS:  I  think  that's  clear  from  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

What's  also  clear  procedurally  ­­ and  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  important,  and  this  is  Page  64  of  the  Joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix  ­­ is  that  he  took  the  position  in  opposing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summary  judgment  that  he  has  very  little  of  the  money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remaining,  and  he  cited  a  declaration  and  an  attached 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sheet  that  I  admit  are  confusing.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  ­­ and  this  $200,000, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

did  he  put  it  in  a  general  account  or  was  it  set  aside 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  specific  account? 

   

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  It  is  nothing  in  the  record  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicate  that,  but  I  think  as  far  as  the  rules  work,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  matter  because  the  rules  for  equitable  lien  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement,  the  tracing  rules,  are  actually  very  robust, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan.  And  so  as  equity  evolved,  you  cannot 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissipate  money  by  putting  it  in  its  own  account  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spending  it.  Something  called  the  "lowest  intermediate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

balance  rule"  developed  to  prevent  against  precisely  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  mischief  that  we  would  reasonably  worry  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  Mr.  Stris,  it  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

make  a  difference,  because  if  he  just  put  it,  say,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  bank  account  where  he  had  all  of  his  other  money, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  how  ­­ how  could  we  say  that  he  spent  all  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds  on  childcare  and  living  expenses?  If  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  mixed  pot,  how  can  we  say,  oh,  yes,  this  came  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  settlement  and  not  from  his  general  funds? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  It's  a  very  fair  question, 

   

  

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg.  And  there  ­­ there  are  settled 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tracing  rules  at  equity,  and  it  worked  as  follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  took  money  and  it  was  cash  and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  it  in  a  bank  account,  what  was  presumed  was  that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless  your  total  cash  assets  dipped  below  the  amount

that  you  got,  that  the  spending  that  you  did  was  not  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  that,  the  creditor's  rights  were  not  impaired. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

So  the  only  way  we  would  prevail  on 

 

 

 

 

 

remand  ­­ I  want  to  be  clear  about  the  modesty  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  that  we're  taking  here.  The  only  way  we  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevail  on  remand  is  if  he  got  the  money  and  he  spent  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down  ­­ all  of  his  money,  not  just  the  settlement  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  the  cash  that  he  had  ­­ down  below  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  of  the  settlement. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

That's  why  this  is  very  important. 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  what  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  ­­ I  don't 

   

   

  

 

 

know  if  it's  the  right  Latin  phrase  or  ­­ "pro  tanto"  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something.  I  mean,  you  would  lose  ­­ it  ­­ it  ­­ it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  to  spend  it  all  the  way  down.  Whatever  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left  would  be  subject  to  tracing. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Yes,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

correct.  But  the  point  I  was  trying  to  make  is,  there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  big  difference  between  the  way  equity  worked,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  to  have  a  sensible  rule  below  its  intermediate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance,  and  what  I  view  as  the  extreme  swollen  asset 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory,  that  never  was  applied  at  equity,  that  my  friend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Katyal  is  advocating. 

 

 

 

            

Under  the  swollen  asset  theory,  if  you  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  money  in  the  future,  if  you  spend  below  the  lowest

intermediate  balance  but  then  you  start  earning  income, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  can  come  and  garnish  your  wages.  So  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  that  I'm  making  here  is  that  the  equity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lien­by­agreement  remedy  is  actually  far  more  robust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  one  would  think  if  one  read  the  briefs  of  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side. 

            

agreement. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Equitable  lien  by 

  

 

 

 

Was  there  an  agreement  ­­ do  you  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  an  agreement  here  because  of  the  Plan? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  I  think  the  ­­ that  issue,  we've 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

lost.  So  I  mean,  you  know  ­­ I  think  that's  another 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

important  point,  Justice  Kennedy.  We  hear  a  lot  about  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

promise­breaking  by  beneficiaries.  And  that  happens. 

  

 

 

 

 

And  those  are  legitimate  concerns.  But  from  where  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sitting,  I  see  a  lot  of  cases  where  there's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

promise­breaking  by  fiduciaries,  where  they  take  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reimbursement  provision  that's  preempted  in  an  insured 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  and  then  try  and  enforce  it,  or  where  they  try  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  a  provision  that  doesn't  apply  by  its  own  terms. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  when  we're  thinking  from  the  perspective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of,  is  this  a  sensible  rule  that  is  consistent  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broad  purposes  of  ERISA,  I  think  it  very  much  is  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  take  the  ability  of  fiduciaries  to  reach  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  assets  of  participants  ­­

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Just  as  a  background 

   

  

 

 

matter,  when  we  left,  as  I  understand,  Great  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Great­West,  we  left  ­­ left  the  issue  open.  If  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiary  receives  a  check  that  by  mistake  is  three 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  more  than  it  should  be,  but  he  may  think  it's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bonus,  he  may  not  understand;  he  spends  it  all.  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  an  ­­ or  is  there  a  legal  action  that  the  Plan  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  to  recover  that  money? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Yes.  If  ­­ if  ­­ if  I  could  not 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  it  yes  or  no  for  a  minute,  and  I  promise  I'll 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  back  to  a  yes  or  no.  I  think  it's  a  very  important 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  because  this  happens  all  the  time  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pension  context. 

 

            

So  the  first  thing  I'm  going  to  tell  you  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  usually  when  that's  the  case,  there  is  an  error  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  part  of  the  Plan.  And  our  view  is  even  if  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  no  remedy,  that  it's  not  consistent  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  of  ERISA  or  the  way  historical  equity  practice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worked  to  make  the  participant  the  insurer  of  that  type 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  error. 

 

            

Now,  there  are  remedies,  and  here's  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  under  ERISA.  The  first  one  is  a  set­off 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy.  And  in  exception  II  C  of  the  Great­West 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

opinion,  you  ­­ this  Court  made  that  very  clear.

question  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Right.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  just  asking,  is  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  rule  in  the  courts  of  appeals,  or  in  the  ­­ in  the

this,  or  just  nothing  written  on  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Well,  in  the  context  of  ERISA, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  you  would  rule  on  this  case  would  determine  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue.  And  so  the  ­­ the  circuits  are  split.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  I  think  the  issue  is  very  important.  This  is  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  subrogation  matter.  This  is  an  issue  that  will 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  dramatic  impact  in  the  pension  and  the  disability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  as  well. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Counsel,  if  ­­ if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  prevail  here  and  are  representing  a  fund,  what  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  advise  them  to  do  so  they  don't  confront  this  result 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  future? 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Yes.  It's  ­­ it's  ­­ it's  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  question.  And  I  do  advise  funds.  And  I  think  that 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  simple  answer,  which  is  funds  that  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible  and  sophisticated  will  do  exactly  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've  always  done.  And  this  is  a  very  important 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

point:  Funds  are  always  worried  about  dissipation. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Health  insurers  have  always  been  worried,  and  here's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why.

The  ­­ the  mine  run  of  individuals  who  get  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

large  tort  settlement  ­­ this  is  just  a  reality  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life  ­­ they're  effectively  judgment­proof  except  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  tort  settlement.  So  the  remedy  doesn't  matter.  In 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  even  if  you  had  a  compensatory  damages 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  in  most  cases,  once  that  money  is  spent,  you've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  nothing.  So  what  health  insurers  and  plans  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  since  well  before  Great­West  and  has  continued  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  it  after  Great­West  is,  when  a  medical  claim  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submitted,  they  investigate  it  carefully.  And  they  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  flag  the  ones  where  there  is  likely  a  tort  ­­ there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  a  tort  recovery.  They  monitor  them  carefully, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

either  internally  or  through  outside  subrogation  agents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  they  act  promptly. 

 

 

 

            

And,  you  know,  I'm  not  going  to  say  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  dance,  because  we  see  a  lot  of  litigation  in  this  area 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  is  a  lot  of  money  passing  through,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans  have  faced  this  problem  since  before  Great­West. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These  policy  arguments  about  how  this  is  a  concern  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissipation  were  made  in  Great­West.  And  I  just  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

they're  ­­ they're  substantially  overrun. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  When  you  say  "they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

act  promptly,"  what  do  they  act  promptly  to  do?  And  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  always  the  case  that  they  can  act  promptly  enough? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  No.  The  ­­ you  know,  whatever

counsel  will  be  advising  the  recipient  to,  I  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose,  spend  it  right  away,  because  then  there  won't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  anything  left;  it  will  have  been  dissipated,  or  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  in  different  accounts,  or  ­­ or  commingle  it  with, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ you  know,  a  variety  of  things.  And  I'm  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wondering  if  the  solution  you're  advocating  is  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  life  a  lot  more  complicated  and  expensive  for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funds,  which  is,  of  course,  contrary  to  the  idea  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserving  the  assets. 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  I  ­­ I  understand  that  point. 

    

   

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  think  the  answer  is,  no,  not  in  any  meaningful

Well,  you  write  letters,  and  you  put  people  on  notice  of

necessary?  What  is  the  action  necessary?  Is  it  going 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  court  and  say,  enjoin  this  person  from  spending  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  that  money? 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Here's  what  plans  do,  and  here's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  plans  should  do:  They  ­­ they  write  a  letter.  The 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

minute  they  find  out  there's  a  settlement,  they  contact; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ask  to  be  paid.  If  they're  not  paid  immediately, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  say  put  this  money  in  escrow  because  we  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute.  If  the  person  says  no,  you  have  a  pretty  good 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea  that  you  might  have  a  problem,  and  you  go  into 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court. 

            

And  this  is  a  perfect  example  with  regard  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Montanile.  There  was  six  months  of  negotiation, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

several  letters  where  it  was  said,  hey,  if  ­­ if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  ­­ if  we  don't  decide  by  this  date,  we're  going  to

MR.  STRIS:  Well,  they  ­­ they  find  out  in

MR.  STRIS:  Well,  because  of  the  risks  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  talking  about  right  here  in  this  dialogue,  plans 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  very  sensitive  to  making  sure  that  the  minute  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  potential  subrogation  recovery,  they  write 

   

 

 

 

 

letters  to  everyone:  To  the  participant,  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

participant's  lawyer,  to  the  tortfeasor,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

tortfeasor's  lawyer,  the  insurer.  And  they  say  we  have

controversial  point.  There  are  some  people,  no  matter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  they're  sitting,  that  misbehave.  And  so  I  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

seen  participants  who  break  promises  absolutely.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

also,  I've  seen  plans  that  are  trying  to  enforce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  that  are  not  enforceable. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Would  it  basically, 

  

 

 

 

 

ignoring  the  impact  of  that  letter  by  a  beneficiary,  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  basis  for  the  sort  of  fraud  action  you  were  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  earlier? 

 

            

believe  ­­

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  No.  I  don't  think  so.  I 

    

  

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiary,  even  the  beneficiary's  counsel  gets  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letter  saying,  by  the  way,  we  have  a  lien  on  this,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  good  luck.  I  hope  you  recover  a  fair  amount.  But 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  do,  make  sure  you  put  it  in  a  separate  account. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Make  sure  you  notify  us. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  if  the  beneficiary  or  the  lawyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  ignores  that,  that's  not  a  basis  for  fraud? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  It  would  depend  on  the  facts  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case.  You  know,  I  ­­ merely  ignoring  the  letter, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  not  so  sure.  But  I  guess  I  keep  coming  back  to  the

to  ­­ to  demean  that  at  all,  but  this  has  always  been  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  And  because  of  the  fact  that  most  people  who

have  these  moneys  are  of  limited  means,  the  compensatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages  remedy  is  ­­ is  of  very  little  help. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

And  so  plans  came  to  this  Court  in 

 

 

 

 

Great­West  and  said,  oh,  well  this  is  going  to  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disaster  if  there's  a  present  possession  requirement. 

   

 

 

 

 

And  yet,  it  hasn't  proven  to  be  the  case  because  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  their  circumstances  act  promptly,  and  in  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances,  they're  able  to  protect  their  rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Stris  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  This  may  be  where  the  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

leads  us.  But  in  your  brief,  you  try  to  make  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  this  is  equitable  in  the  ordinary  sense  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  word.  And  I  don't  understand  that.  What  sense  does 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  this  make? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Okay.  So  that's  a  fair  point, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

but  I  ­­ I  would  put  it  a  little  bit  differently.  What 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

I  would  say  is  that  I  think  a  fair­minded  policymaker 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

could  certainly  pick  the  rule  that  we're  describing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  not  going  to  get  up  here  and  tell  you  that  it's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  that  I  would  pick,  but  I  think  a  fair­minded 

   

   

   

 

 

 

policymaker  could  ­­ and  particularly,  Justice  Alito, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  appreciate  that  it's  a  rule  that's  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  to  all  cases,  not  just  subrogation.  I  think  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  for  this  as  a  policy  matter  becomes  much  stronger 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  pension  context.

The  reason  I  make  that  point  is  I  know  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  running  up  against  this  counterintuitive  view  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  can  our  ­­ how  can  our  position,  even  if  it's  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  cases  say,  even  if  the  unbroken  line  of  history 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  this,  how  can  it  not  be  totally  at  odds  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  core  purpose  of  ERISA?  And  I  think  it's  not. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  may  not  be  the  better  policy  in  your  view,  but  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  one  that  is  consistent  with  the  spirit  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA,  and  so  the  decision  that  needs  to  be  made  is: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  is  this  line  of  cases  that  this  Court  has  decided? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  did  they  say? 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  repeatedly  from  Great­West  to 

   

 

 

 

 

Sereboff,  you  reiterated  in  CIGNA  that  in  nonfiduciary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  a  lien  is  not  equitable  relief  unless  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  property  in  the  defendant's  possession.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  adopted  a  historical  test. 

   

 

 

            

And  so  unless  applying  it  here  is  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  at  odds  with  the  purposes  of  ERISA,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  applying  that  test,  the  unbroken  line  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorities  tell  us  that  the  rule  is  you  can  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce  these  liens  against  specific  property  or  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traceable  product. 

 

            

            

If  I  could  reserve. 

   

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  GINGER  D.  ANDERS 

 

 

 

   

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                  

SUPPORTING  PETITIONER 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

If  I  could  just  start  with  Justice  Alito's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  what  ­­ what  sense  this  framework  makes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  limiting  available  relief  to  equitable  relief  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA,  Congress,  I  think,  contemplated  that  there 

   

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  be  a  remedy  for  plan  breaches  in  every  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  the  framework  this  Court  developed  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinguish  between  equitable  relief  on  the  one  hand  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  like  damages  that,  clearly,  Congress  didn't  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  include  in  the  relief  that  would  be  available. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  ­­ I  think  it's  been  true  since 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Great­West  when  this  Court  interpreted  equitable  relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  narrowly  that  a  beneficiary  will  have  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

incentive  in  some  cases  to  structure  a  settlement  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  to  avoid  paying  reimbursement  to  the  Plan.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  also  been  true  since  Great­West  that  because  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  plans  have  a  need  to  counter  those  incentives  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diligently  protecting  their  rights. 

 

 

 

            

And  so  I  think  the  way  that  the  Court  rules 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case  is  not  going  to  affect  the  existence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  incentives  on  the  part  of  beneficiaries  or  the

need  for  plans  to  be  diligent.  So  I  think  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  to  keep  in  mind  here  that  the  only  reason  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  comes  up  in  this  case  is  that  the  Plan  wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diligent,  that  the  Plan  waited  for  months  when  it  knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  had  a  reimbursement  claim,  and  that  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  disputed.  It  didn't  seek  an  injunction.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  file  suit. 

 

 

            

So  yes,  I  think  this  is  a  situation  that  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

unlike  the  mine  run  of  cases  where  we  see  that  plans 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  Great­West  have  developed  measures  that  they  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  in  order  to  protect  their  rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Ms.  Anders,  in 

  

 

 

 

Great­West,  the  government  filed  on  the  side  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plan.  What  led  the  government  to  shift  its  position? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  I  think  in  Great­West,  I  think 

    

   

 

 

 

we  were  taking  a  somewhat  broader  view  of  equitable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief  than  the  court  ended  up  adopting  in  that  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  as  we  get  here  today,  we've  taken  this  position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we  think  it  is  absolutely  the  logical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence  of  Great­West  and  Sereboff  together. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  you  took  your  position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  Great­West? 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  That's  absolutely  right.  In 

  

  

 

 

 

Great­West,  the  Court  said  that  when  the  funds  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  beneficiary's  possession,  the  Plan  cannot  enforce

an  equitable  lien  ­­ cannot  get  equitable  relief  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Plan.  And  it  relied  on  equitable  authorities  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  quoting,  "If  the  property  or  its  proceeds  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  dissipated  so  that  no  product  remains,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  may  not  enforce  a  constructive  trust  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

equitable"  ­­

 

            

            

thought  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Probably  what  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  thought  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  you  thought 

  

 

 

 

 

Great­West  adopted  a  ­­ a  narrower  understanding  of  what 

   

   

 

 

 

 

equitable  meant  in  this  context  than  you  thought  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate. 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  I  think  at  the  time  we  were 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing  for  a  broader  understanding.  But  as  we  ­­ as  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  here  today,  of  course,  nobody  has  ­­ has  argued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Great­West  or  Sereboff  should  be  overturned,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mertens,  for  that  matter.  And  so  we  think  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence  of  those  two  decisions  is  that  there  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  relief  in  a  case  in  which  the  Plan  participant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  dissipated  the  funds. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  would  you  ­­ say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  the  government's  position  on  commingling? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  no  ­­ the  beneficiary  gets  the  check,  puts  it  in

his  bank  account,  together  with  whatever  else  he  has  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there.  So  how  do  we  tell  if  he's  dissipated? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  I  agree  with  my  friend  that  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

commingling  rule  at  equity,  I  think,  reflected  the  fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  once  funds  have  been  dissipated,  the  lienholder  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  longer  collect.  So  the  way  it  worked  was  that  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  funds  in  your  account  that  ­­ and  you  spent  them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  at  first  it  would  be  presumed  that  you  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spending  your  own  money. 

 

 

 

            

But  ­­ but  once  you  got  down  below  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amount  that  ­­ that  was  originally  subject  to  the  lien, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lienholder  would  only  be  able  to  enforce  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  remained  in  that  account  even  if  it  wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  to  satisfy  the  lien  amount. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it's  basically  the  same  dissipation  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  applies  in  cases  that  don't  involve  commingling. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  can't  ­­ in  a  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

where  there's  no  time  problem  ­­ forget  the  delays  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  forth  ­­ but  like  this  one,  the  Plan  sue  the  lawyer? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  if  there  was  $500,000  and  the  lawyer  received 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

200,000  ­­ but  he  certainly  received  it  with  notice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  any  kind  of  good­faith  purchaser  ­­ why  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  get  it  back  from  him? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  I  think  there  may  be  situations 

    

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  the  Plan  could  sue  the  lawyer.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  If  they  could, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

then  doesn't  that  solve  the  problem  for  them  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers  will  be  awfully  careful  not  to  dissipate  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funds  if,  in  fact,  they're  going  to  be  subject  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit? 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  that's  right,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I  think  lawyers  also  have  ethical  rules  that  ­­ that

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  wait  a  minute.  I  mean, 

    

   

  

 

 

if  they  can  get  it  from  the  lawyer  immediately,  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  they  get  it  from  the  lawyer  at  ­­ at  the  end  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  day?  I  mean,  do  you  mean  that  ­­ that  the  ­­ the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fund  can  get  back  not  only  what  the  beneficiary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receives,  but  also  what  he  has  paid  his  lawyer? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  No.  I  just  mean  that  ­­ that

the  lienholder  to  trace  that  ­­ that  lien  amount.

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  has  to  be  or  nobody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  take  these  cases. 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  That  may  be  correct.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

don't  ­­ I  don't  think  this  situation  has  come  up  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much.  But  I  ­­

   

  

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  don't  see  why  it  would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

be.  There  is  a  fund.  The  fund  belongs  to  person  X. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  lawyer  knows  it  belongs  to  person  X.  Nonetheless, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lawyer  takes  $200,000  out  of  the  money  that  belongs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  person  X  and  gives  300,000  to  the  client. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  assume  the  client  is  more  likely  to  spend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  down  than  the  lawyer,  because  lawyers  tend,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general,  to  have  a  larger  bank  account  than  poorer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients.  So  therefore,  I  do  not  see  why  they  wouldn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue  the  lawyer. 

 

 

            

But  they  aren't,  so  there's  something  I

didn't  understand;  hence,  I  am  asking  the  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  All  right.  Well,  I  don't  think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

­­ I  don't  think  it's  come  up  very  much,  but  I  do  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  possible  that  in  some  situations,  plans  may  be  able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  sue  the  lawyers.  They  can  sue  other  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  think  it  must  depend  on 

    

 

 

 

 

 

how  the  agreement  reads,  and  I  can't  imagine  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  wouldn't  ­­ wouldn't  require  the  beneficiary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  turn  over  the  net.  Not  the  gross,  but  the  net 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recovery,  what  ­­ what  he  receives  after  paying  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees. 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  a  lot  of  these 

   

   

  

 

 

 

plans  are  going  to  disclaim  a  common  fund  or  ­­ or  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  they're  going  to  disclaim  their  ­­ their  ­­

his  safe.  I  do  not  believe  that  no  matter  what  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  between  the  cousin  and  the  lawyer,  the  lawyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  take  the  diamond  ring  that  belongs  to  somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else  ­­ and  he  knows  it  ­­ and  put  it  in  his  pocket,  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  what  the  agreement. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Right.  He's  not  a  bona  fide 

   

  

  

 

 

 

purchaser  for  value  in  that  situation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  the  Plans  do  have  many  other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedies  in  these  situations.  They  can  trace  against  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  any  third  party  who  takes  the  ­­ the  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  notice  of  the  lien.  They  ­­ they  could  monitor  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  They  can  intervene  in  these  suits.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  seek  injunctions.  These  are  all  things  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plan  here  did  not  do. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  just  to  ­­ to  pick  up  on  a  point  that  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend  was  making,  I  do  think  that  this  is  a  situation 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  reasonable  policymakers  could  differ.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  legitimate  concerns  on  both  sides.  It  is  absolutely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  legitimate  concern  that  in  some  cases  a  plan  may  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  able  to  recover  even  if  it  has  diligently  protected

can  do,  though,  are  ­­ are  a  lot  more  complicated  than

complicating  the  procedures  in  this  area,  for  the  simple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  that  nobody  has  to  set  up  one  of  these  plans. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  they  don't  know,  you  know,  how  much  it's  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cost  in  advance  and  all  of  them  just  say,  well,  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worth  it,  and  if  I've  got  to  go  and  file  injunctions  or

won't  set  up  one  of  these  plans. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think  an 

   

   

  

 

 

 

important  point,  Your  Honor,  is  that  no  matter  how  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  rules  here,  the  Plans  are  going  to  have  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligations  and  they're  going  to  have  those  burdens, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Great­West  permits  beneficiaries  to  structure 

 

 

 

 

 

their  settlements  to  avoid  paying  reimbursement  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plan. 

            

So  because  of  that,  ever  since  Great­West, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plans  have  taken  these  measures  and  ­­ and  they  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  to  take  them  even  if  the  Court  rules  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  are  the  concerns  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  side,  which  you  have  mentioned  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  your  ­­ your  friend  also  mentioned?  What  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they?

MS.  ANDERS:  So  one  concern,  as  you  said,  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  whatever  rule  the  Court  announces,  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  apply  in  the  pension  and  disability  benefit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  too.  And  in  that  situation,  the  Plan  may  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  overpayments  to  beneficiaries  over  a  long  period 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  time.  And  the  beneficiary  may  spend  the  money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  knowing  that  she's  going  to  be  responsible  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reimbursing  it  later,  or  ­­ or  that  it's  not  her  money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  spend  in  a  sense.  And  so  in  that  situation,  I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  policymaker  could  be  concerned  that  ­­ about  a  plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  able  to  go  ­­ go  back  months  or  years  later  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  get  reimbursement  from  the  beneficiary. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think,  you  know,  this  is  really  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  for  Congress.  But  what  Congress  could  do  is  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  weigh  that  potential  against  the  downside  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plan,  the  fact  that,  since  Great­West,  they  have  ­­ they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  had  these  obligations,  they  have  needed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diligently  protect  their  rights,  and,  I  think,  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mine­run  of  cases,  they've  been  able  to  do  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  those  are  the  things  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  could  weigh  in  looking  at  the  policy  ­­ policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns  on  either  side  of  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  why  we  think  those  concerns 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  shouldn't  drive  the  analysis  here.  The  ­­

I  shift  gears  a  little  bit  and  ­­ and  just  ask:  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  that  we've  set  up  is  whether  a  remedy  is  typically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  at  equity.  And  there's  been  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

back­and­forth,  I  think,  about  what  that  means. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

What  does  it  mean? 

 

 

 

MS.  ANDERS:  I  think  "typically  available  in 

    

 

 

 

 

equity"  meant  remedies  that  were  considered  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  in  nature.  And  so  it  certainly  did  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include,  as  this  Court  said  in  Merten,  the  type  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mertens,  the  type  of  ­­ relief,  such  as  deficiency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments  or  lien  destruction  damages,  that  that  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  of  as  legal  to  the  end  of  the  ­­ the  time  of  the

MR.  KATYAL:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Three  things  are  undisputed. 

 

 

 

First,  that  Montanile  signed  a  form  saying, 

   

 

 

 

 

quote,  "I  agree  to  reimburse  in  full  the  Plan  from  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settlement." 

            

Second,  the  Plan  provides  that  such  funds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are,  quote,  "Assets  of  the  Plan  not  distributable  to  any

person  without  the  Plan's  written  release." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  third,  under  Sereboff,  that  the  Plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  an  enforcement  claim  under  502(a)(3)  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montanile  still  possessed  the  funds. 

 

 

 

 

            

What  we're  disagreeing  about  is  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

Montanile's  decision  to  commit  a  second  wrong  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

spending  the  Plan's  money  himself  has  made  him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment­proof.  And  the  answer  is  no  for  a  very  simple 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason:  When  a  right  under  equity  has  attached  and  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  then  knowingly  frustrates  that  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

claim,  it  is  absolutely  part  of  equity  to  permit  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  This  reflects  the  cold  reality  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  took  actions  that  blocked  an  otherwise  valid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  in  equity. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  have  no  idea 

    

   

 

 

 

where  you  think  this  lien  attached.  Do  you  think  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attached  at  the  fund,  immediate  ­­ the  whole  500,000,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  amount  of  that  500,000  that  ended  up  in  his  pocket, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  that  500,000  minus  what,  if  anything? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  So  it  ­­ it's  ­­ Barnes  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ that  the  lien  attaches  at  the  moment  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ that  he  has  gotten  title  to  the  thing.  He  gets 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

title  to  the  thing  when  there  is  a  $500,000  settlement. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Settlement,  of  course,  that  we  didn't  know  about,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  nonetheless  did.

Our  only  ­­

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  your  position  is  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

that  moment  it  goes  to  the  lawyer,  it's  his  money,  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

500,000.  You're  entitled  to  whatever  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

on  it. 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  To  a  ­­ to  a  lien  of  $121,000 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

And  so  our  claim  is  not  that  we  have  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  remedy  at  law  that  we  can  get  compensatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequential  damages  or  punitive  damages.  It's  limited 

  

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  lien  itself. 

 

 

 

            

And  that  is  the  rule  in  equity,  that  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  frustrates  a  valid  claim  in  equity  by  taking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions  to  dissipate  the  fund,  you  can  get  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recover  the  value  of  that  fund.  You  can't  recover  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  that.  So  this  is  the  bitter  with  the  sweet  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  ­­ when  you  make  an  equitable  claim  like  this,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  be  limited  by  all  the  rules  of  equity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  addition  to  that,  Justice  Sotomayor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  couldn't,  for  example,  try  and  attach  the  asset,  try 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  attach  and  file  a  lawsuit,  until  he  actually  took 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possession  of  the  funds. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  I  ­­ I  found  a  list.  On 

   

   

   

  

  

 

this  list  I  have,  one,  there  is  the  fund,  500,000  in  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  belongs  to  the  company,  not  to  him. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  he  takes  the  fund  and  he  begins  to

distribute  it  with  the  aid  of  his  lawyer.  Some  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  goes  to  the  lawyer.  If  that  money  is  still  there, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  imagine  you  could  get  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

Some  of  the  lawyer's  goes  to  his  bank 

 

 

 

 

 

account.  If,  in  fact,  that  bank  account  has  not  gone, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  time  he  put  it  there  to  the  time  you  sue,  below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$121,000,  you  can  get  it.  Indeed  ­­ and  if  it  has  gone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

below,  you  can  still  get  it  even  if  there's  a  penny,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  only  get  the  penny. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  he  has  taken  the  121,000  out  of  it  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  it  to  a  person  with  knowledge,  for  example,  his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wife  or  children,  and  it  is  in  their  bank  account,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  you  could  get  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  indeed,  if  they  have  got  and  bought  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  some  tangible  item  that  you  can  trace  it  to,  I  guess 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  get  it. 

 

 

 

            

But  what  we  could  not  find  and,  in  fact,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  find  any  of  those,  you  could  still  sue  him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  State  law,  under  State  fraud  statutes,  and  recover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  damages.  That's  at  law.  And  maybe  you  can  do  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  under  such  a  remedy  where  it's  much  more  mixed  up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  the  other  side  was  prepared  to  give  you  credit  for, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  case,  you  have  State  law  remedies  at  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  what  I  could  not  find  is  a  case 

   

   

 

 

 

 

embodying  the  theory  you  are  now  advancing,  that  he

simply  gets  the  damages  even  where  he  doesn't  have  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  remedies  that  I  just  mentioned. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  So  ­­ so  first  of  all,  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  advancing  that  theory,  Justice  Breyer.  You  cannot 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  ­­ we're  not  advancing  a  damages  theory  whatsoever. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  we're  saying  is  that  you  can  recover  the  value  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lien  itself  when  someone  frustrates  an  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  that  otherwise  exists. 

 

 

 

            

And  we  point  to  three  different  traditions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  equity  that  permit  you  to  do  that:  substitutionary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monetary  decrees,  deficiency  judgments,  and  swollen 

 

 

 

 

 

assets.  All  of  those  reflect  the  basic  idea  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  shouldn't  profit  from  their  second  wrong,  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrongdoing  of  dissipating  a  fund. 

   

 

 

            

So  look,  there  is  a  ­­ they're  absolutely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

right.  The  general  rule  is  that  you  can't  recover  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  assets.  That  is  absolutely  right.  But  there's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

an  urban  legend  that  ­­ that  I  think  the  briefs  try  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spin  around  that  rule,  to  say  that  that  general  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encompasses  a  situation  when  someone  acts  wrongfully  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

dissipate  a  fund,  as  to  which  someone  has  a  claim. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  circumstance,  Justice  Holmes's 

 

 

 

 

opinion  in  Otis  says,  he  says,  if  the  complaint,  quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"seeks  the  recovery  of  an  identified  fund,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  will  not  fail  because  the  fund  is  gone  and

misappropriated  by  the  defendants.  Rather,  under  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances,  the  plaintiff  has  a  right  to  compensation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

as  alternative  relief." 

 

 

            

            

That's  not  damages  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That  would  be  wonderful,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

he  said  "has  an  equitable  right  to  compensation."  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  you  know,  that  sounds  like  cleanup  to  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  No,  it's  not,  Justice  Scalia. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  it's  not,  for  several  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Number  one  is,  of  course,  in  that  case,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire  fund  was  gone.  So  if  it  were  cleanup 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction,  there  had  to  be  something  to  pend  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  had  some  ancillary  jurisdiction,  some  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  There  had  to  be  some  fund  that  was  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remaining  in  order  for  there  to  be  something  to  pend  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  wasn't  there.  The  entire  fund  was  gone. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  ­­ is  ­­ is  that  the

jurisdiction,  so  long  as  the  person  had  possession  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fund  at  one  point. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  I  don't  think  that  there's  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  then  ­­ and  when  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit  is  completed,  it's  discovered  that  all  of  the  fund 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  gone. 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  No,  your  Honor.  If  ­­ if  their 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  is  right,  and  this  is  something  that  Judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Posner  has  said,  for  example,  in  ­­ in  describing  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Medtronic  case.  In  order  for  ancillary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  to  exist,  there  has  to  first  be  a  valid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  claim.  And  then,  for  the  convenience  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties,  you  can  resolve  a  legal  claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

In  Otis  there  was  no  equitable  claim  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  theory,  which  ­­ which  is,  you  ­­ you  know,  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fund  is  gone,  there's  no  lien  that  it's  attached.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gone.  It's  dissipated. 

  

 

            

So  ­­ and  then  it  also  say,  you  know,  it's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remarkable  that  they  say  that  all  of  these  cases  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cleanup  jurisdiction. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Wait.  If  ­­ if  ­­ if 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  equitable  cause  of  action  for  them,  why  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  for  you? 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Because  we  think  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

proposition  that  they're  trying  to  say  is  wrong,  the

idea  that  when  you  dissipate  a  fund,  you  lose  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  claim. 

 

            

Our  point  is  that  is  ­­ that's  generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true;  not  true  in  a  circumstance  when  a  defendant 

   

   

 

 

 

 

frustrates  an  otherwise  valid  equitable  claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  ­­ so  you  ought  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  bring  suit  in  equity  without  asserting  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  ever  had  the  fund  in  his  hands.

MR.  KATYAL:  You  can't  do  that,  of  course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  Knudson  says.  And  ­­ and  that's  a  standard  rule. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  not  here  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You're  saying  even  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know  the  person  has  dissipated  all  the  funds,  you  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue  for  the  equitable  lien,  even  if  you  know  the  funds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  all  gone? 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Correct,  Your  Honor.  As  long 

  

  

 

 

 

 

as  that  was  a  knowing  dissipation,  that  that's  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened.  And  that's  what  the  substitutionary  momentary

that  does  that.  Justice  Homes's  opinion,  Justice  Story 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  a  description  of  other  cases  in  his  treatise. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our  ­­ our  brief  talks  about  the  Baxter  case  and  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  Bank  of  Marin  case.  These  are  the  closest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogue  to  this  case,  because  they're  not  the  general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  about  can  you  recover  from  general  assets;  they're

wrongdoing  when  an  equitable  lien  by  attachments  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  an  equitable  lien  by  agreement  is  already  attached. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It  has  to  be  pretty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

easy  for  you  to  protect  yourself,  doesn't  it,  as  soon  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  some  suitable  time  after  the  injury  you  do  write  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

letter  to  the  person  and  say,  look,  you  need  to  know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  you  sue  somebody,  the  money  is  ours,  and  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  these  rights  of  subrogation,  or  let  us  know  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to,  and  we'll  show  up  in  court  with  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  ­­ and  help  you? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Where  ­­ see,  I  guess  it  would  probably  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  easy  to  ­­ to  monitor  it  yourself.  I  mean,  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court's  computerized  dockets,  you  just  punch  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Montanile,"  and  ­­ and  whenever  that  pops  up  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

docket  and  you  find  out  right  away.  It's  certainly  long

might  appear. 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  So  ­­ so  three  things,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  First,  we're  not  grounding  our  argument  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  of  things.  We  do  think  that  the  policy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences  are  ­­ are  important,  but  we  think  that  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  test  is  what's  traditionally  available  in  equity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  three  specific  lines  of  authority  that  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointing  to  answer  that  question. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  as  to  the  policy  concerns,  we  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  as  you  said  to  my  friend  on  the  other  side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  are  two  big  problems  with  that.  Number  one  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plans  don't  get  noticed  about  when  settlements  occur. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  the  amicus  brief  from  NASP  explains  most  auto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accidents,  for  example,  are  settled  without  any  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  without  any  lawsuit  being  filed  whatsoever.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  exactly  type  it  into  Westlaw  or  something  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  So  that's  one  problem. 

  

 

 

 

            

The  other  is  that  it  becomes  very  expensive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  Plans  to  monitor  this  stuff.  And  Plans  are,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  some  for  profit  entity.  Every  dollar  that  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spend  that  the  Plan  has  to  spend  on  monitoring  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

writing  these  letters  or  filing  lawsuits  or  filing  TROs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  dollar  that  is  taken  away  from  innocent  Plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries,  people  who  have  done  ­­

that's  the  point  we  have  made  in  our  precedents,  but  it

trying  to  do  that.  All  I'm  saying  is  that  the  policy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  here,  I  do  think,  are  substantial  and  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight.  The  amicus  briefs,  before  you  say,  over  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

billion  dollars  each  year  is  recovered  through  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reimbursement  actions.  And  ­­ and  if  you  adopt  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan,  then  as  you  were  saying  as  to  my  friend,  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  just  tell  the  client  ­­ you  are  ­­ telling  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montaniles  of  the  world,  spend  that  money  right  away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Settle  the  case  at  10:00,  and  by  10:01  spend  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.  And  in  that  circumstance,  then  Plans  are  out  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

luck.  Innocent  beneficiaries,  that  means,  are  out  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

luck,  and  people  like  Mr.  Montanile  get  a  double 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recovery.  And  equity  is  not  so  brittle.  There  is  no 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tradition  in  equity  that  supports  this  idea. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As,  Justice  Alito,  you  were  saying,  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  this  make  any  sense?  It  didn't  make  sense  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equity.  Equity  has  always  been  more  flexible  than  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  always  recognized  the  idea  that  people  shouldn't  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  profit  from  their  wrongdoing,  and  that  rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  remedies,  and  avoiding  formalistic  distinctions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  speaking  of  formalistic  distinctions,

the  Solicitor  General's  rule  is  as  formalistic  as  it

is  a  formalistic  distinction.  I  mean,  to  ­­ to  argue 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  we  shouldn't  make  formalistic  distinctions

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  Justice  Scalia,  as 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Frankfurter  says,  equity,  quote,  "assures 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanical  rules  and  depends  on  flexibility."  Every

already  an  equitable  lien  by  attaches. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  you  know,  for  example,  Pomeroy,  just  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  flexibility  interchange,  were  saying,  Section  111, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Equity  has  followed  the  true  principle  of  contriving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  remedy  so  they  shall  correspond  both  to  the  primary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  of  the  injured  party  and  to  the  wrong  by  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  right  has  been  violated.  It  has  therefore  never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

placed  any  limits  on  the  remedies  it  can  grant  either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  their  substance,  their  form  or  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent,  but  it's  always  preserved  the  elements  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flexibility  and  expansiveness  so  that  they  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modified  to  meet  the  requirements  of  every  case." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  this  is  a  perfect  example  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  don't  know 

   

  

 

 

 

that  you  can  read  our  precedence  in  this  area  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they're  very  flexible.  I  mean,  Sereboff,  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  equitable  lien  for  restitution  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  lien  by  agreement,  you  ­­ you  know,  you  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get,  you  know,  deficiency  judgments  as  opposed  to  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments,  and  whether  one's  sort  of  an  adjunct  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  action  or  freestanding.  It's  an  area  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  equity  rules  strikes  me  as  very  technical. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  they  are  technical  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  comes  to  that  first  question,  is  there  an  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  in  the  first  ­­ first  instance.  And  so  Knudson,

for  example,  says  no,  because  there's  no  possession  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fund.  Sereboff  says  here  there  is  possession; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  there  is. 

 

 

            

 

We  don't  quibble  with  any  of  that.  Here  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  comes  to  the  Court,  everyone  agrees  ­­ that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  third  point  I  made  at  the  outset  ­­ everyone  agrees 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  an  equitable  lien  by  agreement.  The  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  we're  disagreeing  about  is  whether  or  not  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spending  all  the  funds  we've  lost  our  remedy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  with  respect  to  that  question,  they  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  precedents  which  say  you  can't  go  after  general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets.  We  agree  with  that.  The  relevant  question  is, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  someone  has  wrong  ­­ when  ­­ when  ­­ when  a  valid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  lien  by  agreement  attaches  and  then  someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acts  to  dissipate  that,  can  they  profit  from  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong.

dissenters  if  I'm  not.  But  it  seemed  to  me  that  they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically  saying,  whatever  remedy  you  have  has  to  be  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  remedy. 

 

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  most  that  I  read 

   

  

 

 

 

about  a  substitution  decree  or  deficiency  decree  is  that

it's  an  ancillary  jurisdiction  to  issue  those. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

Is  that  consistent  with  saying  it's 

 

 

 

 

equitable?  Isn't  it  just  a  legal  claim  that  equity 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  permitted  an  ­­ an  equitable  court  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise,  but  wouldn't  it  still  be  legal  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Right.  Justice  ­­

  

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ and  not  within  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  ­­ the  scope  of  ERISA? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Justice  Sotomayor,  this  is, 

  

 

 

 

 

again,  part  of  the  urban  legend  that  ­­ that's  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed  around  this.  There  is  no  case  that  says  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  substitutionary  monetary  decree  is  a  legal  judgment  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ancillary.  To  the  contrary,  cases  that  we're  citing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  as  Baxter  and  Otis  suggest  that  it  is  an  equity  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that.  And  ­­ and  indeed,  if  there's  any  doubt  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  I  ­­ I  suggest  that  you'd  have  to  say  it's  equity, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  tradition  for  ancillary,  which  was  pendent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  was,  if  an  equity  court  was  going  to  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  legal  claim,  they  had  to  label  it  as  a  legal  claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  the  Seventh  Amendment  reasons,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise,  they  might,  you  know,  there's  ­­ there's  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorts  of  jury  trial  issues  that  come  up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  that's  why  the  tradition  for  cleanup 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  was  to  label  those  claims  specifically  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  okay,  first  we're  going  to  solve  our  ­­ our

equitable  claim,  and  now  we're  going  to  turn  as  part  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  pendent  jurisdiction  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  still  a  little  bit 

   

  

 

 

 

confused  by  all  of  this.  In  my  mind,  you  get  money  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  gives  it  to  you.  And  I  ­­ I  know  that  a  lawyer 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  agent,  but  the  agent  is  keeping  a  piece  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.  You  can  still  go  after  the  client  for  the  piece 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lawyer  took? 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  So  with  ­­ with  respect  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  lawyer  piece  is  much  more  complicated.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  goes  to  Justice  Breyer's  question.  I  mean,  there's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  a  circuit  split  on  this  question  about  can  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  after  the  lawyer,  and  the  reason  why  you  may  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  go  after  the  lawyer  is  the  lawyer  is  not  a  party 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  underlying  agreement. 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  what  I  think  the  Eighth  Circuit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

says  in  contradistinction  to  others.  And  so  that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  it  is  ­­ that  is  not  a  great  remedy.  And, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  course,  it  requires  the  lawyer  to  be  on  notice  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plan  and  all  the  reimbursement  obligations  and  the  like. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under  equity,  Justice  Sotomayor,  I  think  the 

   

 

 

 

 

idea  is  that  when  someone  has  made  a  valid  promise  to  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  these  funds,  such  as  here,  Montanile  knew  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  playing  with  house  money.  He  knew  that  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't  his  ­­ this  wasn't  his  money;  it  was  the  Plan's

money  from  the  start.  And  then  he  goes  and  spends  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  on  other  things.  Yes,  you  can  go  after  his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  assets  to  recover  that  spending  on  other  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  is  something  amply  supported  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  three  different  traditions  in  the  case  law.  Those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  closest  analogs  to  what's  going  on  here  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  has  dissipated  and  frustrated  a  ­­ an  action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  otherwise  existed. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  you  say  again,  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

does  the  lien  attach?  Is  it  when  the  tortfeasor  pays  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  it  ­­ the  check  to  the  lawyer,  or  is  it  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiary  actually  gets  the  200,000? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  I  don't  think  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

answers  are  clear  on  that,  but  I  do  think  it's  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  takes  ­­ I  think  the  most  this  Court  has  said  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  he  takes  title  to  the  thing.  And  presumably,  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

takes  title  to  the  thing  at  the  moment  that  the  check  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  to  the  lawyers. 

 

 

 

            

Now  if,  at  that  moment,  Justice  Ginsburg, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  the  bank  account  of  the  lawyer  was  hacked  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$500,000  settlement  was  gone,  our  view  is  his  general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  then  kicks  in.  In  that  circumstance,  we  cannot 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recover.  The  only  thing  we're  saying  is  that  when  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  knowingly  dissipates  a  fund  as  to  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

someone  else  has  a  claim,  it's  in  that  circumstance  that

the  exception  ­­ as  Justice  Story  called  it,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peculiar  exception  applies  to  try  and  basically  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  that  he  isn't  profiting  a  second  time  from  his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrongdoing. 

            

That's  why  the  claim  is  a  very  limited  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  equity.  It's  just  a  ­­ it's  a  ­­ and  again,  it's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  limited  to  the  amount  of  the  lien.  You  can't  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  that.  You  can't  have  punitive  damages  and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like,  and  it's  encumbered  by  all  the  defenses  in  the

laches  and  unconscionability.  All  of  that  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  defenses  that  are  available  to  such  an  action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  my  friend  on  the  other  side  has  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  this  is  going  to  reach  disability  situations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Absolutely  not.  I  mean,  I  think  you  have  a  variety  of 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

amicus  briefs  before  you  that  say  that  there's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  statute,  407(a),  which  prohibits  liens  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Social  ­­ Social  Security  Disability  overpayments.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says  it's  going  to  reach  pension  overpayments.  Again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  our  rule.  Our  rule  in  ­­ in  those  ­­ in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  circumstances,  a  pension  plan  is  overpaying  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiary. 

            

And  if  the  beneficiary  spends  that,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  something  that  they're  knowingly  dissipating. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  very  different  than  a  circumstance  like  this  in

which  someone  is  dissipating  a  fund  as  to  which  they  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  ­­ as  to  which  the  Plan  has  an  underlying  lien 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against.  And  that's  why  it's  a  ­­ it's  a  very  limited 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  It's  one  that  tracks  the  tradition  at  common  law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Both  Otis  talks  about  misappropriation,  and  Baxter  talks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  wrongful  dissipation  when  someone  has  a  valid  lien 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  you.  And  as  well,  the  Orr  case,  for  the  swollen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assets  theory  and  the  like. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  my  friend  on  the  other  side  says  in  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief,  well,  then  why  in  the  world  are  we  spending  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  time  ­­ are  all  these  equity  cases  spending  so  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  on  tracing?  And  our  view  is  very  simple  on  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tracing  makes  a  lot  of  sense.  In  the  lion's  share  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  tracing  becomes  very  important  because  you  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  defendant  who  is  acting  wrongfully  and  knowingly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissipating  a  fund.  And  so  the  Plan  or  whoever  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustee  is  wants  to  ­­ wants  to  go  after  general  assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  then  can't,  unless  they  can  trace  them  to  a  specific 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asset. 

            

Tracing  is  just  a  lien­priority  doctrine. 

   

 

 

 

It's  nothing  more  than  that.  The  Restatement  that  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend  cites  on  the  other  side  that  is  cited  in  Knudson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Section  215  is  as  clear  as  day.  It  just  talks  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lien  priority.  It  doesn't  say  that  there  is  no  claim  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  ­­ if  ­­ if  someone  dissipates  a  fund.  It  says

that  they  are  not  entitled  to  lien  priority.  That  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

And  look,  we  agree  with  that.  We're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  trying  to  say  we  have  a  priority  over  other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asset  ­­ over  other  creditors.  We're  just  simply  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  to  use  the  language  of  the  Restatement,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"general  creditor." 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you  don't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

priority  over  other  creditors.  So  if  Mr.  Montanile  owes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  money,  he  ­­ it's  all  right  if  he  takes  money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  fund  and  pays  that  debt? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  we  are  then  ­­ you  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  long  as  we  can't  trace  it  in  a  world  of  no  tracing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  there's  obviously  some  funds  here  that  we  may  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trace,  because  as  the  interchange  with  Justice  Ginsburg 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  suggesting,  it's  not  totally  clear  what  was  spent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  what  isn't. 

 

 

            

But  with  respect  to  the  rest,  yes.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  to  take  the  bitter  with  the  sweet,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  we  are  a  general  creditor  out  of  general  assets. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  like  we  get  first  priority  over  those  assets, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  why  this  remedy  is  at  best  a  second­best  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  us.  I  mean,  the  ideal  is,  of  course,  to  prevent 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  from  dissipating  the  funds  altogether. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  do  think,  if  this  Court  recognized,

as  I  think  most  of  the  circuits  have,  that  we  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  of  action  here,  then  I  think  it  would  deter  people 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  engaging  in  the  kind  of  behavior  that  Mr.  Montanile 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  just  want  to  be  clear: 

    

 

 

 

 

 

I  understand  your  position  and  your  answer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Fund  has  ­­ has  a  claim  for  reimbursement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  accident  proceeds.  Accident  proceeds  put  into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  bank  account  of  the  Plan  beneficiary,  the  injured, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  who  was  injured  in  the  accident.  He  also  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  creditor. 

 

            

creditor? 

            

            

            

You're  ­­ you  stand  evenly  with  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KATYAL:  So  if  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Was  that  your  answer? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  it  is  in  the  situation  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  dissipated  fund.  So  obviously,  if  we  can  trace  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  why  tracing  is  still  important. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  it's  ­­ it's  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

example.  The  case  is  settled  at  10:00  in  the  morning. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At  10:30  in  the  morning,  it's  in  the  bank  account. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Nothing  has  been  spent, 

  

 

 

 

 

but  there's  a  creditor.  And  the  creditor's  claim  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

equal  to  the  Plan's  claim,  and  there's  only  enough  money

for  one. 

 

            

What  happens? 

 

            

            

priority. 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well,  Justice  Kennedy  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  thought  you  would  have 

    

 

 

 

 

MR.  KATYAL:  I  would  if  ­­ it  sounds  like  we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  trace  that  fund.  That  is,  the  fund  hasn't  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spent  in  that  circumstance. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It's  traceable.  It's  in 

  

  

 

 

 

the  bank  account. 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Right.  So  then  ­­ and  that  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  exactly  right.  So  we  would  have  priority  over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  $500,000,  in  that  circumstance,  over  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors. 

            

My  only  point  is  if  we're  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montanile­like  situation  in  which  he  has  ­­ let's  say  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spent  down  that  entire  fund  and  there's  another  creditor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  also  ­­ Montanile  owes  money  to.  Once  that  happens, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  ­­ we  can  only  recover  just  like  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  creditor.  And  that's  what  the  Restatement  says. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  all  it  says. 

 

 

 

            

It  does  not  say  that  if  a  fund  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissipated,  that  there  is  no  claim  anymore.  That  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  contrary  to  the  whole  idea  as  Justice  Alito's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  was,  about  what  equity  is  all  about.  That

makes  ­­ that  makes  no  sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

An  equity  is  not  that  brittle,  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scalia.  I  understand  that  there  are  traditions  in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

equity  and  there  are  certain  rules.  But  at  the  end  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  day,  there  ­­ it  was  never  that  formalistic  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  have  the  idea  that  someone  could  profit  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  from  their  wrongdoing  in  frustrating  an  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  that  otherwise  exists. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  it  seems,  Mr.  Katyal, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  are  relying  on  remedies  that  really  developed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  late  in  equity's  life.  In  other  words,  you  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equity  was  going  along,  and  there  were  these  very  formal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  distinguishing  it  from  the  legal  world.  And  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  it  progressed,  there  were  ­­ people  thought  we  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  cleanup  authority,  or  maybe  even  people  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  these  rules  aren't  working  in  the  way  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  them  to  work.  So  equity  got  a  little  bit  less 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  as  it  approached  the  merger  with  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  that,  I  think,  is  not  really  what  we've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant  when  we've  said  we're  looking  to  things  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typically  equitable.  You  know,  not  like  the  last  throes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  equity  as  it  was  becoming  a  legal  system. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  So,  Justice  Kagan,  I'd  spot  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  with  respect  to  swollen  assets,  you  know,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  come  around  in  the  1930s,  and  so  maybe  there's  an

argument  there.  But  ­­ but  for  example,  substitutionary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

monetary  decrees,  Justice  Holmes's  opinions  in  1897, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  same  year  as  Barnes,  the  Chief  Justice's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  that  was  the  foundation  for  Sereboff.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeed,  it  has  a  tradition  that  goes  back  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Story's  1828  treatise,  which  cites  earlier  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  still. 

 

            

            

So  I  don't  think  that  we're  relying  that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  you  take  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

deficiency  judgments,  which,  I  take  it,  was  a  rule  was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

needed  to  give  equity  that  authority,  because  everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  equity  didn't  have  that  authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATYAL:  Well  ­­ well,  even  if  you  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  that  argument  about  deficiency  judgments,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll  respond  to  in  a  moment,  you  can't  make  it  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substitution  or  monetary  decrees,  which  is  a  distinct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

body  in  equity. 

 

 

            

And  with  respect  to  that,  in  1864, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely.  This  Court  promulgated  Equity  Rule  92, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  allowed  for  deficiency  judgments.  But  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  they  had  to  issue  a  rule  doesn't  somehow  make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  a  law  claim,  as  my  friend  says.  I  mean,  after  all, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule  73,  promulgated  in  1864,  was  a  rule  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

preliminary  injunctions.  And  I  certainly  think 

   

  

 

 

preliminary  injunctions  were  available  in  equity,  and,

you  know,  the  fact  that  there  was  a  rule  about  it  didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow  convert  it  into  a  law  claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  the  very  fact  that  this  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued  a  rule  called  Equity  Rule  10  is  suggestive  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ of  the  fact  that  this  is  a  tradition  in  equity. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  look,  if  there's  some  doubt  about  this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  there's  some  doubt  on  the  traditions,  and  they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  ­­ I  don't  think  they  have  a  single  case,  but  even 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  thought  they  did,  that  said  that  we  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibited  ­­ that  we  were  prohibited  from  making  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  at  equity,  I  think  you  should  err  on  the  side  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognizing  the  claim. 

 

 

            

Why?  For  three  reasons.  One,  because  as 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  Solicitor  General's  brief  in  Sereboff  said,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  of  ERISA  is  to  try  and  give  effect  to  written 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans  and  their  determinations.  And  if  there's  doubt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  the  ­­ as  to  what  the  equity  tradition  is,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  read  it  in  light  of  trying  to  enforce  Plan  terms. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  the  pages  23  and  24  of  their  brief.  It  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  way  this  Court  approaches,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  Title  VII  cases  and  the  like. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  is  that,  again,  all  we're  seeking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  a  remedy.  We're  not  trying  to  get  more  than 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  would  have  been  otherwise  available  at  equity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our  ­­ our  view  is  that  when  someone  frustrates  an

otherwise  equitable  claim,  we  can  only  try  and  reinstate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  claim.  You  can't  get  more  from  it  because  of  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  wrongdoing.  So  I  think  we're  giving  effect  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  equity  is  all  about. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

And  then,  third  ­­ and  this  goes  back  to 

 

 

 

 

 

your  last  question  to  Ms.  Anders,  you  said,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  was  ­­ what  was  the  ­­ what  does  "typically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  at  equity"  mean?  And  you  know,  that  test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  from  Mertens.  Mertens  isolates  three  examples  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  was  traditionally  available  as  equity  ­­ at  equity: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandamus,  injunction,  and  restitution. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  you  look  at  mandamus,  for  example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  precedents  from  this  Court  making  ­­ that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  suggest  that  equity  ­­ that  equity  didn't  recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandamus.  You  know,  this  Court  twice  in  the  nineteenth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

century  in  Hine  and  Downs  both  said  that  ­­ said  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

twice. 

            

And  I  think  that's  a  good  textual  clue  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

when  there's  doubt  as  to  whether  something  is  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditionally  available  at  equity  or  not,  you  should  err 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  side  of  recognizing  it  as  traditionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available,  as  this  Court  did  in  the  foundational  Mertens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test. 

            

We're  not  quibbling  with  Mertens.  We're 

  

 

 

 

 

simply  saying  we're  at  least  as  strong  as  to  whether

something  was  traditionally  available  at  equity  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandamus.  Because  in  mandamus,  two  cases  from  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  suggested  it  wasn't  traditionally  available,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet,  the  Court  still,  in  Mertens,  used  that  as  one  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  three  examples. 

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Stris,  you  have  four  minutes  remaining. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

           

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  PETER  K.  STRIS 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd  just  like  to  make  two  brief  points.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  one  is  that  the  historical  authorities  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unquestionably  on  our  side.  And  it  was  interesting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing  my  ­­ my  friend  Mr.  Katyal  go  straight  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substitutionary  monetary  remedy.  I  want  to  say  a  couple 

    

   

 

 

 

 

things  about  this: 

 

 

            

First,  if  you  look  carefully,  the  exact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  he's  making  was  rejected  by  the  holding  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  in  Great­West.  This  is  Section  II  C  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  opinion.  It's  kind  of  a  lesser­known  part  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  opinion. 

 

            

The  ­­ the  argument  was  made  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiary  of  a  trust  commits  that  second  wrong  that  he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  talking  about  when  they  get  a  loan  contractually  and

refuse  to  pay  it  back.  And  what  this  Court  said  is,  no, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  typically  available  in  equity.  And,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  it's  precisely  the  distinction  that  he's  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  push  upon  you  to  squeeze  this  remedy  through. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  let's  look  at  the  substitutionary 

 

 

 

 

 

monetary  decree  cases  he  talks  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Not  a  single  one  of  them  involves  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  lien  by  agreement.  They  ­­ they  don't  involve 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  agreement.  They're  restitutionary  cases.  So  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

also  interesting  to  me  that  he  criticizes  our  side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  the  ­­ the  Restatement  of  Restitution, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  215,  whereas  we  talk  about  Pomeroy.  We  talk 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  Jones  on  liens.  We  talk  about  the  Person  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  an  1880  case  on  page  35  of  the  Blue  brief.  It's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  lien  by  agreement  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

dispute. 

            

The  historical  authority  here  is  beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  I  guess  the  last  thing  I'll  say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  this  is  look  at  the  Shafer's  Appeal  case.  It's  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  his  lead  cases  on  page  37,  note  6.  It  says  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substitutionary  monetary  relief  is  legal. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  ­­ I  think  if  you  look  at  the  cases, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  that  I  would  wish  that  upon  anyone,  they  ­­ they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  do  not  even  credibly  support  the  proposition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically.

So  where  does  that  leave  us?  I  mean,  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

think  I  was  honest  from  minute  one  when  I  got  up  here. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  only  reason  that  you  would  contort  the  standard  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  developed  ­­ let's  be  honest;  you  know,  spot  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ you  have  to  believe  our  position  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamentally  inconsistent  with  the  purpose  of  ERISA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  you  do,  then  I  have  a  problem. 

   

   

 

 

 

            

But  here's  where  we're  at.  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice,  you  made  a  very  strong  policy  argument  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  my  rule  is  no  good.  With  respect,  I  think  I  could 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  a  very  strong  policy  argument  about  why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

participants  who  prove  a  clear  bad­faith  breach  by  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  should  get  consequential  damages.  I  could  make 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  argument.  I  think  I  could  make  it  very 

    

   

 

 

 

 

persuasively.  But  that's  not  what  we're  here  to  do. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  here  to  apply  the  historical  test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  let's  end,  essentially,  with,  I  think,  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

key  concession  that  Mr.  Katyal  makes  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability  context. 

 

            

So  if  you  look  at  this  case  and  you  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  all  this  subrogation,  I  don't  know.  These 

   

  

 

 

 

 

arguments  that  the  Plans  have  ways  to  protect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves,  maybe  they're  right,  but  maybe  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

onerous.  And,  you  know,  I'm  just  not  sure  if  it's  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  add  to  the  cost  of  plans.

Go  look  at  the  disability  cases.  Because  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  stunned  when  Mr.  Katyal  got  up  here  and  said,  oh, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  the  disability  cases  are  different,  like  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  extend  to  them.  He  filed  a  cert  petition  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  with  this  Court  in  the  Bilyeu  case,  which  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  the  circuit  split  cases  that's  here.  Half  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit  split  cases  involve  the  disability  context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I'll  end  with  this:  What  does  that  tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you?  The  fact  that  you  look  at  these  disability  cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  see  that  money  is  being  advanced  and  it's  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spent  before  the  lien  even  attaches,  and  yet  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  part  of  the  circuit  split,  and  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent  is  not  willing  to  defend  that  as  a  policy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position,  I  think  what  it  tells  you  is  that  fair­minded 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  could  disagree  as  to  where  you  want  to  place  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk. 

            

And  so  when  we  go  and  look  at  this  and  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  about  it  in  terms  of  burdens,  if  there  is  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  position,  as  you  look  at  this,  that  a  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  says  you  can  essentially  go  after  general  assets, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  that  some  meaningful  number  of  fiduciaries  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse  that  to  assert  rights  they  don't  have  or  to  delay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  I  think  you  need  to  go  with  the  clear  line  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historical  authorities. 

 

            

Thank  you.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

You  say  he  filed  a  cert  petition.  Is  that  on  behalf  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  client  this  year? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  It's  not  on  behalf  of  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client,  no.  But  it  ­­ it  shows  that  the  disability 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  are  governed  by  precisely  the  same  legal  rule, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  for  him  to  suggest  that  the  legal  rule  that  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  decide  here  would  not  also  ­­ also  apply  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability  cases,  flies  in  the  face  of  the  precise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  he  took  when  he  filed  the  cert  petition  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I'm  just 

  

 

 

 

 

trying  to  ­­

 

 

            

            

MR.  STRIS:  ­­ in  the  Bilyeu. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Are  you  saying  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  he  represented  a  different  client  and  took  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  in  that  case,  he's  somehow  bound  by  that  here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  Oh,  no,  no.  Certainly  not. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

What  I'm  saying  is  we  have  a  circuit  split.  And  half  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  cases  are  subrogation,  and  half  of  them  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability.  So  the  Court's  recognized  that  the  legal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  in  this  case  will  not  only  apply  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subrogation  cases  but  they'll  apply  in  disability  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  Mr.  Katyal  recognizes  that  because  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represented  a  party  in  one  of  those  cases. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  my  ­­ my  point  only  is,  don't  accept  the

representation  that  the  rule  here  can  somehow  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confined  to  subrogation  cases. 

 

 

 

            

            

Because,  as  an  empirical  matter,  it  cannot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  would  be 

   

  

 

 

 

surprised  by  the  proposition  that  lawyers  are  somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collaterally  estopped  if  they  take  a  particular  position 

   

 

 

 

 

 

on  behalf  of  one  client  from  taking  a  different  position 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  different  case. 

   

 

            

MR.  STRIS:  No.  Most  certainly  that's  true. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

And  perhaps  I've  miscommunicated. 

 

 

 

            

We  have  a  circuit  split  which  led  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  granting  this  case,  and  all  of  the  cases  purport 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  resolve  the  same  question  presented.  Half  of  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  the  subrogation  context;  half  of  them  are  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability  context.  So  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  see  how  one 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

could  credibly  take  the  position  that  you  can  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  and  it  would  not  affect  the  mine  run  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability  cases,  because  they're  part  of  precisely  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  circuit  split.  It's  the  same  issue. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon,  at  11:04  a.m.,  the  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
