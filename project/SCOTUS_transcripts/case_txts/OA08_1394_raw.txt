CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’ll hear 

argument next today in Case 08-1394, Skilling v. United 

(1:00 p.m.) 

States. 

Mr. Srinivasan. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

The dramatic collapse of Enron had profound 

reverberations experienced throughout the Houston 

economy and citizenry.  Countless individuals in the 

Houston area were affected, as the court of appeals 

explicitly recognized, so much so that 60 percent of the 

jury venire affirmatively acknowledged in the responses 

to questionnaires that they would be unable to set aside 

their deep-seated biases or doubted their ability to do 

so, or that they were angry about Enron's collapse, an 

anger that was manifested in the vitriolic terms in 

which Petitioner Jeff Skilling was referred to 

repeatedly both in the questionnaires and in the 

community more generally. 

The passions about this case were so intense 

and the connections to Enron ran so deep that the entire

United States Attorney's Office, all 150 or so 

attorneys, recused themselves from the investigation 

that culminated in this prosecution. 

In those conditions, the court of appeals 

was correct in unanimously concluding that this was one 

of the very rare cases in which, because of the degree 

of passion and prejudice in the community, the process 

of voir dire cannot be relied upon to adequately ferret 

out and identify unduly biased jurors.  And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do we take from 

trial counsel at the end of the voir dire process 

announcing that if he had had extra preemptory 

challenges, he would have used them only against 6 of the 

12 people that were finally selected?  If that's all he 

would have ejected, why couldn't a fair jury have been 

found? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, Your Honor, to be 

clear even one juror who should have been excluded and 

wasn't would have been enough, but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a different --

that's a different question. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are taking a broader 

proposition and saying that the presumption could not 

under any set of circumstances be overcome, and that's 

4 

Alderson Reporting Company 

what I'm trying to probe. 

Official 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 

The reason that trial counsel objected to six specific 

jurors at the juncture that Your Honor's referring to 

is that that corresponded to six cause objections that had 

been, in our view, erroneously denied.  Now, that in no way 

suggests that we were satisfied with the remainder of 

the jury.  We had made an objection --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  There was 

only one juror that had been challenged for cause 

against -- for which a preemptory challenge wasn't used. 

I thought that every other for-cause challenge ended up 

being excused on the basis of a preemptory challenge. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's right, and that's 

what I was trying to say, Your Honor, that the reason 

why trial counsel identified six specific jurors was 

that there were six other jurors who would have been on 

the venire as to whom we had applied -- as to whom we had 

asserted a cause challenge that was denied, and because 

of that we had to use a preemptory to strike those 

jurors, which left us without --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that means that 

there were six that were okay. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, no.  There were 

six as -- there were six remaining as to which we didn't

have a corresponding for-cause objection that had been 

denied.  But in no way indicates that we were satisfied 

with the other six. 

From the very outset, we complained about 

this process.  We said at the outset before trial that 

no juror could be seated in this case because the 

process of voir dire couldn't adequately be relied upon 

in these conditions. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell me what in the 

process itself, outside of your general proposition that 

no process could find fair jurors?  What else in the 

process was deficient? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  The process was deficient 

in a couple of respects, Your Honor:  First, with respect 

to time and scope.  The voir dire that the trial judge 

conducted was essentially an ordinary voir dire for 

ordinary circumstances.  He announced before the fact 

that the voir dire would be conducted in a period of 1 

day, and we objected to that. 

He also announced that he would have limited 

questioning and that counsel would have very limited 

opportunity to follow up with additional questions.  We 

also objected clearly and repeatedly to that.  And that 

was manifested in the voir dire that occurred, because 

what the trial judge did is made two fundamental, we 

6 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

think, mistakes in the way he conducted the voir dire. 

One occurs with respect to those jurors as 

to whom they had laid bare their biases, and another 

occurs with respect to those jurors as to whom they 

didn't affirmatively acknowledge their biases, but, 

given the conditions that prevailed in the community, 

they might well have had biases that they didn't 

affirmatively acknowledge. 

Now, with respect to the first, the mistake 

that, in our view, the trial judge made was to accept a 

simple assurance of fairness in the face of overt statements 

of bias and in conditions that confronted this community, 

where there was deep-seated community prejudice and animus 

that permeated the Houston -- that permeated the city of 

Houston, that kind of acceptance of a simple assurance of 

fairness in the face of repeated overt statements of bias 

shouldn't be countenanced. 

And we think what the trial court should 

have done in that situation is to move to an additional 

juror.  But instead of doing that, the trial court 

interviewed 46 jurors, nearly 8 more than the minimum 

that was necessary to constitute a jury in this case. 

And just to give this a frame of reference, the entire voir 

dire process in this case took 5 hours, and the trial 

judge interviewed each juror for approximately 4 and a half

By way of comparison --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But he did -- he did give 

time for counsel to ask additional questions, trial 

counsel. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  He -- he did. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He asked both sides if 

they had additional questions. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  He gave some time, Justice 

Ginsburg, but he made clear before the voir dire began 

that that opportunity was going to be limited both in 

time and scope.  With respect to scope -- and this is at 

page 11805 of the record -- what he said was that 

follow-up questioning would be permitted if it was 

reasonable and if it was related to the purposes for 

which the juror was brought before the bench. 

And just to paint the picture a little bit, 

the -- the potential jurors were brought before the bench, 

and they were left standing, which I think reinforced the 

conception that this was going to be a rather quick affair 

and it was not going to allow the kind of extensive, 

meaningful follow-up that we thought was required. 

And to give it a frame of reference, in the 

Oklahoma City bombing case, the prosecution of Timothy 

McVeigh, that proceeding was transferred from the city

of Oklahoma City to Denver, but even after the transfer, 

the trial judge conducted an 18-day voir dire with an 

average of 1 hour of interviews per juror; 18 days and 

1 hour as compared with 5 hours and 4 and a half minutes. 

And we think the Oklahoma City experience is much more 

befitting of the kind of voir dire that’s necessary in 

circumstances of community prejudice and passion of the 

kind that existed here. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You made a change of 

venue motion at the outset, right? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  We did.  We --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I'm unaware of any 

case in which we have said a change is mandatory when 

what's involved is money rather than life or limb.  Life 

or limb obviously was involved in the McVeigh case. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure, it was, Your Honor, 

and by no means would we in any way diminish the -- the 

profound human tragedy that accompanied the Oklahoma 

City case, but I think the reality of the sentiment on 

the ground in Houston was that Houston citizens, as we 

pointed out in our brief, in fact referred to the -- to 

what happened in the wake of the collapse of Enron in 

terms that were similar to the way they referred to 

terrorist attacks.  They -- they in fact talked about it 

in terms of the 9/11 attack. 

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what was remarkable 

about some of those questionnaires, there were a lot of 

people didn't read the newspapers.  There were a lot of 

people who indicated they really didn't know anything 

about this case. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's true, 

Justice Ginsburg, but I’d like to clarify one aspect 

of that, if I could, and that’s that our argument is not 

-- and it hasn't been at any point in this proceeding --

that pretrial publicity caused the passion and prejudice 

in the community.  This is -- is very much a case 

in which pretrial publicity was a symptom rather than the 

cause. 

Now, pretrial publicity, to be sure, stoked 

the passions that -- that already lay within the 

community, but really this was a case in which the 

passions existed regardless of pretrial publicity.  And 

I think the juror questionnaires and the surveys and all 

the other evidence that we put before the district 

court manifests that.  If you look at the juror 

questionnaires -- and they are -- there are several examples 

of situations in which particular jurors said that they 

were unaware of any of the pretrial publicity, they did 

not watch the news, they didn't read the newspapers, 

they hadn't seen the movies about Enron, but yet they

still said they had feelings about Jeff Skilling and Ken 

Lay. 

Juror 63, a person who wound up on the 

panel, is a good example of that.  She answered “no” to 

all the questions concerning her exposure to pretrial 

publicity, but then when she was asked whether she had 

views about the guilt or innocence of Jeff Skilling, she 

said yes, she did; and she elaborated on that by 

explaining that I think he probably knew he was breaking 

the law.  So this is a person who, notwithstanding a 

lack of exposure to pretrial publicity --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there was some 

follow-up to that. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  There -- there was a bit of 

follow-up to that, Your Honor, but I think the nature of the 

follow-up is -- is quite illuminating on what we think are 

some of the fatal flaws in this voir dire process.  The 

follow-up --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you really think that 

if -- if there had been a much more lengthy voir dire 

and if the trial judge had been more willing to -- to 

grant motions to dismiss for cause, that it would have 

-- that it would not have been possible to find a fair 

and impartial jury in the district? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, our first --

certainly, there should have been a more intensive voir 

dire, Justice Alito.  Now, our first order of submission 

is that the proceedings should have been transferred, 

not necessarily because there don't in fact exist or 

there didn't in fact exist 12 unbiased jurors in the 

city of Houston. 

Our point is a different one, and that is 

that in conditions where you have the level of passion 

and prejudice that permeated the Houston community, 

there’s too great a risk that the process of voir dire 

and particularly the ordinary process of voir dire 

wouldn't be successful in identifying those 12 people. 

That's the danger. 

And the other problem with the argument that 

the government makes with respect to the fact that there 

are 4 and a half million citizens in Houston, which I think 

is part of Your Honor's question, is that that would mean 

more if the trial judge had gone deeper into the jury 

pool than the mere 46 jurors he did interview.  Because 

when he interviewed those 46 and stopped at that point, 

what we were left with was a jury panel as to which 

there was too great a danger of bias, too great a danger 

that they would bring their biases to bear with them in 

adjudicating Petitioner's guilt.

judge must grant a transfer if the judge is satisfied 

that a prejudice against -- that so great a prejudice 

against the defendant exists in the transferring 

district that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and 

impartial trial there. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Correct. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, doesn't that suggest 

that if you could find a fair and impartial jury with an 

adequate voir dire, then the transfer need not be 

granted? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think it has to be 

read against the context of whether we can be confident 

that you can find that fair and impartial jury.  I think in 

any -- I think we would say that in any community in 

which there is 4 and a half million people, there may, 

in fact, be 12 individuals who aren't so biased that they 

can't sit.  The real danger, though, is that the ordinary 

process of voir dire, as this Court's decisions 

repeatedly recognize, in Mu'Min, in Patton, and Murphy 

and others, the ordinary process of voir dire in that 

situation can't be trusted to identify those people. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because you think --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  And that’s the danger here.

MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, no.  No, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  With respect, that's not -- that's 

not the only danger.  I mean, that's -- that's part of 

it, but I think there's -- there's other ones that we 

would put forward before that one. 

There’s two in particular:  First, in a 

community like Houston, in the state of the -- the 

passion and prejudice that existed in Houston at the 

time of this trial, there’s a real concern that jurors 

will not feel fully free to return to that community 

delivering anything other than the conviction for which 

the -- the community desires.  And that, I think, is an 

important concern that this Court's decisions identify. 

And the other one, and this is in Murphy in 

particular, where there’s a substantial share of the 

community that's impassioned and prejudiced, as this one 

was, there’s a concern that even jurors who don't lay 

bare -- who don't affirmatively acknowledge their

biases -- are unwittingly subject to the same biases 

that permeate the community.  And that sort of danger is 

-- is the reason that in these situations, we think 

transfer is required. 

But even if transfer wasn't required, what 

needed to happen was a more extensive and intensive voir 

dire than happened here.  The voir dire was deficient --

and Justice Ginsburg, this gets back to your question 

about juror 63.  The voir dire was deficient in at least 

this respect.  In conditions like those that permeated 

Houston, we think it's error to accept the assurance of 

fairness of a juror who has already laid bare their 

biases. 

Now, juror 63, for example, she said she 

thinks she knew that Jeff Skilling -- she thinks that 

Jeff Skilling knew he was breaking the law.  This is 

someone as to whom we ought to be very concerned.  In 

our view, that person shouldn't get --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there a challenge for 

cause against her? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  There -- there wasn't a 

specific challenge for cause against her, Your Honor, 

but -- but again, we challenged everybody on the basis 

that voir dire wouldn't adequately ferret out biases in 

this case.  And then we did challenge -- as Justice 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Sotomayor's question about the six specific challenges 

that we lodged at the close of the voir dire, but before the 

jurors were sworn -- juror 63 was one of those jurors. 

And so I think it was evident that juror 63 

was not at all somebody who we were satisfied with.  And 

the reason is, if you look at the nature of -- at the 

voir dire colloquy with her, the trial court asked her 

about that statement and asked her:  You remember 

making this statement?  Do you still feel that way?  And 

her response was:  I don't know. 

And then she acknowledged: I have no further 

information to bring to bear on that question than I did 

then.  And at that point, she has only fortified the 

bias that she brought with her, but the trial court was 

unsatisfied, and he continued to press.  And then he asked 

her at some point:  Can you apply the presumption of 

innocence?  And she said yes.  And then that was it. 

But in our view, a -- a search for a --

-- what I think can fairly be described as a rote 

assurance of fairness can't be sufficient, given the 

very evident danger that someone like juror 63, who has 

already laid bare her biases, would bring her biases 

with her to the panel when she adjudicated Petitioner's 

guilt or innocence.

your opinion, if we agreed with your basic idea -- if, 

which is totally hypothetical. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  If we agreed with that, how 

would we sketch the lines?  That is, when does the 

jury -- does the judge have to do more than is ordinary, 

and what counts as more than ordinary?  I mean, I --

what I have fear of, to put it out for you, is that jury 

selection can go on a very long time. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And judges have to -- have 

to run their trials.  And if we tell the judges that 

they have got to do more, that will become exaggerated, 

and they’ll administer it in a way that will make it 

hard to select juries. 

That's the harm I'm worried about.  So I'm 

asking you, how would you sketch a line that prevents 

that harm? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Breyer, it is by 

nature a contextual inquiry.  The standard that this 

Court has articulated to identify the circumstances in 

which this sort of extra -- I think -- precaution is 

necessary is that there has to be, a quote, "wave of 

public passion," close quote, and that's the language 

that the Court has used in a number of its decisions.

public passion --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Wave --

half? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Wave of public passion, and 

I guess the substrata that I would put beneath that, 

especially for this category of cases, is pervasive 

animus directed towards the defendant as responsible for 

a harm felt by the entire community. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, what's the 

second half?  The second half, which I'm really worried 

about, is that we get into the business of running the

trial court's trials.  So I want to know what it is that 

the trial court at that stage, in your opinion, other 

than transfer, has to do? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think what the trial 

court has to do is two things, Your Honor:  First, for a 

juror who has laid bare his or her biases, that juror 

should not be allowed on the panel, and an assurance of 

fairness from that sort of juror isn't enough.  At the 

very least, Your Honor, on this category -- and then I’ll 

go to my second point -- in a situation in which a 

juror has laid bare his or her biases, we think that 

juror shouldn't be seated. 

But if you’re going to entertain the 

thought of seating that person, at the very least this has to 

happen:  They have to be forced to confront their assurance 

of fairness as against the many statements of bias that 

they may have uttered. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens if -- I gather --

that a -- that a trial judge has a panel in front of him and 

people say, yes, I think he is guilty?  And -- and the 

trial judge says, now, if you listen to the presumption, 

can you be fair?  You look him in the eye, and if he says, 

yes, I can put this aside, trial judges do accept those 

jurors. 

Now, if that is the practice, and others

would know more than me, then our -- our -- I'm 

worried about changing that ordinary practice. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  To be clear, Justice Breyer, 

that ordinary practice would only be altered in the very 

rare category of cases that involve a wave of public 

passion.  And -- and they would be altered in the 

following respect:  That if somebody had laid bare their 

biases, the -- in our view, what should happen is that 

you should move to the next juror. 

But even if you didn't do that, at least the 

following should happen, Justice Breyer, and that is 

that when somebody utters an assurance of fairness, that 

itself shouldn't be enough when the community is 

permeated with the sorts of biases that attended this 

proceeding.  The jurors should at least be forced to 

reconcile their previous statements of bias with their 

utterance of fairness. 

The other point I would make is this:  That 

the danger that this Court has identified in conditions 

like those that pervaded the Houston community is that 

even with prospective jurors who don't affirmatively 

acknowledge their biases, there’s a danger that they 

may have biases they haven't brought to the fore.  And 

we think what can't happen is what the trial judge did 

in this case, which is to refuse to question any of the

jurors on the basis of any response they gave in the 

questionnaire, other than responses that raised a red 

flag. 

And we think if you curtail the inquiry in 

that regard, it doesn't allow for the sort of voir dire 

that's necessary to in order to be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I look at --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- in order to ferret out 

biases that may be latent. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any place in 

the record I could look to see questions that you would 

have posed absent the judge's limitations? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  There are, Justice 

Sotomayor.  There’s at R 12036, I think, is an --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I sorry.  R 12036 is an 

important document, which is our renewed motion for 

change of venue and related relief.  And that was after 

the questionnaire responses had been received. 

And the point we made in that document is 

that as a consequence of the questionnaire responses, we 

already knew that a great deal of bias permeated the 

venire.  And we proposed not only that the proceedings 

should be transferred, but also that a different 

sort of voir dire should be conducted than the one that

the trial court envisioned.  And we laid out in that 

motion the sorts of things that we thought should be 

done. 

And we did that in other places as well, 

Your Honor, but I think that would be a good place to 

look.  But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, can I --

perhaps it's time for you to shift gears, if I could --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and move to 

the statutory question. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't understand 

why it's difficult.  The statute prohibits “scheme to 

deprive another of the intangible right of honest 

services.”  Skilling owed the Enron shareholders honest 

services.  He acted dishonestly in a way that harmed 

them.  But I don't understand the difficulty. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

think part of the problem with that sort of rendition is 

that that -- I think nobody suggests that any dishonest 

conduct falls within the compass of this law, that no 

pre-McNally case suggests that.  And I think the 

government doesn’t takes that position, either. 

If it did --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, there has to 

be -- there has to be a right to honesty.  In other 

words, it's not just in the abstract.  And the 

shareholders had a right to his honest services. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  But I don't think that 

you’ve advanced the ball, with all due respect, that much 

by saying there has a right to honest services, because I 

think what -- at the end of the day, what that would mean 

is that any situation in which there’s a fiduciary duty 

or even if there’s not a fiduciary duty, but at least 

any situation in which there is a fiduciary duty, a 

nondisclosure of deception would give rise to a 

Federal felony prosecution. 

And that has never been the understanding 

under pre-McNally case law, and that shouldn't be the 

understanding now, because its sweep is breathtaking, and 

it's not something that we would ordinarily construe 

Congress to have intended. 

Now, I think in -- in this case, there’s 

several objections we have to the application of the 

honest services fraud statute to this case.  We think 

the statute is unconstitutionally vague.  We think it's 

particularly vague as applies to -- as applied to anything 

beyond the narrow category of bribes and kickbacks. 

But I think in some ways the most

straightforward way to understand why the honest 

services fraud statute can't be applied validly in this 

case is to appreciate what I think is an evolution in 

the government's theory.  And -- and at the time of 

Weyhrauch -- and this is at page 48 of the government's 

brief in Weyhrauch, just a few months ago.  The government 

said that the honest services fraud statute, quote, 

“Nor does it cover an official whose interest is public 

knowledge.” 

So, at that point, I think we -- we would have 

believed that the honest services fraud statute can't be 

applied to Jeff Skilling, because his interest, as the 

government acknowledges, was public knowledge. 

But the position that the government has 

taken now is that even though his interest was 

disclosed, he didn't disclose that he was acting in 

pursuit of that interest at the expense of the 

employer's interests, which I read to be contrary to the 

position that they took in the Weyhrauch case and, I 

think, which is problematic in two respects. 

First, there is no pre-McNally 

understanding, none, that a disclosed interest can give 

rise to honest services liability.  And, second, and 

maybe more importantly --

disclosed interest? 

Official 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  A disclosed interest, where 

the interest is disclosed.  All the cases dealt with 

situations in which the interest is undisclosed, as the 

government suggested would be the case in the Weyhrauch 

brief. 

But -- but perhaps even more importantly, 

there is no pre-McNally understanding to the effect 

that acting in pursuit of an interest in compensation 

can give rise to honest services liability.  And, in 

fact, in a post-McNally case, the Thompson case 

out of the -- out of the Seventh Circuit, Judge 

Easterbrook, we think, explained persuasively why 

pursuit of an interest in personal compensation 

shouldn't afford the gravamen of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I thought part of 

the government's theory was not --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- an honest services 

prosecution. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- wasn't limited to the 

compensation.  It was essentially Skilling owned shares, 

and he had information that those shares were inflated. 

Shareholders owned shares.  They didn't have that 

information.  Skilling then sold those shares at a great 

profit to himself.  And the shareholders were left

without that information.  And then when the stock 

price plummeted, they all lost out. 

I thought that the government was not 

limiting the -- its position to the compensation, but was 

also dealing with the share price. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think, Justice Ginsburg, 

the government's theory on how the honest services fraud 

statute applies in this case is laid out at page 49 

and 50.  And the interest that the government identifies 

that was furthered by Petitioner Skilling's action is 

his interest in compensation.  That's -- that's how the 

government, I think, describes it. 

And the -- it's true, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What 49 and 50?  Of the 

government's brief? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Of the government's brief. 

And it's true, Your Honor, that the 

deception that they identify has to do with securities 

fraud.  And I'll bracket for the moment that we think 

that the honest services fraud theory that was put 

before the jury is not at all commensurate with the one 

that’s being asserted now. 

But even if you take as a given that it's 

the theory now, the elements of honest services fraud 

under the government's theory are that the individual

would act in pursuit of his interest in his own 

compensation at the expense of the employer's interests 

in acquiring better information with which to make an 

informed decision. 

And one of the fundamental problems we see 

with that approach is that it would threaten to convert 

almost any lie in the workplace into an honest services 

fraud prosecution for the following --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I --

I just don't 

-- because I'm looking at page 50.  I thought this 

discussion goes from 50 to 52, and that the part on 52 

certainly homes in on the share -- the shares. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It -- it does, Your Honor, 

but the interest at issue -- and I'm reading from page 

50.  This is in the middle of the first full paragraph 

on page 50.  The government says, “That constitute” --

“That conduct constituted fraud.”  The only question here is 

whether the public nature of petitioner's compensation 

scheme prevents his conduct from constituting honest 

services fraud.” 

And then they go on:  “Although the” --

“Although petitioner's basic compensation scheme was 

public, his scheme to artificially inflate the 

company's stock price by misrepresenting its financial 

condition, in order to derive additional personal 

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

benefits” -- i.e., his compensation -- “at the expense of 

shareholders, was not” disclosed. 

So I think the theory of application here is 

that because he was acting allegedly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why -- why do you put in 

the "i.e."?  Additional personal benefits could be both. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Because the stock is the 

compensation, Your Honor.  There's -- there's no -- I 

think, in this sort of situation, there’s not a 

disaggregation between the stock and the compensation. 

The stock was intimately tied to his compensation, and 

the personal benefit that, I think, was being received 

was that compensation interest. 

I mean, the government can clarify that, but 

that's my understanding of the government's view. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think we’ll ask the 

government to do that. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  And the danger with that theory 

is that it would have the capacity to convert almost any 

workplace lie into a Federal felony, for the following 

reason:  That, in a variety of situations, an employee 

might -- might engage in an act of deception to his 

employer with respect to a work-related matter.  For 

example, suppose that there is an employer policy that 

says you can only use workplace computers for business

purposes, and when asked, the employee says that he is 

only using it for business purposes, but he is in fact 

using it for personal reasons.  Well, at that point he 

will have made a deception to the employer.  Arguably, 

it would be material, particularly given that it acts in 

the face of an employer policy, and it arguably was made 

in furtherance of the employer's personal interest in 

maximizing his compensation at the expense of the -- at 

the expense of the employer's interests in having better 

information with which to make an informed decision 

about the employee's future. 

So for that reason as well, we think that 

the application of the honest services fraud --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What you've just 

explained is why you think the statute is very broad. 

You haven't explained why it's vague. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, there are two 

different arguments, Your Honor.  Our threshold 

submission is the statute is unconstitutionally vague, 

and we believe that it's particularly vague as applied 

to a category that extends beyond bribes and kickbacks. 

And I haven't been through those arguments, but they're 

-- they’re spelled out in our briefs. 

Now, with respect to the remaining category, 

which is undisclosed self-dealing, even that category we

particularly problematic when it's applied to the realm 

of compensation for the reasons that I have outlined.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

When Judge Lake approached this case with 

the question of how to select a jury, he had 15 years of 

experience in selecting juries, and he informed the 

parties that it was his experience that voir dire 

conducted by the trial judge is more effective at 

eliciting the potential biases of a juror than the 

oftentimes tendentious voir dire that’s conducted by 

the parties. 

He did not ignore the fact that the Enron 

collapse had a significant impact on the Houston 

community.  He worked with the parties to develop a 14-

page questionnaire, which I encourage the Court to look 

at, if the Court has not already done so.  It's 

extraordinarily detailed.  It has more than 70 questions

designed to ferret out any possible connections between

for their views about the Enron collapse.  It asked for

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me of any

voir dire, and I think there is really --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There's no problem?  I went 

through the 200 pages, and I counted -- this is only my 

own subjective recounting of it, but I counted six of 

whom only one lasted, but I counted five others that 

they had to use peremptories on that include one juror, 

29, who herself was a victim of this offense to the tune 

of $50,000 or $60,000.  The judge said:  I will not 

challenge her for cause. 

I counted another, juror -- what's this one

-- juror number -- number’s 74, who when he looked her 

square in the eye and said, "Can you be fair?"  She said, 

"I can't say yes for sure.  No." 

Okay?  So, in my own subjective account, there 

were five here, maybe six, certainly three, that perhaps 

if they'd had an appeal on peremptories, which 

apparently they don't, they might have said these should 

have been challenged for cause.  So I’m concerned about 

the 5 hours, about the lack of excusal for cause, about 

the very, very brief questions that he provided to 

people who had said on the questionnaire they could 

be -- they could be biased.  They said we think he's 

guilty, for example. 

And all those are cause for concern.  At the 

same time, I’m worried about controlling too much a 

trial judge.  I’ve expressed those concerns.  I know 

this is a special case.  Half, almost, of the jury 

questionnaires they just threw out.  And the 

community -- you know all the arguments there.  You see 

what's worrying me.  And I’m worried about a fair trial 

in this instance and to say -- and I'm genuinely worried, 

and -- and I’d like to hear your response to the kind of 

thing I'm bringing up. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Breyer, I think

that a full reading of the voir dire reveals that 

individuals sitting from this vantage point with a cold 

record who were not there may have different viewpoints 

about --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I’d never heard of an 

instance where a trial judge would not challenge for 

cause -- but I'm not saying it doesn't happen -- where the 

juror herself is a victim of the offense to the tune of 

$50,000 to $60,000.  See, we are getting into an area that 

I'm not familiar with, but I think that that's not 

supposed to be. 

MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that there’s 

any per se disqualification.  But even if there was, 

that juror did not sit, and this Court held in 

United States v. Martinez-Salazar that one of the 

purposes of peremptories is to protect against the 

occasional accidental error. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How -- but is it 

occasional or accidental?  I think that’s what Justice 

Breyer is getting at.  With such a truncated voir dire 

and one in which the judge basically said to the lawyers, 

I'm not giving you much leeway at all, how can we be 

satisfied that there was a fair and impartial jury picked 

when the judge doesn't follow up on a witness who says, 

I'm a victim of this fraud?  I don't know -- I would find

it strange that we would permit jurors who are victims of 

the crime to serve as jurors. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, none sat in this case. 

I don't think there is any claim that they did. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but -- but the judge 

didn't strike her for cause.  So isn't that symptomatic 

of not following through adequately? 

MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that a -- what 

this Court may perceive as an error in the denial of one 

for-cause challenge --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but it's not just one. 

There were like five, of which I have given you the 

worst, and they had to use up all their peremptories. 

And they can't appeal this.  And it's that taken 

together, plus the one who sat, juror 11, provides, as 

they point out for the reasons they say, some cause for 

concern.  And that's what I'm trying to get at. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Breyer, I think 

that reading the entire voir dire reflects that the 

judge was interested in determining whether these jurors 

were qualified to sit.  He was not interested in having 

the voir dire used as a lobbying or a argumentative 

exercise by the lawyers.  And as a result, he relied on 

the very extensive questionnaires to pinpoint the 

examples of areas in which further questioning was

necessary.  And then he went and he, I think, did fairly 

allow sufficient inquiry into whether these jurors could 

sit.  And I think one of the best examples of that is 

actually juror number 63, who Petitioner says was not

illustrates -- and this is in the Joint Appendix at page 

935a and then following -- is that, as this Court has 

remarked many times, the question of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Excuse me.  What was the 

page?  Nine --

MR. DREEBEN:  935a.  This is in volume 2 of 

the Joint Appendix. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Go ahead with it, but they 

didn't challenge 63 for cause, so I guess they waived 

it. 

MR. DREEBEN:  They did not challenge 63 for 

cause, but they -- but they came to this Court today and 

tried to use 63 as an object lesson of what was wrong 

with the voir dire.  I actually think juror 63 

illustrates not only what was right with the voir dire, 

but the immense distortion that Petitioners have 

attempted to perpetrate by putting together effectively 

a highlight reel of every bad headline in every Houston 

publication and claiming that the entire jurisdiction, 

all 4.5 million people virtually, were infected with

some sort of a pervasive prejudice that could not be 

ferreted out in voir dire. 

If you look at what happened in juror number 

63, she happens to be a 24-year-old who comes to court. 

She filled out a questionnaire that she said:  I can be 

impartial.  She did have the statement:  I -- I think that 

probably Skilling is guilty of some crime.  When the 

voir dire proceeds, it turns out that she's not one of 

these jurors who has been in the Houston culture 

pervasively exposed to what Petitioner says is 

prejudicial publicity.  She was living in Austin at the 

time, going to school. 

Then she's asked, “Are you watching major 

networks?”  And she says, “No, I don't really watch the 

news at all.  I'm a turtle person.” 

“Do you recall anything that may have --

you've seen -- that you may have seen or heard on 

television about this case?”  “No.” 

And then the judge, after some more questioning 

about her that reveals that, among other things, Ken Lay 

is a member of the country club that her parents belong 

to, he asks her about the very question that Petitioners 

focus on as problematic:  “Do you have any opinion about 

the guilt or innocence -- and you say, I think they probably 

were breaking the law?”

And her answer is:  "I don't know.  The only 

thing I can say is, anything I've ever heard even 

peripherally has not been, you know -- but that's what 

people say and, I mean, it's hard to know.  People don't 

know what they are talking about." 

And the judge says, “Well, I'm just trying 

to find out what you think.”  She says, "I don't have an 

opinion either way." 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's try juror number --

let's try 76:  Judge:  "Here's the detail that really 

concerns me.  You said, 'I think they're all guilty.'" 

"Right." 

"Now, there's nothing wrong with thinking 

that, if that's what you really think.  You just need to 

tell us that.” 

“Okay.” 

“That's what you think, isn't it?” 

“It's been a long time since I answered that 

questionnaire.” 

“Right.  Now, as you" --

Okay?  Now, that’s -- that, as far as I could tell, 

is as close as I can get to a recantation of what she 

thought originally.

long ago as Chief Justice Marshall in the Burr case --

that people come to court with opinions in highly 

publicized cases.  We expect our jurors to be somewhat 

informed of civic affairs.  They receive information 

through the media or through their friends, and they have 

light opinions.  And they come to court, and the trial 

judge instructs them:  This is a legal proceeding; you’re 

going to hear evidence in court.  What happened 

outside of the courtroom no longer matters.  What 

matters is what has been presented in here.  I'm going 

to instruct you that defendants have a presumption of 

innocence.  Can you follow that? 

And then the judge is the only person on the 

scene.  We're not there, the court of appeals is not 

there; the judge is the only person on the scene to 

judge the jurors' inflection, the jurors' demeanor, the 

jurors' apprehension of the seriousness of the duty. 

And this Court has held that the standard for review of 

a determination of no removable bias for cause is 

manifest error. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Were -- were these 

colloquies that are reported, the -- the pages we have 

just been reviewing, heard by the entire jury pool?

the person -- the juror was standing in front of the bench 

for this? 

MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct, Justice 

Kennedy.  This was not a case like Mu'Min, where in your 

concurrence -- your dissent, you pointed out that the 

colloquy occurred in the full presence of the -- of 

every other juror, and there was no individualized voir 

dire.  Here there was individualized voir dire.  Judge 

Lake had that juror right in front of him, eyeball to 

eyeball, and was able to make the kind of credibility 

assessment, taking into account all of the context, that 

no other judge can do. 

And it's not to say that there’s no judicial 

review of that on appeal.  In the Irvin case, Irvin v. 

Dowd, which is really the Court's first case in this 

line, the Court noticed that there -- 90 percent of the 

jurors had an opinion that the defendant was guilty.  It 

involved a highly sensationalized murder in rural 

counties in southern Indiana.  There was a barrage of 

pretrial publicity.  Eight of the 12 jurors said they had 

an opinion that the defendant was guilty. 

The Court, after meticulously reviewing the 

voir dire, concluded that the judge had committed 

manifest error in accepting the representations of the 

jurors that they could be impartial.  But this is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's hard for me to think 

that the voir dire would have been much shorter even if 

there had been no showing of pervasive prejudice. 

MR. DREEBEN:  I think that what Judge --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Five hours sounds to me 

about standard for a case of this difficulty. 

MR. DREEBEN:  I -- I think that's not 

necessarily correct at all, and it would not have been 

the case that in a normal trial there would have been as 

detailed a 14-page questionnaire as there was in this 

case, that was designed to elicit any and all 

connections to Enron. 

Now, whether there may have been some 

individualized mistakes along the way, whether some of 

us would have preferred that the voir dire be more 

extensive, is not the issue; and unless this Court is 

prepared to set standards that are based either on a 

stopwatch or some sort of, you know, notion of how many 

days voir dire has to occur, it's going to be very 

difficult to administer a standard that says this was 

too little. 

The Oklahoma City bombing case, it is true, 

took many, many days, but that was a capital case, and I

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It took many 

days after it had been transferred. 

MR. DREEBEN:  It did, and Denver itself was 

exposed, probably almost as much as Oklahoma City, to 

the pretrial publicity, and a terrorist act of that 

magnitude, Mr. Chief Justice, really strikes at the 

heart of the entire nation.  Judge Matsch, who sits in 

Denver --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It was very -- the 

atmosphere in Oklahoma City was very different from that 

anywhere else, in terms of the impact of the bombing on 

that particular community. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Agreed.  It was 168 deaths. 

Many of them were children.  There was a sense of -- of 

victimization in the part of the community that I don't 

think is comparable to what happened with a financial 

meltdown in Houston, a 4.5 million city with a robust 

economy and a trial that took place 4 years later, 

after numerous other Enron trials had already taken 

place in Houston, resulting in favorable verdicts for 

defendants, mistrials, acquittals of one defendant. 

This very trial itself of Mr. Skilling 

resulted in nine acquittals on insider trading counts. 

Now, if you would think that the jury had some sort of 

41 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

a substratum of subterranean bias that was ineradicable by 

the conventional techniques of voir dire that we have been 

using for 200 years, then insider trading where the 

defendant pockets personally, as a result of the 

exploitation of insider information -- you would think 

that would be the first place the jurors would go to vent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no, no.  No. 

They’d go to the statute that says honest services --

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  It seems --

it seems -- I'm being flip.  It seems that that's where 

you would focus your attention, if you think your community 

has essentially been fleeced by somebody because of his 

dishonesty. 

MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think so, 

Mr. Chief Justice, because the honest services component 

actually, and the component of this trial, was really a 

subset of the securities fraud.  The essential gravamen 

of Petitioner's crimes were lying to Enron, lying to its 

shareholders about the health of the company in a 

financial sense, when, in fact, he knew that he had been 

engaging in numerous manipulations of earnings and 

schemes that are detailed in the briefs, in order to 

avoid Enron having to recognize that portions of its 

business were imploding.

And the victimization was of shareholders. 

That was expressed through securities fraud; it was 

expressed through insider trading.  There were counts 

involving liars -- lying to auditors, and one object of a 

multi-count conspiracy charge involved an honest services 

object as well as a money or property fraud object, and 

as well as a securities fraud object. 

Now, in our view Petitioner has essentially 

conceded that the honest services statute is not vague 

as applied and, therefore, facially unconstitutional.  He 

all but acknowledges that bribes and kickbacks, which 

constitute the bulk of pre-McNally honest services 

cases, can be defined with precision.  There is not an 

unconstitutional vagueness in it.  And so I think at a 

minimum --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, a concession that a 

bribe or a kickback scheme statute would not be vague is 

hardly a concession that this statute as written is not 

vague.  In fact, I thought that was the point.  The 

point is that the Court shouldn't rewrite the statute; 

that's for the Congress to do. 

MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that in this 

case, Justice Kennedy, the Court needs to rewrite the 

statute so much as to recognize that what happened in 

McNally was this Court said that the mail fraud statute 

43

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

has two clauses, scheme to defraud and scheme for 

obtaining money or property by false representations and 

pretenses.  The government's position, in accordance with 

all of the lower courts, was that these two clauses set 

forth two separate crimes.  Scheme to defraud was not 

limited to money or property.  This Court disagreed, and 

it said, oh, yes, it was. 

And what Congress did in responding was to 

invoke words that had appeared in this Court's decision 

in McNally, in the dissent written by Justice Stevens, 

in the lower court opinions, and intentionally -- as 

this Court put it in Cleveland v. United States -- cover 

one of the intangible rights that the lower courts had recognized 

before McNally, and that was the right to -- intangible 

right of honest services.  And in the context of the 

pre-McNally honest services cases, that was well known 

to include at its core the bribery and kickback cases 

and, in the additional category, nondisclosure of a 

personal, conflicting, substantial interest. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, suppose you have a 

statute that -- that makes it criminal to -- to do any 

bad thing, okay?  Now it's clear that murder would be 

covered.  All right?  Nobody would say that murder is 

not covered by that.  Does -- does that make the statute 

non-vague?

pick something that everybody would agree comes within a 

denial of honest services, doesn't -- doesn't mean that 

when you say nothing but honest services, you’re saying 

something that -- that has sufficient content to -- to 

support a criminal prosecution. 

MR. DREEBEN:  But this is not like a 

statute, Justice Scalia, that says prohibiting any bad 

thing.  It's a statute that responded to a decision of 

this Court in which a term of art, the intangible 

right of honest services, featured prominently.  And 

Congress has --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And there were cases that 

-- that -- some of which included bribery, but others of 

which included a variety of -- of other actions, some of 

which were allowed by some courts and some of which 

were disallowed by some courts.  There was no solid 

content to what McNally covered. 

MR. DREEBEN:  I think that there was a solid 

enough content for this Court to be able to respond to 

the McNally decision by giving shape to the crime in 

accordance with the paradigm cases that the lower courts 

had done and logical implications of those cases, just 

as if it had concluded, in accordance with Justice

Stevens's dissent, that the statute did protect 

intangible rights in the phrase “scheme to defraud.” 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if -- if you’re 

going to say that the statute refers to a term of art, 

the whole point of a term of art is that it’s a shorthand 

for defining something.  And then -- but if you’re 

saying that it's a term of art that means the 

pre-McNally case law over the -- you know, all the 

different circuits and the district courts and that some 

knowledge of that, it -- it's descriptive of 

something, but it's not a term of art. 

MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's a term of art in 

the sense that it referred to a -- a body of law that 

until quite recently, when defendants began making 

vagueness arguments, was understood to refer to the kinds 

of schemes that had been prosecuted before this Court 

held that "scheme to defraud" was limited to money or 

property.  And it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I'm with you 

there.  But then the kinds of cases -- that's where it 

gets fuzzy.  I mean, you need lawyers and research 

before you get an idea of what the pre-McNally state of

intangible services, of honest services.  And I’m just

to be before you can say, you know what, when we tell 

you that right, you know that that's what it's referring 

to? 

MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's clear enough at 

the core, this Court can say so and can provide 

definition, and it can use its standard tools of 

interpretation of criminal statutes to dispose of cases 

that are at the periphery and ensure that there is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It kind of -- it 

puts the prospective defendant, I guess, in an awfully 

difficult position, though, if he has got to wait. 

There’s this common law evolution over time.  You have 

two cases the government wins, one it loses, three --

and he's supposed to keep track of that.  That doesn't 

sound like fair notice of what's criminal. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

don't think it puts a defendant in a very bad position 

at all, because this statute is only triggered when 

there's an intent to deceive, an intentional fraudulent 

act taken to deprive the victim of whatever right exists 

in question.

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the jury instruction, 

Justice Ginsburg, appears on page 1086a of the Joint 

Appendix.  That’s in volume 3 of the Joint Appendix. 

And I will describe the jury instruction, too, but I 

want to say at the outset that this jury instruction was 

drafted against the background of Fifth Circuit law, 

which I think did take a somewhat broader view of the 

honest services crime than the government has taken in 

this Court, and it has to be read against that 

background. 

But the -- the instruction said that “to show 

that defendants deprived Enron and its shareholders of 

their right of honest services, the government must prove 

beyond a reasonable doubt that, in rendering some 

particular service or services, the defendant knew that 

his actions were not in the best interests of Enron and 

its shareholders or that he consciously contemplated or 

intended such actions, and that Enron and its 

shareholders suffered a detriment from the defendant's 

breach of his duty to render honest services.” 

So -- and this was against a background --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it's circular, isn't 

it? 

MR. DREEBEN:  The -- I would agree, 

Justice Scalia.  I’ve read this phrase many times, and

it does seem a little circular to me. 

Official 

The introduction to this jury instruction says, 

"Honest services are the services required by the defendant's 

fiduciary duty to Enron and its shareholders under State law." 

So this was tried in a circuit that followed the State law 

principle that’s at issue in the Weyhrauch case.  The 

government defined the fiduciary duty in that way. 

But the essence of the fraud was that -- that Petitioner 

had a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of Enron to act 

in their best interests, and he betrayed that by acting 

contrary to the best interests of the shareholders, 

fraudulently upholding the price, and ultimately that 

constituted the crime. 

Now, I think there's a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that covers the 

case that your friend put of the employee using the 

computer for personal use?  That fits under this 

instruction? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, whether the employee had 

a fiduciary duty in that respect would be, I think, quite 

a litigable question.  This case doesn't involve any 

subtle or arcane fiduciary duty.  This is one of the 

basic fiduciary duties that any chief executive has, not 

to lie to shareholders about the financial condition of 

the company.

fiduciaries have a sort of heightened duty towards

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I look in the 

Restatement of Agency, and they have a section that 

applies to fiduciaries and non-fiduciaries, both of whom 

are employees? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Normally, Justice Kennedy, no 

such complexities are necessary, and I think that this 

Court can resolve this case without introducing such 

complexities, because the core duties of loyalty that 

have formed the core of the honest services prosecutions 

are universal.  They are equally applicable to agency. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I would assume that any 

employee, even at the lowest level of the corporate 

structure, who has corporate property, a car or something, 

has a duty to protect that car for the employer. 

MR. DREEBEN:  But that's not an honest 

services case.  The honest services cases are about 

conflicting interests and the misuse of official 

position. 

I'm not even sure, in the personal computer 

use case, that the government could successfully show 

that the employee had misused his official position. 

This case is quite typical in that respect.  Petitioner

JUSTICE ALITO:  Were there any pre-McNally 

cases that involved a situation like this, where the 

benefit to the employee was in the form of the 

employee's disclosed compensation? 

MR. DREEBEN:  There were not to my 

knowledge, Justice Alito, and I would frankly 

acknowledge that this case is a logical extension of the 

basic principle that we have urged the Court to adopt in 

the nondisclosure cases.  And the Court can evaluate 

whether it believes that that is legitimately within the 

scope of an honest services violation or not.  But it 

should not obscure our fundamental submission, which is 

that there was a definable category of undisclosed 

conflict of interest cases, that a person furthered 

through his official actions that constituted 

honest services fraud.  A good example of that is United 

States v. Keane, which was a Seventh Circuit decision. 

Petitioner, in his reply brief, claims that 

Keane involved financial injury to Chicago as a result 

of an alderman's concealment of his interest in 

properties that the City was selling.  Actually there 

were three separate schemes in Keane.  In one of them, 

the court was quite clear that, even though the alderman 

got the same deal that every member of the public would

have gotten, it still was honest services fraud because 

he did not disclose his financial interest in that 

property to the council when the council was voting on 

it. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I -- the following 

hypothetical:  I'm a councilperson in a jurisdiction 

that’s considering a tax increase or a tax break, and I 

vote for the tax break, and I happen to have property 

that qualifies.  Is that a breach of the statute? 

MR. DREEBEN:  It may well be, Justice 

Sotomayor.  It depends, I think, on whether the tax break 

was something that basically all general members of the 

public were in a position to benefit from, which may 

well be the case if it's just a private residence, 

versus if it's a particularized business property 

interest that you have either acquired --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Please tell me what I 

look to, to discern -- if I'm a councilperson, to discern 

what needs to be disclosed or not disclosed? 

MR. DREEBEN:  I think in the first instance, 

you will inevitably, as a councilperson, turn to your 

local law.  And I think this brings up an important point 

that was discussed in the Weyhrauch decision, which is 

that the mail fraud statute does not criminalize 

breaches of duty without more.  There has to be a 

53 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

showing of scienter, of a mens rea element of intent to 

deceive.  And unless the government can point to 

something which shows that the individual knew that they had 

a duty to disclose and did not do that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So could --

MR. DREEBEN:  -- or -- if I could just 

finish this part of the answer -- or can point to 

circumvention-type activity, using of shell companies to 

conceal an interest, then the government is not going to 

be able to have an indictable case on honest services 

fraud.  And I think what --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't give me a 

whole lot of comfort, I mean, just because there’s an 

intent to deceive.  An intent to deceive can be the basis 

for -- for terminating a contract.  There's -- there's 

been fraud in the inducement or something of that sort. 

So I know I’m liable to have the contract terminated, and 

maybe for damages for the contract.  And you say:  And also, 

by the way, you know, you can go to jail for a number of 

years, because, oh, yes, it's very vague, but you 

intended to deceive, and that's all -- that's all you need 

to know. 

MR. DREEBEN:  But this Court has recognized 

in numerous cases, Justice Scalia, that a mens rea 

element requiring an intent to deceive, an intent to

violate the law, is exactly what helps prevent statutes 

that might otherwise be considered too vague from 

falling --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You can -- well, you focus 

on what you just put together.  You said intent to deceive, 

intent to violate the law.  I believe in another case, 

you’re saying they don't have to have an intent to violate 

the law because there was no State law that prohibited 

whatever was at issue. 

So is the government now saying -- which is a 

big difference -- that you cannot convict somebody unless 

they know, i.e., they intend to violate a law that 

forbids the conduct in which they are engaging, other 

than this honest services law, or are you not saying 

that? 

MR. DREEBEN:  I'm not saying that, 

Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You’re not saying that. 

MR. DREEBEN:  I'm saying that in the 

ordinary case --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Then if you're not saying 

that, what the person has to carry around with them 

is an agency treatise.

happens, Justice Breyer, is that unless the government 

does have some sort of legal platform like that to show 

that there was knowledge of a duty, it's not possible 

for the government to bring its proof to the court and 

establish that the individual acted with the requisite 

mens rea, unless there is activity that reveals an 

intent to circumvent the law and to withhold the 

information, as in Justice Sotomayor's example, 

information about a property interest that might well 

affect the deliberations of the council.  And that kind 

of evidence often requires use of offshore accounts --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, I mean, of course they 

intend to -- it's not the case that is obvious; it's the 

case that is not obvious that worries me, and --

MR. DREEBEN:  I don’t see any of those --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in the case that 

is not obvious, of course they intend to withhold 

information.  I agree with that.  But the problem is 

they don't know it's unlawful to do so. 

MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, I think if you 

look at the cases in which this has happened, there is --

there’s not like a deliberation on somebody's part -- oh, do 

I have to disclose or not disclose?  What these cases are, 

are really outright criminal conduct in the form of 

conflicting interests that every fiduciary knows you 

56 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

need to disclose this before you take official action to 

further that interest.  That --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dreeben, would you 

clarify the issue that came up:  Is the government's 

theory focused simply on the compensation or does it 

involve the sale of shares? 

MR. DREEBEN:  It involves the sale of shares 

as well.  That was part of the compensation, and it’s 

linked to it.  But, Justice Ginsburg, if you look at the 

government's opening statement in this case, the 

government opened by saying, “You will see that 

defendants Lay and Skilling knew few -- a few key facts 

about the true condition of Enron, facts that the investing 

public did not know.  With that information, defendants 

Lay and Skilling sold tens of millions of dollars of 

their own Enron stock.” 

And then continued:  “When an investor buys a 

share of stock, an investor buys some rights in a 

publicly traded company.  When an investor buys a share 

of stock, they buy the right to hear and receive truth 

from the chief executive officer.  And, importantly, they 

buy the right to have their interests placed ahead of 

the chief executor officer every day of the week.” 

So there was, baked into this case at the 

outset, the notion that these officials were not acting

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. 

A couple of quick points on the honest 

services fraud issue, and then a couple of points on the 

juror issue, if I might. 

With respect to honest services fraud, first 

of all, I think that the government pointed to the jury 

instruction -- and, Justice Ginsburg, this goes to some 

questions that you had raised -- I think what's clear from 

the capacious nature of the jury instruction that was issued 

in this case is that the elements that the government say 

make Jeff Skilling guilty of honest services fraud weren't 

put before the jury or required to be found by the jury. 

And for that reason alone, the conviction against Jeff 

Skilling ought to be overturned. 

Another point I'd make very quickly with 

respect to the sweep of the government's theory

concerning the workplace is, under our understanding, 

the duty of loyalty does extend to all employees.  It 

does, and, therefore, the theory that they assert should 

apply in this case, I think, has devastating 

implications for workplace relations. 

Now, with respect to the juror question, a 

couple of preliminary points, and then I’d like to 

walk the Court through just one aspect of the voir dire 

which I think exhibits the manifest flaws in the process 

the trial court conducted. 

With respect to the question about the 

issuance of questionnaires, questionnaires were also 

issued in the Timothy McVeigh case.  But I don't want to 

limit our comparison to Timothy McVeigh, because I think 

in response to some of the questions that were raised, I 

don't want to leave an impression that a multiple-day 

voir dire with the sort of extensive questioning that we 

think was required here is not in use in other cases 

that involve like crimes. 

In the Martha Stewart case, for example, 

which was a financial case, there were 6 days of voir 

dire and after a questionnaire was issued.  And in that 

case, the only reason you needed an extended voir dire 

was because of the celebrity status of the defendant. 

You didn't have the deep-seated community passion and 

59 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

prejudice that characterized the Houston venue in this 

case. 

So, I think it's not at all unusual to have 

that kind of extended voir dire, and, in fact, we would 

say it's absolutely necessary to assure that the 

defendant receives the fair and impartial jury to which 

he's entitled. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So either this was too 

little or Martha Stewart was too much? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think the former 

rather than the latter --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it's -- it’s 

a different model of it.  As Mr. Dreeben was explaining, 

if you have an experienced judge who goes through this 

all the time, I think it's reasonable for him to say:  Look, 

bring the person in front of me.  We’ve got a questionnaire. 

I can identify the problems, look him in the eye, and I’ve 

got a lot of experience picking a jury, and it's better to 

let me do it than to have the lawyers have 3 weeks to do it. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, you don't necessarily 

need all of that, Your Honor, but I think with respect 

to the way in which the district court, in fact, 

conducted this voir dire, if I could just take -- if I 

could just direct the Court's attention to one juror in

particular -- and, Justice Breyer, this is -- maps onto 

some of the points you were making.  This is juror 61, 

and the relevant exchange is at pages 931a to 932a of 

the Joint Appendix, which is at -- in -- in volume 2. 

And I think the way the trial court 

conducted the voir dire in this case exhibits the 

manifest flaws in his approach generally.  This is 

someone who at page 932a, it's revealed, answered the 

question whether she was angry, whether there was anger 

about Enron, with yes, quote -- it was, quote, “based out 

of greed, hurt a lot of innocent people.” 

And to paint the picture more fully, the 

person was also asked:  Do you have an opinion about the 

collapse of Enron?  To which the answer was, quote, “Yes, 

criminal, caused a huge shock wave which the entire 

community felt,” close quote. 

Now, at 931a at the top, she was asked the 

question whether she had the opinion about Mr. Lay and 

her answer was, quote, “Shame on him.” 

And then much of this was put before her in 

the course of the voir dire.  In the middle of page 

932a, the first answer -- she's asked the question:  “Can 

you presume as you start this trial that Mr. Lay is 

innocent?”  The answer is, “I hope so, but you know, I 

don't know.  I can't honestly answer that one way or

another.”

JUSTICE BREYER:  Then on 932, she does answer 

it, and says, “He's assumed innocent.”  “And can you 

conscientiously carry out that assumption?”  “I could 

honestly say I will give it my best.” 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Not until --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And so the judge looks her 

in the eye and says -- fine. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, not -- not until this 

happens first, Justice Breyer, between 932a and 933a. 

And so she's asked, “So that might -- might your views 

about Ken Lay cloud your judgment relative to criminal 

responsibility?” 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.  And I'll --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  And her answer is --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll read that again.  But my 

question is, can we get a hold of these 238 questionnaires? 

Are they in the record in front of us? 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  I believe that they are.  I 

think that they’re certainly in the record before the court 

of appeals.  So I think that they are.
