CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
first this morning in Case 12-123, Horne v. Department 
of Agriculture. 

Mr. McConnell? 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. McCONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

There's a surprising number of difficult 

merits questions lurking in this case, mostly involving 
whether there was a taking, and if so, how it should be 
conceptualized and valued. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I -- could I just 

stop you on a factual matter --

MR. McCONNELL:  Certainly. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- because it has 

confused me.  As I look at the captions of the cases, 
there appear to be two different partnerships:  One 
partnership, known as Raisin -- doing business as Raisin 
Valley Farms, has Mr. Horne and his wife as the 
partners. 

Larsen Valley, the producer -- not the 

producer, the handler -- has four other, the Hornes,

plus two other people.  So who owns the raisins?  Isn't 
that the first partnership of the husband and wife?  And 
isn't the handler a second partnership that does the 
business of handling? 

Page 4 

MR. McCONNELL:  The other two partners in 

Lassen were Laura Horne's parents, now deceased. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the estates have 

been substituted. 

MR. McCONNELL:  Substituted.  That's right. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So isn't it two legal 

entities, one who owns and one who handles?  One 
partnership produces, one partnership handles? 
MR. McCONNELL:  The Department of 

Agriculture did not distinguish among them. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I don't care if 
they did or they didn't.  I mean, we should know.  Are 
they two separate legal entities?  One who produces --
MR. McCONNELL:  They are separate -- they 

are separate legal entities, all effectively controlled 
by the same family. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's -- you 

know, in the cat -- you get some limited liability by 
creating separate entities, so the creature who owns is 
one partnership, and the -- and the entity that 
produces, that handles, is a second one.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume this is one of 

Page 5

those difficult merits questions you were alluding to, 
it doesn't go to whether there's jurisdiction, but to 
whether the claim of a taking can be asserted by the 
partnership in question, isn't it? 

MR. McCONNELL:  That's right, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't see how 

it goes to jurisdiction, which is the only question 
before us. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it does to my mind 

because what is the claim, assuming that the producer 
owns -- the producer entity owns the raisins.  What 
exactly is being taken from the handlers?  Is it the 
percentage -- it can't be the raisins because they don't 
own them. 

MR. McCONNELL:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, 

I'm -- I'm delighted to preview our -- our argument on 
the merits on that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What -- what do they 

own? 

MR. McCONNELL:  So the -- so the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What is it that's being 

taken from the handler entity?

issued against the -- the Hornes in their capacity as a 
handler only, so the entire fine was paid by them.  None 
of the fine is attributable to anyone in their capacity 
as a producer. 

Page 6 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So go back. 
What is the -- what was taken from them -- you're saying 
it's just the fine, that the fine is a taking or -- what 
was the interest that they're claiming was taken by the 
government?  They didn't own the raisins, so they get 
paid a fee for handling. 

MR. McCONNELL:  So -- so this is -- this is 

our position, Justice Sotomayor.  I think we have to 
look at what is it that the Department of Agriculture 
attempted to take.  So, in the demand letter from the 
Department of Agriculture addressed to the Hornes, 
they -- they asked the Hornes to deliver California 
raisins, or the dollar equivalent.  So that's the fact 
upon which all of this case is -- is built. 

Now, what is the legal significance of that, 
California raisins or the dollar equivalent?  It is our 
legal position, or it will be our legal position on the 
merits that when the government seeks a specific 
physical property, a res, or its monetary equivalent, 
that that is a taking of the res itself.  And there's --
and there's support for that in the -- for precedent

from this Court.  The closest case is Village of 
Norwood v. Baker. 

Page 7 

In this case, the -- the city condemned a 

strip of land for the purpose of building a road.  They 
tried to get out of paying any compensation by claiming 
that the abutting landowner would gain value.  That was 
rejected.  They were assessed $2,000 compensation for 
the taking. 

And then the city turned around and issued a 

special assessment against the landowner for precisely 
that $2,000.  The landowner came back up to this Court, 
and this Court held that it was a taking -- a taking of 
the land. 

And in a subsequent case just a couple of 

years later, the Court described this as a, quote 
"actual confiscation of private property to public use." 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you -- you began by 

saying that these are merits defenses, but you wanted to 
focus first on -- on the jurisdictional question that's 
before us. 

MR. McCONNELL:  That's right.  I hope it 
helps to inform the jurisdictional question.  But the 
jurisdictional question is this:  The Ninth Circuit held 
that my clients could not even raise their takings claim 
on the merits until they had first gone to the Court of

I think there are three things wrong with 

Claims. 

that. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Am I right in thinking 

that there is no dispute on that point, that the -- the 
takings claim could have been asserted by the Hornes, as 
producers, in the Court of Federal Claims? 

MR. McCONNELL:  I think that the government 

no longer disputes, although you should ask them to 
be -- to be clear -- I think that they no longer dispute 
that this is not a jurisdictional client, even though 
they prevailed after the petition for rehearing was 
filed in the Court of Appeals --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, jurisdictional --
MR. McCONNELL: -- on the ground that it was 

jurisdictional. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- jurisdictional or not, 
as a practical matter, producers who are not subject to 
fine as handlers, but the producers of the raisins whose 
raisins are being segregated, could they go to the Court 
of Federal Claims and say my raisins have been taken? 

MR. McCONNELL:  The -- whether the claim is 
being brought in the capacity of producer or handler I 
think is not relevant to one of our arguments, and it is 
relevant to the other argument.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I'd just like a 
straight answer to that question.  You -- you are 
representing producers, and they just produce. 
MR. McCONNELL:  No, no.  No, we're 

Page 9

representing people who are both producers and handlers. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm saying 

hypothetically -- hypothetically.  Is the Court of 
Federal Claims the proper forum for a producer? 

MR. McCONNELL:  It depends upon whether the 
taking has been from them or not.  In the ordinary case, 
the ordinary relationship between a producer and a 
handler, the producer is not paid for the reserve 
raisins and therefore any payment that would come, any 
lawsuit on behalf of those raisins would go to the 
producer, and that would go I think to the Court of 
Claims. 

In this case, though, the business model is 
quite different from that and the producers in this case 
were paid everything.  They received full value --
market value for their raisins.  The only people who are 
out any money in this case are the Hornes in their 
capacity as handler.  So that's why they are the 
only ones --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the problem is that 
they weren't entitled to that money.  Meaning they had

to pay it over to the producer.  The producer was going 
to pay them a handling fee, but that money didn't belong 
to them.  It belonged to the producers who supplied them 
with the raisins and expected payment for them --
MR. McCONNELL:  I'm not sure what --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- if they were sold in 

the ordinary course. 

MR. McCONNELL:  I'm not sure which 

money you're -- they have not asserted any claim on any 
money.  The producers have been completely paid off.  It 
is the handlers who have been held responsible.  And the 
reason they were held responsible was the following 
logic, and you see this on -- on -- on page 78 of the 
judicial officer's opinion. 

They were held responsible because in 

their -- in their processing capacity, when they were 
doing the stemming, the seeding, the fumigating, the 
packing, that this was regarded by the Department of 
Agriculture as possession -- physical possession of the 
raisins and acquisition of the raisins, even though they 
never had title to the raisins. 

It's the Department of Agriculture that has 

attached to them a possessory interest in the raisins 
and then assessed them the full monetary equivalent of 
those raisins, full market value, $484,000 for the

market value because it's -- because under this very 
unusual regulatory scheme the government regards them as 
having possessed the raisins even though that -- that is 
not --

Page 11 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. McConnell, I'm sorry. 

Could I -- along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg was 
saying, suppose that the Hornes had given over all the 
raisins, right, but that they thought that this was 
improper, that this marketing order was -- it was a 
violation of the takings clause.  Could they have gone 
to the Court of Claims, via the Tucker Act, and said, we 
want our money back? 

They gave -- they gave over the raisins, 
they say we're entitled to compensation.  Could they 
have gone through the Court of Claims? 

MR. McCONNELL:  If they had -- if they had 

not been paid for the raisins, they had taken raisins to 
a handler, received no money for them, I think that they 
could go to the Court of Claims. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In other words, the Hornes 
did what the marketing order suggested they should do. 
They gave over the raisins.  But they said this is just 
improper.  You're saying they could go to the Court of 
Claims? 

MR. McCONNELL:  Yes. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So if -- if that's 

Page 12

the case, I guess then the question is, why didn't they 
have to go that route? 

MR. McCONNELL:  They didn't -- they didn't 
go that route, and the question I think is what are the 
-- what are the legal consequences of that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right. 
MR. McCONNELL:  -- because what they -- what 
they knew was that they were not going to be compensated 
for the raisins, and therefore they came up with a --
with a plan, a business plan that they believed made --
eliminated any handler and made it unnecessary for any 
of the independent producers, on whose behalf they're 
operating, to turn over raisins to the government. 
The plan was ultimately rejected and we 

haven't brought a -- a cert petition on it, but the plan 
actually complies with the -- with the language of 
the -- of the regulation because they believe that in 
their capacity as handler, as processor, that they never 
acquired the raisins.  "Acquisition" is the key term for 
becoming a handler under the rule. 

And they believe that since they were simply 

providing a service for -- for $12 a ton to their 
neighbors, that they never acquired the raisins, they 
never possessed the raisins, and therefore no one had to

comply the regulation. 

Page 13 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, some of the raisins 

were their own.  Some of the raisins were their own. 

MR. McCONNELL:  That's correct. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  At least as to that, that 

wouldn't be true, right? 

MR. McCONNELL:  That's -- that's correct.  I 

think that's correct. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, to get you back to 

the -- the jurisdiction point, let's -- let's just 
assume a hypothetical case where a regulated entity has 
to pay an exaction which it deems to be a penalty.  And 
let's assume it can go to the Court of Claims, but it 
doesn't. 

It waits until the penalty's assessed and 

then when the penalty's assessed it says, this is a 
taking.  That -- is that the case that you want to 
discuss with us today? 

MR. McCONNELL:  That's right.  When the 

underlying order would be a taking and they have been 
assessed money because they didn't comply with the 
taking, we believe they can challenge that as a taking. 
And both under the AMAA procedures, in which are exclusive, 
I think that they have to go through the -- through the 
Department of Agriculture and then to the district

court, but I also think under the principles of the --
announced by this Court in of the Apfel decision that 
they are entitled to a remedy in the district court. 

Page 14 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. McConnell, would you 

explain the -- if they were just handlers and weren't 
producing any raisins, if they were just handlers, do 
they have a claim and where?  And if they were just 
producers -- I take it from the question I asked and the 
question Justice Kagan asked that if they were just 
producers, the raisins got set aside, they were paid for 
only the ones that went to market, they could go to the 
Court of Claims. 

But now they're just handlers, as this 

entity is for most of the raisins that are involved, 
some 80 percent, right?  It's only about 20 percent is 
their own.  So could this work for someone who was just 
a handler, doesn't produce any raisins? 

MR. McCONNELL:  So if they are just a 

handler --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 
MR. McCONNELL:  -- as the Department of 

Agriculture treated them, as far as the Department of 
Agriculture is concerned they are only a handler.  They 
are required to raise -- exhaust their claims before the 
Department of Agriculture and then challenge the order

in the district court. 

Page 15 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What I'm -- I'm trying to 
understand is this scheme.  Apparently it wasn't enough 
just to be a handler or just to be a producer.  The 
claim that you're making turns on the coincidence of 
being both the producer and a handler. 

MR. McCONNELL:  I don't think that that's 

so.  I think that we -- that the Hornes ought to prevail 
on either -- in either of their capacities. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So any handler, any 

handler could be making the same claim? 

MR. McCONNELL:  Any handler who has a 
business model that is similar to this.  But most 
handlers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what do you mean 

by -- what's the business model that's similar to this? 
MR. McCONNELL:  So most handlers, if they're 
in compliance with the order, they take all the raisins 
from the producers, they only pay for -- for the free 
pool of raisins.  They don't pay for the reserve raisins 
and they never have any interest in the reserve raisins. 
In this case, the Hornes did not operate that way. 
The -- the producers received full value for all of 
their raisins. 

So the producers are -- are not in the case.

They have no standing.  They have no pocketbook injury. 
The -- the entire pocketbook injury in this case is 
borne by the Hornes in their capacity as a handler. 

Page 16 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  In response to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In the Horne model, the 

handlers buy -- buy the free raisins and then pay the 
producers, is that what it --

MR. McCONNELL:  That's correct. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, so that's the 

difference in this model, they don't take title to the 
raisins is what you're saying? 

MR. McCONNELL:  Exactly.  And the Hornes 

believed that this would mean that they were not 
handlers. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Let me --

let me --

MR. McCONNELL:  And that -- and they were 

found to be handlers anyway. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What is -- what is the 
value in permitting a party who doesn't own property to 
raise a taking claim on behalf of other people? 
Meaning, doesn't the system have an interest in ensuring 
that people comply with their legal obligations, and to 
the extent that you choose to violate the law the way

they have here, that the fine is punitive and not 
compensatory. 

Page 17 

Meaning, you don't own the raisins, but you 

were obligated to put raisins aside for someone else. 
You were their agent and you failed to meet a government 
obligation that was independently on you. 

MR. McCONNELL:  No. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I go back to my 

question:  What was the taking?  Since you didn't own 
the raisins, the taking is the fine is what you want to 
call the taking. 

MR. McCONNELL:  The taking is what the 

government demanded, which was either give me your house 
or give me your money, give me your raisins or give us 
the monetary equivalent. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they're not your 

raisins.  They’re not your raisins. 

MR. McCONNELL:  By the time -- by the time 

this order was enforced, the raisins were gone and so as 
a practical matter, only one of those two alternatives 
was left as a matter of timing. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, but in answer to

for the raisins. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If they had not been paid

MR. McCONNELL:  Right. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  But are you -- does that 

mean you do not think that the AMAA withdraws Tucker Act 
jurisdiction? 

MR. McCONNELL:  It withdraws Tucker Act 
jurisdiction only for handlers.  So if we're talking 
about pure producers --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Only for handlers. 
MR. McCONNELL:  -- pure producers do not go 

to the -- don't have to go through the AMAA process. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  Why -- why does it 

withdraw for the one and not the other? 

MR. McCONNELL:  These New Deal-era programs, 
Justice Scalia, are somewhat -- the purpose is somewhat 
obscure --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I don't mean the

Sections 14(a) and 15(a) of the AMAA.  I don't think 
that's in dispute.  So only producers are -- are 
regulated by this program.  Only producers have a right 
to go through their remedies in the Department of 
Agriculture. 

Only producers have to do that.  It's --

it's a -- it's completely a producer --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said --
MR. McCONNELL:  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 

Excuse me.  Each of those was -- please substitute the 
word "handler" for each of those.  It's only the 
handlers that are regulated under this -- under this 
program. 

So -- and -- and my clients were treated as 
handlers.  They believed that they were not.  But it is 
the Department of Agriculture that has attached this --
this status to them.  And it's -- it's I think quite a 
Catch 22 for the government to come along and say, 
although we are fining you $700,000 in your capacity as 
a handler, you're not a handler for purposes of 
challenging the legality of that order. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm just trying to get to 
what you're arguing about.  And I might be off base by 
now.  I feel like handlers, purchasers, raisins, like an 
old Abbott and Costello movie.  I just want to see if

I'm right.  Tell me.  Just say you're wrong and I don't 
go into it further. 

Page 20 

There -- there are some people, they've been 
-- they are either -- they have some raisins, all right. 
And these particular people, whom the Department has 
said have acquired the raisins, it said they acquired 
the raisins.  And so they're there with some raisins, 
and then the government says, do this thing with your 
raisins.  And they don't want to do it, so they don't. 
They don't do it even though the law says do it. 

And then they say the law is 

unconstitutional and, moreover, you fined us a huge 
amount of money and we don't want to pay it because the 
law is unconstitutional, and we consider that money that 
we paid.  Call it a fine, call it what you want.  We 
consider we shouldn't have paid it and now we want it 
back and we want compensation and we think it's a taking 
and where do we go.  Can't we make that argument in the 
Ninth Circuit?  It's something like that; isn't that 
what we're arguing about? 

MR. McCONNELL:  That's almost exactly right.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes? 
MR. McCONNELL:  -- which is that this is the 

Page 21

proceeding here that decides whether they have to pay. 
They have not yet paid the fine. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, okay.  So we 

shouldn't have to pay because this is all 
unconstitutional.  And -- and now what's your argument? 
MR. McCONNELL:  So -- so they're raising a 

defense.  It isn't that they are -- it isn't that 
they're getting -- trying to get it back. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then the Ninth Circuit 

says go to the Court of Claims.  And you say no, we 
don't have to go to the Court of Claims. 

MR. McCONNELL:  But that detail actually is 
quite important because, remember, you can't even go to 
the Court of Claims unless you are seeking damages for 
an actual violation that has already taken place.  We 
could not go to the court -- the Hornes could not go to 
the Court of Claims right now.  What the government says 
is that they should pay the $700,000 fine first and then 
go to the Court of Claims to get it back.  And that is 
exactly what this Court said in Apfel, is a, quote, 
"pointless set of activities that Congress could not 
possibly have" --

 MR. McCONNELL:  -- "have contemplated." 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think that's true, Mr. 

Page 22

McConnell, as to part of the fine, that part of the fine 
falls under Apfel, but not the other part.  As to the 
compensation part, it seems to me you have a pretty 
decent Apfel argument.  But as to the penalty part, I 
don't really understand how the Apfel argument would go. 
It seems to me that as to the penalty part, 

the key thing is that if they had handed over the 
raisins, they could have gone to the Court of Federal 
Claims and had the compensation done there.  And the 
fact that the government is penalizing them for not 
complying with the marketing order does not fall within 
the rationale of Apfel. 

MR. McCONNELL:  Well, the most pertinent 

case for that part of the fine, for the penalty part, is 
Missouri Pacific Railroad v. Nebraska.  So this is the 
case where the railroad was told by the State to do 
some -- some expensive work, the railroad says no, that 
would be a taking if we were required to do that.  There 
is no compensation available and so they don't do it. 
They're fined $500. 

That gets up to this Court and an opinion by 

Mr. -- Justice Holmes, the Court holds that that is a 
taking and that the railroad is entitled to challenge

the taking in the form of the fine.  So for -- for the 
penalty portion, the punishment portion of the fine, 
Missouri Pacific Railroad is actually the more pertinent 
decision. 

Page 23 

Which comes back -- I don't think I fully 

answered all the variants of Justice Sotomayor's 
question. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All I was trying to do was 

to get you on the basic argument, which you started 
with, which is why is there -- why was the Ninth Circuit 
wrong when they said they had no jurisdiction to hear 
this, that rather, they had to go -- you had to go to 
the --

MR. McCONNELL:  May I tick off the three 

reasons? 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
MR. McCONNELL:  One is it has nothing to do 

with jurisdiction. 

Second, the Tucker Act does not apply to 

cases where -- where there is a defense being lodged to 
a monetary exaction.  That's Apfel, as supplemented by 
Missouri Pacific Railroad. 

And third, even if that were not so, the 

AMAA displaces the Tucker Act and they were required to 
exhaust their remedies before the Department of

Agriculture and take their case to the district court in 
which they are residing. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What was the first?  I 

forgot the first already.  What was the first? 

MR. McCONNELL:  The first is that it isn't 

jurisdictional and therefore it should not have been 
raised --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what isn't 

jurisdictional? 

MR. McCONNELL:  The -- the requirement to go 

to the Court of Claims when you -- when you need to is 
not jurisdictional, that that's a matter of remedy, that 
is, it's -- it's the equitable principle that you may 
not pursue your case for an injunctive relief when 
there's an adequate remedy at law. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. McConnell, in --

in -- if the producers had decided to challenge this as 
a Tucker Act violation, they would have had to hand over 
the raisins?  Or could they have just held on to the 
raisins and said, I'm not handing it over until I get 
just compensation? 

MR. McCONNELL:  So had they held on to their 

own raisins and sold them, I assume, you don't -- not 
just left them rot, if they had sold them, then the 
Department of Agriculture would have called them a

handler because anyone who sells raisins is called a 
handler, and then they would be fined in their capacity 
as a handler and it would be a somewhat similar case to 
this one. 

Page 25 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right. 
MR. McCONNELL:  Maybe an easier one than 

this one. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the point is that 
under a normal takings claim, you have to hand over your 
property, you've lost the value, and you want the 
government to pay it back to you, correct? 

MR. McCONNELL:  Not necessarily correct. 
There are a whole string of cases in which property 
owners raise takings as a defense rather than turning 
over the property.  Kaiser Aetna is perhaps the most --
best known recent case, but out of an administrative 
context, there's the Florida Power & Light case.  Penn 
Central was -- was like this.  Loretto v. Teleprompter 
is like this. 

There's a whole string of cases.  The 

government themselves cite six such cases, most of them 
fairly old, for this proposition.  So there's nothing 
unusual about bringing a -- a defensive takings claim.

want to encroach on your rebuttal time, but one 
mysterious thing.  The first time around, the Ninth 
Circuit decided this case on the merits.  So if you're 
right, I take it, we remand and then they adjudicate the 
merits of the takings claim.  But they already did that. 
MR. McCONNELL:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  And 

they did that on a ground that we think is manifestly 
inconsistent with this Court's precedents.  We were 
prepared to -- we were trying to get an en banc review 
and were prepared to come to this Court from the merits 
determination. 

We were blocked from that because the 

government, after the petition for rehearing was filed, 
came up with -- calling this a jurisdictional argument, 
raised this objection for the first time; and the Ninth 
Circuit panel accepted their view, issued a new opinion, 
stripping out the entire merits, and substituting this 
jurisdictional holding that is producing so much 
enjoyment for us this morning.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

Page 27

MR. PALMORE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

I'd like to start where Justice Sotomayor 
started with Petitioner's counsel because any takings 
analysis needs to begin with a careful identification of 
what property was allegedly taken.  Petitioners in this 
case have actually advanced two different theories about 
what property of theirs was taken.  What taking is at 
issue here?  Raisins and money. 

We think both takings claims fail for 
threshold reasons, but they're different threshold 
reasons that call for different analysis. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Palmore, before you do 

that then, have you conceded the point that this is 
not jurisdictional? 

MR. PALMORE:  We agree that the failure to 
go to the Court of Claims is not properly viewed as a 
jurisdictional defect.  We did invoke Ninth Circuit 
precedent below stating that it was jurisdictional.  And 
some of this cases -- this Court's cases put it in 
ripeness terms, which is an Article III concept.  So 
there has been confusion --

raise the argument that it was jurisdictional? 

MR. PALMORE:  In our opposition to the 

rehearing petition. 

Page 28 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And now you are --
now you are changing back again and saying it's not? 

MR. PALMORE:  There was Ninth Circuit 

precedent holding that it was jurisdictional, and we 
relied on that and there is certainly language from this 
Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You relied on that 

when you got to rehearing.  You didn't rely on that 
before you went before the Ninth Circuit, right? 

MR. PALMORE:  That's correct. 
We think -- we think this is properly viewed 
as a substantive defect in the claim, so in a sense the 
Ninth Circuit, in its initial panel decision, ruled for 
the government on a substantive defect one, there's no 
taking.  And what it did on rehearing in our view, 
although it attached the wrong label to it, it 
substantively was correct in concluding that there was 
substantive defect number two --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. Palmore, if you are 
conceding now that this is not jurisdictional, it seems 
to me that your Tucker Act argument as a substantive 
argument, I mean, has been waived.  You didn't raise

that argument until the rehearing petition. 

MR. PALMORE:  That would certainly be 

Page 29 

something that -- that the Ninth Circuit could consider 
in the event there were a remand here.  But the Ninth 
Circuit did decide it.  The substance of its bottom line 
conclusion was correct and all of its analysis was 
correct.  It simply used the wrong words, so we think it 
is here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm really -- I'm really 
confused.  You are saying there ought to be a remand 
here because the question is not jurisdictional, which 
is just what your friend says, right? 

MR. PALMORE:  Well, the Ninth Circuit --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the two of you are in 

agreement it ought to go back to the Ninth Circuit, they 
should do it on the merits, and -- and if that's wrong, 
we can review that. 

MR. PALMORE:  Look, if that happens, of 

course, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the consequence 
for us is they reinstate the prior panel opinion, in 
which we win, also --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That may well be, but --
MR. PALMORE:  I'm not going to resist too 

strenuously that kind of remand, but they did decide it. 
And moreover, they decided something separate, which is

at JA-305 they said something different, which is the 
kind of threshold defect in the takings claim turning on 
raisins, which is there is a capacity problem. 

Page 30 

So there are two problems with the raisin 

claim, a capacity problem and a just compensation 
problem.  The capacity problem is this:  In 2002, after 
having been strictly raisin producers since 1969, 
entering into a market where there was a reserve 
requirement from the beginning, they knew what they were 
getting into, they decided to adopt a new business 
model, as Petitioner's counsel says.  But, as was found 
below, they adopted a business model that was an 
intentional, willful attempt to evade regulatory 
requirements in order to secure an unfair competitive 
advantage. 

But what they did was they took on the 

obligations of a handler.  They became raisin handlers 
in 2002.  And what came with that status were a series 
of regulatory obligations that apply only to handlers 
and under the AMAA can apply only to handlers:  The 
requirement to have raisins inspected, the requirement 
to file truthful reports, the requirement to make 
records available, and the requirement to separate out 
raisins into what's called free tonnage and reserve 
tonnage, any raisins processed, it doesn't matter who

owns them. 

Those are handler-specific regulatory 
obligations that were imposed upon them, and they 
violated every single one of them, willfully and 
intentionally, in order to secure an unfair competitive 
advantage. 

And what the USDA did was impose penalties 
on them for the violation of law that -- that attached 
to them only as raisin handlers.  And then they invoked 
the judicial review proceedings in Section 14 that 
provides a judicial review mechanism only for handlers. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but part of -- part of 
that penalty was -- you know, your raisins or your life, 
right?  I mean, it was --
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you don't have to pay 

the penalty if you give us the raisins. 

MR. PALMORE:  That's not correct, 

Justice Scalia.  They have to give the raisins. 
Mr. McConnell referred to demand letters --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You mean they -- Is that 

right, they have to give the raisins? 

MR. PALMORE:  They are under a regulatory 

obligation to provide the raisins.  If they violate that 
regulatory obligation, they are subject to sanctions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So --
MR. PALMORE:  One component of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that amounts to the same 

Page 32

thing, your raisins or the penalty, right? 

MR. PALMORE:  No, but it's not a choice. 

And I think that's very important to point out.  There 
were actually two different demand letters. 
Mr. McConnell referred to a demand letter saying your 
raisins or your money.  There was an initial demand 
letter saying:  You are a handler; you have to comply; 
we're going to come get the raisins.  The second demand 
letter said, we showed up -- literally it says, we 
showed up with our truck, you didn't provide the 
raisins, so now you have got to provide the cash 
equivalent. 

And there were also going to be, as there 
were, separate regulatory proceedings brought against 
them for violating those -- those obligations.  Not just 
the failure to reserve, but all these handler-specific 
obligations.  They filed false reports.  They didn't 
make raisins available for inspection. 

There were a whole host of regulatory 
violations that were at issue here, and when they 
invoked the handler review action in the district court 
they could assert defenses as a handler.  But, for

instance, another producer -- producers can't invoke 
these -- these judicial review schemes.  Another 
producer couldn't have intervened in that action to 
assert its producer claim. 

Page 33 

JUSTICE ALITO:  As this case stands when --

as it comes before us, is there a claim that they --
that money -- the government is trying to take money 
from them without just compensation? 

MR. PALMORE:  That was certainly not how we 
understood the claim to be litigated below.  That's not 
how the Ninth Circuit thought -- understood the claim. 
We have been talking about the claim involving the 
raisins, which fails for a to capacity reason and a just 
compensation reason. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that an issue -- is that 
an issue we should decide or is that an issue that the 
Ninth Circuit should decide, whether there is a takings 
claim for money? 

MR. PALMORE:  That was certainly not decided 

below, so a remand -- to the extent that this was 
preserved, a remand would be possible outcome there.  We 
think, though, that that claim suffers from separate --
separate procedural threshold defects. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  If we assume for 

the sake of argument that there is such a claim, why

does that not fall within Apfel? 

Page 34 

MR. PALMORE:  Well, we think that -- for 

several reasons.  First of all, the Apfel opinion that's 
referred to is just a plurality.  It's not been adopted 
by the Court.  Second of all, the Apfel analysis relied 
on this one-for-one, dollar-for-dollar concept.  That 
was a critical part of the plurality's discussion there, 
and it thought that it would simply be a pointless 
exercise for Eastern Enterprises to be required to pay 
the premium and then to go to the Court of Federal 
Claims and get the exact same amount of money back. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Don't they claim that --
MR. PALMORE:  We suggested that there are a 

whole host of reasons --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Before you leave that, don't 

they claim that the entire amount that is assessed 
against them is a taking?  Now, maybe they are wrong. 
That the entire amount assessed against them is a taking 
without just compensation?  Maybe they are wrong, but 
isn't that a merits question? 

MR. PALMORE:  That's -- that's -- they are 

clearly wrong about that, and I -- but I think --
however you characterize that defect, it defeats this 
dollar-for-dollar pointless exercise point that 
Apfel plurality --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why is that a 

Page 35

necessary part of Apfel?  Why didn't Apfel just mean 
when we are dealing with cash you don't have to go to 
the Court of Claims?  So even if -- you know, you can 
have a discussion in the district court about whether 
it's not dollar-for-dollar and it should be discounted 
in some way. 

But why should the fact that its 

dollar-for-dollar mean -- why is that a requirement, as 
opposed to just it's cash and so the question of, 
like -- you know, handing some -- handing it all over 
and getting some back, that can be done in the district 
court rather than making somebody file a separate suit? 
MR. PALMORE:  Well, I think there were two 

things going on in Apfel and there were really two 
distinct reasons why the plurality in Apfel thought that 
there was no requirement to go to the Tucker Act there. 
One was that it thought that in a statute like that, 
that simply allocated benefits and burdens among private 
entities, Congress would not have intended there to be 
compensation available in the -- in the event that there 
were a taking. 

And that was actually the government's 

position in that case and the Apfel plurality cited to 
that portion of the government's brief.  And it cited

cases in its discussion that weren't dollar-for-dollar 
or even cash transfer cases in which the Court had gone 
to the merit of takings claims without consideration of 
a Tucker Act remedy. 

Page 36 

Then there is the second idea, which is the 

cash transfer idea.  And we think that the 
dollar-for-dollar aspect of that was important to the 
plurality's analysis because it viewed that as evidence 
that Congress would not have intended the Tucker Act to 
be deployed because it would have been a pointless 
exercise.  So it really went to what Congress's intent 
was. 

Here, of course, for myriad reasons, that 

dollar-for-dollar analysis breaks down. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, but there's a 

similar -- I mean, it seemed to me, again simplifying, 
that underlying this their clients think this whole 
raisin program is unconstitutional.  What it does is it 
takes raisins that we grow, in effect throws them in the 
river.  And in the thirties, that was done to raise 
raisin prices. 

And they think as a matter of policy that 

just hurts people by raising prices, and as a matter of 
constitutional law it takes raisins from some people 
that belong to them and uses them for this bad purpose.

Okay, that's their view of it, something like that, 
isn't it? 

Page 37 

MR. PALMORE:  Yes. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  So they're making 
that kind of constitutional claim.  Now, I would think 
if all you told me was that and I knew nothing about all 
these statutes, I would say that's the kind of claim 
that should be made in a Federal district court, period, 
not the Court of Claims.  Because their government isn't 
going to compensate them for anything.  That's against 
the whole point of the program. 

Either this program is valid or it isn't. 

And if it isn't, some authoritative set of courts should 
tell us that.  So I have a feeling this is somehow not a 
right fit with the Court of Claims. 

Now, you explain to me why that purely 

instinctive feeling at this point is completely wrong. 
MR. PALMORE:  Sure.  Justice Breyer, we've 
now shifted back to the -- the first theory about the 
property, which is the raisins.  What they could have 
done in 2002, would they have been a producer of 
raisins, solely a producer of raisins for decades, at 
any point during -- between 1969 and 2002, they could 
have gone to the Court of Claims and said, this reserve 
requirement, is a taking of my raisins, I want my just

compensation. 

That is not just a remedy, as Mr. McConnell 
suggests, it is a constitutional condition on the taking 
of private property for public use.  As long as there's 
just compensation, there simply is no violation.  So 
that's why --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That couldn't be what the 

statute meant.  I think that's what Justice Breyer says. 
Did -- did Congress create a statute in which we're 
going to take your raisins and then you can go to the 
Court of Claims and get your money back.  I mean, 
that -- that surely is not what Congress contemplated. 
The -- the whole notion of the program is you can't get 
your money back in the Court of Claims. 

Now, if you're raising a constitutional 

objection, that's something else.  That should be done 
in district court.  But to say that Congress 
contemplated -- you know, we'll take your raisins and 
then you sue in the Court of Claims, they give you your 
money back.  That's a weird statute. 

MR. PALMORE:  Justice Scalia, I have two --
two responses to that.  First of all, these claims have 
been litigated in the Court of Claims; the Evans case, 
the Cal-Almond case, both of which we cite in our brief. 
Raisin producers, or in the Cal-Almond case it was an

almond producer, went to the Court of Claims and said 
this reserve requirement is a taking, I want my money. 
And they lost; and the Court of Claims -- correctly, in 
our view -- held that there was no taking. 

Page 39 

That said, we do agree that it is actually a 

close question whether Congress would have intended 
compensation to be provided in a situation like this 
one, in the event the raisin reserve program were found 
to be a taking.  We've said -- we've said in our brief, 
we do view that as a close question, although on 
balance, we think that the proper answer is that there 
is a remedy -- or, sorry, there is just compensation 
available in the Court of Claims. 

But there are cases, Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you -- you think that's 
a close question?  You think that the way the statute is 
supposed to operate, once it is held that this is an 
unconstitutional taking, is that every year, the 
government takes the raisins and every year, the grower 
goes to the Court of Claims and gets the money back for 
the raisins.  Is that the program that Congress 
anticipated? 

MR. PALMORE:  Well, we do agree that it's a 

close question for the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think it's close at

all.  That's a crazy statute.  Every year we're going to 
take raisins and every year we're going to pay you in 
the Court of Claims.  What's the purpose of that? 

MR. PALMORE:  Well, of course, Congress 

didn't think this was a taking.  And it -- and it built 
considerable administrative flexibility into the 
statute, and at the end of the day, that's what 
convinces us that Congress would not have intended to 
preclude compensation in the Court of Claims and to --
to opt for an injunction instead because the Secretary 
of Agriculture has wide latitude to adjust. 

So the compensation wouldn't be paid year 

after year, as your hypothetical suggested.  The program 
could be adjusted.  A reserve requirement is only one 
way of complying with the kind of supply control 
provisions of the statute.  There are any number of 
options available. 

But I'd also point out that in this Court's 

precedence in Monsanto and Regional Rail, those were 
both statutory schemes which had their own compensation 
mechanism, as does this one, this reserve raisins that 
producers do get paid sometimes for them in a smaller 
amount.  Those were cases in which the statutes did have 
compensation mechanisms, and this Court held that the 
Tucker Act was available as kind of a supplementary

compensation in the event --

Page 41 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Palmore, am I 

incorrect in thinking that the government is saying, 
handlers cannot raise the constitutionality of the 
Raisin Marketing Order?  You've told us that the 
producers can go to the Court of Claims.  What about the 
handlers?  They're at least being fined for violating 
the Act, and it's their position that the whole thing is 
unconstitutional. 

Can they raise the constitutionality of the 

whole arrangement defensively, or they simply can't 
raise the constitutionality of the Act? 

MR. PALMORE:  Justice Ginsburg, I think this 
goes back again to the property question.  If the claim 
is that it's unconstitutional because it takes 
producers' property, they can't raise that in this 
proceeding.  If the property is the raisins, they can't 
raise that in this proceeding.  They need to -- to 
comply and go to the Court of Claims for compensation, 
which means there has been no -- in the event there's a 
taking, it's a constitutional taking because just 
compensation is provided. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it would be --
MR. PALMORE:  If the claim -- if the claim 

is that the money that was taken from me, the fine, that

itself is a taking, then we think that claim can and 
must be brought in the context of the AMAA proceeding. 
That was not how the Court of Appeals understood the 
claim here to be, and there's no precedent for the idea 
that a fine for violation of law can be articulated as a 
taking of the lawbreaker's property without just 
compensation.  I haven't seen any case that -- that 
stands for that proposition and that would be quite 
remarkable. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then you just -- but 

then you just lose on the merits.  What the Ninth 
Circuit says, they can't even argue this. 

MR. PALMORE:  Well, Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I thought that what 

we were going to decide was whether or not, assuming you 
can go to the Court of Claims, you must go to the Court 
of Claims, can you prefer to wait, have a penalty 
assessed against you and say this is unconstitutional, 
it's a taking.  Your position is you can't say that.  I 
don't understand why.  Other than, if you want to talk 
about Williamson and so forth, we can get into that. 
MR. PALMORE:  But, Justice Kennedy, the --

the Ninth Circuit didn't understand the taking claim to 
be that the fine for my violation of law is a taking of 
my money.  That's not how the Ninth Circuit understood

the claim, so they didn't analyze it in that way. 

Page 43 

They understood the claim to be that the 

taking of producers' raisins is a taking, and we 
lawfully resisted it because it was an unconstitutional 
taking.  The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected that 
because there was nothing unconstitutional about it 
because it was not without just compensation. 

The Tucker Act is the just compensation. 

This Court has held --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The just compensation, I 
take it, in the program is supposed to come from the 
fact that raisin prices go up.  So the poor children 
with their noses pressed to the glass because they can't 
pay the raisins, their parents are the ones who are 
paying the compensation.  And certainly not the 
taxpayer, he's not going to pay it, and maybe the other 
producers will pay, some who get gypped or something, I 
don't know.  But I can't believe that Congress wanted 
the taxpayers to pay for a program that's going to mean 
they have to pay higher prices as consumers. 

MR. PALMORE:  Justice Breyer, and that goes 

to the -- to the merits of the case. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  No, it doesn't go 
to the merits.  It goes to whether or not it makes sense 
to think that the Court of Claims has something to say

about this.  And suppose we did this.  Suppose we said, 
given the fact that you filed your thing, whatever it 
was -- you know, late, and the -- and the light of this 
very enlightening discussion which has been helpful, we 
think this is the kind of program and challenge to 
the program where there isn't going to be a remedy 
really in the Court of Claims and they ought to go ahead 
in the Ninth Circuit, and in light of all these 
enlightening things that we'll write, you just decide 
the merits of -- is that -- now, I'm sure you're going 
to say that's absolutely terrible, it won't work at all. 
So tell me why not. 

MR. PALMORE:  Well, Your Honor, of course, 

the consequence of that is they reinstate our prior 
victory in the prior panel opinion --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, we'd say -- we'll 
say given the way that we've talked about the program, 
perhaps it's best to consider this matter fully. 

MR. PALMORE:  Well, they did consider the 

matter fully.  In the initial opinion, they said there's 
no taking here. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
MR. PALMORE:  So all of the discussion we're 

having here is about -- is predicated on the idea that 
if there were a taking, would compensation be available

in the first place. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  Can I --
MR. PALMORE:  We agree there's no taking. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  It almost 

seems to me, and I'll ask Mr. McConnell when he gets up 
at rebuttal, that there is some sort of due process 
challenge going on here that's been created by the 
labels they did in this new situation -- in this new 
business venture.  In the normal situation, the handler, 
I'm being told, would actually have title to the 
raisins, and they would pay the producers for the 
raisins.  So there would be property taking. 

In that situation, where the handlers 

actually own the property, would they be able to raise a 
taking defense? 

MR. PALMORE:  No, because of the way that 
the statute and the regulatory program works.  If the 
handler is actually buying raisins from the producer, 
the handler never takes title to the reserve raisins. 
And he doesn't pay for the reserve raisins.  He takes 
title to the free-tonnage raisins and the title to the 
reserve raisins passes, as a matter of law, from the 
producer to the Raisin Administrative Committee.  The 
handler never owns those raisins. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So they are missing a

business opportunity because they can't take title to 
those raisins.  And yet you're asking --

Page 46 

MR. PALMORE:  They would never pay for 

those -- they would never pay for those raisins because 
they can't take title.  They can't lawfully take title 
to those raisins.  Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This really does sound 

to me -- and I think that both Justice Scalia and Breyer 
now are being more and more convinced -- there has to be 
a place to challenge this scheme. 

MR. PALMORE:  And there absolutely is. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Whether it's a taking --
whether there's a takings claim for the handler because 
the handler is being asked to do things --

MR. PALMORE:  But the handler's property is 

not being taken, and that's critical.  There are 
separate takings claims that handlers have advanced 
that -- that could be asserted through this process. 
For instance, there was a case called Lion Raisins from 
the Federal Circuit that we cite in our brief, in which 
the issue was that the handler provided bins to store 
the raisins, and he didn't get his bins back.  Okay? 

That was a handler takings claim, and that 

had to be asserted in the context of this handler review 
scheme.  But the handler doesn't own the raisins under

this scheme. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's -- that's a merits 
question again.  I mean, it's not a question of whether 
you -- you can resist on the basis of a takings claim. 
It's a question of whether you are going to win. 

MR. PALMORE:  No, Justice Scalia, I think it 

goes to the scope, the capacity question that we were 
talking about before because the statute is quite clear 
in section 608c(13)(B) that this scheme does not 
regulate producers in their capacity as producers.  And 
if someone wants to take on both roles, they will be 
regulated only as a handler. 

So the regulatory obligations that applied 

to Petitioners when they adopted this business model 
were handler-only regulatory obligations, and then this 
is a handler judicial review proceeding.  That's a very 
narrow means of decision here that avoids some of these 
kind of conceptual questions about the nature of the --
the Takings Clause, which is that this claim simply 
doesn't belong in this proceeding. 

But there's no unfairness or no due process 
issue here at all because they -- in 2002, when -- when 
Petitioners decided to engage in this, these regulatory 
violations in order to secure an unfair advantage over 
their competitors, as was found by the ALJ at JA41, at

that point they could have sought compensation for the 
past 6 years of raisins that they had provided.  They 
didn't do it. 

Page 48 

I don't understand why they didn't do it. 
They left that claim on the table.  And to the extent 
they wanted to claim going forward, they could have 
continued to use compliant handlers and sued every month 
for compensation in the Court of Claims. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Did I understand you to say 
a couple minutes ago that if the case were remanded, you 
would be entitled to win on the reasoning of the panel 
opinion? 

MR. PALMORE:  The prior panel opinion, 

Justice.  If -- if there was a remand on the basis that 
the Ninth Circuit misunderstood this as a jurisdictional 
Article III defect, and then the Ninth Circuit were to 
find waiver, what the Ninth Circuit presumably would do 
would be to reinstate its first panel decision, which we 
think was also correct and held that there was no taking 
here.  There are two --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Palmore, what would be 

wrong -- would anything be wrong -- with a -- with a 
disposition of this Court that went something like this: 
Everybody agrees that this is not a jurisdictional 
issue, including the government, so they got that wrong.

 Now, as to this whole business about the 

Page 49

Tucker Act and whether the Tucker Act provides a remedy, 
the government only started talking about that in a 
petition for rehearing en banc, and the government can't 
do that.  You know, it can't introduce an argument like 
this in a petition for rehearing en banc.  So that's 
waived. 

And now, the Ninth Circuit can go and try to 

figure out whether this marketing order is a taking or 
it's just the world's most outdated law. 

(Laughter.) 
MR. PALMORE:  That would certainly be an 

available option, or the Ninth Circuit could decide for 
itself whether there had been a waiver. 

But there's a separate issue in that there's 
this capacity issue, which is a separate point that the 
Ninth Circuit made at JA305, when it pointed out that 
this was a producer claim, and that's something that --
that was strictly a producer claim and wasn't -- wasn't 
a fit for this handler review action, and that's 
something that could also be considered on remand. 

But the consequence of this -- of that would 

be for the -- the Court to impose its -- if it found a 
waiver, to rule for us for separate merits reasons. 

We do view the Tucker Act -- the failure to

seek just compensation -- as a merits defect in the 
Petitioners' claim here.  So even putting this capacity 
problem aside, there is simply -- there's no defense. 
Mr. McConnell says that this can be raised as a defense. 
But there is no defense if all you show is that there has 
been a taking of private property for public use, full 
stop. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What does the word 

"acquire" mean.  There is some opinion here which says 
these handlers acquired the raisins.  What is -- what's 
that about? 

MR. PALMORE:  "Acquire" is a defined term, 

and it includes to possess.  So they took to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Like lessees or something, 

bailees? 

MR. PALMORE:  There was no question under 

the regulatory scheme here that Petitioners were 
handlers.  And in fact, there's a surprising --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- no, no.  I just wanted 

to know what the word "acquire" --

MR. PALMORE:  "Acquire" -- "acquire" is 
defined to include a number of things, including to 
possess.  And a handler is anyone who sells raisins. 
There was no mystery about this.

brief, we cite communication after communication where 
USDA told them --

Page 51 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, can an acquirer of my 

car, for example -- I don't know.  Forget that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  A bailee? 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can they -- can they 
 

assert a takings claim attaches to the car?  It sounds 
like a standing question. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I suppose a bailee 

could, a bailee of the car. 

MR. PALMORE:  No, I don't think a bailee 
could.  I think the owner would have to assert that 
claim, right. 

But "acquire" is a defined term, and as this 
case comes to this Court it's accepted.  The Petitioner 
has not sought cert on the underlying regulatory 
findings.  In fact, their arguments -- they were told 
ahead of time that they were completely wrong over and 
over and over again, and then they lost that claim at 
every level, twice within the Department of Agriculture, 
in the district court, in the court of appeals.  They 
lost on that regulatory claim. 

This wasn't a good faith misunderstanding.

willful and intentional, knowing violation of regulatory 
requirements because they were able to undercut their 
competitors by not playing by the rules.  So this 
doesn't present any kind of due process --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no. But still, it might 

if they're acquirers -- but they are acquirers, okay? 
They think this program is unconstitutional because it 
takes some other people's property, right?  So those 
other people are in a very special relation to them. 
Those other people are really close. 

And it may be they have standing to assert 

those other people's claims.  And if they do have 
standing to assert those other people's claims, why 
can't they make the argument that way? 

MR. PALMORE:  I -- I disagree that they have 
standing to make those other people's claims.  And also, 
Petitioners haven't argued, haven't made any third-party 
standing argument here. 

But -- this Court's requirements are quite 

strict for third-party standing.  You have to have a 
close -- a close relationship, and I don't think a mere 
arm's-length commercial relationship would count. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose they do have 

standing.  Could they raise the claim?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You say no. 
MR. PALMORE:  Well, they have -- they 

Page 53

certainly have standing as producers to raise the claim. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's assume they have 

standing.  Could they raise the claim --

MR. PALMORE:  Yes, that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- that this is an 

unconstitutional taking? 

MR. PALMORE:  In the Court of Claims, 

absolutely, as producers. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  In the 

administrative proceeding where they are charged with --
where a penalty is being assessed against them. 

MR. PALMORE:  I think that they would have 

standing, but it's still a claim that's beyond the scope 
of this narrow specific judicial review proceeding.  I 
think its' a -- it's a different problem. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I have to say -- I 

think it comes with less than good grace for you to 
criticize the other side for not having raised a 
particular argument.  But I do want to clarify that you 
have no objection at this point for reversing the Ninth 
Circuit on the ground that they erred in saying that 
this -- they should have dismissed on jurisdictional 
grounds.

 MR. PALMORE:  Well, I'm not going to resist 
that too strenuously, -- but I think if they did decide 
the question, they decided it correctly.  It was a 
threshold defect.  Their analysis was all correct.  So I 
think that's before the Court. 

But yes, we -- we frankly acknowledge and we 

acknowledged in our brief that we did not -- we did 
suggest below that this was a jurisdictional defect. 
Ninth Circuit authority said that it was and we relied 
on that. 

We now believe that it's best understood not 
as a jurisdictional defect, but as a substantive defect 
in the claims, not simply a choice of remedies issue, as 
Petitioners suggested because choice of remedy suggests 
that there has been a constitutional wrong and that we 
need to decide what remedy is going to be available, an 
injunction or damages. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The short answer is, 
yes, reach the merits only if I win.  That -- that's 
really what you want us to do. 

MR. PALMORE:  Well, we -- we think you could 

reach some of the merits.  We think that the narrow 
disposition here is actually the capacity --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  I need to 
ask you this question because do you want us to reach

the merits if we're going to have you lose?  You got to 
want one or the other. 

Page 55 

Do you want us to reach the merits, period, 

is really the question? 

MR. PALMORE:  Yes.  Our position is that 

we're not acquiescing in a -- in a remand.  We think you 
can affirm, and you should affirm.  However, I do 
recognize --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think we should 
reach the merits, which is a very different question? 
MR. PALMORE:  Well, it depends on what you 

mean by "merits." 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Only if you win, right? 
MR. PALMORE:  There is the taking -- no. 
There is the underlying kind of takings claim, that 
there was -- was there a taking here at all?  And that's 
not before the Court.  I don't think anyone suggests 
that that's before the Court. 

But we do -- we do think that there are a 

series of other threshold defects in the claim that this 
Court could -- could rely on. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Palmore. 

Mr. McConnell, you have 3 minutes remaining.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

Page 56

MR. McCONNELL:  I'd like to make two quick 
points.  One is that I believe that the government has 
essentially conceded here in this argument and in their 
brief that the Tucker Act does not apply.  They have 
told us that the Tucker Act does not apply on page 50 
and repeated here when Congress could not have 
contemplated a compensation.  Now, in addition -- and 
their only answer to that is to say, first, that 
Congress didn't think it would be a taking, which in 
Regional Rail, this Court said is not the question. 

And secondly, that if -- if there's one --

we should get paid once, compensation once and then the 
administrator's going to cancel the program, which is no 
answer at all.  Either the statute contemplates 
compensation for everybody or it contemplates it for 
nobody. 

I think they have effectively conceded that 

the Tucker Act does not apply. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, they've conceded 

that it doesn't apply to handlers. 

MR. McCONNELL:  To handlers.  And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes, and so they've 

conceded there is no --

 MR. McCONNELL:  And the second issue I 

Page 57

wanted to talk about so is this capacity issue. 
Certainly, we have standing.  When -- it's not 
third-party standing.  All of the money comes out of our 
pocket, yes, we have standing.  And secondly, we 
certainly -- and then that is in our capacity as 
handler. 

Essentially, the Department of Agriculture's 

view is that during those couple of days when the 
raisins are going through our packing plant, that we 
acquired them and possessed them during those couple of 
days and that we should have given them their -- their 
share.  That's raisins, that's not money.  But by the 
time they get around to enforcing that and so forth, the 
raisins are gone and now the money stands in -- stands 
in for the raisins.  But that is a taking claim. 

We think it's a -- it's a straightforward 

taking claim under -- under Norwood and Missouri Pacific 
Railroad, that's a merits question.  But in any event, 
it is not a problem of capacity.  Whatever might be, 
that taking, that taking is in the capacity as a 
handler. 

Those are my two points. 
Thank you. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
