 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument this afternoon in Case 09-152, Bruesewitz v. 

Wyeth.

 Mr. Frederick.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 This case involves a vaccine designed in the 

1940s that was administered to Hannah Bruesewitz in 

1992, some 30 years after scientists discovered a safer 

way to design the pertussis component of the DTP 

vaccine.  The Third Circuit held that the Bruesewitzes 

could not pursue a design defect claim under State law 

invoking the preemption principle in claiming that the 

Vaccine Act of 1986 preempted the Bruesewitz's State 

claim.  That holding is in error for three reasons.

 First, the court overlooked the numerous 

provisions of the Act protecting manufacturers from 

liability, but it did not expressly preempt design 

defect claims.

 Second, the court misconstrued the word 

"unavoidable" in section 22(b)(1)'s Federal law defense.

And third, the court adopted a policy that 

exposes children to unnecessary safety risks.

 With respect to the first reason, in the 

1986 Act Congress created a program, the vaccine 

program, that was funded by surcharges on the vaccines 

that users used, and out of that fund designed a program 

to pay compensation to persons who were injured by 

vaccine-related acts.

 Congress also provided a mechanism for 

exhaustion through the vaccine court program before a 

person claiming injury could pursue a State law cause of 

action.  In creating Federal law defenses to the State 

law that was designed to govern such actions, Congress 

established certain defenses, but all of those defenses 

apply on a case-by-case basis.  There are no absolute 

provisions that preclude a State law claim.  The Third 

Circuit misunderstood that basic principle.

 The defenses that the Vaccine Act created 

for manufacturers includes such things as a regulatory 

compliance defense for failure to warrant claims, a 

learned intermediary doctrine that is instituted at a 

national level, the imposition of comment k -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is -- I'm 

sorry, Mr. Frederick.  What's the point that you are 

trying to make?  That because there are a whole bunch of

provisions designed to help manufacturers, that this one 

can't possibly also be designed to help manufacturers?

 MR. FREDERICK:  My point is that when one 

looks at the specific language of 22(b)(1) against the 

backdrop of these other provisions, it's clear what 

Congress was intending was to enact a national defense, 

but not to displace State law completely.  And the 

question presented is whether, on a case-by-case basis, 

the design defect claims that had been brought by the 

Bruesewitzes are displaced as a matter of law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 

the argument would go the other way:  That because they 

set up a compensation scheme, that was a good sign that 

they didn't want to allow State law claims.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And if one looks, 

Mr. Chief Justice, at sections 21, 22, and 23 of the 

Act, what 21 provides is that the Claimant can elect not 

to accept the vaccine court judgment.  Section 22 

provides the standards of responsibility, and section 23 

provides the mechanisms for trial of the State law 

claim.  And 23(e) provides that the evidence of the 

vaccine table and what happens in the vaccine court 

shall not be admissible in the State law claim.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Section 22(b)(1) refers to 

side effects that were unavoidable even though the

vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by 

proper directions and warnings.

 If the term "unavoidable" was intended to 

carry its ordinary meaning, what need was there for the 

rest of that language:  "Even though the vaccine was 

properly prepared and was accompanied by proper 

directions and warnings"?  If it was improperly prepared 

or didn't have the proper directions and warnings, then 

the side effects are avoidable.  So that language is 

surplus, isn't it, if "unavoidable" really means 

unavoidable?

 MR. FREDERICK:  What Congress was intending 

to do, Justice Alito, was, with the word "unavoidable," 

to use a word that had a settled meaning in the common 

law.  And that settled meaning referred to the design of 

the product in light of the current state of scientific 

knowledge.  That grew directly from comment k, the 

section 402A of the restatement of torts.

 And in comment k, which tracked the 

structure of the restatement provision itself, the 

general rule for the restatement was strict liability 

for dangerous products, quote, "although the drug is 

properly manufactured or properly warned against."

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But isn't it true that at 

the time, there was a distinct minority view that you

could not recover for design defects for vaccines?

 MR. FREDERICK:  There certainly was a 

debate.  The majority view, however, was to adopt 

comment k as a defense to strict liability claims on a 

case-by-case basis.  And the cases that we've set forth, 

I think, illustrate that, even the cases that the other 

side cites.  Several of them had been overruled by the 

time the 1986 act took effect and there was a decided 

shift in favor in the case-by-case application of 

comment k.  And in the 1987 report, Congress made very 

clear it intended to preserve that case-by-case 

approach.  That is set forth at page 50 of our brief, 

Justice Alito.

 So when one looks at both the words that 

Congress used in 22(b)(1), the debates that occurred, 

and the committee reports that explained what Congress 

is intending here, we believe the intent is unmistakably 

clear to adopt comment k as a defense to -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you haven't really 

answered Justice Alito's question as to why the later 

language is not surplus.  If indeed it bears the 

technical meaning you say that it -- that it bears, that 

later language is surplus.

 MR. FREDERICK:  It is not surplus if one 

reads comment k and understands what the drafters there

were intending to get at, which was:  If, based on 

current scientific knowledge, the risks are unavoidably 

unsafe, meaning there is no way in science we can design 

a safer product, there will be a defense to a claim of 

strict liability unless or provided that the product is 

properly manufactured and warned against.  This was a 

proviso that was intended to ensure that the focus be 

kept on the unavoidable, unsafe aspects of the design of 

the vaccine.

 Now, the other side's view takes other words 

of 22(b)(1) and renders them surplusage.  And I am 

looking now at page 19A of our reply brief, where we set 

forth the statutory language, if you want to follow 

along here.  What the other side's view is that after 

the word "if" following the date of October 1, 1988 -- I 

am at page 19A of the reply brief, the addendum.

 Under their view, all of the words that 

follow the word "if" and through "even though" becomes 

surplusage, because under their reading the manufacturer 

is relieved of all liability if, quote, "the vaccine was 

properly prepared and was accompanied by proper 

directions and warnings," and renders the entire concept 

of unavoidability surplusage.  So our view is that what 

these -­

follow it.  Tell me that again.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Under their --

Justice Scalia, looking at (b)(1) on page 19A following 

the date October 1, 1988.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Under their view, after the 

word "if," the phrase "the injury or death resulted from 

side effects that were unavoidable even though" is 

surplusage, because in their view of the statute 

Congress created a complete exoneration from liability 

if the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied 

by proper warnings.  They took the concept of 

unavoidability completely out of the statute.

 And the word "unavoidable" had a settled 

meaning.  There were numerous cases that had construed 

that meaning in light of the 20-year history of 

Restatement section 402A.  So -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I take it that the 

government is urging that "unavoidable" means 

unavoidable in the vaccine that has gained FDA approval.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Ginsburg, that 

position is incorrect.  And there is empirical evidence 

indicating that the manufacturers, Lederle's Mr. 

Johnson, testified that the problem with the '86 version 

of the statute was that it allowed for design defects to

go forward.  And he urged there to be a regulatory 

compliance defense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you are asking us 

to interpret this statute in light of his testimony at a 

hearing?

 MR. FREDERICK:  What I'm saying is that 

Congress had choices, and one of the choices was to 

adopt a regulatory compliance defense for design defect 

claims, and it chose not to do that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me the 

language supports the reading Justice Ginsburg has just 

suggested, or the government has just suggested, with 

the use of the word "the."  It says the effects of the 

vaccine were unavoidable, even though the vaccine was 

properly prepared.  Your position is, well -- the 

question is whether it was unavoidable if you could have 

prepared a different vaccine.  But this says 

"unavoidable, even though the vaccine."

 MR. FREDERICK:  Right.  And it is preceded 

by the word "if," Mr. Chief Justice.  And if -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't see the word 

"if."

 MR. FREDERICK:  It's right after the date, 

1988.  If the injury resulted from side effects.

 So it is looking on a case-by-case basis in

that context, whether the vaccine created the injury or 

side effect that is being complained of.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Frederick, I have this 

problem with -- with your interpretation.  As -- as has 

been said, the government interprets "unavoidable" to 

mean unavoidable with respect to the vaccine that has 

been approved.

 If it doesn't mean that, if it simply means 

unavoidable with some other vaccine, you could always 

avoid them if you have a vaccine that is significantly 

less effective.  I mean, what other vaccine are you 

comparing it with?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Scalia, let me try 

to clear this up in this way.  All of these vaccines are 

approved by the FDA.  And the question is whether you 

give a presumption of design correctness for all time 

based on the FDA's approval of that vaccine.  This 

vaccine was approved in -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that, but the 

plaintiff comes in and says, Look, you could have 

eliminated this, this, and this, and these side effects 

would not occur.  Of course the vaccine would only be 

effective in 75% of the cases, but nonetheless, it was 

avoidable.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And that's why the concept

of unavoidability as a defense always rested on the 

current State of scientific knowledge.  In the 1960s, 

Lederle signed -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that doesn't answer 

my question.  I acknowledge it rests on current 

scientific knowledge, but current scientific knowledge 

would enable you to design a drug that does not have 

these side effects even though it's significantly less 

effective, and there is no criterion as to how much less 

effective it has to be to qualify and so forth, whereas 

the government's interpretation of the word ties it to 

a -- to a particular vaccine.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Scalia, the way 

these cases were construed, and we have cited them in 

our reply brief, the standard was whether or not it was 

as safe as a feasible alternative but was -- sorry, as 

efficacious but safer as a feasible alternative.  That's 

how the courts -- the State court -­

documents indicated that Lederle -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You keep saying that. 

But didn't I understand correctly that that drug was 

withdrawn from the Japanese market in which it had 

originally been -­

MR. FREDERICK:  No.  Let me clarify.

 There are two theories by which there was a 

design defect claim.  One concerned a product by Eli 

Lilly called Tri-Solgen.  That was a split cell vaccine 

that was developed and sold in the 1960s.  It was 

demonstrated to have far less serious effects for 

encephalopathy and other residual seizure disorders and 

problems.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was it proven that it 

was as effective?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, it was, and it had 65% 

of the market.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And could it be used for 

all five -- there are five inoculations in this series.

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And only one of them was 

not approved for the first three.

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's the second one for 

Justice Sotomayor.  This was an acellular technique that

had been studied in the United States in the 1950s and 

eventually was developed by the Japanese in the 1980s. 

That acellular technique was eventually approved by the 

FDA in the mid-1990s and is now common in all of the 

three-part VDAP vaccines that are currently on the 

market.

 Our point is that the scientists literally 

knew about that acellular technique.  They were 

beginning to do tests, but they didn't aggressively do 

it for economic reasons.  And that has never been -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If there is a safer 

alternative, it must be pursued regardless of cost?

 MR. FREDERICK:  No, there is a 

reasonableness standard.  The standard of due care that 

State law and tort has always had is:  What does a 

reasonable manufacturer do in the same or similar 

circumstances?  But that is a question, ultimately, of 

fact, whether or not the economics -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In a question of fact in a 

case-by-case determination in every State, the 

manufacturers would probably be worse off under your 

approach than if they didn't have the law at all,

the whole design of the vaccine program, because if you 

channelled most claims into something that the 

manufacturers didn't have to defend against or pay the 

judgments of, the thought was that the vast, vast 

majority of people would never go to State court.  And 

it would only be in those rare circumstances like the 

problem we have here where the vaccine court awards 

nothing that the Bruesewitzes even had to go to State 

court.

 Had they filed their claim a month earlier 

when residual seizure disorder was still on the vaccine 

table, we wouldn't be here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why was it taken off?

 MR. FREDERICK:  There was a debate in the 

scientific community.  The Institute of Medicine 

believed that residual seizure disorder was medically 

proved to be a causative factor from the pertussis 

component of the DTP.  There was a disagreement of -- by 

folks in the Secretary of Health and Human Services as 

to whether or not that was sufficient to justify legal 

cause.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so didn't the special 

master find what -- in the compensation proceeding that 

causation had not been proved?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  And it was a

proceeding, Justice Ginsburg, that had allowed for no 

discovery against the drug manufacturer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, you -- you say that 

in court you could prove causation, since you had 

discovery, although you couldn't prove it before the 

special master because discovery was very limited?

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's our submission.  And 

that was the design that Congress intended.  That's why 

what happens in the vaccine court under section 23(e), 

as a matter of law, is inadmissible in a subsequent 

State court action.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And can you -- maybe this 

is a good point, but I would like to know what your 

response is.  I'm not asking you in either a hostile nor 

friendly way.

 The -- assume for the moment that the 

language, I cannot find clear one way or the other.  So 

I think it's ambiguous.  At that point, what is your 

response, on that assumption that this brief on the 

other side from the American Academy of Pediatrics and 

21 other physician and public health organizations -­

what the pediatricians here say is that, if you win, 

we're turning this over to judges and juries instead of 

the FDA and other specialized agencies, that the result 

could well be driving certain vaccines from the market,

and basically, a lot of children will die.  And that -­

that's their claim.

 And I think that their legal argument there 

is that wasn't Congress's purpose.  Congress's purpose 

was the contrary.

 So leaving the language out of it, I would 

like you to respond to what I would call that 

purpose-related, fact-related argument by these 

particular people.

 MR. FREDERICK:  If I may, let me make two 

points, Justice Breyer, the legal point and the policy 

point.

 The legal point is:  This Court's cases make 

clear that there is a clear statement principle.  Before 

Congress is presumed to have displaced State law, it 

must act with a clear statement.  And that is true in 

the Eleventh Amendment context as well as the preemption 

context.  So if you conclude there is ambiguity, we 

should win -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there is another case 

on that where we are going to have to go into -- which 

is, does that mean every bit of it has to be clear? 

Does it mean the intent has to be clear?  That's a 

complicated area.  But I will put that aside for the 

moment.

MR. FREDERICK:  Here, 22(a) answers that 

question as a matter of law, because it says the State 

law provides the general rule.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  I've got -­

MR. FREDERICK:  Now, that's the legal point. 

The policy point is that by channelling the vast 

majority -- and the SG's brief says 99 percent of the 

people who go through vaccine court accept the judgment 

of the vaccine court.

 And on the First Circuit, the Schaefer 

decision -- which you wrote, Justice Breyer -- said that 

even in the instances in which people lose in the 

vaccine court, they may regard the hurdles and obstacles 

of the State court process to be so great that they 

don't bother to try.  It's difficult to win these kinds 

of cases in State court.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Explain why.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Because proving causation 

and proving the availability, based on science, of an 

alternative design is not something that is a relatively 

easy thing to do.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's -- that's why I 

asked the question.  Frankly, if I see the Academy of 

Pediatrics telling me one thing, and I in an earlier 

case wrote the other thing, I do tend to think I could

have been wrong.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's -- that's why I 

am asking you:  Is that the best you can find on the 

other side, namely something I once wrote in a case?  Or 

are there other -- are there other things?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FREDERICK:  It happened in the moment to 

come to mind, Justice Breyer.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FREDERICK:  The point that I want to 

make is that the threat of liability is only a realistic 

one if there is a threat that there's actually going to 

be payment at the end.  And Plaintiffs do not bring 

cases to lose; they bring cases if they have a 

reasonable prospect of winning based on what the 

evidence would show a design defect to be.

 And so when Congress set up this system and 

it exonerated the vaccine makers of 99 percent of all 

cases that are going to go through this system claiming 

defects or problems, if you ask manufacturers around the 

country that you get a special defense against punitive 

damages, you get a regulatory compliance defense for 

failure to warn, you have to have a trifurcated 

proceeding, and you are not going to have to pay damages

or defend the actions 99 percent of the time, most 

manufacturers in the United States would take that 

bargain.

 And so the question -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It would depend, I 

suppose, on what they thought the judgments were going 

to be in the 1 percent of the time.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't take too 

many $60 million verdicts to make you come out on the 

other side of your calculus.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And that's why, going back 

to the wording of the statute, Mr. Chief Justice, in 

section 23, where Congress said for someone who had 

elected not to accept the judgment in 21, you get to go 

to State court and try to prove your claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Anyone could go to the 

State -- I mean, somebody who won in the vaccine court 

could go to court on the argument that the amount was 

insufficient, the amount of compensation.

 There is -- there is no foreclosure of 

anyone to come to court; is that right?

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.  But you 

have to fight through the defenses that Congress erected 

in 22(b)(1), (b)(2), and (c), which are quite difficult

defenses.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What would happen if a drug 

manufacturer sought FDA approval of an alternative 

vaccine and the injury occurred during the period while 

that was under consideration by the FDA?  That's -­

that's just too bad?

 MR. FREDERICK:  A harder case, but not one 

that couldn't be proved under State law.  The negligence 

inquiry would look into whether or not a reasonable 

manufacturer would have tried earlier and more 

aggressively to obtain FDA approval.

 Here, we think we can meet that standard, 

because we had a drug that was on the market, the split 

cells Tri-Solgen, that was proved to be safer and just 

as efficacious, and it had been on the market until 

Wyeth took it off, after Wyeth concluded that when it 

purchased the rights from Eli Lilly it couldn't 

manufacture the vaccine Tri-Solgen in a way that it 

would get it the profit stream that it wanted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the -- when it was -­

when Tri-Solgen was owned by Lilly and you said that it 

was approved and marketed, was that one available for 

all five inoculations?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

That was used for all through the series for children's

vaccination for DTP.

 And the problem here with the other side's 

approach, fundamentally, is that not only does it render 

part of 22(b)(1) surplusage, and not only does it ignore 

the many benefits that manufacturers got, but at the end 

of the day it allows for an exoneration from liability, 

even for manufacturers who know there is a safer design 

available.

 And that fundamentally is something Congress 

never would have imagined, that manufacturers would 

invoke an immunity from suit, even when they knew -­

the secretary have the authority to -- to withdraw 

certification on the ground that it is no longer safe, 

fair, and potent?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.  There 

is -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You are assuming that the 

manufacturer knows something that the secretary doesn't?

 MR. FREDERICK:  No.  Our submission, 

Justice Kennedy, is that for many vaccines there is no 

safer alternative, and there could be no design defect 

claim.  But for those instances in which there is a 

safer alternative, the burden under State law is for the 

manufacturer to act reasonably in pursuing the safer

design, if that is available.

 It's not -- there is no provision in the FDA 

regulations or under statute for the FDA to engage in a 

comparative safety analysis.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If the language -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any provision 

in the regulations that require a manufacturer to 

withdraw a drug earlier than when the FDA tells them to?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Not that I'm aware of.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So this immunity would 

come along until they go to the FDA and say, Well, we've 

gotten enough incidents to prove -­

MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.  And this 

very vaccine, Justice Sotomayor, was taken off the 

market in 1998.  And the product that Wyeth used as the 

substitute for it says in its package insert, this is a 

safer vaccine than the Tri-Immunol that we have taken 

off the market.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I'm not sure 

that in most cases you are going to be able to tell 

immediately -- you are marketing one vaccine and 

something else is being tested or about to be approved, 

or it's on the market -- that that's safer. 

Particularly since you have to look not only at -­

whatever -- injury and mortality rates, but also

efficaciousness -- or efficiency, I guess -- in terms of

the vaccine.

 So you don't know right away.  Somebody 

comes in and says, Here's a different vaccine; your 

vaccine causes one death every 10,000 doses, or whatever 

it is.  And the other says, This is better; it's one 

death every 12,000 doses.  You say, Well, but ours is 

more efficient in stopping the vaccine.

 Well, how much more efficient?  Well, it 

depends on the judgment of a jury.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And the manufacturers win 

that case, probably, Mr. Chief Justice.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but you assume that 

there is no clause or burden to the manufacturers who 

defend these suits to assess settlement offers.  This is 

a -- this is a tremendous expense.

the manufacturer has to settle a meritorious case; we 

all know that.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  But, Justice Kennedy, 

that's after an exhaustive process through which they 

have gone through the vaccine program and the person is 

dissatisfied with the remedy that's provided.

vast, vast majority of those kinds of claims.  And it's 

only in those rare circumstances where there would be a

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Congress enacted the National Childhood 

Vaccine Injury Act against the backdrop of a wave of 

tort litigation that threatened to drive manufacturers 

out of the business of providing the vaccine -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why didn't they make 

the vaccine court exclusive?  There is plenty of 

administrative systems that make -- preclude State law 

actions altogether and place you in administrative 

proceedings.  So if their intent was to drive out State 

lawsuits, why not do that?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Because, Justice Sotomayor, 

the kind of lawsuits that caused Congress concern were

the very kind of lawsuits that are expressly preempted 

by 22(b)(1), and that is design defect claims, which 

have the exact problem that was just being discussed.

 For a design defect claim, as Justice Scalia 

pointed out, the challenge that is brought to the 

vaccine that was approved by the FDA can be challenged 

as less safe than some alternative vaccine, bounded only 

by the imagination of the experts.  It was those design 

defect claims that were the problem.  Congress 

preserved -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, how -- couldn't they 

have taken care of that with Daubert?  I mean, won't 

most of these cases get resolved on a motion for summary 

judgment?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Not design defect claims, 

Your Honor.  Just to go back to 1986 and what the crisis 

was.  As the 1986 House report makes clear, the 

manufacturers were being driven out of the vaccine 

business, imperiling the nation's design -- vaccine 

supply by design defect claims that did survive summary 

judgment.  And that did lead to the danger, as 

Justice Kennedy pointed out, of settlements.  The key 

point about protection -­

regulations or law where the FDA, in giving a license to

or permitting a new vaccine, actually looks at whether 

that vaccine is the most efficacious way with the least 

serious harm to the population.  Is there a regulation 

that requires that judgment by them before they issue 

permission to market?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  There is not, Justice 

Sotomayor.  What the FDA is empowered by regulation to 

decide under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is whether 

the vaccine is safe and efficacious.  Once approved -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  What is the 

motivation?  If there is no -- there's no approval 

mechanism for the FDA to look at that issue, what is the 

motivation for manufacturers to voluntarily remove a 

drug that is causing harm to the public before the FDA 

acts?

 If they are completely immune under your 

reading of this preemption statute, what motivates them 

to act more quickly?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  The Act itself.  But 

section 27 of the Act -- let me just go back and 

describe what Congress did in 1986.  It said, We have a 

crisis, and it created three things to solve the crisis: 

A preemption provision that said, Let's end the design 

defect claims that are causing the problem.  Let's 

provide --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Sullivan --

Ms. Sullivan, if Congress had wanted to do that, they 

could have said simply that no vaccine manufacturer may 

be held civilly liable if the vaccine is properly 

prepared and accompanied by proper directions and 

adequate warnings.  That would have been the simplest 

statement.

 Congress didn't make that statement.  They 

were asked to amend the statute to make that statement, 

and they didn't.  I mean, if you wanted to make it clear 

that there is no design defect liability, then say that: 

No civil liability unless inadequately -- improperly 

prepared, improper directions, or warnings.

 What they -- the language that they used is 

certainly, to say the least, confusing.  This 

unavoidable -- these side effects that were unavoidable. 

Well, why did they need to put that in there if what 

they were concerned with was to cut out liability for 

design defects?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Ginsburg, let's go 

back to the text and put -- read the two clauses 

together.  And our main point here is, as Justice Alito 

and Justice Scalia have already pointed out, the 

Petitioners render the "even though" clause surplusage.

 We read the two clauses together.  And let's

read them together against the backdrop of the three 

kinds of product liability claims that could be brought: 

Design defect, manufacturing defect, and failure to 

warn.

 The -- the statute references two out of the 

three.  And we -- we believe that -- and the Government 

believes that the reason that was done was to say that 

the third omitted kind of claim, design defect claims, 

were preempted.  The two that were allowed -- and, 

Justice Sotomayor, this is what makes it different from 

straight pure administrative schemes -- this does 

preempt defect claims, the omitted claim.  It allows 

manufacturing defect claims and it allows warning claims 

subject to the presumption in 22(b)(2).  Limited -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under your view, when does 

the manufacturer have to come forward and acknowledge 

that there is a defect in the design?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Justice Kennedy, the 

manufacturer is subject to ongoing reporting 

requirements under section 28 of the statute.  And I 

think that if you think there is ambiguity in the text, 

as Justice Breyer suggests, we can go to the structure 

of the statute.  And let me just mention a number of 

features of the statute -­

answer that question?  What is the motivation for the 

manufacturer to either continue the testing of their 

product and voluntarily stopping it if a better design 

has been found by someone else or even an inducement for 

them to find a better design if a competitor comes 

around?

 Because I don't see why they should stop 

until they have caused as many injuries as they need to 

before the FDA says stop.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Justice -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What is the inducement 

for them to do it voluntarily?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  First of all, Justice 

Sotomayor, Justice Kennedy is correct, the FDA can order 

removal from the market.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I am not asking about 

the FDA.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  But the reason why -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I said the 

manufacturers' motivations.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  And -- and, Justice 

Sotomayor, the reason why the FDA has never had to use 

that nuclear option is that it -- it works closely with 

manufacturers long before it needs to be used, and 

that's because of the rest of the structure of the Act.

in 1986 in addition to -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Before you get to 

that, I think your answer to Justice Sotomayor's 

question is:  Nothing; the manufacturers have no reason 

to take the vaccine off the market until the FDA tells 

them to.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  That's not correct, Your 

Honor.  So the -- section 27.  Section 27 distinguishes 

vaccines from other drugs.  Section 27 says that the 

Secretary of Health and Human Services shall -- shall 

have an affirmative mandate to promote safer vaccines 

and to reduce the number of side effects.

 And the Vaccine Act didn't just eliminate 

design defects -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if the manufacturer is 

slow or remiss or negligent or willful in not giving the 

information to the Government, there is nothing the 

injured person can do.  There is still complete 

preemption, under your view?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Of design defect claims, 

Justice Kennedy, but not of warning claims.  And it 

will -- there are grave consequences if a manufacturer 

withholds knowledge of adverse effects from the FDA.

anything in this that would give them -­

MS. SULLIVAN:  There is not a freestanding 

cause of action.  But if you look at 22(b)(2), you see 

that the manufacturer will lose his -- lose its 

presumption that its warnings were correct.  It will be 

subject to warnings suits in State court if it withholds 

information from the FDA without the benefit of the 

presumption.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The warning -­

MS. SULLIVAN:  And if you look at -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The warning -- the 

warning claims, the manufacturing claims, those are 

always avoidable.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Always avoidable.  Exactly, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- so what can be -­

the only thing that can be unavoidable is the design 

defect.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  That's exactly right, Your 

Honor.  And that's how the text makes sense.

 To go back to the text, the text says there 

are two kinds of avoidable side effects:  Side effects 

that come from improper preparation -- well, of course

the manufacturer can avoid those; it can prepare the 

vaccine better without contaminants -- and it can avoid 

warning defects by changing the warning.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The warning doesn't have 

to say, "Warning:  We could make something better if we 

wanted to."

 (Laughter.)

 MS. SULLIVAN:  It does not.  That's correct, 

Your Honor.  And that's because -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or there is something 

better on the market than this that won't cause that.

told a story that perhaps has misled the Court into 

thinking there was a safer vaccine in the 1980s.  There 

was not.

a success in the way that FDA worked with the scientific 

community and the national Government worked with 

manufacturers to produce a safer vaccine, it was the

it was available for all five inoculations.  And then 

Wyeth bought it, and then -­

MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Ginsburg, Tri-Solgen 

was a split cell vaccine.  It was manufactured and 

produced by Lily in the 60s and withdrawn in the 70s. 

But Mr. Frederick was incorrect that the Government ever 

deemed it as effective and safer than the wholesale 

vaccine, Tri-Immunol, that was administered in this 

case.

 If I could refer Your Honor to page 19 of 

the Respondent's brief, we cite to 50 -- Federal 

Register 51051 and 52.  That's where the FDA 

specifically determined that Tri-Solgen was not safer, 

was not safer, than Tri-Immunol with respect to seizure 

disorders or other severe effects.  It simply may have 

involved less local effects like fevers and rashes.

 So there was never any government 

determination that Tri-Solgen was safer.  In fact, 

Tri-Solgen came off the market.  Why?  Because the 

section 27 worked, the Federal Government worked to 

promote safer vaccines.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  How does it do that?  Look, 

I think a difficulty I have is this.  Imagine vaccine X 

saves 10,000 lives, but inevitably 20 children will be 

killed.  That's inevitable.  Time period one.

Five years passes.  The manufacturer now 

realizes he could save three of those five people.  All 

right.  Is there anything in the law that requires him 

to tell the FDA that that is so?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  There is not anything that 

requires him to tell the FDA that is so.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If there is 

nothing that requires him to tell the FDA what comes 

along, what I think your opponent is saying is at that 

moment, it is no longer an unavoidable harm and there is 

nothing in this statute that says that unavoidable 

harms -- that avoidable harms are taken away from the 

courts.

 So what is your response to -- what is your 

response to that?  He's saying all the unavoidable ones 

are taken away, but not the avoidable ones.  And now we 

have an example.  So what is your response to that?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  That "unavoidable" in the 

statute is a term of art.  And to the extent that 

comment k is relevant at all, Mr. Frederick says, "Oh, 

Congress was adopting comment k, the majority view." 

Well, first, there was not a majority view.

especially to mean unavoidable and avoidable.  Let's

at least ambiguous.  If that's so, then what is your 

response to the question I raised before, that is:  That 

he says that if you allow judges and juries to decide 

only the question of avoidability, there will not be the 

harms that the childhood pediatricians thought there 

would be, because most people will go to the courts -­

to the vaccine court anyway.  There are very few such 

cases, and there will not be enough liability to drive 

manufacturers from the market.

 You heard him respond to that.  What is your 

response to that?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  First, there will be enough 

liability to drive manufacturers from the market.  Let 

me correct some things that Mr. Frederick said that were 

not true.

 The vaccine court, 99 percent of those who 

receive monetary judgments in vaccine court, the 

administrative no fault system, do accept their award, 

but what Congress was concerned about was those who lose 

in the administrative system and then go take their 

second bite at the apple in State court, whereas, as has 

been mentioned, they are not bound by any findings in 

the vaccine court.  23(b) says -­

thought if you went into the vaccine court you had to

sign something saying you weren't going to go into a 

tort case.  I'm wrong about that?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  No.  You go into a vaccine 

court and there is an exhaustion requirement.  22(b)(1) 

must add something to the exhaustion requirement.  We 

say it adds an exemption preemption provision, but you 

can elect at the end to take the judgement or not. 

Those who get money in vaccine court, 99 percent take 

it.  What we are worried about is the 64 percent who 

lose in vaccine court.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do those 64 percent 

do now?  What is the percentage of those people who 

actually go into court now?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  I can't answer that, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that because whatever 

the percentage is, proving causation is never easy -­

MS. SULLIVAN:  That's true, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- for non-listed -­

MS. SULLIVAN:  But there are 5,000 claimants 

in vaccine court now who claim there is a relationship 

between the mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine and 

autism.  They have lost all six test cases and when the 

individual cases are resolved, that is 5,000 potential 

claimants in State court.

Congress was worried about episodic waves of 

fear about vaccines leading to future litigation.  They 

took care of existing Claimants with vaccine injuries 

back in 1986 with the compensation system.  The reason 

they put in 22(b)(1) was to prevent future litigation in 

State court where manufacturers could be driven from the 

market by the fear of liability that had in 1986 

involved the withdrawal of insurance, the escalation of 

insurance costs, the withdrawal of one manufacturer from 

the vaccine market.

 And today there are very few vaccine 

manufacturers and the risk of the vaccine supply on 

which the nation's protection from contagious disease 

depends, it depends upon the existence of that stable 

supply of vaccines.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If Congress were so 

clear, as you are describing it, then why didn't it 

adopt the provision that said failure to develop a safer 

vaccine would not be grounds for liability?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, 

I think you have to look to the rest of the structure of 

the Acts to see what Congress did here.  It did three 

things.

 It made vaccines quite different from other 

drugs.  And this is not a situation where the FDA has to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it also was directed 

 MS. SULLIVAN:  That's right -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The failure to develop a 

safer vaccine would not be grounds for liability, and 

Congress didn't enact that.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Your Honor, Congress enacted 

a preemption provision that we think it was in the four 

corners of the provision of 22(b)(1), "preempts design 

defects."  It has a carveout for the two kinds of suits 

that are allowed, manufacturer and warning defects.  The 

clear holding of the rest of the text is that design 

defect claims are precluded.  Compensation makes sure 

that people who do have injuries from vaccines are taken 

care of.

 The rest of the structure of the Act injects 

the Federal Government into driving the vaccine 

development process in a way that it does not for other 

drugs.  Congress wants people to take vaccines.  It 

wants us to inoculate all our children.  It wants us to 

have compensation to ensure people who are injured that 

they can get some money to take care of their children's

 But Congress wanted to make sure that it was 

driving, that the Federal Government, the FDA, the 

Centers For Disease Control, together with the AMA, 

together with task forces, were driving research to make 

safer vaccines.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are making an 

assumption that has a flawed premise, which is that 

their only concern was protecting the manufacturers.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Not at all, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It couldn't have been.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  They compensate the victims.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not only do they 

compensate victims, but they permitted victims to go 

into State court.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  For manufacturing and warning 

claims.  For manufacturing and warning claims.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no.  That's your 

assumption.  My point is that if we are talking about 

what the purpose was, you can't assume that -­

and the protection of the vaccine supply.  Justice 

Sotomayor, the clearest way that I -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If this drug had not 

been sold and another drug had been used the person 

would have avoided their injury.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, there is no such drug 

here.  Acellular vaccine was not approved by the FDA for 

use in infants under two until 1996.  It was approved 

for children over two in 1991.  That's because in this 

country, we require clinical studies that weren't 

required in Japan a decade earlier to make sure that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It sounds to me that 

you're going to win on non-summary judgment.  I don't

be very, very onerous.  So I'm not trying to minimize 

it, but I do think that there's a whole lot of hurdles 

in place before a plaintiff wins on one of these claims.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Sotomayor, 

manufacturing claims and warning claims are susceptible 

to summary judgment.  Design defect claims are not in 

the same way.  You are shadowboxing against an infinite 

number of theories about how there could have been a 

safer vaccine.

 But the clearest way I can say why 

Mr. Frederick's interpretation can't be right is:  If

you concede at least one purpose was to protect 

manufacturers, to protect the vaccine supply, in 

addition to compensating the victims, Mr. Frederick's 

reading of 22(b)(1) does not serve that purpose.  He 

reads 22(b)(1) to leave manufacturers in the exact same 

place after the Act that they were before.  Go to State 

court.  Try to show that there was -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They set up this whole 

compensation scheme where everybody agrees -- I mean, 

the manufacturers got this compensation scheme which 

took most of the cases out of State court.

 So to say they were left just like they were 

before, before they were exposed to all these claims -­

now it's only to a very small part of them.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  That's not quite right, 

Justice Ginsburg.  The Act allows all losers in vaccine 

court to go to State court.  There are 5,000 -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, yes.  I got that 

answer from Mr. Frederick before.  But most of them 

don't, because it's cheaper, faster, and working well.

 MS. SULLIVAN:  For vaccine court winners, 

that's true.  For vaccine court losers, the fear was 

that these lawsuits would drive manufacturers out of the 

market, even if the manufacturers could win in the end.

it needs to attach at the beginning of the claim. 

22(e), for example, refers to bringing an action. 

22(b)(1), to do any work to protect manufacturers, has 

to attach to prevent the cause of action from being 

brought.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm still not clear -- I'm 

still not clear what answer you gave to 

Justice Ginsburg's question, saying:  Why didn't 

Congress put this out in plain words:  There should be 

no liability for design?  Is the answer sloppy drafting? 

Are you reluctant to give that answer?

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, Justice Kennedy, it 

could have been drafted a different way and it would 

have meant the same thing.  We think the best way to 

read the two clauses together "unavoidable," "even 

though," is to refer to what comment k meant.  Now, 

comment k used the term "unavoidable."  We know Congress 

was thinking about the term unavoidable.  We know that 

because in the 1986 House report the congressional 

committee say we would like to enact the principle of 

comment K.

 Well, what is the principle of comment K? 

The principle of comment k is there are so products so 

useful that we want them to stay on the market without 

design defect liability.  They can only be sued for

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH,

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. HORWICH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I think the Court finds itself actually 

three-quarters of the way through the argument without 

actually hearing about the most important federal agency 

that is involved with this, which is arguably not the 

Food and Drug Administration but the Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention.

 And so with respect to the question about 

what is it that is governing whether the -- whether 

the -- the - a given vaccine is subject to the Act and 

what are the incentives and who is actually making the

decision and who is trying to determine if there's 

something better that's out there that we should be 

pursuing -- that is the mission of the Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention.

 That is why Congress took the original 

table -- the vaccines that are on the original table in 

this statute were taken from CDC's recommendations that 

reflect CDC's expert scientific judgment, based on the 

input from the medical and scientific community, of what 

vaccines do we have that are the ones we should use to 

protect the public health?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Do they get the information 

from the manufacturers?  And -- I mean, would they find 

out if in fact there had been a change -­

MR. HORWICH:  Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and it was now -- there 

is a safer alternative?

 MR. HORWICH:  Well, let me -- let me give -­

kind of -- let me answer that in -- in two ways.

 The -- the first is that the -- the nature 

of vaccine research is not something that manufacturers 

do in a cloistered laboratory somewhere.  So it's 

actually very unlikely to imagine that a manufacturer 

somehow comes uniquely into possession of this 

knowledge.

I mean in fact, the Federal Government 

spends billions of dollars doing vaccine research that 

government scientists themselves perform.  The 

government sets the agenda for what are our targets for 

development.  The -- the research agenda to pursue the 

acellular pertussis vaccine was something driven by the 

Federal Government.

 Federal Government made a choice and said 

we -- we don't want manufacturers and our scientists 

pursuing the -- the Tri-Solgen approach and trying to 

improve that.  We don't understand that vaccine very 

well.  We know the ultimate target needs to be the 

development of an acellular vaccine, and so that's the 

research path that -- to go on.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose then that in -­

suppose I look into this, which I will do, the CDC and 

what they do.  And suppose I become convinced you are 

completely right, that this is a government agency that 

is top of this and the chances of something going wrong 

are very small and they will figure it all out, together 

with the manufacturers.  Suppose I conclude that.

 What do I do about this word unavoidable?

 MR. HORWICH:  Well I think -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now I can't say that the 

word unavoidable -- it's pretty hard to say that that

word unavoidable means avoidable; and I am in fact -­

like to look to the purposes of this statute, that if 

something says "day" I can't say it means "night."  And 

so -- so what --what is it about this word that allows 

us to say that it's avoidable?

 MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think the answer to 

that actually came in a question that Justice Ginsburg 

posed to Mr. Frederick, which is that unavoidable is 

being used in the sense of okay; what are the vaccines 

that FDA has approved that CDC has recommended for 

routine administration to children, and that are the -­

and that are the ones that the Federal Government has 

determined are appropriate therefore to protect the 

public health?  And given that that is the state of 

affairs that we are in, was this injury -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  To show that -- remember 

they only want to say, because of special circumstances 

this is an avoidable -- this is an avoidable injury. 

I 

think I am right on that.

 And -- and so the best place to look in your 

opinion, for me to look, to show that this word 

unavoidable includes that avoidable claim, is where?

 MR. HORWICH:  I think the way to understand 

it is -- is to see that as the -- as the committee 

report -- as the '86 committee report says, that what

Congress is trying to convey in using the word 

unavoidable is it is -- it is respecting the principle 

of comment k, which is the principle that socially 

beneficial products that nonetheless have these adverse 

effects ought to be on the market and we ought not to 

allow tort law to push them off the market, which is 

exactly what -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me -- going back 

to the point you just started with -­

MR. HORWICH:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- which was is this -­

is the Control -- Disease Center, is it making a 

judgment before it approves a drug for licensing, that 

it's the most efficacious drug on market?

 MR. HORWICH:  CDC does not issue a license.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No -­

MR. HORWICH:  But the way the statute works 

is that the statute only covers, in its present form, 

the way -- I'm referring now to the present version of 

the provision in the statute that explains how vaccines 

become subject to the Act, because not all vaccines are. 

The provision is in 14(e) of the Act, which I believe 

may not be reproduced in any of the papers, but it 

basically says that two things have to happen.  One is 

that before the vaccine becomes subject to either the

compensation program or the preemption provision -- is 

that CDC has to recommend it for routine administration. 

And that is a judgment that CDC makes with the advice of 

the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where do I look at that? 

At what documents do I look at to make a judgment that 

in fact, CDC is doing what I ask, that it is looking at 

the question of whether this is the most efficacious 

drug with the least adverse effects?  Is that a judgment 

it's making?

 MR. HORWICH:  Yes.  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We know the FDA is not. 

Are you representing to us right now that CDC makes that 

judgment?

 MR. HORWICH:  CDC makes that judgment and 

announces it in a reasoned, published announcement in 

its official journal which is the Morbidity and 

Mortality Weekly Report.

 And so for every drug -- or excuse me, for 

every vaccine that it recommends for routine 

administration, it publishes a notice in its journal 

explaining, this is -- these are the products that we 

are recommending for routine use, this is the -- the 

studies, this is the development of them, this is our 

basis for this determination.  And so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That would include 

comparisons to other drugs on the market?

 MR. HORWICH:  Well, it -- there often won't 

be other drugs actually on the market to compare it to, 

but there will be -- there will be a vast body of 

scientific literature that again is not exclusively 

within the manufacturers' control, because it has been 

produced by the Federal Government, by other countries' 

public health agencies, by academic scientists, that CDC 

will reference or its advisory committee will have 

incorporated in its recommendation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it doesn't make a 

determination that the one that they are listing in 

their morbidity report is better than one that's out 

there?  This is a situation where there were two of them 

out there.

that information in their weekly report, do they compare 

it both with respect to losses or mortality and with 

respect to efficiency, with -- to the other vaccines on 

the market.

 MR. HORWICH:  Yes.  Let me give you an 

excellent example of that which is probably familiar to 

the Court, that there are two types polio vaccines. 

There is the Sabin vaccine, with is associated with 

certain very rare but serious side effects but which is 

extremely efficacious at protecting a population, and 

then there is the Salk vaccine, which is not associated

with those same side effects, but is not as effective at 

protecting the population.

 Now CDC made a determination and this was a 

determination in effect from the 1960s through the 

1990s, that the Sabin vaccine -- the one that is, quote, 

unquote, "less safe," was the appropriate one for use 

because it better served the public health.  Now as 

polio -- now this is a dynamic process that CDC is 

continually engaged in, and so as polio approached 

global eradication and you are not as concerned about 

actual control of disease running in the community, CDC 

transitioned its recommendation to the Salk vaccine.

 So I -- I think that answers the question 

that the CDC is making determinations in this regard in 

a comparative way; and I think it would be extraordinary 

then to have juries -- to have -- to imagine that 

Congress set up a system in which juries would 

effectively be second-guessing decisions like that, 

because CDC has made -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The committees have 

manufacturers and Government scientists and university 

professors and others?

 MR. HORWICH:  My understanding is actually 

the manufacturers are -- are -- are relatively less 

represented on these -- on these committees.  In a sense 

that the manufacturers are sometimes doing the 

manufacturing, but a lot of the research agenda is 

really driven by the Federal Government.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Horwich, would you -­

would you explain one feature of this, it was the

allegation that there were an unusual number of adverse 

reactions to the particular lot that this child's third 

vaccine came from, and that those adverse reactions were 

not disclosed to the doctors.  And the doctors -- the 

child's doctor said if I had known about the unusual 

number of adverse reactions, I never would have used 

this vaccine.

 Is there any actionable claim for that, for 

not disclosing that there were a number of adverse -- an 

unusual number of adverse reactions to this particular 

lot.

 MR. HORWICH:  If -- if I may?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.

 MR. HORWICH:  Yes, absolutely there is, 

because that claim is either in the nature of a labeling 

claim or in the nature of a manufacturing defect claim. 

And the -- the district court here and the court of 

appeals both treated that question not under preemption 

but on the facts, summary judgment in this case was 

granted purely on the absence of a disputed issue of 

material fact -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 MR. HORWICH:  -- with respect to those 

claims.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you.

 The only law cited by the Government today 

was section 14 of the Vaccine Act.  It is not reproduced 

in the materials, but it is -- the title of section 14 

is a vaccine injury table.  It's about recommendations 

that the CDC makes as to which vaccines will be on the 

vaccine table, so that when the person goes throughout 

vaccine court process, you can look and determine 

whether or not on a no-fault basis the vaccine is listed 

on the table or not listed on the table.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  May I ask you this question 

about something that Mr. Horwich said?  Under your 

understanding of this scheme, if a -- a person suffered 

a very serious injury as a result of the Sabin vaccine 

during the period when the CDC recommended that over the 

Salk vaccine, would the -- would that injured person 

have a claim for design defect if the person could -­

could produce experts who said the CDC was wrong, that 

they should never have made this recommendation?

 MR. FREDERICK:  It's not that the CDC would 

be wrong, Justice Alito.  There is a difference between 

strict liability and a no-fault arrangement and where

negligence would be asserted that a reasonable 

manufacturer would have come forward with information 

about a safer design.

 So what Congress explicitly rejected and 

they voted this down in the Energy and Commerce 

Committee was a regulatory compliance defense solely on 

the basis that the FDA had approved at the time -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this may be -- this 

may be what Congress wanted and may be the better 

policy, but your answer to my question is that -­

MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- that would permit a lay 

jury relying on experts produced in court, the CDC got 

this wrong, the Salk vaccine was really the better one.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, yes, that would be a 

viable design defect claim.  And let me give you an 

example right out of the Joint Appendix in this case. 

In 1965 Lederle's researchers determine that Lily, the 

Tri-Solgen, had a "superior product," that's at page 245 

of the Joint Appendix.  That was in 1967.  Eight years 

later the internal scientists at Lederle wrote a memo to 

the head of Lederle and said we recommend that we 

approach Lily for its pertussis vaccine process and/or 

continue to bid on foreign contracts for this product 

line with the intent of increasing volume.

They had made the determination they were 

not capable internally of doing a safer design and they 

knew that for eight years and they nonetheless kept the 

wholesale pertussis in its market and the documents in 

this case indicate they did it for economic reasons. 

And the whole idea behind having design defect claims is 

to put manufacturers to the duty of putting out safest 

possible products in light of what the science holds.

 The CDC -- there are no regulations that the 

Government cites in its brief or today saying that the 

CDC does the kind of comparative analysis for safety 

that is provided under State law design defect claims.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Their argument is that the 

CDC will do it better than juries.  That's what I heard 

him say.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And, Justice Breyer, there 

are now six DTaP vaccines on the market that CDC doesn't 

distinguish between them, but if it comes to pass that 

the science would indicate that one of them was woefully 

not as safe, and here, their argument is that the 

vaccine industry is going to go out of business.  This 

vaccine that's at issue in this case was taken off the 

market in 1998.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought 

Mr. Horwich told me that the CDC does compare new

vaccines to the ones that are out in the market?

 MR. FREDERICK:  He cited no law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You think he was 

incorrect in that assertion.  We can go back and look at 

these weekly reports and they are either going to say 

this is better than the one that's out there or they are 

not.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  And if you compare 

that to what Congress wrote in the statute, our 

submission is that Congress's words in section 22 take 

precedence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm just trying to 

find out what your position is on that.  Do they compare 

it to existing vaccines or not?

 MR. FREDERICK:  We found no law that gives 

the CDC the authority.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not asking about 

law, I'm asking matter of fact.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Whether, I'm not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You open up the 

weekly report.

 MR. FREDERICK:  I'm sorry, 

Mr. Chief Justice.

weekly report and it says this new vaccine is better

vaccine than the one that is out there or not?

 MR. FREDERICK:  I'm not aware that the CDC 

does the kind of granular comparisons that would go to 

the level of safety that is at issue in this kind of 

case.  And that's what's important here.  We are talking 

about trying to eliminate some of the most horrifying 

and horrible incidents of injury to vaccines that we 

compel children to take.

 And the whole idea behind Congress's scheme 

was to balance having vaccine supply available with 

providing a generous form of compensation to those 

persons who would be injured.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
