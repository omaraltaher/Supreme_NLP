CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 00 -- oh, pardon me -- 01-332, the Board of


Education of Independent School District No. 92 of


Pottawatomie County v. Lindsay Earls.


Ms. Meoli.  Meoli I guess.  Is -- is that the


correct pronunciation? 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA M. MEOLI


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MS. MEOLI:  Meoli. 


QUESTION:  Meoli, okay.  The third time is the


charm. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. MEOLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


This case involves the constitutionality of the


Tecumseh School Board's decision to implement a


suspicionless drug testing policy for students in


competitive activities as a reasonable response to student


drug use. 


Tecumseh's policy represents a natural, logical,


and rational application of this Court's decision in


Vernonia v. Acton.  Vernonia's policy applied to students


who chose to participate in interscholastic athletics.

Tecumseh's policy applies as well to athletics, but also


to all the other competitive activities that are offered


by the district. 


Respondents do not challenge the policy as


applied to the athletics, conceding that this Court


approved that practice in Vernonia.  Competitive --


QUESTION:  Well, this policy goes beyond what


was permitted in Vernonia, does it not?


MS. MEOLI:  Well, it covers --


QUESTION:  It greatly expands the number of


students covered by the policy. 


MS. MEOLI:  It -- it covers a wider variety of


interscholastic competitive activities.


QUESTION:  And the evidence is not as strong, is


it, in this case of drug use in the school as -- as was


the case in Vernonia?


MS. MEOLI:  Well, Your Honor, we do not believe


that is true.


QUESTION:  Well, if you go by the district


court's findings, that's what you'd conclude. 


MS. MEOLI:  The district court in Vernonia?


QUESTION:  In this case.


MS. MEOLI:  In this case.  No, Your Honor, I --


I really don't think so.  I think there is ample evidence


in the record to demonstrate a drug problem in Tecumseh.

 QUESTION:  What do you --


QUESTION:  By the -- by the young people who


were involved in these particular extracurricular


activities?


MS. MEOLI:  Yes, we do have evidence of drug use


with these students in extracurricular activities. 


QUESTION:  Well, what do you make of the -- the


reports that have been filed up to the eve of the adoption


of this regulation by the school district with the Feds,


year after year after year, saying, things are fine here? 


The only thing we have to worry about is some beer.  Were


they lying? 


MS. MEOLI:  No, Your Honor, I don't think they


were lying.  Number one, the district has always admitted


that alcohol really is the number one problem in the


school district, and that's what the applications for the


Federal --


QUESTION:  Yes, but they were -- they were


saying at the same time that they didn't have a problem


with -- with what we usually refer to as drugs.


MS. MEOLI:  They said it -- it wasn't a major


problem at that time.  And -- and I think if you


compare --


QUESTION:  And -- and in point of fact, as I


understand it, since the testing has been carried out

among the -- the class of people subject to this


challenge, there have been only three instances of any


drug use found.


MS. MEOLI:  From the -- from the drug testing?


QUESTION:  It would seem -- it seems to me that


your evidentiary problem is up to the eve of adopting the


regulation, the school district was saying, we don't have


a problem.  And once the regulation was, in fact, in --


was -- was placed into effect, you've gone for several


years and you found three instances.  I -- I don't see how


you -- you don't lose whether we look at it ex ante or ex


post. 


MS. MEOLI:  Let me answer the second part first. 


First of all, the -- the policy was only in effect for a


limited amount of time in the 2-year span of time.  It was


implemented halfway into the first school year, and so a


limited amount of students were covered in that first


year.


The second year, the lawsuit was filed at the


beginning of August, and therefore only a very limited


number of initial testing was done before the district


determined to hold the policy in abeyance.  There were


four students in -- under those limited amount of students


that tested positive.  I know the court of appeals


referred to three in one area, but that was just in the

high school.


QUESTION:  But didn't one --


QUESTION:  Well, I suppose the existence of a


policy might be expected to deter drug use so that you


would have fewer instances after it was imposed. 


MS. MEOLI:  Yes, Your Honor, and -- and in fact


really --


QUESTION:  We will never know, will we?


QUESTION:  Well, let her answer the question.


(Laughter.) 


MS. MEOLI:  Your Honor, in fact, it -- it really


did.  I -- I mean, if you even take the limited amount of


testing that we did in the 2-year period of time, the


first year three students tested positive, the second year


one student tested positive.  The only full year that the


testing was applied in the Tecumseh School District was


after the district court made its decision but before the


court of appeals overruled it.  And that evidence is not


in the record, but it was -- there was a greater number of


students that tested --


QUESTION:  Ms. Meoli, didn't we say in Vernonia


that in Skinner, which was the railroad employee testing


case, we did not demand that it be shown that the


particular railroad had a drug problem?  Didn't we say it


was enough that there was a nationwide problem?

 MS. MEOLI:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  We said that in Skinner, and we


adverted to that in Vernonia.


MS. MEOLI:  And -- and Vernonia's evidence as


well showed that there was not a specific drug problem


among athletes. 


QUESTION:  I thought the argument in Vernonia


and I thought the opinion in Vernonia, in assessing the


particular interest of the district, repeatedly emphasized


the particular problems with the athletes.  The athletes


were the ones that the kids looked up to.  They were the


role models.  There was rampant drug use among the


athletes.  There was a rampant disciplinary problem among


the athletes.  Athletes were getting injured.  There was a


very specific showing of a specific interest of the


district. 


And now you're coming in and saying, well, that


-- that really does not matter.  And it seems to me that


the implication of what you're saying is that this so-


called special needs requirement will apply to every child


in every school in the United States. 


MS. MEOLI:  I'm not saying that, Your Honor.  I


-- I think there is a corollary --


QUESTION:  But isn't that the implication of


what you're saying?

 MS. MEOLI:  No, Your Honor, I don't.  For


instance, you were talking about in Vernonia the athletes


were looked up as role models.  Well, the athletes in


interscholastic competition in Tecumseh are looked at as


role models to some students --


QUESTION:  Except for one startling difference. 


The -- in -- there was a problem with athletes.  Here,


one thing that is clear in the record is the -- the school


board's admission that the -- that the drug and alcohol


problem is more of a problem with those who are not


engaged in these extracurricular activities.  In other


words, the testing is directed to a group, those engaged


in competitive activities, that is less of a problem, as


far as drug use is concerned, than the rest of the


students who are idle.  And just naturally one would


expect what turns out to be the case, that there's more


drug use in the group that's not tested than there is in


the group that's tested.


MS. MEOLI:  Well, Your Honor, we have never said


that the -- the students in interscholastic competitive


activities are the only students or even the most likely


students to be abusing drugs.  But the evidence that we


have in the case demonstrate that they do abuse drugs.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm -- I'm referring


specifically to page 100 and 101 of the joint appendix

where the question is whether the students who tend to be


involved in drugs are the ones most likely to be choosing


extracurricular activities.  And the answer ultimately is,


we have students that are on drugs, and they are in


extracurricular activities.  They are -- they are -- there


are probably more that are not in activities.


MS. MEOLI:  That was the testimony of the -- of


the board president, Dean Rogers.  There's also testimony


of James Blue that said he really didn't find that


difference between --


QUESTION:  Where is that testimony? 


MS. MEOLI:  I think it is at page 106, Your


Honor.  Page 106.  Now, national studies show that band,


vocal and non-athletic extracurricular activities


students, they are the least likely of all students to use


drugs.  Would you agree that this same -- the same thing


would hold true for Tecumseh High School students?  The


answer was, no, I would not.


QUESTION:  He had no basis for saying yes or no.


MS. MEOLI:  Well, yes, he -- he says that


initially, and then he goes on to say, I just know that


all age levels, all categories -- if we're categorizing


the students that frequent the park.  This part of the


deposition was referring to this --


QUESTION:  Yes, but he's not saying, as was the

case in Vernonia, that here is a group that we can


identify that has this problem.  Either there's no


particular problem with this group as opposed to all


students -- so, my question is if -- if you can, on the


absence of any special showing with respect to this


extracurricular group, then it seems to me that your


argument is really that all students can be tested.  I


mean, there was a special circumstance with the athletes


in Vernonia.  Your argument for these extracurricular


people I think would hold as well for -- for all the


students because there's no more of a problem and probably


less among those engaged in extracurricular activities


than the -- than among the students that don't do anything


after school.


MS. MEOLI:  Your Honor, the use of -- of drugs


among the students in competitive activities was just one


of the factors as to why the Tecumseh board selected that


group.  I really do think that, in fact, the -- at the


meeting that the school district held for the community to


give input, they asked that same question, why can't we


drug test all students?  And I think there's a couple of


reasons as to why you can't. 


One of the reasons I think is because students


in general have a property right in their education. 


Hence, they have a legal entitlement to a free public

education. 


Secondly, the State compels them to be there,


and parents, if they do not send their -- their children


to school, face criminal prosecution.  So -- so they are


there.  And I don't think that you can fashion a drug


testing policy that could have the kind of consequences


that would deny them that opportunity or -- or prevent


parents from being persecuted for not --


QUESTION:  Well, if you want --


QUESTION:  You don't -- you don't have to go


that far, do you, in order to -- in order to justify


limiting it to those who participate in -- in voluntary


activities?


MS. MEOLI:  No, Your Honor.  We -- we --


QUESTION:  It seems to me you could say even if


we could drug test anybody, we made the choice of giving a


student who feels that strongly about not undergoing drug


testing the ability to avoid it by simply not engaging in


the extracurricular activities.  You don't have to forego


going to school entirely or go to a private school.  You


can simply not participate in extracurricular activity. 


Isn't that in itself a valid reason for limiting it to


extracurricular activities? 


MS. MEOLI:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.  I --


QUESTION:  It's an equally valid argument -- I

-- I suppose an equally valid argument would -- for -- for


testing everybody would be our object is to stop drug use,


not to penalize people who go out for band.  And there's


some evidence in this record that there is more drug use


about the -- among the people who are not going out for


extracurricular activities, but among those who do.  And


therefore, if your argument is good for this case, it


seems to me your argument, a fortiori, is good for testing


everybody in the school.


MS. MEOLI:  Your Honor, the -- the purpose of


this program is not to discipline students.  It's not to


catch them.  It is to deter drug use and to help those


students --


QUESTION:  Don't you want to deter drug use


among those who do not go out for band? 


MS. MEOLI:  Yes, Your Honor, I -- I believe we


do.


QUESTION:  Then why isn't the argument good that


you can test everybody? 


MS. MEOLI:  Well, number one, I -- I think there


is a deterrent effect for implementing this program among


the student -- general student body.  If they want to --


QUESTION:  Well, I think -- go ahead. 


MS. MEOLI:  If they want to try out or -- or


audition for one of those competitive activities, they

know in advance that one of the regulations is to be


subjected to drug testing.


QUESTION:  No, but with respect, what you're


arguing is -- is a justification for the present policy


that you've got, and I understand your position there.


What I'm interested in and Justice Ginsburg was


a moment ago is it seems to me that if -- if we take your


argument and we take the evidence that is indicated on the


record, there is at least an equally good argument for


testing everybody in the school, whether they go out for


band or whatnot or -- or do not.  And -- and isn't that


the case?  That's what we're interested in.


MS. MEOLI:  Well, I think there is a reasonably


good argument for that.  We're not espousing that, but I


think --


QUESTION:  No, I realize --


MS. MEOLI:  -- even though -- even -- even if we


utilize the balancing test that was utilized in Vernonia,


I -- I think there is a really good argument --


QUESTION:  But if we get to that point, then the


whole notion of special need has -- has, more or less,


evaporated.  We don't have the kind of special safety need


as -- as in the railroad case.  We don't have the unusual


temptation to crime need as in the immigration case, and


the special need is simply the need to deter drug use

among all children in all schools of the United States. 


And -- and if the -- if the theory of this is special


need, it seems to me that the concept of special need


seems to have gotten lost.


QUESTION:  I suppose the distinction that you


draw is based on the fact that you have a sanction for the


people that you apply it to.  You can tell them you cannot


participate in extracurricular activities.  But as -- if


you applied it to the whole school board -- to the whole


school population, rather, you couldn't sanction them by


saying you cannot come to school.


MS. MEOLI:  Exactly, Your Honor, and -- and that


really is our position because we have to educate the --


QUESTION:  But you could say --


QUESTION:  And the only sanction you impose is


you just can't play in the band or -- or cheerlead or


whatever it is they want to do. 


MS. MEOLI:  You can -- you can remain in the


class.


QUESTION:  So, you have a special burden if you


want to engage in extracurricular activities.


MS. MEOLI:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Or how about taking elective classes,


classes that the State doesn't require you to take, but


some students might like to take?

 MS. MEOLI:  Well, Your Honor, we have to draw a


line somewhere, and -- and even though elective classes


are a choice --


QUESTION:  Well, I wondered what -- the line


that you would draw as a question of the school's policy,


but you were saying at least you see a problem with


testing everyone because people are compelled to go to


school and -- so that's why you resisted drawing the line


there. 


My question is if you're doing a voluntary, then


why don't you say as well, you volunteer for -- you're


taking a certain course, this is an elective course.  Same


thing. 


MS. MEOLI:  Well -- well, elective courses are


really mandatory, Your Honor, in many cases.  I mean, you


have your core curriculum that are required for


graduation, and you also have your electives.  You need 24


credits in order to graduate from high school.  18 of them


have to be in the core subjects.  The rest of them are


electives.  But those are required. 


QUESTION:  Except for that, it would be a good


idea, though, wouldn't it? 


(Laughter.)


MS. MEOLI:  Yes, Your Honor.  I -- I think if --


if we could fashion --

 QUESTION:  That's what I thought you'd say. 


MS. MEOLI:  If we could fashion a way to do it,


I believe the majority of school boards would be behind


it.  But -- but at the state of the constitutions of -- of


the 50 States and the states of the compulsory education


laws that all the States have, I -- I don't think that is


possible.  So, if a line is going to be drawn, I think the


line can be drawn between the students in the general


school population and students in extracurricular --


QUESTION:  May I ask?  Is there any other


sanction other than -- other than ineligibility for


extracurricular activities?  Is there any other sanction


imposed on a student who is found to have been using


drugs?


MS. MEOLI:  No -- no, Your Honor, and in fact,


that only happens in this policy under the third time --


QUESTION:  So, really the student could say,


well, the worst -- if I go out for extracurricular


activities and get caught, it'll be back where if I had


gone out at all. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  He gets back to square one.


MS. MEOLI:  Well, I think -- I think children


who engage in these activities really want to compete.  I


mean, they are really interested in what they are doing.

So, they don't want to get caught.  And it's also a -- a


way for these students to say no.  Peer pressure among


elementary and secondary school children is -- is very


significant, and --


QUESTION:  Could you, for that reason, adopt as


a -- as one of our sanctions or a supplementary sanction


simply publicity that the person has been caught?  Anybody


who fails the drug test will have his name and photograph


posted on the bulletin board.  Would that be -- would that


be constitutional too?  I presume it would be under your


theory. 


MS. MEOLI:  I -- I think it would be very cruel,


Your Honor.  As -- as to whether --


QUESTION:  It would get the job done.


MS. MEOLI:  -- as to whether it is


constitutional or not -- we're -- we're not in -- in the


job of disciplining students.  And -- and we seem to be


going into that realm more and more.  This program -- we


don't want to put an A on them or a big substance abuse on


them.  What we really want to do is help those students. 


And it may be constitutional to do that, but that's not


what we are asking this Court to do.  We're just asking


you to give us the tools to deter drug use, to help those


drug users. 


And -- and if there are no other questions --

 QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Meoli. 


MS. MEOLI:  -- my time. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


A school district that reasonably concludes that


it faces a drug problem may adopt random drug tests for


students engaged in competitive extracurricular activities


without violating the Constitution. 


QUESTION:  Suppose you've had hard statistical


evidence to show that the kids that go out for the


extracurricular activities are the ones that really do not


use drugs, that the high drug user population is in those


that don't engage in the activities.  What -- what would


your recommendation be to the school board at that point?


MR. CLEMENT:  I think in a case like that, it


still might be appropriate for the school district to test


the students involved in extracurricular activities, and I


think that is because, as this Court has emphasized on a


number of occasions, by making the -- the testing program


applicable only to an avoidable activity, the -- the


school district would be ensuring the reasonableness of

the program under the Fourth Amendment. 


QUESTION:  But there's some -- we -- we had an


amicus brief by some -- a pediatrics association and so


forth that pointed out that students that engage in these


extracurricular activities are, indeed, the least likely


to be involved in drug use.  And it seems so odd to try to


penalize those students and leave untested the students


that are most apt to be engaged in the problem. 


MR. CLEMENT:  Well --


QUESTION:  It's just -- it's so


counterintuitive, isn't it? 


MR. CLEMENT:  A couple of points in response to


that, Justice O'Connor.  First, there's contrary evidence


as well, and the petitioners in their reply brief point to


some evidentiary studies that showed that really drug use


is distributed evenly across all groups in the student --


in the student population. 


The second thing I would add is that as -- as I


was noting in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, there


is a sense, and which the majority and Justice Ginsburg in


-- in Vernonia emphasized, that by making the program only


applicable to activities that are avoidable, you -- you


limit Fourth Amendment difficulties.  You make the program


more reasonable.  And as Justice Stevens pointed out, you


also avoid any difficult questions that might be

occasioned by the consequences of a drug testing program


that applies to school-wide.


QUESTION:  Well, this in the face of a school


district that is certifying to the Federal Government they


don't have a drug problem.  I mean, the whole thing is


absolutely odd. 


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't think it's that odd,


Justice O'Connor.  First of all, in terms of the


certifications, I would direct you to footnote 23 of the


district court opinion.  And the district court found in


that footnote that what those reports really emphasized


are the relative natures of the problem.  Alcohol was the


major problem they faced, but in each one of those --


those reports, they note that they do have a drug problem.


QUESTION:  Well, if alcohol is the problem, why


don't they address that?  This is just -- I mean, it's


structured in a way to do very little good it seems to me.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, do you think any school


in the country doesn't have a drug problem? 


MR. CLEMENT:  I would be surprised to find a


school district that didn't.  The national figures on --


on the -- the amount of drug use are really staggering. 


As we note in our brief, over half of all 12th graders


have tried illegal drugs by the time they graduate from


high school.  So, I really think that, you know, if

anything, the burden ought to shift in these cases to the


other side to show that this one school district is the


one school district --


QUESTION:  Can -- can you tell me --


QUESTION:  In both Skinner and Von Raab, we


imposed or we permitted the imposition of drug testing on


the basis of a nationwide problem, didn't we, without --


without showing that the particular entity in question


shared in that national problem? 


MR. CLEMENT:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.


And I would also point out I'm not sure you want


to put school districts in the business of trying -- when


they -- when they find some incidental evidence of drug


use, to try to pin it down to the exact extracurricular


groups involved.  If a student comes in --


QUESTION:  Well, do --


MR. CLEMENT:  -- for some sort of anonymous drug


counseling, I'm not sure they want to ask him what groups


are you in.


QUESTION:  May I ask?  What is your view on --


on the validity of a -- a school-wide drug testing


program? 


MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Stevens, we think such a


program would be constitutional, but we think the program


at issue here --

 QUESTION:  So, you would differ from the


petitioners then. 


MR. CLEMENT:  We -- we do have that difference,


but we think a program like this is constitutional for


three reasons.  One, extracurricular students agree to


additional intrusions on their privacy and have additional


safety risks.  Second, as --


QUESTION:  No.  But you say they agree to it. 


They agree to it only under the circumstances that if they


don't agree to it, they can't engage in any of these


activities.  They know perfectly well they'll never get


into a competitive college if they don't.  And the -- the


agreement is not simply something that is -- is arrived at


sort of in the abstract.  There's -- there's tremendous


pressure on them to agree to it. 


MR. CLEMENT:  Two points, Justice Souter. 


First, we're not suggesting this is -- this is


constitutional because it's consensual.  I think Justice


Kennedy, in -- in his separate opinion in the Ferguson


case, pointed out that in these special needs contexts,


there's an element of voluntariness which is important to


the constitutional analysis, even if it's not voluntary in


the full sense of the word. 


This -- a second and related point about that,


though, is that these are avoidable programs, and I think


23

that makes the important difference.  And again, as I


noted earlier, because they're -- they're avoidable in


that sense, it avoids any difficult questions with the


consequences that a positive test might generate.


QUESTION:  But it doesn't --


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question that -- that


is -- concern -- concerns me about the difference between


this case and Vernonia?  If we -- if we look at what


people might expect in the real world, where people know


that athletes, professional athletes, Olympic athletes,


athletes are tested for drugs, but people who are just


everyday people aren't.  So, Vernonia could be regarded as


all the students who are athletes -- they will be treated


as athletes are generally.  But that's not true of the --


the large population of high school students.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I mean, I -- I think one


fact is that I think it is increasingly becoming true that


-- that these sorts of policies are in society as a whole. 


And one of the petitioners in this case who -- who didn't


wanted to be drug tested at school had to go get drug


tested for the job at the Kmart, at the McDonald's.  And I


do think that probably does have some influence on the


reasonable expectations of privacy in this area. 


But I also think that it really doesn't make a


lot of sense to draw a line on -- on sports, and even


24

within sports, of course, there are differences.  The


Vernonia policy applied to golfers, as well as football


players.  Now, I'm not aware that golfers, as a general


matter, are tested for substance abuse even on the PGA


Tour.  I could be wrong about that, but the point is there


are differences in the risks even among the athletes, and


I think this Court in Vernonia didn't make anything turn


on those differences. 


The dissent in Vernonia pointed out that there


wasn't any evidence of drug use at the grade school in the


7th and 8th grade, and that the evidence really wasn't an


evidence of a disciplinary problem that was specific to


student athletes.  And the majority in Vernonia did not --


was not -- was not moved by those two points.  The


majority said that the evidence was good enough in these


contexts. 


And I think this is an area where deference to


the local school boards in their determinations about the


nature of the problem, the nature of the solution, and


particularly the particular students that are going to be


tested is quite appropriate.  It's important to


recognize --


QUESTION:  But you would make -- you would make


-- and I think you've said this -- the same argument if


they had decided to have a universal drug testing policy

in the school.


MR. CLEMENT:  I would, Justice Souter.  I do --


as I said, I think it's a more difficult question.  And I


think the most difficult problem with a school-wide test


is what Justice Stevens pointed out, and that would be


what are the consequences of a positive test.  But if you


imagine a school district that -- that faced -- reasonably


concluded it faced a serious problem and instituted a drug


test where the only ramification of a positive drug test


was a confidential notification of the parents, I don't


see why that test would violate Fourth Amendment


reasonableness. 


QUESTION:  But at that point, I -- the so-called


special need has become virtually a universal need.


MR. CLEMENT:  I would like to say two things in


response to that. 


First, in Vernonia itself, this Court didn't


identify the special need as being the drug problem.  This


Court identified the special need as being the school


setting, and that's consistent with this Court's decision


in T.L.O.


QUESTION:  And -- and the special need would be


a universal need in every school in the United States. 


MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I do think it would properly


recognize that the school context is different, and that

school boards have a freer hand in testing their students


than the Government has testing either employees or its


citizens at large.


QUESTION:  But if -- if that is the case, what


is the danger in the school case, comparable to the -- to


the railroad worker's danger or the -- the customs


officer's danger?  What is the danger as distinct from


simply the desire to deter illegal drug use? 


MR. CLEMENT:  I think the danger is this.  I


mean, it -- and I think Von Raab actually is -- is an


excellent counterpoint.  This Court in Von Raab said that


you could test the customs official because they are on


the front line of the drug problems on the supply side.  I


think by parity of reasoning, children today are on the


front lines of the drug problem, but on the demand side. 


The evidence shows that if you can stop children from


using drugs before their 18th birthday, they're not likely


to start using drugs after that --


QUESTION:  But if --


QUESTION:  The danger is getting young people


used to a drug culture.  You're raising young people in


school.  And the -- the specific danger is unlike with


adults.  You're forming -- you're forming their habits for


the rest of their life.


MR. CLEMENT:  I agree with that, Justice Scalia,

and I would -- I would add that this is not the only


context where -- where the Federal Government has


recognized that difference.  The penalties for dealing


drugs in a school area or selling drugs to a minor are


much more substantial than those selling drugs to adults.


QUESTION:  I think that's hardly a revelation


that the Government is concerned about what drugs do to


our culture. 


MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, and I think it's


perfectly --


QUESTION:  It's not exactly rocket science, is


it?


MR. CLEMENT:  No, and -- and I don't think it's


rocket science also to say that that -- that concern is


particularly acute with respect to the youngest and most


vulnerable members of society.  And as I say, if you look


at 21 U.S.C. 859, 860, 861, all of those provisions put


added penalties on someone who deals drugs involving


children. 


Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GRAHAM A. BOYD


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. BOYD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:


Opposing counsel said we have to draw the line


somewhere, and the -- the way to draw the line in this


case is to keep in mind the core principle that


individualized reasonable suspicion is the standard for


school searches set forth in T.L.O.  If there's going to


be a line as to where do we go past that standard, while


still retaining the core of T.L.O. --


QUESTION:  There was no individualized suspicion


in Vernonia. 


MR. BOYD:  There -- there was not, and Vernonia


is the exception. 


QUESTION:  Well, so -- so there goes your


principle. 


MR. BOYD:  Vernonia is the exception to the


T.L.O. rule.  It didn't -- it did not overrule T.L.O. 


What Vernonia said is that in certain special


circumstances, that rule would be set aside.  The key --


QUESTION:  You can have medical -- metal


detectors in schools where they're afraid the children


have guns?


MR. BOYD:  Yes, they can. 


QUESTION:  Now, there's no individualized


suspicion there, is there? 


MR. BOYD:  No, there's not, and the reason --

contagious disease.  I'm not --


QUESTION:  I was trying to -- well, that's what


I -- I raised that because, of course, everyone is making


a criminal analogy, but nobody is arrested here. 


MR. BOYD:  Well --


QUESTION:  Nobody is arrested.  This is


counseling.  It's an effort to deal with the demand side


of drugs, and -- and I just wonder.  That's why I'm -- I'm 


raising, right at the beginning, the question of whether


this individualized suspicion is the correct model to


apply.


MR. BOYD:  Well, unless the Court stands ready


to overrule T.L.O., I believe it is the standard.  I think


what's behind your question, Justice Breyer, is -- is a


question about intrusiveness of the search.  Obviously,


there is a difference between the passive --


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, it's absolutely clear


there isn't individualized suspicion, so you win


automatically if that's the test, I would think. 


MR. BOYD:  Well --


QUESTION:  And, of course, it wasn't in


Vernonia.  I would think it wouldn't be in certain

instances in the school like guns.  And so, rather than


just start off, as you did, assuming that that's it, I'd


like to hear some argument for it. 


MR. BOYD:  Of -- of course.  Let -- let me try


to set up what -- what I see as -- as basically how you


move from the general rule of T.L.O. to the exception of


Vernonia.


In order to set aside that core Fourth Amendment


principle, I think there has to be some nexus to a


problem, some connection that is demonstrated to a problem


either, and preferably both, in terms of safety and drug


use. 


Both of those are missing here.  The reason this


school expanded its initial policy from athletes to


include non-athletes was because it wanted to appear


evenhanded.  Now, that's not a value that this Court has


recognized in the -- in the special needs context.  They


didn't want to stigmatize the athletes alone through the


drug test, so they said, who else can we get?  Their


lawyers said, well, the Seventh Circuit said you can get


the non-athletes, and so they expanded it. 


But let's look at the safety rationale here. 


Now, in Vernonia, the school board said up front, this is


about the safety of our athletes, and that's why we're


doing it.  In this case, the school board's testimony and

the testimony of everyone else who has been -- who's --


who's testified is that safety is not a reason for this


test.  There is nothing about the band or the choir that


is dangerous. 


And this is a very important too that we did not


make in our briefs I want to bring out.  In Vernonia, the


drug test was for in-season athletic activities.  While


you're playing football, you're drug tested.  They were


concerned about that.  In this case, they test year in,


year out.  If you look at page 198 of the joint appendix,


the policy itself says it is in season and out season. 


So, there's nothing about the activities of Lindsay Earls


in the choir, who's here today, not a drug user -- there's


nothing about her activities in the choir that requires


her being drug tested. 


QUESTION:  But the choir is presumably a year-


round thing in a way that football is not. 


MR. BOYD:  No, it's not, Your Honor.  All of


these activities have competitive seasons, and the


competition is what triggers the drug testing.  It's quite


clear that in the academic team, choir, band, all of these


activities, they are participating at a certain point, and


yet they are drug tested throughout the year. 


QUESTION:  Are you saying that, for instance,


choir in Tecumseh is only in the fall?

 MR. BOYD:  The --


QUESTION:  Or only in the winter or only in the


spring? 


MR. BOYD:  Yes, Your Honor, in terms of the


competitions, they are.  There's a class which -- which


they are very clear, it is not the reason that drug


testing takes place, and someone who's merely in the class


is not drug tested.  But if you go out for the team, as it


were, which competes during a limited season, then you are


drug tested, although it is for the entire year.  So,


again, it's not the activities of the choir competition


that are of concern to the school. 


QUESTION:  Well, give me the quote.  Which


season of the four seasons is for band in Tecumseh? 


MR. BOYD:  I honestly don't know what months of


the year they compete in, and -- and in rebuttal, if I'm


wrong, I'm --


QUESTION:  They can't be for all four seasons, I


guess. 


But --


MR. BOYD:  Excuse me?


QUESTION:  -- let me -- let me ask you this. 


What -- what they're -- what they're trying to do is to


find a basis on which they can implement a program which


has an element of consent to it.  The Government does not

think that's necessary, but that's the case that we have


before us.  And so, what the school district has done has


taken a set of programs and they said, this is a surrogate


for consent, and that's what's happening here.  This -- I


-- I think this goes beyond Vernonia.


MR. BOYD:  Right. 


QUESTION:  But we take cases as they come to us,


and in this case, it is clear that the student who is --


is so offended by the idea of a search and does not care


about the school district's policy of ensuring that drugs


are school-free doesn't need to participate in the


extracurricular activity.  That's their choice. 


MR. BOYD:  Well, Justice Kennedy, you're


absolutely right.  That's the position here.  And frankly,


I think that's what it comes down to for them.  They don't


have the safety rationale.  They don't have the drug use


rationale. 


And -- and I would actually point to the -- to


your concurrence in the Ferguson case where you -- where


you, albeit briefly, survey the special needs in drug


testing jurisprudence and point out that in all of those


cases, the activity was, in a sense, consensual or


voluntary.  I mean, this goes back to Justice Scalia's


question in -- in the initial round, too.  If you want to


drive a train, if you want to be a customs agent, if you

want to be a football player in Vernonia, if you want to


run for office in Chandler, these are all activities which


you're perfectly free to not do.  Now, maybe that weighs


into the balance, the constitutional reasonableness


balance, somewhat but it certainly is not dispositive. 


And when that's all you have, when there isn't the history


of drug use, when there isn't a safety rationale, when all


you have is this, then it's nothing. 


Now, I think also I need to --


QUESTION:  It -- it seems to me if a school is


better than other school districts insofar as drug use,


they have less drug use, that they're maybe entitled to


keep it that way. 


MR. BOYD:  Well --


QUESTION:  You seem to say not.  You seem to say


there has to be some great crisis where we lose a couple


years of kids to drugs, and then we -- and then we move. 


National statistics just don't support that. 


MR. BOYD:  Well, there -- there are a couple of


things.  I mean, first of all, the -- the crisis


nationally of drug abuse is one that certainly we need to


be concerned about, and I think Justice O'Connor is right


to point out that the pediatricians, along with the public


health social workers and teachers, all say that this


policy of setting up barriers for extracurricular

activities is actually counterproductive.  It promotes


drug use and other dangerous activities. 


But let me get to precisely the question that


you're asking, too.  This is a school that has in place


cameras in the halls, security guards, drug dogs that


sweep through the school and the -- and the parking lot


and the students.  They search lockers.  They have


teachers who are trained in looking for drug use.  They


have all of these things in place, and they have a


mandatory reporting policy that if they discover any drug


use, they have to report it.  Now, over the years, that's


added up to two instances of drugs being found, none of


them associated with non-athletes, none of them associated


with extracurricular activities.


QUESTION:  Yes, but they have a record here


that, of course, suggests if you want to know if drugs are


going on in your school, you ask the kids.  You don't find


them because nobody is stupid enough to take them into the


school.  But it's all around and they use them.  And here


they ask the kids, and the teachers ask the kids, and they


say, sure, there's a lot of drug use going on over in the


park, at parties.  That's the record that I saw.


MR. BOYD:  Well --


QUESTION:  And I don't really see how that -- I


mean, you know, you might be able to drive a millimeter of

light between that and Vernonia.


MR. BOYD:  Well --


QUESTION:  So, go ahead and try.  But I -- I


can't --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  I mean, I -- I -- they did what I


would have done.  I would have asked my children what's


really going on in this school, and they get a positive


response when it's a question of drugs. 


MR. BOYD:  Justice Breyer, I -- I think you're


right.  I'm going to go ahead and try.  But I think


there's -- I think there's an important distinction here. 


What the kids said in this case is, to the extent there's


drug use going on, who's doing it?  It's not the choir and


the band and so forth.  And I think that that's critical.


I think that the jurisprudence of this Court in


looking at when do you set aside individualized suspicion,


it says there has to be that connection between --


QUESTION:  Why?  Now, I --


MR. BOYD:  Why.


QUESTION:  Of course, if I read the cases, as I


do, and they logically require you to win, that's the end. 


You win. 


MR. BOYD:  Sure. 


QUESTION:  But just in case it's open --

QUESTION:  -- I would like to know why.  I take


it they've given you some reasons why they've limited it. 


One, these are the school leaders and maybe it'll spread. 


MR. BOYD:  Sure. 


QUESTION:  Two, we don't want to put the


student, although we'd really like to, to the choice of


school versus drug testing.  We'll put him to the choice


of extracurricular versus drug testing.  It's a little bit


better.  Okay.  That's their reason. 


Now, what do you say?


MR. BOYD:  Well, I -- I mean, I think what's


perhaps behind your question is a little bit of what's the


law and why is the law that way and a little bit of why


the policy --


QUESTION:  I'll tell you what's behind the


question.  What's behind the question is that I think


undoubtedly you're right, that this is a slight expansion


of Vernonia.  You want to say a lot.  They'll say hardly


any.  So, it's hard for me to see why, if I came out one


way in Vernonia, I'd come out differently here.  And


that's what I want you to --


MR. BOYD:  Okay, fair enough.  I -- I think the


question is where do you want to put your focus.  If your


focus is solely on is there evidence of drug use in the


38

high school alone, then the difference here I think is


still very important.  In Vernonia, you had athletes who


were skipping class and being arrested.  You had people


smoking marijuana across the street in plain view.  You've


got none of that here.  I think there is that difference. 


But I think that also I would ask you to focus


somewhere different than what is the overall general


problem.  I would say that if you take seriously the idea


of the nexus, or connection, being there in order to take


what is a serious step from individualized suspicion to


blanket intrusive search, I would say you have to look at


what are the reasons for picking this group.  Is it simply


to be fair to the athletes where a problem may exist, or


is it -- which is the case here, or is it because there's


a problem here, which is certainly not the case here. 


And there's another difference too, Justice


Breyer, which I think is absolutely critical.  In


Vernonia, that was a school where discipline was out of


control.  Discipline throughout the school jurisprudence


of this Court has been a critical factor.  In Vernonia, it


was a school that said, quote, we don't have a major drug


problem for many years, just like this school.  But then


in the space of 2 or 3 years, they said, discipline


referrals have increased by almost threefold.  Teachers


are threatening to quit.  We're thinking about mass

expulsion of the students.  We can't keep control of this


school. 


Now, if you look what this school has said, by


contrast, let me refer you to the joint appendix.  In


their Federal reports, they say -- now, I'm not talking


about the drug use here.  I'm talking about discipline. 


They say on page 192, minimal problems have been


experienced due to violent safety and discipline problems. 


That's right in the middle.  And in the very last sentence


on that page --


QUESTION:  I don't understand the point of this


argument, counsel.  I mean, is -- is the only reason


schools want to prevent drug use is that they have unruly


classrooms when they have drug use?  I should think that


is the least of the reasons to prevent drug use. 


MR. BOYD:  Well, it --


QUESTION:  And -- and what I miss in your


argument is any recognition of the fact that we are


dealing here with minors.  I mean, you're talking here


about a search rather than a seizure, but in the case of


minors, you can keep them, in effect, imprisoned after


school, can you not, if they haven't done their homework


or something else?  The school is standing in loco


parentis.  It is trying to train and raise these young


people to be responsible adults.  And I think that -- it's

a -- it's a world of difference from -- from what -- from


what the State can do with regard to adults.


MR. BOYD:  Let -- let me -- let me do two


things, if I may, Justice Scalia.  Let me just quote the


last sentence of what I was about to say and then I -- and


then, if I may have your permission to address the in loco


parentis argument, because there's a good answer to that.


In terms of the discipline argument, Justice


Breyer, what the school said is we don't have that


problem, and in the last sentence, the discipline policies


in place at each site have been effective in dealing with


the problems.  So, I think if one of the things, maybe not


the only thing, Justice Scalia, but if one of the things


we care about is can the kids learn here, is this a school


environment that is conducive to learning and safety and


discipline, Tecumseh High School has that in hand with


their cameras and guards and dogs and everything else. 


They don't need this policy.  Especially they don't need


it for Lindsay Earls.  I mean, if they want to voluntarily


test all the students, they apparently will get many of


them, but why should we force Lindsay Earls to -- to give


up her privacy as part of that?


QUESTION:  You're willing to rest your case on


the proposition that the only valid basis for conducting


drug searches is to -- is to enable the school to maintain

discipline.


MR. BOYD:  No, no. 


QUESTION:  So long as you have a bunch a


druggies who are orderly in class, the school can take no


action.  Is -- is that what you want us to --


MR. BOYD:  Absolutely not.  Given that we have


here a school that has not only discipline in hand, but


also drug use itself in hand, especially among these


activities, which themselves aren't dangerous, it seems it


adds up to me the mirror image of Vernonia. 


But let me address your point, Justice Scalia,


about in loco parentis.


QUESTION:  Except for one point that was made in


Vernonia, and it does go across the board, and that was


the statement that drug testing on suspicion, which is the


alternative, because in life, it's everything as compared


to what.  So, if we didn't have the -- the random testing,


it would be on individual suspicion.  And the point was


made there that if you had -- if you treated the children


that way, you would transform this random process into


what the opinion author called a badge of shame, and that


it might be worse the risk of singling out the


troublesome, but not drug likely student, the one that the


teacher -- the one that's always the bad boy in the class


and diverts the teachers --

 MR. BOYD:  Right. 


QUESTION:  -- who are engaged in that exercise


from the job of teaching to being a police officer.


MR. BOYD:  Justice Ginsburg, there's a good


answer to that question.  Let me focus on the facts of


this case, as they come to this Court.  This is a school


that already has not had this problem of pointing the


finger of -- of accusation at students, although it could


do that with its drug dogs and locker searches and


everything else.  When it gets a student for whom there is


some suspicion of drug use, say, a -- a drug dog hits on a


student who could easily have had dad's beer spilled on


the -- on the sleeve.  That will make a drug dog alert. 


That student is then questioned.  That already happens in


this school. 


But there's also a key point that I think was


missed in that -- in that discussion in Vernonia, which is


that even if -- whichever way you rule in this case,


suspicion-based drug testing can and will go forward in


this and many other schools.  So, even if you have a


blanket policy, if there is, say, some malicious teacher


out there who wants to -- to pick out Johnny because


Johnny is acting bad and -- and put that badge of shame on


him, she or he can certainly do that.  I don't think that


that is a reason to go ahead with the policy that doesn't

have a basis in the safety, discipline, or drug use


rationales.


Now, Justice Scalia, I'm feeling like I'm not


getting to the in loco parentis question, and I do because


the -- the short answer is, I believe the brief by the


parents, the amicus brief -- Jean Burkett is the lead one


-- really engages this question in a very vigorous and


intelligent manner.  And what they say is this.  In loco


parentis is a doctrine that does not say the school is the


parent, can take over from the parent.  The parent still


retains certain roles, and the parents in this community


-- a good number of the parents in this community say I


want to raise my kid and I've succeeded so far in raising


my kid by having open communication where they can come to


me and talk and we will -- and we will have that trust


there.  The school has interfered with that relationship


by forcing me, the parent, to sign off on this drug test,


which is a different way of raising kids. 


QUESTION:  Well, but the in loco parentis


argument works against you there too because in loco


parentis also indicates that all children are forced to go


to this school.


MR. BOYD:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And we have to accept that a majority


of the parents want to make sure that those children are

QUESTION:  And they have -- they -- you seem to


me to be disparaging about police dogs and locker


searches, and maybe that's what you're going to challenge


next.  But what the -- what -- what the school board has


said is that this is a necessary and effective policy, and


that's -- that's all it said. 


MR. BOYD:  Justice --


QUESTION:  And there are rights of other


children who want to go to a school which is drug-free, if


they can. 


MR. BOYD:  Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.


QUESTION:  And it seems to me that's part of in


loco parentis too because those students are required to


go the school just as -- as the drug user is. 


MR. BOYD:  You're absolutely right about that,


and please don't hear me to be disparaging of those other


tools because those are tools that do not include a


blanket intrusive search, which is the principle that's at


issue here.  And I actually applaud this school for


being --


QUESTION:  Well, why does it make difference why


you applaud it or not? 


MR. BOYD:  Oh, it probably doesn't.  It probably

question. 


QUESTION:  We're talking about a constitutional


MR. BOYD:  It -- it does.  But -- but the point


I'm trying to make is that -- is that these other tools,


which they have the legal right to use, are being used


successfully. 


In loco parentis I think comes into play when


you have a school like Vernonia where, as -- as you put


it, Justice Kennedy, the rights of the other students,


their ability to get an education and to themselves stay


drug-free is being interfered with.  Now, if we were


talking about the Vernonia school --


QUESTION:  Are you saying that the in loco


parentis principle does not apply in the case of a school


if a minority of parents object to what the school is


doing?


MR. BOYD:  That's not my position.


QUESTION:  Well, I thought that was what you


were saying a moment ago? 


MR. BOYD:  Let -- let me please try to be more


clear about that.  It depends on what the issue is and


what's happening in the school.  When there is an issue of


school discipline, say, in the Fraser case or the


Hazelwood case, where you had student conduct that was in

a sense -- well, certainly had -- had a element of


connection to constitutional protection, but yet affected


the rights of other students to be able to learn in that


environment, then --


QUESTION:  Well, how did -- how does Hazelwood


fit that description? 


MR. BOYD:  Well, because of the disruption that


could be caused by the -- by the school paper articles. 


My -- my point is that where disruption --


QUESTION:  I don't think the reason in Hazelwood


was -- where the discipline was justified was -- caused


disruption, but because when you're learning in school,


you follow the instructions of the teacher. 


MR. BOYD:  Well, and also the form issue.  I


mean, I -- I think that's certainly there and I don't -- I


-- I brought this upon myself by bringing up the case, but


I hope --


for that. 


QUESTION:  You did, yes. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BOYD:  I did.  I did.  I did and I apologize


But my point is that the in loco parentis


doctrine more broadly comes into play when the rights of


the student who says, I want to -- or the minority comes


into conflict with -- with the environment of the school

of learning and discipline.  And that's -- that was the


case in Vernonia.  That's not the case here.  And it's


certainly not the case if you think of it in terms of the


rights of the student --


QUESTION:  Now, say again why you -- you think


the Vernonia situation, with respect to this point, is


different than the Tecumseh. 


MR. BOYD:  Sure.  It's -- it's really the point


I was making to Justice Breyer about discipline in the


school.  Vernonia had convincingly shown and the district


court found that there was a discipline problem that was


out of control that was directly tied to drug use by


athletes.  They wanted to address this problem by going


after the thing that was connected to it. 


Now, this is a school that doesn't have any of


that.  It doesn't have the discipline problem.  It doesn't


have the drug use.


QUESTION:  Well, but that -- that question has


been batted back and forth -- you're -- you're not saying,


are you, that unless the school has the sort of discipline


problem they had in Vernonia, it can't do this?


MR. BOYD:  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not, although I


think that when you have neither a discipline problem nor


a drug use problem among the tested students, nor a safety


among the students tested, I don't see how you get within

Vernonia at all unless Vernonia sort of quietly,


implicitly said what we really meant to say was drug test


everybody because those principles do apply to all 24


million secondary school students in this Nation.  And so


I don't --


QUESTION:  May I ask on the drug test?  If you


had a choice, in terms of which is the -- I understand you


think this is clearly unconstitutional.  Would it be more


unconstitutional or less unconstitutional to test


everybody? 


MR. BOYD:  I'm not really sure that one can --


can rank more and less constitutional.  Both seem to me


plainly unconstitutional.  The only constitutional way to


go beyond individualized reasonable suspicion is to


identify a problem in a school and devise a solution that


has a close nexus to that particular problem, and that


certainly isn't the case here. 


Let me put that a little bit differently,


Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  Of course, Justice Scalia would --


would respond by saying, well, everybody knows there's a


potential problem in every school in the country, and


that's enough.  And why isn't that an effective argument? 


MR. BOYD:  It's not -- it's not enough because

test behind the Fourth Amendment reasonableness


requirement becomes one where there's no weight on one


side of the -- of the balance.  That's a little vague, so


let me --


QUESTION:  Why is that?  Now, they've come in


with a brief on the other side and said, you know, despite


the fact that we're spending X billion dollars, two-thirds


of which goes on the supply side for interdiction --


MR. BOYD:  Right. 


QUESTION:  -- demand has stayed constant among


teenagers, and it's about 20 to 30 percent of all of the


children in these high schools who take drugs.  Now, if


you know that that is a fact, why is it -- and if you know


this is a typical high school, why isn't that enough to do


just what you said would be constitutional, to say here's


a particular problem, 20 to 30 percent of the kids are


taking drugs, and we want to come in with a solution


that's tailored to that? 


MR. BOYD:  Well, it's -- you know, the number is


probably, according to Mr. Clement, is more like 50


percent, and -- and that 50 percent of -- of the kids in


the high schools are using drugs. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Then it's much worse than


I thought. 


MR. BOYD:  And --

 (Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  And then if that -- if that's fine,


then -- then there is the problem you talked about, which


I just heard you say.  And so, if -- you said if there's a


problem of a serious sort, and that this is tailored to


that problem, they can do it.  All right.  So then why


couldn't they do this on that theory? 


MR. BOYD:  Well, if it's 50 percent nationally,


this school in its reports to the Federal Government says


that its school-wide drug use based on its own surveys,


which is where the national data comes from, surveys, is 5


percent.  5 percent. 


QUESTION:  All right, 5 percent.  I mean, maybe


-- maybe they exaggerated in that report.  I guess I'd


have to take the finding of the district court here, and


when I read the district court opinion, I thought the


district judge thought it was a fairly serious problem. 


MR. BOYD:  Well --


QUESTION:  He didn't put numbers on it. 


MR. BOYD:  Right, he did not. 


QUESTION:  But you used the word serious


problem.  So --


MR. BOYD:  Okay.  What -- what I wanted to say,


Justice Breyer, is this.  If you take the school at their


own word, that their data shows that it's at 5 percent,

and you take the school board president and all three


teachers at their word in saying, to the extent that that


drug use -- that 5 percent is there, it tends not to be


among these activities, and if you take this Court


seriously in articulating a nexus test, there simply is


not a nexus between choosing these non-athletes who, both


in terms of school versus Nation and the non-athletes and


the school versus the other students, are really


exceptionally unlikely to be using drugs.  It's a terribly


poor --


QUESTION:  Now, in your opinion a school that


did find that it was within, let's say, half the average,


say 20 percent or 25 percent, and they did feel that a


significant number of their extracurricular activity


students were involved in that, if -- if they've heard


that through hearsay or any other way that was reasonably


plausible for policy makers, they could then do this in


your opinion. 


MR. BOYD:  No, they could not because there


still is a need for a safety rationale.  There is not a


single case in which drug testing has been upheld by any


court, outside of this line of cases for extracurricular


non-athletes.


QUESTION:  Well, what was the safety rationale


with golfers in Vernonia?

 MR. BOYD:  Well, the safety rationale -- I mean,


certainly the Court in Vernonia didn't talk about golfers


one way or another, but --


QUESTION:  Well, but you're -- you're saying


that Vernonia was based on a safety rationale.  Its


testing included golfers. 


MR. BOYD:  Well, in Vernonia, the Court talked


at some length about the safety rationale.  Justice


Kennedy, in his -- in his Ferguson concurrence, also


described the Vernonia holding as -- as being about


students who are athletes and face these danger risks. 


Now, reasonableness, Your Honor --


reasonableness -- it does need to turn in the end on some


kind of reasonable line drawing.  I think it was


reasonable for the Court to say in Vernonia, the line that


was drawn by Vernonia among athletes, the vast majority of


whom are doing things that, if not involving physical


contact, certainly involve exertion of the court, that in


the opinion of the Court could cause death.  Death was


what was -- the word that was used by this Court.  Also,


in Skinner, death from train accidents; in Von Raab, death


from misguided bullets.  Those were the stakes in those


cases. 


Here you've got a choir. 


QUESTION:  How about death from overdose?

concern, but there's no --


QUESTION:  I mean, do you think life and death


is -- is really not involved in -- in the fight against


drugs?


MR. BOYD:  It absolutely is, Justice Scalia, and


-- and where there's --


QUESTION:  Let's not minimize that.


MR. BOYD:  I don't mean to, and where there is


evidence of drug use among a group of students, then I --


QUESTION:  As far as -- as far as the extent of


the drug use is concerned, this is an elected school


board, isn't it? 


MR. BOYD:  It is. 


QUESTION:  Why -- why should I trust your


assessment of how serious the drug problem is and what


measures are reasonable to counter that -- that


seriousness over the assessment of -- of the local


citizens who -- who elect their school board, and their


school board says we have a big enough problem that we


want to use this draconian measure? 


MR. BOYD:  Well, I think if we listen to the


school board and to the school administration, who


themselves are even closer to that problem, what they say


is, we've identified enough of a problem that initially we

want to test our athletes.  And they directed Mr. Jacobs


to go off and draft a policy for athletes.  He did so. 


They came back and he said, you know, we feel kind of bad


about stigmatizing our athletes.  Who else can we test? 


Now, that's not identifying a drug problem. 


In fact, the best evidence in this case is what


the school itself says to the Federal Government where the


Federal Government says, now, remember these reports, when


they write them, they say, tell us what you know, not


based on just sort of vague evidence, but tell us what you


really know about drug use, do some surveys, ask some


questions, look around.  The school did that, and over the


course of a number of years, they said consistently


exactly what Vernonia said back before it had a problem. 


We don't have any --


QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose the school


district said, we're going to have two schools and you can


go to either one.  One, they don't have dogs or -- or


tests or anything else.  It's the druggie school. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  And -- and the other school -- and


the other school is they have mandatory testing for


everybody.  Would that be constitutional?  And then your


client could go to the druggie school.


MR. BOYD:  I don't think so because I think even

by the nature of that hypothetical, it presupposes one of

grounds. 


there. 


QUESTION:  Vastly experience why? 


MR. BOYD:  Excuse me? 


QUESTION:  Why?  Because there are drug users


MR. BOYD:  Well, I -- I think -- no, I don't


think that's the reason why.  I think --


QUESTION:  No parent -- no parent would -- would


send the child to the first school that I suggested, other


than perhaps your client wants to go there. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BOYD:  Well, she absolutely would not, Your


Honor.  I mean, Lindsay Earls is -- is a young woman, a


freshman at Dartmouth now, who hasn't used drugs.  She was


drug tested and she passed, and no one has suspected her


of using drugs.  I'm sure my -- my opposing counsel would


attest to that. 


QUESTION:  Can -- can -- doesn't -- don't magnet


schools have rules for uniforms and so forth that they're


-- they're completely optional?  A school district could


have two schools, one with -- one with no testing, the


other with testing.  Then you have a choice. 


MR. BOYD:  I think uniforms are a world apart.

There's not an intrusive blanket search. 


QUESTION:  Well, they're not covered by the


Fourth Amendment. 


MR. BOYD:  Exactly. 


QUESTION:  I mean, isn't that the problem? 


MR. BOYD:  It is. 


QUESTION:  What do you -- do you say just


frankly to the argument, forget individualized need,


forget special need entirely, forget suspicion?  We're


standing in loco parentis and if we think it's reasonable


to do it, we can do it.  What's the answer to that


argument? 


MR. BOYD:  I -- I think the answer to the


argument is the Fourth Amendment turns on reasonableness. 


It's not a majority rules standard.  And I think you have


to look at the incremental intrusion here, and this is a


point that I don't think has been made today.  But with


school athletes, they already submit a urine sample.


QUESTION:  That doesn't answer the question. 


The question -- yes, it turns on reasonableness, but what


Justice Souter's question suggests is that the -- the


issue is whether it would be reasonable for a parent who's


concerned about drug use on the part -- on the part of his


children, to be this intrusive.  That is the question. 


MR. BOYD:  For a parent to do it -- I -- well, I

QUESTION:  Yes.  I extend your time by 30


seconds.


MR. BOYD:  Thank you. 


A parent can do many things that are different


than what a school could do.  The fact that a parent could


do a drug test is exactly the reason -- and in Tecumseh


they could do that.  That is not a reason for a school to


do it in circumstances where there is not a demonstrated


problem among the students who were being tested with a --


with a solution that's actually tailored in any reasonable


fashion to meet that problem.  Otherwise --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Boyd. 


Ms. Meoli, you have 1 minute remaining. 


MS. MEOLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no


further questions, I'll waive the remainder of my time.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well. 


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 11:10 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
