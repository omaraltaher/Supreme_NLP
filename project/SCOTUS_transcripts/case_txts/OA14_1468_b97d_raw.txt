CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­1468,  Birchfield  v.  North 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dakota  and  the  related  cases. 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Rothfeld. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CHARLES  A.  ROTHFELD 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  fundamental  problem  with  the  statutes  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  in  these  three  cases  is  that  they  make  it  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  offense  to  assert  a  constitutional  right. 

   

 

 

 

 

Under  laws  of  North  Dakota  and  Minnesota,  a  person  who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  stopped  on  suspicion  of  impaired  driving  is  obligated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  take  a  warrantless  chemical  test  to  determine  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

alcohol  content  of  their  blood. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  States  concede  that  these  tests  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

searches  under  the  meaning  of  the  Fourth  Amendment.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  and  North  Dakota  appear  to  recognize  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  exception  under  the  recognized  exceptions  of  the  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  applies.  Nevertheless,  a  person  is 

   

  

 

 

obligated  to  take  this  warrantless  ­­ to  submit  to  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrantless  search,  and  is  committing  a  criminal  offense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

if  he  or  she  does  not  do  so.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  it  correct  to  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  concede  that  the  State  could  revoke  the  driver's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license  for  refusing  to  take  the  test,  either  blood, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alcohol  or  Breathalyzer? 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  That  ­­ that  is  not  at  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case.  We  haven't  taken  a  position  on  that, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  ­­ but  I  ­­ but  we  don't  dispute  for  purposes  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  that  the  State  could  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  let's  ­­ let's 

  

 

 

 

 

assume  that  that  is  a  concession  or  that  we  hold  that  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  a  premise.  If  the  State  can  impose  a  civil 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  sanction,  why  couldn't  it  also  impose  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  sanction?  We  could  have  hypotheticals  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  would  just  be  no  more  than  three  days  in  jail, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  sanction,  or  a  three­year  suspension,  which  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  greater.  Why  should  there  be  a  difference? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  ­­ I  think  the  fundamental 

    

   

 

 

 

distinction  that  ­­ that  governs  the  outcome  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  we  think,  is  that  ­­ is  that  between  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking  away  a  benefit  that  it  didn't  have  to  give  you  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  place,  which  is  what  the  Court  addresses  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  unconstitutional  conditions  line  of  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  this  situation  here,  where  the  State  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  by  fiat,  you  are  subject  to  a  criminal  penalty, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative  criminal  penalty,  for  ­­ for  asserting  a

constitutional  right. 

 

            

            

In  the  case  that  you  are  hypothesizing  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

conditions  are  just  different.  I  ­­ I  don't  think  that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

analytically  ­­ analytically  it's  a  ­­ it's  a  different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

proposition. 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  But  I  ­­ I  have  to  disagree 

   

   

  

 

 

 

with  that,  Your  Honor,  for  this  reason:  I  ­­ I  think 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  the  unconstitutional  conditions  line  of  cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  Court  has  said  is  the  State  has  given  someone  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  that  it  did  not  have  to  give  in  the  first  place. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  all  the  State  is  doing  when  it  takes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  away  is  saying  you're  back  in  the  position  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  were  to  begin  with.  There  is  no  sort  of  direct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  that's  attached  to  what  the  individual  is  doing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  Court  in  those  cases  has  said,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  look  to  see  the  practical  effect  of  the  combination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  benefit  and  the  condition  to  see  whether  or  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  in  ­­ in  reality  is  trying  to  do 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indirectly 

what  it  could  not  do  directly,  that  being 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the 

 

 

suppression  of  the  constitutional  right. 

 

 

 

 

  

And  so  in 

 

 

those  cases,  the  Court  will  look  to  see  is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ what  is 

 

 

it,  agree  with  the  connection  between  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  and 

 

the  condition?  And  it  will  look  to  see  the  degree  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coercion  that  the  ­­ the  State's  manipulation  of  the

benefit  and  condition  imposes  on  the  individual  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surrender  a  constitutional  right. 

   

 

            

But  as  the  Court  ­­ the  Court  has  made  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  in  this  entire  line  of  cases  what  it's  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  is  figure  out,  is  the  State  trying  to  do  indirectly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  it  could  not  do  directly,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abdicate  a  constitutional  right? 

   

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  One  way  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  This  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  One  way  of  looking  at  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  is  doing  is  not  to  criminalize  the  assertion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  constitutional  right,  but  to  criminalize  reneging 

   

 

 

 

 

 

on  a  bargain.  And  the  bargain  was,  we  give  you  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license  to  drive,  and  in  exchange  for  that,  you  consent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  ­­ to  a  blood­alcohol  test  under  certain 

   

   

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  And  if  you  renege  on  that  bargain,  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what's  criminalized.  Why  isn't  that  a  better  way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  looking  at  this? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  ­­ I  think  it  ­­ to  look  at 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  that  way,  I  think  you're  sort  of  in  ­­ in  the  world 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  consent.  In  this  case,  at  least,  there  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion  that  consent  of  that  sort  was  present  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case,  there  ­­ there  is  no  reason  to  believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  defendants  had  any  idea  that  they  were  agreeing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  bargain  that  ­­ that  you  ­­ you  described.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  under  Justice 

  

 

 

 

Alito's  hypothetical,  suppose  if  for  every  driver's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license  you  had  to  sign  a  consent  form,  I  consent  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  a  Breathalyzer  test  in  the  event  the  officer  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grounds  to  require  it. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  let  me  answer  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  in  two  parts,  Your  Honor.  First,  as  to  what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  on  in  this  case,  where  there  is  nothing  like  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ on  the  form,  what's  happening  here,  the  way  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  statutes  operate,  if  you  drive  on  the  roads  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

North  Dakota  or  Minnesota,  you  are  automatically  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrevocably  subject  to  the  State's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  testing  Justice 

  

 

 

 

Alito's  question.  Suppose  there  is  real  consent.  Is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  I  ­­ then  ­­ then  the

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  that's  my  next 

  

 

 

 

 

question,  but  let's  just  talk  about  just  the  State  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State. 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  And,  Justice  Sotomayor,  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

in  fact,  is  the  reality  of  this  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  know. 

    

 

MR.  ROTHFELD:  But  ­­ but  I  ­­ I  think,  as  I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

say,  the  analysis  there  would  be  not  the  analysis  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  but  a  consent  analysis  under  the  Schneckloth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  of  cases.  And  I  think  they're  ­­ it  would  be  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's  obligation  to  show  on  the  totality  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  that  the  consent  to  permit  the  search  and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  to  subject  yourself  to  the  conditions  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  truly  voluntary,  that  it's  the  product  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's  choice,  that  it  was  not  the  product  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coercion  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  You  know,  that  especially 

  

 

 

 

 

in  North  Dakota  and  sparsely  populated  States,  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  drive  in  order  to  ­­ so  we  know  that  consent  is  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fictional  in  that  sense.  But  suppose  that  it  was

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ and  the  drivers  sign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it.  It  still  seems  to  me  you'd  ­­ you'd  have  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  it's  ­­ it's  coerced. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  think  that's  right.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

think,  as  I  say,  the  analysis  would  be  a  consent 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  under  Schneckloth.  One  of  the  key  points  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  coercion,  and  I  would  think  that  if  someone  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told,  you  cannot  drive,  particularly  in  a  rural  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  North  Dakota,  and  probably  anywhere,  but  certainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  something  which  is  absolutely  essential  to  daily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life,  to  going  to  your  job  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  that  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

grounded  in  what  provision  in  the  Constitution? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  That  would  be  grounded  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth  Amendment,  because  the  ­­ the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  the  ­­ the  right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  have  to  drive.  I  thought  you  were  just 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

postulating  something  saying  ­­ I  mean  you're  saying  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  could  not  take  away  that  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  No,  no,  no.  I'm  ­­ I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

apologize,  Your  Honor.  That's  not  what  I  meant  to  say. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  I'm  saying  is,  if  ­­ if  the  submission,  as  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy  hypothesizes,  is  people  are  told  and  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  aware  that  they  are  being  told  that  if  they  drive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  consenting  to  be  searched,  that  they're

consenting  to  submit  to  the  chemical  test,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  State  can  execute  on  that  depends  on  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not  there  is  consent. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  no.  But  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

thought  you  said,  well,  of  course  there's  coercion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  can't  survive  in  North  Dakota  without  a  car, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  I'm  happy  to  postulate,  but  ­­ but  what  is  ­­ what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  basis  for  that  ­­ that  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  ­­ I  think  that's  not  a  ­­

    

   

   

 

 

 

not  a  right  that's  granted  in  the  Constitution.  What  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  ­­ the  relevance  of  that  is  that  there  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coercion,  we  think,  within  the  meaning  of  Schneckloth, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  meaning  of  this  Court's  Fourth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coercion,  you  know,  voluntary  consent. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­ so  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  of  analyzing  this  case,  we  have  to  assume  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  could  prohibit  people  from  driving,  period. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  think  that  that's  right. 

    

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay.  Now,  as  far 

  

  

 

 

 

 

as  the  border  goes,  now  when  it's  ­­ I  understand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stopping  people  at  the  border.  But  what  if  there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sign  at  the  border  that  says  anyone  who  uses  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

roads  consents  to,  you  know,  blood  alcohol  testing  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  ­­ they're  pulled  over?

would  not  be  this  case,  because  in  this  case  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion  that  these  defendants  had  any  idea  that  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes  existed,  let  alone  that  they  were  voluntarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surrendering  their  right  to  assert  the  Fourth  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  in  the  hypothetical  that  you  suggest,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  would  be  a  difficult  case  for  the  State  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make,  because  the  State's  obligation  would  have  to  be  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carry  the  burden  of  showing  that  the  defendant  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntarily  surrendered  the  right  to  ­­ to  resist  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Is  it  true  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State  could  prohibit  driving  altogether  without  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason? 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  I  ­­ I  sort  of  conceded 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that  to  the  Chief  Justice.  That's  not  an  issue  in  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  I'm  not  sure  whether  that  is  true.  And  if  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  could  not  do  that,  then  that  makes  their  case  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weaker,  because  in  that  ­­ they  could  not  then  condition

could  withdraw. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  mean  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  suppose  the  reason 

    

 

 

 

 

would  be  that  the  issue  we're  talking  about,  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traffic  deaths,  right?  I  mean,  if  ­­ I  mean,  obviously 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  a  realistic  contention,  but  that's  ­­ a  lot  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  hypotheticals  aren't.  I'm  trying  to  get  to  the

basis  of,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  flexibility  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  has  in  this  situation  depends  upon  what  rights  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motorist  has. 

 

            

And  I  understand  the  Fourth  Amendment 

   

 

 

 

argument,  but  it  does  seem  to  me  that  if  you're  making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  unconstitutional­conditions  argument,  it  is  pertinent 

 

 

 

 

 

to  determine  what  authority  the  State  has  in  any  event. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  That's  right.  But  let  me  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

let  me  be  very  clear.  I  think  that  there  are  two  points 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  crucial.  One  is  that  we  are  not  making  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional­conditions  argument.  We  are  saying 

  

 

 

 

what  the  State  is  doing  here  is  a  ­­ is  a  direct 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assertion  of  ­­ direct  imposition  of  criminal  penalties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  people  who  assert  their  Fourth  Amendment  rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  is  nothing  to  do  with  a  condition  because,  as  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  these  ­­ these  defendants  are  not  shown  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  aware  that  they  were  subject  to  a  condition  at  all. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  we're  interested  in  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  other  possibilities.  And  so  if  you  assume  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  can  condition  the  ­­ the  right  to  ­­ the  ability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  drive  on  the  State's  roads  ­­ and  let's  assume  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  somebody  who  is  crossing  the  border.  Assume  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  can  condition  the  ­­ the  ability  to  drive  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's  roads  on  consenting  to  a  blood­alcohol  test, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps  under  certain  circumstances.  Let's  say  this  is

to  operate  an  interstate  passenger  train  on  submitting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  blood­alcohol  test  in  the  event  of  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicion.  The  person  is  operating  the  ­­ the  train 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  influence  of  ­­ of  alcohol,  or  the  same  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  someone  who  is  operating  aircraft. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Or  suppose  there  were  a  law  that  said  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  want  to  enter  certain  government  buildings,  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  this  building,  the  ­­ the  condition  of  entering  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consenting  to  a  search,  and  you  have  to  sign  something, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  go  through  the  magnetometer.  And  then  if  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  got  through  that,  and  there  was  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicion  that  the  person  had  smuggled  in  some  kind  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapon,  the  person  would  be  subjected  to  a  search.  What 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  the  difference  between  that  situation  and  this

search,  is  there  a  requirement  for  a  warrant,  because  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  as  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  we  would  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

suppose  we  said  this  is  like  Skinner.  If  the  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  asked  about  statistics,  suppose  there  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelling  showing  that  there  was  a  measurable  increase 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  traffic  fatalities.  If  this  was  not  in  force,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say  this  is  a  special  condition,  and  therefore  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  consent.  And  the  bottom  line  is  ­­ and  that  means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  constitutional  right  because  we  just  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  constitutional  right. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  I  ­­ that,  I  think, 

   

   

  

 

 

Your  Honor,  would  be  creating  a  new  exception  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth  Amendment,  and  it's  not  a  certain­conditions 

   

 

 

 

 

analysis.  But  ­­ but  it's  an  important  point,  so  let  me

go  back  to  this. 

 

 

 

              

I  think  what  was  happening  in  Skinner  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  ­­ and  that  whole  line  of  cases,  Skinner  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vernonia  and  Von  Raab  ­­ the  Court  is  saying  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  the  circumstances  that  an  individual's  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  privacy,  the  ­­ whether  or  not  there  is  discretion  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  part  of  the  law  enforcement  officer  to  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  to  execute  the  search,  all  those  things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  into  special  needs.  And  the  Court  says  in  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special­needs  situations,  there  is  no  Fourth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ applying  the  ordinary  Fourth  Amendment  principles, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  Fourth  Amendment  entitlement  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Maybe  ­­ maybe  I 

  

 

 

 

 

misunderstood,  but  I  thought  that  was  the  whole  thrust 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Justice  Alito's  question.  Why  can't  we  say  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  needs?  Let's  assume  the  statistics  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

compelling. 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  But  I  ­­ I  think  that  it's  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

I  think  it's  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  when  we  talk  about  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk  about  innocent  ­­ innocent  lives,  just  as  we  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Skinner. 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  think  ­­ I  think  that  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

analysis  there  is,  I  mean,  do  we  look  ­­ we  look  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic  Fourth  Amendment's  characteristics  that  go  into

whether  a  search  is  required.  In  McNeely,  I  mean,  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court  essentially  addressed  that  very  question.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court  addressed  the  argument  that  the  nation's  impaired 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driving  problem  is  so  severe,  so  compelling,  that  we  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disregard  the  warrant  requirement,  and  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejected  that.  And  in  fact,  no  member  of  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted  that  as  principle  in  McNeely. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I'm  not  sure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  the  ­­ I'm  not  sure  that's  different  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  I  mean,  in  the  ­­ in  the  railroad  case,  I  think 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we're  saying  is  that  the  need  for  safe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transportation  on  the  trains  to  protect  the  innocent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  there  is  ­­ is  compelling  enough  that  ­­ that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

falls  within  the  special­needs  exception.  And  I'm  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  I'm  not  ­­ not  sure  why  that  analysis  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  here. 

 

              

I  ­­ I  don't  know.  I  suspect  more  people 

    

   

 

 

 

die  from  drunk  driving  accidents  than  from  train 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accidents,  and  so  the  special  need  would  seem  to  be  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  ­­ as  compelling. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  But  I  think  that  that  was  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  rationale  in  Skinner,  certainly  not  the  entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale.  I  think  that  the  principal  reason  for  saying 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  no  warrant  requirement  there.  And  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  not  just  that  there  was  no  warrant  requirement  but

that  there  was  no  probable  cause  requirement;  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  a  search  without  suspicion  at  all.  No  one  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting  that  that's  appropriate  here. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  that  the  reason  the  Court  came  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  conclusion,  both  in  Skinner  and  Von  Raab  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vernonia  and  that  entire  line  of  cases,  is  kind  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  combination  of  characteristics  that  there  was  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion,  as  I  said,  on  the  part  of  the  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  officer  to  decide  who  to  search,  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  were  a  variety  of  things  that  had  sort  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  to  do  with  the  ordinary  criminal  process.  These 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  not  criminal  investigations  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  Court  has  said  time  and  again  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  ordinary  law  enforcement  circumstance  where  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search  is  being  conducted,  that  a  warrant  is  required. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  the  presumption  unless  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  presumption  ­­ but 

  

 

 

 

 

there  are  many  ways  of  analyzing  this  case,  so  let  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  get  you  to  focus  on  one  that  doesn't  have  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  consent  or  any  of  these  differences  that  you  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  of  them  that  you've  been  discussing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One  way  to  analyze  it  is  you  just  ask:  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ there  is  no  such  thing  as  an  exception  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth  Amendment.  The  question  is  whether  the  Fourth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  requires  a  warrant  in  these  circumstances,  and

it  seems  to  me  if  it  does,  then  you  win.  And  if  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't,  then  the  State  has  considerable  freedom.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  boil  people  in  oil,  but  it  might  be  able  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  All  right.  So  that's  how  ­­ what  I'm  thinking. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Now,  the  question  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

MR.  ROTHFELD:  It  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  I  don't  find  this  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

much  in  the  briefs,  and  it  surprises  me.  That's  what  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  you  to  address.  Why  ­­ why  isn't  there  a  big 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  a  blood  test  and  a  Breathalyzer?  I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

mean,  look,  I  look  at  a  Breathalyzer;  it's  a  little  box 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

the  size  of  a  cell  phone.  It  has  a  little  straw  on  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end,  and  you  breathe  into  it.  And  what  you  breathe  into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  carbon  dioxide,  which  is  going  to  go  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environment  anyway;  you're  not  going  to  keep  it.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moreover,  it  takes  place  quickly,  so  the  evidence  hasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disappeared.  A  blood  test,  you  have  to  go  somewhere 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

else.  There  is  risk  involved.  Time  elapses,  so  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lose  some  of  the  evidence.  And  it's  painful  in  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances. 

            

So,  I  immediately  think,  isn't  there  a 

   

 

 

 

 

difference?  So  encapsulated  in  what  I'm  saying  is  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  wrong  with  a  Breathalyzer  test  when  it  can  save  lots 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  lives  and  is  given  to  those  people  where  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable  cause,  I  take  it,  or  at  least  reasonable

suspicion  to  think  they're  drunk.  It'll  clear  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocent;  it'll  inculpate  the  guilty,  very  little 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interference.  But  a  blood  test,  I  mean,  that  might  be  a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

different  thing. 

 

            

Okay.  I'd  appreciate  what  your  response  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  that  line  of  thought. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  And  I  will  do  that.  I  will 

    

   

  

 

 

 

say  to  begin,  I  think  that  your  prefatory  statement  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  correct  that  if  a  warrant  is  required  here,  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

win.  If  a  warrant  is  not  required,  then  the  State  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerably  more  leeway  in  what  it  can  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On  the  breath  test,  breath  test  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  intrusion  on  personal  integrity.  As  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  in  Skinner,  the  ­­ first  of  all,  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  the  breath  test  is  a  search  in  the  Fourth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  ­­ meaning  of  the  Fourth  Amendment.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceded  by  ­­ by  my  friends  on  the  other  side.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  presumption  has  been  that  when  there  is  a  search 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  law  enforcement  proceeding,  a  warrant  is  going  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

be  required  unless  one  of  the  regular  exceptions  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  requirement  applies  there. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  it  is  conceded  by  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  and  North  Dakota  that  there  is  no  so  ­­ no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  exception  here.  And  so  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  why  can't  we  say  that

with  respect  to  a  breath  test  that  this  is  a  search 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

incident  to  arrest? 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  think  that  it's  not  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

search  incident  to  arrest  for  the  reasons  that  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stated  by  the  dissenting  opinion  in  ­­ in  the  Bernard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  by  Justices  Stras  and  Page  of  the  Minnesota  Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court,  which  is,  the  court  has  made  very,  very  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistently  from  Chimel  on  through  Riley  most  recently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  search  incident  to  arrest  turns  on  the  existence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  two  considerations,  either  the  search  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  to  preserve  officer  safety,  or  to  preserve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  think  that  this 

   

  

 

 

 

would  be  based  on  the  notion  that  it's  necessary  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preserve  evidence,  plus  the  notion  which  Justice  Breyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested  that  this  is  about  as  uninvasive  as  a  search 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  possibly  be.  And  so  that  given  those  two  things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together,  that  it  is  useful  to  preserve  evidence  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  is  a  extremely  uninvasive  search,  that  we  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assimilate  it  into  the  search­incident­to­arrest 

 

 

 

 

doctrine. 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  let  me  answer  both  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  points.  On  ­­ on  the  preservation  of  evidence, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence  that's  being  tested  here  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blood­alcohol  level,  so  alcohol  level  in  the  blood.  And

they're  simply  using  breath  as  a  means  of  doing  that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As  to  that,  breath  and  blood  are  identical.  And  so,  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  ­­ the  Court  addressed  this  in  McNeely. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes,  but  there's  something 

  

 

 

 

 

very  different  in  the  level  of  invasion,  and  certainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  appropriate  to  look  at  the  invasiveness  of  a  search 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  deciding  whether  to  do  a  search  incident  to  arrest. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  if  that  weren't  true,  we  wouldn't  have  talked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  how  much  you  could  get  off  of  a  cell  phone  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Riley.  If  that  weren't  true,  we  would  allow  people  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  body  cavity  searches  when  they  do  search  incidents  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrest. 

            

So  it  seems  to  me  that  the  Court  can  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  level  of  invasion  incident  to  a  search  when  deciding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  a  particular  search  comes  within  the 

   

 

 

 

 

search­incident­to­arrest  doctrine,  and  that  that  might 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  way  of  separating  out  this  category  of  cases  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ones  that  we  were  talking  about  in  McNeely. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  let  me  say  two  things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  that.  First,  our  sense  is  that  a  breath  test  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact  a  significant  intrusion  on  personal  integrity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  reasons  the  Court  suggested  in  the  Skinner  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When  one  takes  one  of  these  Breathalyzer  tests,  I  mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  not,  Justice  Breyer,  simply  that  you're  exhaling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  ordinary  way  and  carbon  dioxide  is  dissipated

into  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  didn't  say  ordinary  way. 

    

 

 

 

 

I  said  you  blow  hard  into  a  little  straw­like  thing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  connected  with  what  looks  like  a  cell  phone.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  the  word  "significant"  or  not  doesn't  help  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean,  it  is  what  it  is. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  ROTHFELD:  It's  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  that  ­­ that  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  why  it  is  so  intrusive  that  the  Constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insists  on  a  warrant  where  that  insistence  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

undermine  in  many  cases  the  evidence  that  you  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  for?  Now,  that's  ­­ that's  a  question  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

several  factors.  And  it  doesn't  ­­ just  doesn't  help  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  significant  or  not  significant.  That  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question,  not  the  answer. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  as  to  why  we  think  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ why  we  think  it  is  significant  as  a  personal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter,  when  one  takes  a  Breathalyzer  test  of  this  kind, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  tube  is  inserted  into  the  person's  mouth.  You  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhale  continuously  for  an  extensive  period  of  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Could  be  as  many  as  20  or  25  seconds.  And  the  point  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  to  expel  what  the  Court  has  characterized  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Skinner  as  deep­lung  air.  It's  ­­

with  it?  I  mean,  after  all,  if  in  fact  the  person's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eyes  turn  bloodshot  when  every  time  he  drank  four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bottles  of  whiskey,  you  could  look  at  the  his  eyes,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  wouldn't  be  intrusive  at  all.  I  mean,  what  you're 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  for  doesn't  have  much  to  do  with  the  intrusion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  the  way  you're  looking  for  it  that's  the  problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  problem.  It's  not  that  you  happen  to  want  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  it  for  a  particular  reason. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  You're  inserting  a  tube  into 

   

  

 

 

 

a  person's  mouth  to  get  them  to  expel  something  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deep  within  their  body  so  that  it  can  be  tested  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government.  And  my  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse  me.  I  know  we've 

    

  

 

 

 

assumed  that  it's  only  evidentiary,  but  in  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience,  police,  when  they  do  the  road  test,  do  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  want  to  confirm  that  you  are  in  fact  drunk. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Before  they  take  you  in  and  take  you  off  the  road, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  doing  this  test  as  part  of  the  probable  cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluation:  Is  there  enough  probable  cause  to  bring  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in?  There  may  be,  independent  of  it,  but  sometimes  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breath  test  exonerates  people  and  they  go  on  their  merry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way. 

            

So  why  are  we  thinking  that  it  is  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary?  I  do  think  the  blood  test  is,  by  the  way. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Once  you've  arrested  someone,  you've  decided  to  take

person.  But  ­­

  

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  And  that  is  true  with  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breathalyzer,  too.  We're  talking  here  not  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

preliminary  field  sobriety  screens;  we're  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  have  been  arrested  or  as  to  whom  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable  cause  to  believe  that  they  are  ­­ have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driving  while  intoxicated. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  As  I  said,  there's 

   

  

 

 

always  ­­ there's  probable  cause,  and  there's  probable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause. 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  But  these  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  meaning  why  can't  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

view  it  as  just  part  of  the  necessity  of  the  ­­ of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stop  and  suspicion  of  the  stop? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Because  I  think  again  the  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  tests  we're  talking  about  here,  the  ­­ under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws  of  both  North  Dakota  and  Minnesota,  the  officer  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  right  to  give  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  right.  So  what  is  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

percent  of  tests  of  Breathalyzers  that  is  given  at  ­­ by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  car?  And  under  what  ­­ and  what  percent  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breathalyzers  is  given  after  the  person  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrested  and  moved  to  jail  or  the  equivalent? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  there  ­­ as  I  said,

they're  field  sobriety  tests.  I  think  that's  given  in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

practically  every  case  as  an  initial  screen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  saying  what  percent  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which?  Okay?  I'm  asking  because  I'm  curious  and  think 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  might  be  relevant.  You  may  not  know.  So  if  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know,  say  you  don't  know. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  don't  know,  Your  Honor.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

think  that  the  answer  to  that  question,  how  many  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  are  stopped  in  a  preliminary  way  are  then  arrested 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  suspicion  of  driving  while  impaired,  and  I'm  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  that  there  are  statistics  that  anyone  has  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Suppose  the  Breathalyzer 

  

 

 

 

test  was  improved,  there's  better  technology.  So  let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose  that  all  that's  required  is  to  put  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breathalyzer  a  couple  of  inch  ­­ an  inch  from  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person's  mouth  and  wait  for  the  person  to  breathe,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  sufficient  to  measure  blood  alcohol. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  ­­ would  you  say  that's  a  search? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  think  that  might  not  be  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

search.  I  think  that  would  be  a  very  different 

    

   

 

 

 

 

situation. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  All  right.  So  if  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

compare  that  with  what  ­­ what  has  to  be  done  here,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  big  ­­ what  is  the  big  difference  between  those?

That  you  have  to  put  a  straw  in  your  mouth? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  I  would  think,  Your 

   

  

 

 

 

Honor,  that  most  people  ­­ maybe  this  is  just  me,  but  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicion  would  be  that  if  presented  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility  of  either  inserting  something  into  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mouth  and  expelling  something  from  deep  within  your  body 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  tested  by  the  government,  people  will  find  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  intrusive  than  having  an  officer  look  in  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backpack.  I  think  ­­

    

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It  doesn't  seem  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  seem  realistic.  The  reason  why  people  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  submit  to  a  blood­alcohol  test  is  that  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  want  their  blood  alcohol  measured.  It's  not  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  object  so  much  to  blowing  into  a  straw.  Do  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree  with  that? 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  maybe  I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

do,  Your  Honor.  Obviously  people  don't  want  to  have  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  are  stopped  on  the  road  don't  want  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tested  in  any  respect.  There's  no  question  about  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

true.  If  you're  not  drunk,  you'd  be  happy  to  be  tested, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

that's  an  intrusion,  too.  And  maybe  that  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately,  you  would  be  happy  to  be  tested  and  let  on

your  way. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It's  an  intrusion  when  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pat  down  someone  having  probable  cause  to  believe  he's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committing  a  crime,  and  you  pat  him  down,  which  is  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worst  intrusion,  I  would  guess.  Pat­down  is  a  much  more 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

intrusive  form  of  search  than  saying  would  you  blow  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  straw. 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  I  ­­

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  we  allow  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Let  me,  again,  sort  of  offer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  points  on  that.  One  ­­ one  is,  the  States,  in  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treatment  of  blood  and  breath  tests,  as  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described  in  McNeely,  almost  uniformly  treat  the  breath 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tests  and  blood  tests  identically.  And  as  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why?  That's  ­­ that's 

  

  

 

 

 

really  my  unknown  question:  Why.  Why?  That's  why  I 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

started  with  that,  because  I  really  don't  know  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer. 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  And  ­­ and  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

answer,  Your  Honor,  is  that  people  understand  the  breath 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  to  be  ­­ it's  designed  to  obtain  the  same  evidence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

literally  ­­ exactly  the  same  evidence  as  the  blood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test.  And  why,  in  response  to  Justice  Alito's

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  that's,  I  guess  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

please,  go  ahead. 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  But  I  ­­ I  think  that  you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

were  concerned  about  the  dissipation  of  this  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  as  to  the  blood  and  the  breath  test,  it's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  exactly  the  same. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes,  you're  right  that  it's 

  

 

 

 

designed  to  get  at  the  same  evidence,  and  you're  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  dissipation  of  the  evidence  works  in  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  way.  But  you're  suggesting  that  we  should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close  our  eyes  to  the  fact  that  there's  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  difference  in  the  degree  of  invasiveness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  know,  even  assuming  that  both  of  these  are  searches, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  I  have  to  say,  you  know,  I  think  that  that's  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  ­­ we've  held  that,  and  so  blowing  is  a  search, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  question  about  that,  but  there  are  searches, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then,  again,  there  are  searches.  There  are  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invasive  searches  and  less  invasive  searches.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  my  intuitions  are  that  that's  an  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  when  we  think  about  these  questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well,  as  to  the  nature  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breath  test.  And,  again,  I've  been  addressing  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  I'm  not  sure  how  much  more  there  is  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  it,  but  I  ­­ but  I  think  that  the  reality  is  when 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  foreign  object  is  inserted  into  a  person's  body  and

they  are  asked  to  expel  something  from  deep  within  their

the  face  of  it,  is  an  intrusive  proposition,  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  most  people  regard  as  ­­ as  the  Court  suggested  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Skinner  ­­ a  significant  invasion  of  their  personal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

integrity. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  about  the  standard 

  

 

 

 

 

sobriety  tests?  I  take  it  you're  not  challenging  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  officer  said,  walk  a  straight  line. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  That's  ­­ that's  right.  I  ­­

    

  

 

 

 

 

I  think  that  would  not  certainly  ­­ certainly  would  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  search.  I  doubt  it  would  be  a  seizure.  So  I  think 

    

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

­­ I  think  that  that's  correct. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Even  though  it's 

  

 

 

 

involuntarily,  the  person  doesn't  want  to  do  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  If  it's  not  a  search,  we're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

not  concerned  with  Fourth  Amendment  limitations. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  ROTHFELD:  It  ­­ it  may  be  a  seizure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  I  ­­ that's  something  we  have  not  analyzed  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  about,  and  we  certainly  are  not  challenging  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  it  is  ­­ it  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seizure  if  you  say  to  a  person,  now  you  walk  a  straight

officer  at  the  time. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  think  these  are  almost  all 

    

 

 

 

 

 

voluntary.  The  officer  asks,  would  you  walk  a  straight 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

line?  People  do  it  or  attempt  to  do  it.  So  if  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case,  certainly  there  can  be  no  Fourth  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem. 

            

So  ­­ but  ­­ but  those  are  not  ­­ as  I  say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  not  challenged  here.  I  think  they  present  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  ­­ an  entirely  different  set  of  issues. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  guess,  for  some  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I'm  sorry,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No.  Go  ahead. 

  

  

 

 

 

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Just  to  return  to  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan's  point,  I  think  in  addition  to  the  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics  of  the  breath  test,  which  we  do  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  personally  intrusive,  I  think  it  is  the  fact  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  has  always,  whenever  it  has  confronted  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search  ­­ and  there  is  no  question  that  these  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

searches  ­­ in  an  ordinary  law  enforcement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation,  not  in  the  special  needs  kind  of,  sort  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  investigation,  the  Court  has  said  there  must  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  warrant  unless  one  of  the  recognized  exceptions  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  recognized  exceptions,  I  think,  are 

   

 

 

 

 

substantially  conceded  by  the  other  side,  do  not  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  So  it  would  be,  I  think,  a  novelty.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well  ­­ but  I  guess  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question  that  I  asked  ­­ I  mean,  I  agree  with  you  that 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

you  do  need  a  recognized  exception,  and  that  we  should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  feel  good  about  making  up  new  exceptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willy­nilly. 

            

The  question  is,  why  isn't  this  a  search 

   

 

 

 

 

 

incident  to  arrest  given  the  various  aspects  that  I've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned,  the  fact  that  the  evidence  does  dissipate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  time,  that  getting  a  warrant  might  interfere  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  and  that  it's  ­­ relatively  uninvasive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Right.  If  I  may  answer  that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

question,  Your  Honor,  and  then  sit  down? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

MR.  ROTHFELD:  I  think  ­­ for  dissipation 

    

 

 

 

 

for  search­incident­to­arrest  purposes,  my  understanding 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  that  doctrine  is,  one  is  concerned  with  ­­ with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  suspect  doing  something  affirmatively  to  get  rid  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence,  flushing  the  evidence  down  the  toilet. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  the  classic  search­incident­to­arrest  situation. 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Court  in  McNeely  made  very  clear  that  we're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing  with  that  here.  The  alcohol,  breath  test,  blood 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  doesn't  have  to  dissipate  at  a  predictable  level. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  going  to  remain  in  the  body  to  be  tested  later  on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  I  don't  think  that  justifies  a  search 

   

   

 

 

 

 

incident  ­­ shoehorning  into  the

from  an  entirely  different  category  of  threats  to

And  if  I  may  ­­

   

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why  isn't  ­­ why  isn't  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  affirmative  effort  to  get  rid  of  the  evidence  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know  the  longer  the  interval  passes,  the  less  likely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  test  is  going  to  reveal  a  level  that's  over  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  amount. 

 

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Well  ­­ but,  I  think,  Your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Honor,  for  the  evidence  suggested  in  McNeely,  which  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  says  that  there  is  nothing  you  can  do,  nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative  you  can  do  to  take  this  evidence  and  hide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  it's  going  to  be  dissipated  in  a  predictable  way, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it's  not  in  our  control  to  do  it.  And  if  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  test  you  quickly,  and  breath  tests  are  ­­ can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  quick,  the  State  will  be  able  to  do  ­­ obtain  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  If  the  State  gets  a  warrant,  they  can  do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  and  that's  what  they  should  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

If  I  may,  Your  Honor.

MR.  McCARTHY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  North  Dakota  statute  strikes  a  bargain 

   

 

 

 

 

with  individuals  who  wish  to  use  the  State's  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

roads. 

            

Conditioning  their  use  thereon,  on  consent 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  blood­alcohol  test,  if  arrested  for  drunk  driving, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  has  held  that  this  is  a  valid  bargain,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  States  may  enforce  it  with  the  imposition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  consequences,  including  license  revocation 

 

 

 

 

and  the  use  of  test  refusal  as  evidence  in  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  about  another 

  

 

 

 

 

bargain,  if  people  find  that  texting  while  driving  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becoming  an  increasing  problem,  and  so  when  you  get  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license,  you're  ­­ you  give  implied  consent  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  to  look  at  the  texts  or  whatever  they  can  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  on  your  cell  phone  to  make  sure,  you  know,  a  minute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ago  you  were  texting  somebody  while  driving?  Is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  that  be  acceptable  under  your  rationale? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  I  ­­ I  think  it's  highly 

    

   

 

 

 

doubtful,  Your  Honor.  I  think  there's  many  differences 

    

 

 

 

 

 

between  that  and  what's  going  on  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  the  interest  here  is  ­­ is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniquely  compelling  interest?

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  assume.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

don't  know  what  the  statistics  are  going  to  say.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  surprise  me  if  there  are  at  least  as  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accidents  caused  by  people  texting  while  driving  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drinking  while  driving. 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Even  still,  Your  Honor,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  this  statute,  it's  ­­ given  the  history,  given  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  here,  it's  a  uniquely  compelling  interest.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

on  top  of  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  do  you  mean 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"the  history"? 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  The  history  of  the  State's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

battle  in  combatting  drunk  driving. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  there's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

that  much  history  for  texting,  because  there  haven't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  iPhones  around. 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Certainly,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

Nonetheless,  there's  ­­ in  these  cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  first,  the  search  only  comes  up  when  the  driver 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  arrested.  So  there  is  probable  cause  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  that  this  person  was  driving  drunk. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  know.  I  don't  ­­

    

    

 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  So  this  law  is  targeted  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tightly  right  there  on  the  ­­ on  the  people  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causing  the  problem.

MR.  McCARTHY:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  People  swerve  in  the

they're  ­­ you  know,  when  they're  intoxicated,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  stopped  for  doing  that.  And,  you  know,  the

MR.  McCARTHY:  Again,  Your  Honor,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

I  think  it  is  different  because  there  is  probable  cause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  officer  has  reason  to  believe  the  person  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drinking  and  driving  as  opposed  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  does  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

where  does  that  probable  cause  come  from? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  It  comes  from  the  field 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sobriety  tests.  It  comes  from  doing  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  He's  got  to  do  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  Breathalyzer? 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Not  necessarily.  I  suppose 

    

  

 

 

an  officer  could  do  a  preliminary  ­­ the  on­site

there  is  in  the  case  of  the  drunk  driving. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Not  only  that,  but  what's  happening  here  is

MR.  McCARTHY:  ­­ for  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ you  can  get  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

warrant. 

              

I  mean,  you're  not  left  with  that.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  want  the  administrative  expense  of  calling  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

magistrate  or  setting  up  a  system  to  get  a  warrant,  but 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  a  very  powerful  alternative.  That's  what  we  said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  McNeely. 

 

            

So  it's  not  that  you  don't  have  an  out.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  for  us  is:  Do  we  dispense  with  a  very  important 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  in  our  law,  that  before  you  search  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  the  inside  of  a  person  with  a  needle  or  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  intrusive  way,  that  you  get  a  warrant?  I'm  ­­ I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  sure  why  you  think  you're  left  with  nothing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Well,  Your  Honor,  two  things. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

One,  we  think  McNeely's  helpful  for  us  because  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ what  the  Court  was  concerned  about  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forced  blood  draws  over  the  objection  of  the  arrestee. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  those  don't  happen  under  this  system. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  ­­ the  second  part  of  McNeely  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  McNeely  pointed  to  these  types  of  statutes  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  these  are  alternatives  that  don't  require  forced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blood  draws,  that  avoid  the  problem  because  they're  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  They  were  only  talked 

  

 

 

 

 

about  in  civil  consequences;  suspend  the  license.

That's  directly  related  to  the  condition  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license  is  given.  But  I  ­­ I  ­­ criminal  sanctions  are 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  very  different  thing.  In  scope  and  in  effect.  You're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putting  someone  in  jail;  you're  not  taking  just  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license  away. 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Criminal  penalties  are 

  

 

 

 

different;  we  don't  dispute  that.  And  that  is  really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  the  essence  of  the  question  on  the  table  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Given  that  the  Court  has  already  endorsed  these  types  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions  being  imposed  on  the  privilege  of  driving  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  endorsed  significant  consequences  being  used  as  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  mechanism.  So  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Could  you  say  something 

  

 

 

 

 

about  what  the  practical  consequences  of  requiring  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  for  every  Breathalyzer  would  be  in  a  State  like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

North  Dakota?  I  ­­ when  ­­ my  picture  of  North  Dakota 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  it's  not  like  New  York  City.  You  don't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

night  court  going  on  all  the  time.  And  so  how  many  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  tests  occur  during  some  period  of  time,  and  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  magistrates  would  you  have  on  duty,  let's  say,  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2:00  o'clock  in  the  morning  to  field  a  request  for  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant? 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Well,  I'll  ­­ the  first  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  part  of  my  answer  is  that  if  a  warrant  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  in  every  case,  that  would  go  well  beyond  what

the  Fourth  Amendment  requires.  Because  even  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  in  McNeely  the  Court  acknowledged  that  many  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  warrant  won't  be  required. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  in  North  Dakota,  Your  Honor  brings  up  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interesting  point.  It's  not  that  there  are  judges  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

magistrates  on  ­­ on  duty  all  the  time  in  North  Dakota. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  fact,  they're  considered  what  is  known  there  as  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call.  So  they're  not  on  duty,  but  they  may  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  reachable  somewhere,  typically  by  phone.  But  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

often  takes  a  while,  especially  in  rural  jurisdictions. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  How  long?  What  it  says  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ACDL  brief  is  that  in  Wyoming  it  takes  five  minutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  in  Montana  it  takes  15  minutes.  How  long  in  North 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dakota? 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  In  North  Dakota,  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

larger  jurisdictions  where  there's  a  little  bit  of  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

quicker  process  where  they  use  more  telephonic  warrants, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  arresting  officer  can  go  directly  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

magistrate  in  those  systems,  my  understanding  is  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

takes  about  a  half  an  hour  to  hour.  But  in  the  smaller 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions  where  it's  more  rural,  where  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oftentimes  harder  to  get  somebody  on  the  phone,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  the  process  is  different.  The  ­­ the  officer  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  go  through  a  prosecuting  attorney  first  and  then  to  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

magistrate.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Why  is  it  harder  to  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  on  the  phone  in  rural  ­­ than  in  a  busy  city?

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  think  people  in  the 

    

 

 

 

 

rural  areas  were  sitting  waiting  for  the  phone  to  call. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Your  Honor  ­­ Your  Honor,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  in  large  part  it's  a  lack  of  resources  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manpower.  There's  not  as  many  people  available  to  cover 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  times,  and  so  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  that  excuses  you  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  constitutional  requirement?  We're  now  going  to  bend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fourth  Amendment,  which  I  always  thought  started  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  presumption  that  we  favor  warrants,  we  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disfavor  them.  But  since  many  jurisdictions  seem  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

manage  it,  we  give  a  pass  to  North  Dakota  because  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  want  to? 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  It's  not  that  ­­ it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  North  Dakota's  asking  for  a  pass  here.  There's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple  things  here.  One  again  is  that  a  warrant  is  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  in  every  case. 

 

 

 

            

The  second  thing  is  that  the  ­­ the

sense  of  the  real  world  harms  here.  So  let  me  ask  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  assume  something. 

 

 

            

Assume  that  you  actually  could  put  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  a  system  which  got  you  a  warrant  in  10  or  15 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minutes,  which  many  States  of  a  similar  kind  have  done. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  then  would  be  your  interest  in  the  ­­ in  ­­ in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  that  you're  asking  us  for? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  The  ­­ the  interest  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost  the  same,  really,  because  ­­ and  this  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  part  here  ­­ is  that  the  warrant  ­­ the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  the  warrant  is  to  authorize  a  search  over  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection  of  the  arrestee.  But  that's  not  happening 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

The  ­­ the  State  does  not  want  to  undertake 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  searches  because  it's  a  public  safety  risk,  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  to  the  officer  and  to  the  arrestee,  but  the  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personnel  would  be  in  between  them.  And  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  the  Court  acknowledged  as  legitimate  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  you  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  you  obstruct  justice 

  

 

 

 

 

by  refusing  to  comply  with  the  warrant,  you  can  punish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  for  the  obstructing  justice,  and  you  can  get  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  outcome  as  putting  them  in  jail  for  being  drunk  and

MR.  McCARTHY:  Again,  it's  not  that  the

do  is  get  evidence  of  someone  ­­ this  is  a  pure  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  need.  This  has  nothing  to  do,  necessarily, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  safety  of  the  community  because  the  person's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  taken  off  the  road.  And  we  presume  that  you  can

respectfully  disagree  that  ­­ that  the  suspension  of  a

still  very  much  a  public  safety  interest,  and  it

MR.  McCARTHY:  ­­ because  the  way  it  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  that's  what  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

asking.  Because  if  you  could  get  a  warrant  easily  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  case,  I  mean,  then  I'm  struggling  to  figure  out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  your  interest  is  in  having  the  kind  of  law  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have.  So  ­­ but  maybe  I'm  just  not  understanding 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something.  So  ­­ so  it  really  is  a  question. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Suppose  you  could  set  up  a  system  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  could  be  reached  within  10  or  15  minutes,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  would,  in  almost  all  circumstances,  give  a  warrant. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  in  a  couple,  say,  no,  I  don't  think  you've  satisfied 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  requirements,  right?  So  ­­ and  you  could  do  that  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  or  15  minutes.  What  would  be  the  problem  with  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relying  on  a  system  like  that? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Again,  there's  two  ­­ there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

two  problems.  One  is  that  the  warrant's  not  required  in

here  is  that  the  warrant  ­­ all  ­­ is  ­­ the  point  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  warrant  is  to  authorize  the  search  over  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection.  The  State  doesn't  want  to  do  that.  And  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  ­­ to  step  back  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  think  it's  not  ­­ I  did 

    

   

 

 

 

 

not  understand  that  answer.  What  we're  struggling  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  wake  of  our  recent  cases  where  we  talk  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants,  we  find  out  that  modern  technology  allows,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  States,  both  sparsely  populated  and  heavily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

populated,  to  get  a  warrant  in  15  minutes.  And  the  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  position  the  States  are  arguing  here  is  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  an  ­­ that  a  warrant  is  not  necessary,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

takes  too  long.  We're  saying:  Suppose  it  takes  15 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

minutes;  what  then? 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  You're  asking  for  an 

  

 

 

 

 

extraordinary  exception  here.  You're  asking  for  us  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  it  a  crime  to  exercise  what  many  people  think  of  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  constitutional  right.  There  is  some  circularity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there.  And  you  could  point  to  no  case  which  allows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

So  we  have  to  show  that  there  is  exceptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ there  is  a  necessity  for  the  exception,  and  you're

just  not  answering  the  question  about  whether  or  not,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  wake  of  our  recent  decisions  over  the  last  three  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four  years,  warrants  have  been  expedited  in  many  cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  why;  and  if  they  have  been,  why  that  isn't  an  answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  your  argument. 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Well,  there's  a  ­­ there's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

couple  reasons.  One  is  to  ­­ to  require  a  warrant  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  situation,  I  think  what  actually  required  the  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ it  would  essentially  invalidate  the  statutes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  upheld  in  Mackey  and  Neville.  There  was  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  required  in  those  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  We're  making  law.  I  don't 

    

  

 

 

 

want  ­­ none  of  us  want  an  answer  in  terms  of  law.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  know  a  practical  fact.  The  practical  fact  is, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  it  possible  that  you  could  get  a  warrant  in  30 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seconds?  You  have  a  button  on  the  cell  phone.  It  has  a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

big  "W." 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  policeman  presses  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

A  voice  comes  on,  and  it  says,  what's  the  problem?  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  it  in  15  seconds,  and  they  say,  ah,  I  got  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Okay.  You  got  your  warrant.  Or  there's  something 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

unusual,  and  he  says  no.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  that  were  in  front  of  us,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  take  me  too  long  to  decide  this  case  because

I'd  say  why  don't  you  use  it?  You  might  answer  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ridiculous.  It  isn't  30  seconds;  it  can't  be.  It  isn't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five  minutes.  It  isn't  15,  even,  in  most  parts,  and  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  be  without  added  expense.  Or  you  could  say  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  make  any  difference  and  explain  it.  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'd  have  a  hard  time  with  that  one,  but  I  want  to  know 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  your  answer  is  on  the  facts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  On  the  facts,  there  is  delay 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  ­­ some  delay  in  getting  a  warrant,  and  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  make  a  difference  here. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  does  it  make  enough  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  difference? 

 

            

MR.  McCARTHY:  Well,  there's  a  couple 

   

  

 

 

reasons.  But  I  want  to  step  back  here,  because  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

implication  of  a  Fourth  Amendment  right  is  the  start  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  analysis;  it's  not  the  end  of  the  analysis.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  in  the  unconstitutional­conditions  context  where 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  bargain  here.  And  the  Court  has  always 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  States  to  impose  bargains  ­­ to  impose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions  on  the  use  of  the  public  roads  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manner.  For  nearly  a  hundred  years  the  Court  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  this  type  of  thing  as  a  mechanism  to  impose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions.

MR.  McCARTHY:  There's  approximately  6,000 

  

 

 

 

of  the  two,  and  they're  roughly  50/50  over  the  course  of

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT

MS.  KEENA:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  follow  up  on  some  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  of  the  practicality  of  search  warrants  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  situations.  And  having  grown  up  20  miles  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

North  Dakota  border  and  attending  college  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fargo­Moorhead  area,  I'm  very  familiar  with  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

realities  are  in  the  rural  area.  And  yes,  we  ­­ we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  may  be  possible  to  get  a  search  warrant  in  every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  but  if  that's  what  this  Court  is  going  to  require, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Minnesota,  we  are  going  to  be  doing  warrants  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blood  draws  in  every  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  is  not  what  this  Court  wants.

Dakota.  In  a  lot  of  these  jurisdictions,  there's  only 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

one  officer  on  duty.  I  grew  up  in  a  town  of  2,000,  20 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

miles  from  the  North  Dakota  border.  There  was  only  ever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  officer  on  duty,  and  that  hasn't  changed.

located  in  every  jurisdiction  in  Minnesota  and  North 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dakota.  And,  for  example,  in  the  town  that  I  grew  up

into  the  straw. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Right.  You  can  make  it  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

crime  not  to.  That  will  force  them.  Okay.  So  ­­

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  KEENA:  That's  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  knew  ­­ that  was  somehow 

    

 

 

 

 

 

missing  in  this  argument.  I  think  what  people  are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  figure  out,  at  least  me,  is  if  ­­ first, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forget  the  blood  test.  The  blood  test  is  a  separate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter,  in  my  mind.  I'm  thinking  solely  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breath  test.  Do  you  ­­ does  the  Constitution  require 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  to  get  a  warrant  before  you  administer  the  blood  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  breath  test,  other  things  being  equal? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  KEENA:  And  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  Constitution  leans  in 

  

 

 

 

 

that  direction.  And  so  I  ask  you,  why  not?  And  now 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  told  me  all  the  things  that  cut  against  you.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  well,  before  we  give  the  breath  test  we  take  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  station,  and  so  then  that  seems  to  take  15 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minutes,  and  ­­ and  in  the  meantime  why  can't  you  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call  the  magistrate,  and  at  least  we  have  some  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

safeguard  against  total  arbitrary  behavior.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

where  you  are. 

 

 

            

MS.  KEENA:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  there  ­­ and  so  why  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  bad  for  the  State?

MS.  KEENA:  Well  ­­ and  I  have  to  look  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  implied­consent  statute  and  what  that  allows  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  allow.  So  currently,  Minnesota's 

  

 

 

 

implied­consent  statute  says  once  I  offer  a  test  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

they  refuse,  we're  done.  We're  done.  So  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  you  ­­ I  don't  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  how  to  explain  it  more  clearly  than  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  not  talking  law.  I'm  talking  practical  facts.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  prepared  to  come  back  and  say  to  me,  you  know,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  to  get  a  warrant,  50  percent  of  the  drunk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drivers  are  never  going  to  be  caught,  ah,  I'll  listen  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

If  you  come  back  to  me  and  say,  you  know,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  say  that  a  warrant  is  required,  it  will  mean  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

400  policemen  have  to  spend  ten  seconds  more  than  they'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise  spend  on  a  telephone,  I  say  well,  that's  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

point,  but  not  that  much  of  a  point. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Now,  do  you  see?  I'm  trying  to  get  a  fact. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  KEENA:  Well  ­­ and  I  don't  have  those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

type  of  statistics  to  answer  that  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ask  a  different  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

maybe  a  different  way  of  asking  a  similar  kind  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

When  we  decided  McNeely,  there  were  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinions.  But  even  the  opinion  that  was,  you  know,  the

concurrence,  or  just  ­­ I  don't  remember  whether  it  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  concurrence  or  a  dissent  ­­ but  the  one  that  was  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

­­

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  There  was  one  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  Chief  Justice's  opinion, 

  

 

 

 

 

even  that  said  ­­ and  this  was  with  respect  to  a  blood 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test.  But  the  Chief  Justice's  opinion  said,  look,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  20  minutes  between  the  time  that  you're  stopped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  time  that  we  can  get  you  to  a  hospital  to  get  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blood  draw,  and  you  can  get  a  warrant  in  that  20 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minutes,  then  yes,  you  have  to  go  get  a  warrant  in  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  minutes. 

 

            

So  at  the  very  least,  why  wouldn't  that  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case?  You  know,  if  ­­ if  you're  ­­ if  all  of  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  ­­ I  mean,  I  have  to  say  when  I  originally 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

thought  about  this  case,  I  had  in  my  mind  roadside 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stops.  But  in  all  of  these  cases  you're  actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driving  these  people  to  a  station  house.  So  why  can't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  get  a  ­­ at  least  what  the  Chief  Justice  said  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McNeely,  which  is,  okay,  if  you  can  get  a  warrant  within 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  time,  you  have  to  get  a  warrant  within  that  time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KEENA:  And,  you  know,  and  speaking  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

behalf  of  Minnesota  ­­ and  it's  very  clear,  Minnesota 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treats  ­­ and  I  don't  necessarily  disagree  with  you. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  ­­ Minnesota's  up  here  as  kind  of  the  alternative

argument.  Minnesota  specifically  treats  blood  tests 

  

 

 

 

 

differently  than  breath  tests.  We  specifically  do.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

our  court  has  recognized  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

So,  for  example,  under  the  implied­consent 

 

 

 

 

 

law  in  Minnesota,  if  you  are  ­­ in  order  to  get  a  blood 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  urine  test,  you  have  ­­ you  have  to  offer  both.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  we  do  treat  it  differently.  And  the  case  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Minnesota  treated  it  differently  in  the  Bernard  case; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  very  clear.  And  they  very  clearly  stated  that  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling  that  they  weren't  going  to  address  blood  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

urine,  and  they  will  be  shortly  because  there  are  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  before  them  where  that  issue  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  good.  Let's  talk 

  

  

 

 

 

just  about  the  breath  test. 

 

 

 

 

            

Number  one,  I'm  ­­ I'm  not  sure  why  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  roadside,  but  number  two,  if  you  take  them  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  station,  then  you  have  the  ­­ our  question  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  warrant.  Let's  talk  just  about  the  breath  test  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  practicalities  of  ­­ of  adopting  the  Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Let's  assume  ­­ I  know 

   

  

 

 

 

my  colleagues  are  ­­ but  as  part  of  this,  okay,  assume, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  Justice  Kagan  did,  that  a  system  could  be  put  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  for  a  warrant  on  a  breath  test.  If  you're  doing 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  at  the  precinct,  you  can  do  it  as  you  go  there.

Right  now,  we  get  dozens  of  consent  cases  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  ­­ of  homes,  where  the  police  tell  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

homeowner,  we're  applying  for  a  warrant.  And  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

homeowner  says,  well,  then  I  got  to  do  it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  the  number  of  warrants  are  much  less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  that.  Because  they  know  they're  going  to  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  warrant.  So  if  you  can  put  a  system  in  place  for  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  and  you  tell  the  person,  if  you  don't  take  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant,  you're  going  to  ­­ if  you  don't  do  the  blood  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  breath  test,  you're  going  to  be  charged  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obstruction,  what  are  you  losing  out? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  KEENA:  Well,  what  we're  really  losing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out  is  the  enhanceability.  That  is  ­­ that  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  charging  someone  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What's  enhanceability? 

  

 

 

MS.  KEENA:  For  a  DWI.  So  in  both 

   

  

  

 

 

 

Minnesota  ­­ well,  I'm  sure  everywhere  ­­ there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhanceability  with  DWI  laws. 

 

 

 

            

So  in  Minnesota  ­­ and,  for  example,  if  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  charge  ­­ if  I  can't  charge  the  DWI  or  refusal  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  only  left  with  an  obstruction,  I  can  no  longer  use 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  event  to  enhance  any  future  DWI  that  same  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  commit.  So  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  You  change  the 

  

  

 

 

 

law.  I  mean,  you  know,  it's  as  if  you  want  us  to  create

an  exception  to  the  Fourth  Amendment,  and  a  very  drastic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one,  to  give  someone  the  right  to  say  yea  or  nay  without

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  that's  because  you

That's  your  choice.  We're  ­­ we're  now  creating  an

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  IAN  H.  GERSHENGORN 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  do  three  things  this  morning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First,  address  the  real­world  consequences.  Second, 

  

 

 

 

 

explain  why  I  think  a  bright­line  criminal  rule  is  at 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

odds  with  common  sense,  the  U.S.  code  and  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent.  And,  third,  explain  why  it  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistake  to  have  a  warrant  requirement. 

   

 

 

 

            

In  the  real  world,  I  think  it's  critically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

important  that  this  Court  not  assume  that  warrants  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  24/7.  That  is  not  the  case  in  the  real  world. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Court  knows  that  from  the  NHTSA  studies  that  are  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  record.  The  North  Carolina  example  is  ­­ is  one. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  the  ­­ what  the  study  did  there  was  compare  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions  that  were  able  to  put  in  a  warrant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  against  the  nine  jurisdictions  that,  for

various  resource  reasons,  availability  of  judges  reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  other  reasons,  were  unable  to  do  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  experience  of  the  park  police,  I  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

tell  you  in  the  wake  of  McNeely,  is  that  while  they  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  the  warrants  24/7  in  Maryland,  they  have  stopped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  blood  draws,  except  in  extraordinary  cases  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virginia  and  D.C.  because  the  magistrates  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  24/7. 

 

            

Even  in  McNeely  itself,  where  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

listed  in  a  long,  long  footnote  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  why  is  that?  Why  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

why  in  Maryland  have  they  been  able  to  and  Virginia  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  In  the  Federal  ­­ for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  system,  it's  not  a  resource  constraint.  Some  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it,  as  the  Court  recognized  in  McNeely,  is  a  willingness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  judges  to  be  available  24/7.  A  matter  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority  is  in  Federal  court.  You  may  not  get  ­­ in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Southern  District  of  New  York,  you  may  have  24/7 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

availability  for  terrorist  attacks,  but  you  may  not  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  for  routine  drunk  driving. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  even  in  D.C.  and  Virginia,  where  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  have  it  for  fatal  crashes,  it's  not  available  24/7.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No  number.  A  person  is 

    

  

 

 

 

drunk.  He  is  10  percent  above  the  legal  limit,  whatever 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is.  How  long  does  it  take  to  dissipate,  do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know? 

            

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  To  dissipate,  I  don't  ­­

equal  to  or  less  than? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  there  a  number?  Have 

   

  

  

 

 

you  come  across  any  kind  of  study  on  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So  some  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

statistics  ­­ I  don't  have  the  exact  statistics,  Your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  What  the  Court  has  found  is  there's  significant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissipation  but  that  you  can  back­calculate  if  you  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  But  there  is  a  delay  in  getting  the  warrant  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times. 

            

In  the  Maryland  case,  you  can  get  it  as  soon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  15  minutes.  But  a  warrant  can  take  as  long  as  a  half 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hour  or  for  as  long  as  90  minutes  or  two  hours.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  page  37  of  the  study.  So  I  think  it  would  be  a  big 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistake  for  this  Court  to  decide  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  was  going  to  say  in  the  McNeely  footnote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  listed  33  states  that  have  electronic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants,  which  is  not  the  same  as  24/7  judicial

availability.  But  that  leaves  17  states  that  don't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  And  so  I  really  think  it's  a  mistake  for  the  Court 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  decide  it  on  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  there  are  more  and  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  year,  aren't  there?  I  mean,  we're  now  up  to  over 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40,  aren't  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So  Your  Honor,  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

definitely  more  and  more  every  year.  But,  again,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  if  the  Court  is  doing  a  rule  based  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea  that  these  warrants  are  constant  ­­ are  always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available,  there  is  a  serious  risk  that  in  ­­ once  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  that,  then  the  evidence  is  lost,  particularly  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  breath  test  in  the  jurisdiction  where  you  can't  get  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant. 

            

So  if  I  could  then  turn  to  the  ­­ to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bright­line  criminal  rule  that  I  understand  to  be  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

core  of  Petitioner's  case,  in  McNeely,  this  Court  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  State  may  condition  driving  on  public  roads  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  require  as  a  condition  that  a  motorist  arrested  or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

detained  for  drunk  driving  agree  to  a  BAC  testing  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  State  may  impose  significant  consequences  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  subsequent  refusal. 

 

 

            

So  the  question  is:  Does  the  Constitution 

  

 

 

 

 

 

impose  a  bright­line  rule  against  criminal  penalties, 

   

 

 

 

 

even  when  lesser  sanctions  are  insufficient  to  overcome

the  natural  incentive  that  many  drivers  will  have  not  to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abide  by  that  condition?
 

 

 

 

            

As  a  matter  of  common  sense,  I  think  that
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

doesn't  make  sense.  The  idea  that  you  can  only  withdraw
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  government  benefit  has  major  problems.  For  example,
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  condition  would  extend  beyond  the  term  of  the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit,  canceling  the  benefit  does  nothing.
 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  U.S.  Code  reflects  that.  If  I
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could,  Your  Honor,  I  am  subject  under  18  U.S.C.  207  to  a
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­year  ban  when  I  leave  the  Solicitor  General's  Office 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  contacting  or  communicating  with  the  SG's  office  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  official  matter.  That  is  punishable  under  18  U.S.C. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

216  by  up  to  a  year  in  jail.  That  is  a  criminal  penalty 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  condition  on  my  employment. 

   

 

 

 

            

That  is  not  the  only  situation.  18  U.S.C. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

603  criminalizes  contributions  by  government  employees. 

 

 

 

 

 

42  U.S.C.  14135  criminalizes  a  probationer's  refusal  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

give  DNA. 

 

            

The  idea  that  there  is  a  bright­line  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  sanctions  and  criminal  sanctions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

forces  the  government  only  to  rely  on  withdrawal  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  is  just  not  the  case.  That's  reflected  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  case  law. 

 

 

            

Back  in  1927,  in  the  Stephenson  case,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  discussed  in  the  briefs,  that  was  a  situation  in

which  Texas  had  conditioned  driving  on  the  Texas  roads 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  as  a  ­­ and  restricted  that  by  ­­ by  imposing  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorts  of  permitting  requirements.  Now,  in  that  era,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lockner  era,  those  were  viewed  as  unconstitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interferences  with  private  contracts.  And  although  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other  side  identifies  Stephenson  as  a  case  that  did  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  criminal  penalties  and  that  was  just  a  withdrawal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  benefit,  I  think  if  the  Court  looks,  we  read  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  differently.  And  I  think  if  the  Court  looks  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  260  of  Stephenson,  it  will  say  that  the  ­­ see  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Texas  statute  imposed  criminal  penalties. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  again,  the  idea  that  the  only  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  can  do  to  ­­ is  withdraw  a  benefit  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  of  an  unconstitutional  condition  and  can't  go  to

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  I  think  one  of  our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

concerns  is  that  driving  is  so  essential  for  so  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  that  it's  really  different  than  opting  to  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  Solicitor  General's  Office. 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So  Your  Honor,  I  take  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

point,  but  I  think  this  is  the  critical.  What  the  Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  McNeely,  the  Court  crossed  that  bridge  in

Excuse  me,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

            

What  the  Court  has  said  is  for  60  years, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  of  course,  it's  different  than  working  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor  General's  Office.  But  it's  a  dangerous 

   

  

 

 

 

activity  where  you're  driving  two  tons  of  steel  down  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

road,  and  the  Court  said  you  can  condition  driving. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  a  reasonable  condition  that  the  State  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  This  is  a  helpful  answer, 

   

  

 

 

 

and  your  ­­ your  time  is  running,  but  I'm  going  to  stop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  just  to  ask  another  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  it  permissible,  based 

  

 

 

 

 

on  the  pleadings  and  the  briefs  that  are  filed  with  us, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  ­­ for  the  Court  to  make  a  distinction  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking  a  breath  test,  refusing  to  take  the  breath  test 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  refusing  to  take  a  blood  test? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Certainly,  it  is,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

Honor,  and  we  set  forth  that  in  our  brief.  I  do  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  this  Court  said  in  Skinner,  and  Your  Honor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  in  Skinner,  is  ­­ the  Court  has  never  held  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  it  did  in  McNeely  that  a  warrant  is  required  and  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  not  do  so  here.  The  Court  said  in  McNeely  ­­ in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Skinner,  that  there  are  no  significant  privacy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests,  that  we  cannot  include  a  breath  test  to

implement  for  privacy  concerns.  That  makes  good  sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  intrusion  is  much  smaller,  the  amount  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  that  is  revealed  is  just  the  alcohol.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  much  narrower  set,  and  it  can  be  done  as  part  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regular  booking  process. 

 

 

            

So  on  that  side  of  the  scale,  the  privacy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  are  substantially  smaller. 

 

 

 

            

            

And  the  second  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  are  those  tests  often 

  

 

 

 

 

 

administered  roadside  or  ­­ everybody  has  ­­ they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  telling  us  they  have  to  go  to  ­­ I  thought  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  roadside. 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Your  Honor,  as  a  general 

   

  

 

 

 

manner,  they're  actually  done  at  the  station.  There's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preliminary  test  that  can  be  done  at  the  side  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

road  that  often  is  not  admissible  in  evidence.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  these  so­called  BAT  mobiles,  the  blood­alcohol 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testing  mobiles  that  can  be  done  at  the  side  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

road,  but  many  jurisdictions,  including  the  park  police, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  using  those.  They  actually  are  done  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

station. 

            

But  I  also  would  like  to  say,  on  Your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor's  opinion  ­­ on  Your  Honor's  question,  that  the

warrant,  generally  the  warrant  ­­ of  course,  it  ­­ it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides  the  function  of  having  a  neutral  magistrate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  evidence.  But  generally  with  a  warrant, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

then  the  officer  can  force  compliance.  That's  part  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  warrant  allows.  That's  not  possible  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breath  context. 

 

            

What  this  Court  ­­ the  ­­ a  warrant  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  for  a  breath  analysis  can't  be  ­­ can't  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accomplished  without  the  consent  of  the  breather.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  force  somebody  to  breathe  steadily  enough.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  an  extended  birthday­cake  blowout,  candle  blowout, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  force  somebody  to  do  that.  And  so  the  warrant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  kind  of  an  odd  fit.  And  I  think  then  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  presumably 

  

 

 

 

 

there're  sanctions  for  failing  ­­ failing  to  comply  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  valid  warrant. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  But  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  If  the  police  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant  to  search  your  house  and  you  say  I  don't  care,

presumably  is  subject  to  criminal  sanctions  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So,  Your  Honor,  it  might

little  bit  why  the  use  of  the  warrant  doesn't  ­­ doesn't

I  think  the  other  problem  that  you  have  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  can't  force  compliance,  you  might  have  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  statute  ­­ another  statute  later  to  ­­ to  do  it.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  consequences  are  not  as  clear,  what  it  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  is  drive  the  State  to  the  blood  ­­ blood  testing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  one  can  force. 

 

 

 

            

But  that's  the  very  situation  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  recognized  in  Neville,  and  that  the  States  here

situation  that  States  don't  want  to  be  driven  to,  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forced  blood  draw  on  a  nonconsenting  individual. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Again,  what  about  that 

  

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ assuming,  for  argument's  sake,  that  you  can  take  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breathalyzer  without  a  warrant.  What  need  is  there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

for  ­­ for  a  blood  test  without  a  warrant?  I  mean,  why 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  it,  at  a  minimum,  that  if  you're  going  to  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blood  test,  you  need  a  warrant? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  So,  Your  Honor,  one 

  

 

 

 

 

difference,  of  course,  is  that  the  blood  test  does  ­­ if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  officer  has  a  suspicion  that  there's  other  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

alcohol  at  issue,  the  blood  test  is  critically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important.  If  there  are  drugs  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Of  course  it's  important. 

  

 

 

 

 

But  it's  going  to  take  time.  You've  got  to  get  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital.  There's  risks  involved.  It's  a  more  serious

intrusion.  And  so  the  requirement,  as  we  said,  could  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  minimal.  You  go  to  ­­ during  that  15,  20  minutes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to  the  hospital,  go  get  a  warrant. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Nobody's  saying  they  can't  do  it.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  whether  they  have  to  have  a  magistrate's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

approval,  and  so  that's  what  my  question  was. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Assuming  you  win  on  the  Breathalyzer,  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  you  win  on  the  blood  test? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GERSHENGORN:  Your  Honor,  we  ­­ we  win 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  blood  test,  because  the  ­­ because  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bright  line  on  criminal  sanctions,  and  because  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critically  important  outside  the  blood  context  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  need  the  drug  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Thank  you,  Your  Honor.

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  ROTHFELD:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  I  may,  I'll  make  three  quick  points, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  legal  and  one  practical. 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  I  think  given  the  discussion  here, 

   

 

 

 

 

the  Court  should  not  lose  sight  of  the  ­­ what  we  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  fundamental  legal  proposition,  what's  going  on  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  which  is  in  North  Dakota  and  Minnesota,

people  who  drive  on  the  roads  are  automatically  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrevocably  lose  their  Fourth  Amendment  right  to  resist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrantless  searches.  There's  no  consent  here,  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

no  knowledge  that's  been  demonstrated  on  the  part  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  defendants. 

 

            

So  the  ­­ the  proposition  that's  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered  by  the  government  is  that  States  can  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attach  to  any  benefit  that  is  provided  to  individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  surrender  of  a  constitutional  right,  whether  or  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  individuals  know  that  they're  going  to  do  it.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  future,  a  criminal  penalty  can  be  attached  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  of  that  constitutional  right.  That's  quite  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

remarkable  proposition. 

 

              

I  think  that  the  examples  that  Mr. 

 

 

 

 

 

Gershengorn  offered  of  ­­ of  criminal  penalties  that  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  attached  to  ­­ to  government  employees,  for  example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  situations  in  which  there  is  no  First  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  Those  are  Pickering  cases  in  which  there  are  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  substantive  limitations  on  what  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  can  do,  so  there  would  be  no  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  there. 

 

            

Second,  on  practicalities,  there  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion  about  the  nature  of  warrants  and  how  ­­ how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

readily  available  they  are.  If  the  Court  reveals  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

studies  by  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety

Administration,  which  has  looked  at  this  extensively,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  find,  as  a  contrast  to  some  extent  to  McNeely,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrants  are  almost  universally  available  on  quick  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

efficient  terms. 

 

            

The  amicus  briefs  that  filed  on  our  side  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  demonstrate  this  is  true  in  the  vast  majority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  cases.  There  are  more  ­­ more  States  that  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  these  warrant  mechanisms  now  than  did  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McNeely  was  decided,  so  it's  going  to  become  a  universal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism. 

            

As  the  NHTSA  study  shows  that  in  virtually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  jurisdictions,  including  rural  jurisdictions,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito  asked  about,  these  are  ­­ warrant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures  work  effectively,  that  the  officers  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

field,  the  magistrates  and  the  judges  who  handle  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  the  prosecutors,  all  ­­ almost  universally  praise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  warrant  process  as  something  that's  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective  that  drives  down  test  refusal,  that  makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confrontations  between  officers  and  drivers 

 

 

 

 

substantially  reduced,  and  that  drives  up  DUI 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions.  And  so  warrants  are  an  effective  way  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressing  this.  And  as  the  Court  said  in  Riley,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  to  a  situation  like  this  is  simply  get  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant.

breath  versus  blood  tests,  the  Court,  so  far  as  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aware,  has  never  said  that  once  there  is  a  search  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken  place  in  a  law  enforcement  investigation,  that  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  cut  out  certain  character  ­­ certain  ­­ certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

types  of  procedures  or  certain  types  of  evidence  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  sought.  The  presumption  is  that  a  warrant  should 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  required. 

 

            

And  in  the  Skinner  case,  I  mean,  the  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed  both  blood  and  ­­ and  breath  tests.  Although 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  noted  there  were  differences  between  the  two,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated  them  identically  for  Fourth  Amendment  purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  said  that  they  have  essentially  very,  very  similar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics.  They  involve  similar  personal  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

degrees  of  personal  intrusion.  And  I  do  not  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  any  supportable  reason  for  treating  the  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently  for  purposes  of  the  warrant  requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Honor. 

            

            

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon,  at  11:26  a.m.,  the  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
