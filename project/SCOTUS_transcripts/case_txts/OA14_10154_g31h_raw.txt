CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­10154,  Voisine  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Armstrong  v.  United  States. 

 

 

 

            

Ms.  Villa. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  VIRGINIA  G.  VILLA 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS, 

 

 

 

 

                 

APPOINTED  BY  THIS  COURT 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

There  are  three  reasons  to  exclude  reckless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanors  from  the  phrase  "use...  of  physical  force" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  occurs  in  921(a)(33). 

 

 

 

            

The  first  is  that  it's  consistent  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  use  that  this  Court  has  implemented  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  cases.  Second,  it  is  consistent  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

common­law  definition  of  battery.  And,  third,  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  intentionality  inherent  in  domestic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  it's  inconsistent 

  

 

 

 

with  the  treatment  of  bodily  injury.  I  mean,  I  think 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

you  agree,  because  the  Court  so  held,  that  either  bodily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  or  offensive  touching  is  the  act  ­­ satisfies  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act  requirement.  And  you  say  if  there's  bodily  injury,

then  reckless  is  enough,  but  if  it's  only  offensive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

touching,  then  you  need  a  higher  mental  state, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  or  knowing?  Why  ­­ if  ­­ if  both  acts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualify  equally,  why  shouldn't  the  same  state  of  mind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attach  to  each? 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  The  same  state  of  mind  should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

attach  to  each,  and  that  is  why  intentionality  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state  of  mind  that  under  the  common  law  can  attach  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each.  Because  intentional  battery  covered  both  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

offensive  physical  contact  as  well  as  the  physical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury,  whereas  recklessness  covers  only  bodily  injury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

Intentionality,  in  my  mind,  is  misperceived,  because  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­ you're  talking  about  intentionality  as  the  act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  causing  the  injury.  But  I  understood  common­law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

battery  to  be  the  intentional  act  that  causes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury;  i.e.,  if  a  husband  threw  a  bottle  at  a  wife, 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

doesn't  intend  to  hit  her,  but  the  bottle  smashes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  wall  and  the  glass  embeds  itself  in  her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face,  under  the  common  law  that  would  have  been  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battery  because  the  act,  the  intentional  act,  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throw  the  bottle.  It  wasn't  ­­ it  wasn't  to  cause  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury,  but  the  act  caused  the  injury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  I  respectfully  disagree,  Your 

    

 

 

 

Honor.  Under  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  know.  If  we  end  up 

    

  

 

 

 

 

disagreeing  because  the  government  points  to  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples  where  this  is  the  case,  how  do  you  win? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  That's  only  on  injury  cases,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  you  don't  have  that  same  confirmation  or  that  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organization  of  the  law  with  respect  to  offensive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical  contact.  And  so  my  clients  were  convicted  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offensive  physical  contact  under  a  ­­ under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  approach.  And  so  at  that  point,  you  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  they  were  convicted  of  anything  that  caused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical  injury. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  ­­ but  the  point  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  contact  was  in  ­­ was  ­­ some  contact  had  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  occurred. 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  question  is  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

there  was  an  act  that  caused  that  contact  regardless  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it  was  intentional  or  reckless. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  The  problem  under  the  common  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  not  all  touches  were  considered  to  be  illegal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  that  is  why  in  Johnson,  this  Court  stated  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law  as  being  the  intentional  application  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful  force. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  we  were  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

about  common­law  battery  as  it  applied  to  ­­ definition

as  it  applied  in  a  domestic  setting.  So  I'm  talking 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  about  a  domestic  setting  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS.  VILLA:  This  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ which  this  is. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  VILLA:  This  is  serious  but  the  problem 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  is  that  the  government's  formulation  of  any  reckless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  satisfying  use  of  physical  force  is  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  limited  to  batteries. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  the  mens  rea  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness  could  apply  to  the  act  of  touching  or  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  act  is  offensive.  Now,  under  Maine  law,  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  of  those  does  it  apply?  It  doesn't  necessarily 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  apply  to  both. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Statutorily  it  does  apply  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

both. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  if  someone  recklessly 

  

 

 

 

 

touches  another  person  and  that  is  offensive,  that's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battery  under  Maine  law? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  And  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

government  cites  a  case  exactly  for  that  ­­ proposition, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that's  the  Gantnier  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  what  happened  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

MS.  VILLA:  It  was  whether  the  defendant  got 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ an  instruction  on  the  simple  battery  rather  than

the  sexual  offensive  contact,  and  so  that  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reversed  it  because  it  said  that  it  was  a  proper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  No,  I  mean  what  were  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

facts?  What  did  this  person  do  that  was  ­­ involved  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reckless  touching? 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  He  went  to  wake  in  ­­ his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stepdaughter,  I  believe,  who  was  asleep  on  a  couch, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

reached  underneath  a  blanket  and  ­­ to  shake  her  awake, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  touched  her  naked  body. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  that  ­­ that  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  recklessness  there  goes  to  the  ­­ the  offensive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature  of  the  touching,  not  to  the  touching  itself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  No. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  In  other  words,  there's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

act  of  touching,  so  he  ­­ he  went  to  shake  her  but  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  intend  to  touch  her? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  It  was  ­­ there  can  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness  as  to  result  or  recklessness  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance.  And  so  that  is  an  example  of  recklessness 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  to  circumstance  by  reaching  underneath.  If  he  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

touched  her  on  top  of  clothing,  it  would  not  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  offense  that  could  have  been  charged.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  the  fact  that  he  touched  her  naked  body  and  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  see  that  she  was  naked.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  don't  really  understand 

    

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  answer.  He  didn't  intend  to  touch  her  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all?  That  was  his  intent? 

  

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  VILLA:  No,  he  did  intend  to  touch  her. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Okay.  Well,  that's  what  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

saying.  They  are  two  different  things.  Did  the  ­­ does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  intend  to  touch  ­­ does  the  person  intend  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

touch  in  an  offensive  way? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  VILLA:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  so  then  it  seems  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  answer  to  my  question  is  that  it  is  in  the  latter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  has  the  mens  rea  of  recklessness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Under  the  Maine  statute,  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  latter  that  has  the  mens  rea  of  recklessness.  Under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  common  law,  it  is  the  intent  to  have  unlawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact.  And  so  that  is  why  not  all  touches  qualify, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  why  you  can't  just  have  an  intent  to  touch. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  also  have  to  have  an  intent  to  touch  unlawfully. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ­­

   

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  is  it  that  indicates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Federal  statute  tracks  the  common  law?  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  statute  gives  its  own  definition. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Your  Honor,  the  Federal  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  use  of  physical  force,  and  so  it  is  only  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Castleman  having  adopted  the  common  law  for  purposes

of  force.  But  Your  Honor  is  absolutely  correct,  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  construing  the  common  law  here.  We  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construing  the  phrase  "use...  of  physical  force."  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  problem  with  the  government's  case  is  that  that  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  physical  force  can  occur  in  reckless  driving  context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  I  am  driving  a  car  and  I  have  a  family  member  that 

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

qualifies  under  922  ­­ 921(a)(33)  in  with  me  and  I  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  an  accident  due  to  reckless  conduct,  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualify  as  a  predicate  under  this  statute  according  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  construction. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  Villa,  can  I  understand 

   

  

 

 

 

what  you  said?  You  said  you're  relying  primarily,  then, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  on  the  common­law  history  but  on  the  ­­ the  ­­ just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  language,  "use...  of  physical  force"  and  what  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means,  the  ordinary  meaning  of  those  words,  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct?

a  wall.  You  say,  well,  I  have  a  better  example.  It's 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

driving  a  car  really  fast  in  a  way  that  will  endanger 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  inhabitants.  But,  of  course,  we've  said  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  times  ­­ I  mean,  we  said  it  most  recently  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Sykes  case  that  a  car  is  ­­ is  an  instrument  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force  when  used  recklessly  in  that  way.  So  why  aren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  these  kinds  of  examples  consistent  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  meaning  of  use  of  force? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  There's  a  substantive 

   

  

 

difference,  though,  between  driving  recklessly  and  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intending  to  harm  the  person  that  is  with  you  in  the  car 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  throwing  an  object  at  a  person.  And  so,  really,  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  of  throwing  an  object  at  a  person  is  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  use  of  force  against  that  other  person. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  defendant  can  testify  all  day  and  all  night  that  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  intend  to  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Of  course,  you're  ­­ you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

adding  language  to  the  statute  now  because  you  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  another  person,  and  that  is  indeed  the  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Leocal.  But  in  Leocal,  we  said  we're  not  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  the  question  here,  which  is  just  the  phrase  "use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  physical  force,"  not  against  another  person,  just  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase,  "use...  of  physical  force." 

 

 

 

 

            

And  tell  me  ­­ I  mean,  I  guess  your  car

give  me  an  example  which  would  be  reckless  behavior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  a  battery  statute  but  which  you  think  would  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  the  use  of  force. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  I  had  a  client  once  who  pled 

    

   

 

 

 

 

guilty  to  a  misdemeanor  where  he  was  actually  running 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

away  from  a  guy  who  was  trying  to  beat  him  up.  And  he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closed  the  door  very  forcefully  behind  him  and  caught 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  guy's  fingers  in  the  ­­ in  the  door. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You  just  said  it.  He  closed 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  door  very  forcefully  behind  him. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  VILLA:  He  did. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That's  the  ­­ that's  the  use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  physical  force. 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  It  was  the  use  of  physical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

force.  But  what  he  explained  is  that,  I  closed  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

door.  The  door  hit  the  guy.  I  didn't  mean  to  hit  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guy.  I  knew  he  was  behind  me. 

    

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  know.  And  that's  why  it's 

    

  

 

 

 

 

reckless  and  not  knowing  or  whatever  the  other  term  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  ­­ but  you're  still  using  physical  force.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  ­­ that's  the  term  that  has  to  be  interpreted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  is  the  "use...  of  physical  force." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  But  the  Court  has  said,  with  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due  respect,  that  it  is  to  ­­ carrying  out  an  action  or

door,  he  didn't  mean  to  hurt  the  other  guy.  He  meant  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close  the  door.  And  so  he  was  using  force  to  close  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

door,  but  he  wasn't  using  force  to  hurt  the  other  guy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  quite  right.  But  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

language  ­­ I  feel  like  I'm  repeating  myself  a  little, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

so  I'll  just  try  it  one  more  time.  The  language  is  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  use  of  force.  And  what  we  are  trying  to  decide  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  that  includes  use  of  force  that  indeed  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carried  out  without  an  intent  to  harm,  but  is  carried 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  with  an  understanding  that  there  is  a  risk  of  harm. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  what  recklessness  is.  And  ­­ and,  you  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  something  like  driving  a  car  200  miles  an  hour,  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throwing  a  plate,  or  slamming  a  door  when  somebody's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

hand  is  in  the  vicinity,  all  of  those  things  involve  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requisite  risk  and  all  of  those  things  involve  the  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  physical  force. 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  But  not  in  the  sense  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  construed  "use"  in  the  past.  And  so  they  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ for  instance,  in  Smith,  which  was  decided  in  1993, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case  was  where  it  was  "to  carry  out  an  action  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  by  means  of."  And  so  it's  not  to  carry  out  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action,  to  close  a  door,  by  means  of  hurting  somebody. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  there  is  this  disconnect,  and  that  is  inherent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  in  the  ­­ in  recklessness,  because  what  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  is  that  you  aren't  looking  to  hurt  it.  There  may

And  so  the  ­­ the  whole  difference  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposeful,  knowing  behavior  as  opposed  to  reckless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behavior  is  ­­ is  that  you  have  a  purpose  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  someplace  else  with  a  risk  that  there  might  be  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral  consequence,  rather  than  actually  seeking  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accomplish  that  collateral  consequence. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Don't  you  have  to  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

at  this  in  the  domestic  violence  context?  Because  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition,  "use  of  force"  as  put  in  terms  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanor  under  Federal  or  State  triable  law,  means  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  it  means  a  domestic  violence.  And  isn't  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

prototypical  in  many  of  these  domestic  violence  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  much  of  the  violence  employed  is  not  direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence,  not  hitting  some  ­­ there's  a  lot  of  that,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  an  awful  lot  of  the  examples  I  raised  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reckless  conduct  that  leads  to  violence,  either  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drunkenness  or  from  other  conditions. 

 

 

 

 

            

You're  using  "use  of  force"  as  it's  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined  in  other  areas.  Why  does  it  fit  into  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  violence  case? 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Because  domestic  violence, 

  

 

 

 

according  to  the  Castleman  opinion  was  violence  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonviolent  conduct  that's  offensive,  and  is  offensive  ­­

MS.  VILLA:  Excuse  me? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That  was  the  offensive 

  

 

 

 

 

touching  prong.  I'm  talking  about,  here,  the  use  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical  force  prong  ­­

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Except  for  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ that  causes  injury  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

some  way. 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  But  it's  a  singular  definition. 

   

  

 

 

 

It's  "use...  of  physical  force."  Whether  it  is  touching 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not,  it  is  something  that  is  intended  to  control 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one's  partner.  And  so  if  you  have  to  use  force  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control  one's  partner,  or  you  do  something  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offensive  to  control  one's  partner,  it  is  still  the  idea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  are  implementing  any  level  of  force  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

achieve  an  end,  and  that  end  is  the  control  inherent  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  violence. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  government  tells  us 

  

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  ­­ heavy  consequences  ride  on  this,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  that  many  domestic  violence  situations  would  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  prosecution  under  this  statute  on  your  read, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  require  knowing  or  intentional,  rather  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reckless,  state  of  mind. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Yes,  Your  Honor.

MS.  VILLA:  I  don't  necessarily  agree  with

footnote  8,  courts  have  generally  construed  "use...  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical  force"  to  exclude  reckless  conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  there  are  ­­ for  instance,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Castleman  itself,  it  falls  in  the  Sixth  Circuit.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Circuit  in  Portela  held  "use  of  physical  force 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excludes  reckless  conduct."  It  was  not  construing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

922(g),  but  I  would  note  that  the  State  prosecutor  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Castleman  had  a  statute  much  like  that  in  Maine  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disallowed  knowing,  purposeful,  or  reckless  conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

And  rather  than  charging  all  of  them,  that  prosecutor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restricted  it  to  "knowing  purposeful  conduct." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Do  you  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

prosecutors,  when  they  are  State  prosecutors,  when  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  charging  these  domestic  violence  offenses,  are  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  looking  ahead  to  the  consequences  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  charge  for  Federal  firearms  laws?

because  there  is  a  large  part  of  the  budget  of  ­­ for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  violence  within  the  Federal  government  that

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  let  me  ask  you  this, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  somewhat  unrelated.  So  Congress  passes  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  and  they  do  not  want  a  person  who  has  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  of  a  misdemeanor  crime  of  domestic  violence  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  firearm.  Okay?  What  was  the  year  when  that  was 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed? 

            

MS.  VILLA:  1996,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Okay.  1996. 

  

  

 

            

That's  what  they  want  to  do.  And  you  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  ­­ that  the  offense  of  battery  falls  within  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition;  am  I  right? 

   

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  The  offensive  contact  battery, 

  

 

 

 

 

yes,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  All  right.  What  reason  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

there  to  think  that  when  Congress  did  this,  they  wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law  battery  only?  They  didn't  want  battery  as  it

Congress  intended  is  that  it  did  not  adopt  battery  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definition  of  a  misdemeanor  crime  of  domestic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

violence  for  purposes  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I  under  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

understand  that,  but  I  thought  you  agree  that  "battery" 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  some  sense  falls  within  the  definite  ­­ falls  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  category  of  a  misdemeanor  crime  of  domestic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

violence. 

            

MS.  VILLA:  I  have  to,  because  of  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Castleman  so  ruled. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yeah.  Okay.  Well,  if  you 

  

  

  

 

 

 

agree  with  that  ­­ and  then  your  argument  is  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  ­­ all  they  think  about  across  the  street  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law.  So  battery  ­­ common  law  battery,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  care  what  the  actual  statutes  are  around  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country.  They  are  just  interested  in  the  offense  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law  battery. 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  mean,  is  that  realistic? 

    

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Your  Honor,  that  is  not  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position.  My  position  is,  is  that  common  law  battery, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offensive  physical  contact  could  only  be  accomplished 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  intentional  conduct. 

 

 

            

The  term  "use"  had  been  construed  already  by

this  Court  prior  to  1996  as  being  an  affirmative, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposeful  conduct  that  you're  taking  an  item  and  making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  your  instrument,  that  you're  accomplishing  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  that.  And  in  this  case,  it  would  have  been  force. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  then  if  you  accompany  that  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea  of  domestic  violence  as  the  intentional  controlling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  domestic  partner,  all  of  those  ideas,  each  one  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  has  intentionality  at  its  core. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  that  when  Congress  used  this  phrase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  an  element,  not  as  a  ­­ a  generic  crime  of  battery, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  as  an  element  of  any  misdemeanor  crime,  it  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  use  of  physical  force,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

intentionality  use,  as  well  as  physical  force  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  violence,  all  share  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  think  you're  losing  me.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

thought  you  were  argue  ­­ I  thought  you  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledging  that  reckless  conduct  would  be  sufficient

offensive  touching  is  involved;  is  that  right  or  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Under  the  common  law  in  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  mid  1800s,  there  was  a  subset  of  batteries  that  did 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt  a  negligent  ­­ not  a  negligence,  but  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

recklessness  factor.  But  that  is  not  the  definition

that  category?  That  was  the  category  where  bodily 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  resulted;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  the  answer  to  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alito's  question  is,  yes,  that  bodily  injury  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trigger  this  statute. 

 

 

            

It's  the  question  I  opened  with.  If  the  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  conduct  is  covered,  whether  it  is  touching  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bodily  injury,  why  shouldn't  the  state  of  mind  match? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why  shouldn't  the  same  state  of  mind  do  for  both  bodily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  and  offensive  touching? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Because  it  would  be  inconsistent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  idea  that  when  you  adopt  a  common  law  term, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  adopt  all  of  the  soil  that  went  with  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  what's  the  common 

  

 

 

 

 

law  term? 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  The  common  law  term  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"battery"  term  as  informing  force.  And  so  in

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Excuse  me.  Let  me  get  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  The  statute  talks  about  "use." 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  It  is  "use." 

  

 

 

 

            

And  so  force  was  at  issue  in  Castleman,  and

battery  as  being  the  level  of  force  for  purposes  of  the

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  we  wouldn't  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  common  law  has  some  great  definition  of  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"use,"  would  we? 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  No,  Your  Honor.  Which  is  why 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  normal  usage  for  use  of  physical  force  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent  ­­ also  intentional,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yeah. 

  

 

MS.  VILLA:  ­­ so  I'm  just  saying  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  mean,  I  hear  you  today  as 

    

   

 

 

 

 

basically  making  an  ordinary  meaning  argument,  which  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  a  good  thing  because  all  the  briefing  on  both 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sides  of  this  has  been  talking  about  the  common  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until  it's  coming  out  of  your  ears,  and  it's  not  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me  why  the  common  law  makes  any  difference  at  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

              

I  mean,  you  know,  Congress  was  operating 

 

 

 

 

 

against  a  backdrop.  It  was  not  the  backdrop  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law;  it  was  the  backdrop  of  50  States  having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battery  statutes.  There's  no  word  in  this  statute  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  defined  ­­ you  know,  which  is  a  ­­ a  settled 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

common­law  term. 

 

            

So  the  question  is,  what  was  Congress  doing?

Congress,  we  said  in  Castleman,  wanted  to  basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capture  the  set  of  battery  statutes  in  which  ­­ which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  used  for  people  engaged  in  domestic  violence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Almost  all  of  those  statutes  use  "recklessness"  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  Why  isn't  that  the  proper  place  to  look  rather 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  the  common  law? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Because  Congress  used  a  narrower 

   

  

 

 

 

definition  than  many  battery  statutes.  And  so  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  have  wholesale  been  adopting  those  battery 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes  as  ­­ as  meaning  use  of  physical  force. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  Congress  doesn't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  statute  doesn't  talk  ­­ say  ­­ say  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"battery."  It  doesn't  use  it. 

  

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  VILLA:  Does  not  use  the  word  "battery." 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  defines  it  in  ­­ in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  special  way. 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  It  defines  it  in  a  very  special 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

way.  And  all  of  the  parts,  you  have  use  of  physical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force  which  this  Court  had  defined  as  ­­ as  having  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  the  user's  instrument  which  is  that  intentionality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  prior  to  Congress  adopting  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  had  consisted  of  use  of  physical  force  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  statutes  where  recklessness  was  excluded,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ it  did  not  adopt  ­­ again,  it  doesn't  say

they  adopted  "battery"  may  be  a  way  of  trying  to  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  it,  but  it's  not  what  they  wrote. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  they  also  narrowed  the  idea  of  what  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitute  a  ­­ an  appropriate  misdemeanor,  because 

   

 

 

 

 

again,  as  in  Castleman,  the  court  recognized  that  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  under  the  Tennessee  statute  would  qualify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  were  threats  but  not  threats  of  a  deadly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weapon. 

            

All  of  the  ­­ the  use  of  physical  force,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempt,  attempts  are  specific  intent  crimes,  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  also  an  intentional  crime.  And  then  threats  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually  very  intentional.  And  so  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  you  please  go  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  question  Justice  Kagan  asked  you  and  not  using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  shaking  somebody,  because  I  don't  understand  how 

   

 

 

 

 

 

shaking  someone  doesn't  constitute  the  use  of  physical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force.  It  may  not  be  great  force,  but  it's  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

touching. 

            

What  other  example  do  you  have  of  a  reckless 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

act  that  wouldn't  involve  the  use  of  physical  force? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  ­­ you're  sort  of  saying  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  It's  ­­

I  thought  was  my  husband  and  I  patted  him  on  the  back

oh,  my  gosh,  that  isn't  him. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  had  ­­ I  touched  him.  I  intended  to  touch

touching  that  does  not  involve  ­­ it  involves  touching 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimally.  That  could  be  an  offense.

MS.  VILLA:  It  is  ­­

many  reasons,  including  must  arrest.  Some  neighbor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hears  a  disturbance  and  so  calls  the  police.  The  police

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  example  that  you

are  related  may  not  be  ­­ that  the  touching  may  occur, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it  may  either  not  be  wanting  to  be  offensive  such  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  wanting  to  touch  somebody  to  wake  them  up  instead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  wanting  to  offend  them.  And  so  that's  the

I  would  like  to  reserve  the  rest  of  my  time

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Ms.  Eisenstein. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ILANA  H.  EISENSTEIN 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  has  twice  interpreted 

 

 

 

 

Section  922(g)(9)  in  Hazen  and  Castleman,  and  each  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded  that  Congress  intended  to  keep  guns  away  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  convicted  of  assault  and  battery  under  generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable  State  and  Federal  and  Tribal  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Petitioner  attempts  to  distinguish  between 

 

 

 

 

offenses  that  cause  bodily  injury  and  those  that  involve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offensive  touching.  But  as  this  Court  already  decided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Castleman,  that  is  a  fallacy;  that  distinction  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

elusive.  And  that's  because  States,  including  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  prohibit  the  causation  of  bodily  injury,  even  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses  may  include  offenses  that  are  similar  in  terms

of  degree  to  offensive  touching.  In  fact,  that  was  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  at  issue  at  Castleman  itself.  It  was  the  bodily 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  prong  of  the  Tennessee  statute,  not  the  offensive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

touching  prong. 

 

            

 

 

And  ­­ and  in  that  case,  the  bodily  injury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  committed  in  a  way  that  involved  only  slight 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury.  And  yet,  this  Court  refused  to  distinguish,  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

degree  of  force,  batteries  that  qualify  Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

922(g)(9)  predicates. 

 

            

Keep  in  mind  that  States  overwhelmingly 

 

 

 

 

 

define  battery  as  ­­ only  as  to  the  resulting  injury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners'  role,  which  would  limit  misdemeanor  crimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  domestic  violence  to  intentional  conduct,  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  a  prosecutor  in  those  jurisdictions  to  prove  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  underlying  offense  not  only  that  the  contact  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

push,  the  hit,  the  grab  was  intentional,  but  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor  would  also  have  to  show  that  the  abuser 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended  the  resulting  injury  in  order  to  prove  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battery  offense  under  the  vast  majority  of  State  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Federal  law. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What's  so  bad  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that?  I  mean,  given  her  door  example,  for  example,  why 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  the  accidental  or  perhaps  you  would  say  she  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  he  or  she  knew  that  the  person  was  close,  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  that  constitute  misdemeanor  crime  of  domestic

violence? 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Well,  in  part  because 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress  intended  to  cover  batteries.  And  the  way  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  only  at  common  law,  but  also  in  modern  ­­ under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  and  generic  understanding  of  battery,  define  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battery  offense  as  ­­ only  as  to  the  causation  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resulting  harm. 

 

            

 

 

And  keep  in  mind,  reckless  conduct  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioner  avoids  the  fact  of  what  reckless  conduct  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A  reckless  conduct  is  not  an  involuntary  or  a  negligent, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  even  an  accidental  act.  Reckless  conduct  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntary  conduct.  It's  conduct  where  an  individual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

chooses  to  act  in  conscious  disregard  of  a  substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  known  risk  of  harm. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  the  ­­ if  the  person  in  your  example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  slammed  the  door  not  realizing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fingers  were  there,  that's  not  going  to  be  reckless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  at  all.  That  would  be  negligence  at  best. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  mean,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

don't  know;  you're  running  away.  What  if  it's  a  close 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

call?  You  don't  pause  to  think,  well,  gosh,  maybe  he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close  enough  or  she's  close  enough  that  this  will,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  hurt  his  fingers  or  something.  I  mean,  is  ­­ is

pinch  the  fingers  or  something. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  But  ­­ but  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ what  feels  wrong  about  the  hypothetical  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  degree  of  intent  of  the  act  or  ­­ it's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent  to  which  that  person  may  be  justified  in  the  door 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

slamming,  which  was  that  this  was  an  act,  perhaps,  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­defense. 

              

I  think  the  more  prototypical  examples  are 

 

 

 

 

 

situations  where  ­­ that  this  Court  highlighted  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Castleman,  where  an  individual  takes  intentional  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  contact  with  their  loved  one  and  does  so  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  that  is  reckless  as  to  whether,  for  example,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  push,  reckless  as  to  whether  his  wife  simply 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stumbles  backwards  or  falls  down  and  injures  herself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  the  way  States  overwhelmingly  frame  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assault  and  battery  statutes. 

 

 

 

            

            

And  that's  what  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Justice  Ginsburg's  example 

  

 

 

 

of  operating  an  automobile:  A  husband  is  arguing  with 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  wife  and  speeds  through  a  stop  sign  and  the  wife  is

injured.  What  results  under  the  statute? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that  under  an  assault,  a  general  assault  and  battery 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  it's  theoretically  possible  that  a  person  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

be  convicted  of  battering  his  or  her  spouse  under  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  I  don't  think  that's  problematic  for  two 

    

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  One  is  I  think  it's  an  extremely  narrow 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

category  of  offenses,  and  Petitioner  has  pointed  to  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  examples. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  the  ­­ the  main 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute  says  "recklessly  causes  bodily  injury." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  So  there  ­­ and  I  agree 

   

  

 

 

 

 

with  Your  Honor  that  in  theory,  that  type  of  offense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  constitute  a  battery.  But  to  the  degree  to  which 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  prosecuted  where  ­­ in  the  real  world  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecuted  where  the  ­­ a  domestic  family  member  is  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sole  victim  and  that  that  is  only  a  misdemeanor,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  not  sufficiently  severe  injury  or  other  factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  rise  to  the  level  of  a  felony  offense,  which  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  disqualifying  under  its  own  right,  I  don't  think  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  level  of  overbreadth  is  problematic  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  not  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

overbreadth.  I'm  talking  about  interpretation  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  The  statute  includes  a  misdemeanor,  so  that

disposes  of  that  part  of  your  answer.  The  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covers  a  misdemeanor. 

   

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Correct,  Your  Honor.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

what  I'm  ­­ but  my  point  is  that  the  type  of  scenario 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  is  posited  where  both  there  would  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reckless,  sort  of  a  generally  reckless  conduct,  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim  happens  to  be,  by  ­­ by  chance  the  family  member, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  opposed  to  another  member  of  the  public,  and  thus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualifying  as  a  Section  922(g)(9)  predicate  is  narrow 

   

 

 

 

 

 

indeed. 

            

And  the  converse  of  that  is  striking.  While 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ while  the  overbreadth  of  the  hypothetical  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It's  narrow,  but  it  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  qualify  under  the  statute.  I  don't  quite  understand 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  answer.  You  said,  oh,  well,  it's  narrow.  But  it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  a  violation  under  the  meaning  of  the  statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  I  think  it's  a  violation 

    

   

 

 

under  the  meaning  of  general  assault  and  battery,  but  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  think  that  there's  nothing  wrong  with  ­­ as  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan  suggested,  with  treating  that  type  of  offense  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disqualifying. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  you're  saying  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

example  is  covered  by  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Yes,  Your  Honor.

which  that  raises  a  concern  in  terms  of  overbreadth,  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  this  Court  should  be  concerned  about  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  what  Congress  was  worried  about  wasn't  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overbreadth  of  these  prosecutions  against  family 

 

 

 

 

 

members.  Instead,  they  went  to  a  real  underreporting, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

under  prosecution  and  the  low  conviction  rates  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses.  This  was  the  problem  that  Congress  addressed. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  whole  reason  why  they  extended  the  firearms  ban 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  felony  offenses  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Which  of  our  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  of  our  cases  say  that  you  don't  have  to  worry  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  categorical  approach  covers  conduct  of  the  sort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy  was  talking  about  because  Congress  meant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  cover  other  things? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that  you're  right  that  the  categorical  approach  and  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strictures  can  cause  real  problems  if  there's  any  degree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  overbreadth  in  the  statute.  But  that's  exactly  why, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  interpreting  Section  922(g)(9)  and  what  Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  was  is  extremely  important  here.  Because  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent  to  which  Petitioner's  view  is  adopted,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  require  only  intentional  conduct  to  qualify,  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

degree  of  overbreadth  such  as  Justice  Kennedy's  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  in  a  State,  of  California  of  a  driving  offense 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

would  exclude  the  entire  statute,  because  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  not  sure 

  

 

 

 

 

"overbreadth"  ­­ I'm  not  sure  overbreadth  is  the  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  term. 

 

            

So  you  think  it's  an  appropriate  defense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  a  prosecution  here  that  the  type  of  conduct  I  was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged  with  is  really  not  what  Congress  had  in  mind? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yes,  it  fits  under  the  terms  of  the  statute,  but  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  what  Congress  had  in  mind.  And  there's  going  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  about  that. 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  No,  Your  Honor.  The  ­­ my 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument  is  the  opposite,  which  is  that  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  effectuate  Congress's  purpose  by  giving 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  922(g)(9)  the  meaning  that  Congress  intended, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  to  cover  generally  applicable  assault  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battery  statutes  regardless  of  whether,  on  a  rare 

   

 

 

 

 

 

instance,  they  may  end  up  covering  an  individual  who  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recklessly  driving  and  injured  a  family  member. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  feel  like  your  answer 

    

 

 

 

 

was  that  the  statute  does  cover  it,  but  it's  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlikely  that  a  prosecutor  would  bring  such  a  case.  I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  that's  what  you  started  to  say  about  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

I  think  it's  unlikely  that  those  prosecutions  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  in  the  State  offense  on  those  ­­ under  those

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Do  we  have  precedent  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  saying  it's  okay,  we  can  trust  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutors  to  do  the  right  thing?  Can  you  cite  me  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  that  says  that? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  do 

   

   

   

  

 

 

not  ­­ I  do  not  represent  that.  But  what  I  do  suggest 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  what  we're  looking  at  here  is  not  what  prosecutors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  do  under  the  ­­ in  the  State  ­­ the  underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  prosecution,  but  what  Congress  intended  to  cover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Section  922(g)(9).  So  in  order  to  avoid  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  scenario  where  a  family  member  may  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

injured  in  a  nondomestic  context,  the  result  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

requiring  intentionality  as  to  both  the  harm  and  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  touching  would  be  to  eliminate  all  of  the  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress,  in  fact,  intended  to  cover. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  don't  know  how  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  about  the  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  ­­ the  rule  of  lenity?  We  are  reviewing  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  of  a  court  that  divided,  and  both  judges  wrote 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  strong  opinions.  And  we  also  have  18  U.S.C. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  16,  where  a  crime  of  violence  doesn't  include 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reckless  ­­ a  reckless  state  of  mind.  So  putting  those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

together,  the  other  statute,  plus  that  this  was  a  split 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  why  doesn't  the  rule  of  lenity  apply?

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Your  Honor,  the  rule  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

lenity  only  applies  where  there  is  grievous  ambiguity  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute.  And  I  respectfully  submit  that  there  is  no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  grievous  ambiguity.  Congress's  intent  was  clear, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  Court  already  found  as  much,  in  Castleman  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Hayes,  which  is  that  there  was  a  class  of  offenses 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  intended  to  cover  by  the  statute  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  generally  applicable  assault  and  battery  statutes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  rule  that  Petitioner  suggests  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclude  all  of  those  offenses  and  would  frustrate  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  purpose  of  Congress,  so  lenity  doesn't  apply  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  reason.  And  there's  no  ambiguity,  not  only  as  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  purpose,  but  as  to  ­­ as  to  what  battery  itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encompasses.  Petitioners  have  tried  to  argue  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

battery,  either  at  common  law  or  in  contemporary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice,  that  there  was  some  requirement  of  an  intent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  harm.  And  the  overwhelming  weight  and  universal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight  of  authority  points  the  opposite  direction.  Even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sources  cited  by  Petitioner  establish  that  at  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  there  was  no  requirement  for  the  intent  to  do  harm. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  certainly  States,  in  adopting  their  assault  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battery  provisions,  have  modeled  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formulation. 

            

Another  way  to  look  at  this  is  ­­ outside  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  common  law,  is  the  way  that  Taylor  examined  the

statute  of  burglary  under  the  ACCA  offense,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ rather  than  turning  just  to  the  common  law,  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  this  as  covering  generic  battery.  And  ­­ and  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  at  that  way  under  the  contemporary  practice,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Model  Penal  Code  and  the  uniform  opinion  of  the  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  appeals  and  commentators  all  have  concluded  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battery  was  not  limited  to  a  purpose  to  cause  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resulting  harm,  but  included  contact  that  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reckless. 

            

In  the  face  of  Petitioner's  hypotheticals, 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  struggles  to  even  conceive  of  a  hypothetical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

example  of  where  there  is  a  reckless  battery  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ against  a  family  member  that  would  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitute  a  misdemeanor  crime  of  domestic  violence. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The  converse  is  that  Congress  enacted 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  19  ­­ 922(g)(9)  to  address  a  vital  ­­ vital 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  safety  problem.  It  identified  those  who  had  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted  of  battering  their  family  members  as  posing  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dramatically  increased  risk  of  perpetrating  future  gun 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence  against  their  family. 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  should  continue  to  interpret 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  922(g)(9)  in  light  of  that  compelling  purpose. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions.

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Your  Honor,  the  right  is

a  First  Amendment  suspension  or  a  suspension  of  a  First

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Your  Honor,  it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

necessarily  permanent  as  to  the  individual,  but  it  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  permanent  as  to  a  particular  harm.  And  here  Congress 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  to  intervene  at  the  first  instance  that  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  is  convicted  of  battering  their  family

here,  which  was  the  prevention  of  gun  violence  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  nature  of  the  ­­ of  the  underlying  offense,

crimes  of  battery  to  future  gun  violence.  That  evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  extremely  strong.  And  Congress  recognized  that  this

Petitioners  are  good  examples  of  this.

While  they  didn't  reach,  thankfully,  the  point  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  able  to  reach  for  a  firearm  and  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibited  from  having  a  firearm  under  Federal  law,  they

violence  offenses  and  possess  the  firearms  in  close

convictions  and  are  suffering  from  that  ban. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress  also  contemplated  exactly  the 

 

 

 

 

lifetime  nature  of  the  ban  that  Your  Honor  suggested  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left  it  in  States'  hands  to  resolve  that  by  allowing

individual's  Second  Amendment  rights,  but  I  believe  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  identified  a  compelling  purpose  and  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

found  a  reasonable  means  of  achieving  that  purpose. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  ­­ I  suppose  one  answer 

    

   

 

 

 

is  ­­ just  a  partial  answer  to  Justice  Thomas's  question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  SORNA,  a  violation  of  sexual  offenders  have  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

register  before  they  can  travel  in  interstate  commerce. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  that's  not  a  prevention  from  traveling  at  all.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  ­­ it's  a  restriction. 

   

   

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Well,  Your  Honor,  it's  a

prevention  in  requiring  prophylactic  measures  in  order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  prevent  a  substantial  ­­ because  Congress  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

identified  a  substantial  risk  of  harm  from  people 

   

 

 

 

 

 

identified  as  committing  those  types  of  offenses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Do  it  ­­ what  is  it  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  ­­ they  raised  this  in  their  brief.  They  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  focus  on  the  cases  in  which  there  is  a  misdemeanor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battery  conducted  without  an  intentional  or  knowing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state  of  mind. 

 

 

            

Now,  they  say  if  this,  in  fact,  triggers  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  the  question  Justice  Thomas  asked  ­­ if  this,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  triggers  a  lifetime  ban  on  the  use  of  a  gun,  then 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  we  not  have  to  decide  something  we  haven't  decided? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  it  would  be  a  major  question. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

What  constitutes  a  reasonable  regulation  of 

   

 

 

 

guns  under  the  Second  Amendment  given  Heller  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  cases  with  which  I  disagreed?  But  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ the  point  is,  she's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

raised  a  question,  and  she  wants  us  to  answer  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  Is  this  a  reasonable  regulation  given  ­­ you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  heard  the  argument,  in  part  ­­ given  the  distance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  forth?  So  what  am  I  supposed  to  say,  in  your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion,  in  respect  to  that  rather  important  question?

that.  First  is  this  comes  up  only  in  the  nature  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  avoidance,  not  as  a  direct  Second 

   

 

 

 

 

Amendment  challenge. 

 

            

 

 

As  we've  already  argued,  this  statute,  in 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  view,  is  clear  that  misdemeanor  crimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  domestic  violence  include  batteries,  whether  they  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Stop  you  at  the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

point.  Your  argument  on  the  first  point  is  that  she  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  raise  the  constitutional  question.  She  said  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  to  avoid  a  constitutional  question,  we  should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decide  it  in  thus  such  and  such  a  way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  one  answer  would  be,  well,  maybe  so.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't  facing  the  constitutional  question.  We  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

simply  facing  the  question  of  what  Congress  intended. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  this  does  raise  a  constitutional  question,  so  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  And  then  there  will,  in  a  future  case,  come  up  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  question.  So  we  ­­ or  our  point  is,  we  don't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  decide  that  here. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  If  there  are  no  further

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  VIRGINIA  G.  VILLA 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS, 

 

 

 

 

                

APPOINTED  BY  THIS  COURT 

 

 

 

            

MS.  VILLA:  Your  Honor,  Congress  did  not  use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  word  "battery"  in  921(a)(33).  And  so  the  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  is  whether,  under  the  rule  of  lenity,  the  Court  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  say  battery  is  the  standard  that  we  are  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  in  order  to  construe  this.  And  it's  a  push  me,  pull 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  because  it  is  the  use  of  force,  but  that  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  be  a  prior  battery  conviction.  It  could  be  any 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanor  conviction  that  has  a  state  of  recklessness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  state  of  mind  and  results  in  any  ­­ any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involvement  of  a  domestic  partner. 

   

 

 

            

And  I  think  that  there  is  enough  play  within 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  ­­ statute  itself,  as  well  as  the  extent  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  common  law,  so  ­­ to  say  that  that  is  a  reason  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying  the  rule  of  lenity. 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  also  the  underlying  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

questions.  And  this  Court,  as  in  being  able  to  abrogate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  constitutional  right  indefinitely  based  on  reckless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct,  I  believe  also  presents  extreme  due  process 

   

 

 

 

 

 

concerns.  And  for  those  reasons,  I  believe  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court  should  conclude  that  under  these  circumstances,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  best  to  avoid  that  question  and  to  construe  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  the  way  that  is  consistent  with  the  words.
