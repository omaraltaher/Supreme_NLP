CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-1008, Shady Grove Orthopedic 

Associates v. Allstate Insurance. 

(10:58 a.m.) 

Mr. Nelson. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. NELSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Since the inception of the Rules Enabling 

Act, this Court has repeatedly held that within their 

scope of operation, rules promulgated under that Act 

govern the practice and procedure of Federal courts in 

diversity and Federal question cases alike. 

This case concerns whether a New York State 

law prohibiting New York State courts from certifying a 

class applies in a Federal diversity action and 

displaces the otherwise applicable Federal class 

certification standards set forth in Federal Rule of 

Civil Procedure 23. 

Whether the case is viewed as presenting a 

question under the Rules Enabling Act as construed in 

Hanna v. Plumer, or instead more generally as an Erie 

question, the answer is the same.  The State rule does

not govern.  That result is underscored by the Class 

Action Fairness Act, which extended Federal diversity 

jurisdiction to cases of this type precisely so that 

Federal procedural standards would apply.  In the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this is a procedural 

standard that has a manifestly substantive purpose, 

which is to restrict recoveries of penalties.  In that 

sense, it's like a cap on damages.  And if you're right, 

then the purpose that New York had would be completely 

undermined, because what lawyer would bring a $500 case 

in State court when she could bring a $5 million case in 

Federal court? 

MR. NELSON:  Well, to begin with, I –- I 

don't think that it's a substantive rule because it 

reflects a policy.  The policy here, as described by the 

New York Court of Appeals in the Sperry case, is that 

the -- the legislature believed that class actions were 

not necessary in this category of cases. 

I think that is ultimately a procedural 

policy.  It's not a limitation on --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They didn't want to have 

class actions. 

MR. NELSON:  They certainly did not want to 

have class actions, Justice Ginsburg. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And how is it different

from Cohen v. Beneficial, the security for costs? 

Procedural in one sense, but with a definite substantive 

purpose in mind; that is, to restrict derivative 

actions. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, the Cohen case I think is 

different in this respect, although when Cohen was 

decided shareholder derivative actions together with 

class actions were under Rule 23. 

Those things have now been divorced, and 

shareholder derivative actions differ from class actions 

in the Rule 23 sense in a fundamental way.  In Rule 23, 

the class is composed solely of individuals who each 

have a substantive right to pursue that recovery under 

the relevant law.  In a derivative action, the plaintiff 

is actually asserting a substantive right to -- to 

really assert a claim on behalf of someone else, the 

corporation. 

And what the Court said in Cohen and 

elaborated more in the Kamen case in 1991 is that that 

question is really a matter of the law of 

shareholder-corporate relations, the circumstances in 

which a shareholder may bring a derivative suit, and 

isn't really answered by the Federal rules.  And in 

Cohen in particular, what the Court focused on --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You could say just as

well here that the question isn't addressed by the 

Federal rules.  If New York wants to say this kind of 

claim can be brought only as an individual action, not 

as a class action, why shouldn't the Federal 

court say that's perfectly fine; this class of cases 

can't be brought as a class action; we respect the 

State's position on that.  Why should we as a Federal 

court in a diversity case create a claim that the –-

that the State never created? 

MR. NELSON:  Well, the reason is that Rule 

23 actually does address the issue, and it's the same 

issue that the -- that the State rule tries to address, 

which is whether the matters may be certified as a 

class. 

Not only does Rule 23(b) provide explicitly 

that the court may certify an action if the Rule 23(b) 

(1), (2), or (3) criteria are met, but this Court also 

emphasized in the Califano v. Yamasaki case that under 

Rule 1, the Federal rules apply to all actions in the 

Federal courts.  And what that means, as the Court put 

it in Yamasaki, is that a class action is available, 

potentially, if the 23 standards are satisfied, in any 

action within the Federal courts, unless Congress has 

exercised its power to override a Federal rule, which, 

as the author of Federal law, Congress is always

Official 

The difference as to -- as to the State is 

that the State has no power to displace Federal law, and 

Rule 23, promulgated under the Rules Enabling Act, is 

Federal law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This Court in its recent 

decisions has been sensitive to not overriding State 

limitations, and so has read the Federal rule to avoid 

the conflict. 

Gasperini is one such case with regard to 

Rule 59, interpreted so that you do not collide with the 

State policy, and the same thing with Semtek with Rule 

41(b).  The Federal rule is interpreted so as not to 

conflict with the State policy. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, I would -- I would 

actually first go back to what the Court said in Walker, 

and I don't think it's -- Walker v. Armco, and I don't 

think it's disavowed that that the Federal rule is given 

its plain meaning, and when a collision is unavoidable, 

the Court -- the Court recognizes conflict. 

Gasperini, I think, is -- is different, with 

due respect to someone who probably knows more about it 

than I do.  But as I read Gasperini at least, I see the 

Court there saying that what is going to be applied in 

the Federal court is what it saw as a substantive

standard limiting damages.  That is to say, damages are 

excessive if they are in excess of -- manifestly exceed 

what is –-

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there wasn't a cap on 

damages in Gasperini.  It wasn't a cap.  It was --

MR. NELSON:  It wasn't -- excuse me.  I'm 

sorry.  Go ahead. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was that we want the 

courts to exercise a role in checking these damages so 

they won't be excessive. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, the -- the Court in 

Gasperini said what it saw was a substantive principle 

of New York law, was that damages could not exceed 

reasonable compensation for the -- for the plaintiff's 

injuries.  Now, that -- that is not a cap in the sense 

of $1 million, $5 million, $50,000.  But it's a cap in 

the sense of providing the substantive standard by which 

the court determines excessiveness. 

And as for Rule 59, the reason the Court saw 

no conflict there is Rule 59 simply provides the 

procedural mechanism within which a defendant makes a 

motion to seek a new trial on the grounds of 

excessiveness of damages. 

But it -- but excessiveness of damages is, 

to go back to a point that was made in the previous

argument, like fairness.  Fairness in relation to what? 

Excessiveness of damages has to be judged according to 

what the State law is on what damages one is entitled to 

recover. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under -- under your 

theory, are all of the statutes set forth by the 

Respondents in their appendices invalid in Federal 

court? 

MR. NELSON:  No, Your Honor, certainly not. 

Especially given that their appendix -- half of it 

consists of Federal statutes, which of course are valid 

because Congress -- Congress can --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, not half. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, a significant number.  I 

-- I think it's -- it's a goodly number. 

Now, as to the State statutes, I think the 

State statutes are very different.  Some of them may or 

may not be valid, but they operate very differently from 

the State statute at issue here. 

They focus on particular rights of action. 

Some of them set forth limits on recovery that really 

are set forth as damages caps, and all of them are tied 

specifically to the substantive cause of action created 

by State law.

the New York legislature, instead of having a statute 

that covered penalties generally, minimum recoveries 

generally, wrote into each statute, each penalty 

statute, each minimal recovery statute, that this suit 

must -- may not be brought as a class action -- instead 

of having  an encompassing statute that covered all of 

them, wrote into each individual statute that 

limitation. 

MR. NELSON:  I would agree that that 

presents a very different question.  I’m not -- I’m 

still not certain that I -- that I think that the State 

court can do that, because I don't think that a 

limitation on whether an action can be brought as a 

class establishes substantive rights within the meaning 

of the Rules Enabling Act. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you -- are you telling 

me that even if New York had provided for a specific 

penalty for a specific matter, the Federal court could 

disregard that and make it a class action, even if the 

State that created the right said, this is a right for 

an individual only? 

MR. NELSON:  Well, I -- again, I think 

that's what the best answer to that question would be, 

because the -- the right in a class action is still an 

individual right; it's simply the -- the question is

simply whether multiple claims of multiple parties can 

be aggregated in a single action.  That doesn't expand 

the right that the -- that the State legislature has 

created for the individual. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you saying that even 

if it -- then you are telling me it doesn't make any 

difference whether they do it across the board, as they 

did here, or in each penalty statute it says no class 

action. 

MR. NELSON:  Again, what I'm saying is it 

certainly may make a difference in the sense that the 

Court doesn't have to go nearly that far to resolve this 

case. 

If that case were presented, I'm simply 

saying that -- that I still don't think that that 

necessarily establishes a substantive right within the 

meaning of the Rules Enabling Act. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, does it or not?  I 

mean, it presented you -- here's a case that says:  You 

can sue for this penalty but only in an individual 

action. 

MR. NELSON:  Yes.  As I've said, I think the 

best answer to that question is:  That does not 

establish a substantive right.  It establishes a 

procedural right with respect to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you are saying that 

even if New York didn't use this shorthand, even if they 

incorporated it into each penalty statute, your answer 

would be the same --

MR. NELSON:  Yes, my answer would be the 

same, but this -- the result here doesn't turn on that 

answer being correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry. 

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was you are entitled to 

$100 as a statutory penalty but only if it's an 

individual claim.  If you -- if this is brought as a 

class action, you don't get the statutory penalty.  I 

thought that was the substance of her question. 

Now, are you saying that also is merely 

procedural and -- and pre-empted by Rule 23? 

MR. NELSON:  I think -- I think it's 

procedural in the sense that it establishes -- if it 

establishes a right, the right it establishes is 

procedural and procedural rights don't override the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, you get $100 or 

you don't get $100.  How can you be any less substantive 

than getting the $100 or not getting the $100? 

MR. NELSON:  Whether you -- when – when 

what determines whether you get it is the form of the 

action that you have brought in a Federal court and

whether it has been brought aggregated with other --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then under your view, 

there is absolutely nothing, no law that the State could 

pass that would not conflict with Rule 23 --

MR. NELSON:  No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- as it -- as with 

respect to class actions? 

MR. NELSON:  I mean, one thing that the 

Court could do is that it could establish a cap that 

applied with respect to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You mean the State could 

do. 

MR. NELSON:  I'm sorry, yes.  I misspoke. 

The State could certainly establish a cap that applied 

whether an action was brought as a class action or an 

individual action.  In other words, for any related 

series of transactions, the overall damages to which 

this defendant can be subjected, whether in a 

multiplicity of individual actions or in a class action 

is X.  That, I think, would clearly be substantive. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it has to 

apply to individual actions as well? 

MR. NELSON:  I think -- I think if -- if the 

application of the -- of the statute depends on 

whether -- whether the action is brought as a Rule 23

action in Federal court or not, to me that's -- that is 

placing consequences on a procedural issue, and is not a 

matter of substance. 

But, again, I want to emphasize that this 

statute is very different from that.  This statute is a 

statute that is not even limited to rights of action 

under New York State law.  This is an action that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Have they applied it? 

If I recall your brief correctly, you say that the New 

York courts have applied it to causes of action arising 

under other State laws.  Is that right? 

MR. NELSON:  I -- I actually haven't found 

one that applies it to actions arising under other State 

laws.  I have -- I found actions that apply it to 

actions arising under Federal law.  And the principal one 

--

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There is no New York 

Court of Appeals decision to that effect? 

MR. NELSON:  That is correct.  They are 

rules -- there are decisions of the appellant division. 

But, as you know this Court very shortly after deciding 

Erie emphasized, holdings of intermediate State court of 

appeals are very persuasive data as to what State law 

is.

persuasiveness of the reasoning of the court. 

MR. NELSON:  Yes.  And in this case, the 

statute on its face uses the term "right of an action 

brought under a statute."  There is no suggestion in 

901(b) that it's limited to New York State statutes. 

The term "statute" in the -- in the Civil Practice Law 

and Rules is not confined to New York State statutes. 

Section 901 as a whole clearly is applicable 

to -- to rights of action brought under any source of 

law.  And the New York State courts in the -- the most 

applicable case, the Rudgayzer case, justified its 

application of the statute to a Federal right of action 

on the ground that this was merely an -- a -- a rule 

that governed local forms of -- of proceeding. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can’t a statute be both? 

Can a statute both establish a substantive limitation 

and also establish a rule of procedure for New York 

courts?  Why can't a statute say, New York courts will 

not entertain any action, including those arising under 

foreign law, that are class actions seeking penalties? 

And also, no New York State cause of action which seeks 

a penalty can be sued on in a -- in a collaborative 

action?  Couldn't you do both in the same? 

MR. NELSON:  Well, a statute certainly 

phrased that way could do both.  The question is when

the statute is not phrased that way, when it's phrased 

simply as a general procedural instruction as part of 

the general procedural --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you are begging the 

question.  It's a general instruction.  But can't --

can't the instruction be interpreted to be both? 

MR. NELSON:  Well, the -- the question I 

think is -- is what basis would there be for construing 

it to be both?  It -- it -- it's unitary in language --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because the statute may 

put forth both a substantive policy and a procedural 

policy.  I'll give you a concrete example. 

New York establishes a claim and says in the 

statute:  But this sort of claim has to be brought 

within 1 year.  Then New York gets a similar claim 

under another State's law, and it says, even though we 

applied our -- even though our statute applies to our 

own law in a substantive way -- that is, it says you 

have no action after a certain amount of time –- we 

don't want our courts to be cluttered with claims from 

out of State when we wouldn't entertain similar claims 

in our own State. 

That is certainly the way statutes of 

limitations have been interpreted by a number of States 

as having both a procedural aspect and a substantive

aspect. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, I -- I certainly agree 

that statutes of limitations are generally applied by 

State courts to foreign causes of action.  And that's 

because, I think, for choice of law purposes, they are 

considered and were traditionally considered to be 

procedural matters.  It's only with the advent of Erie 

that they were characterized as substantive matters for 

purposes of -- of the application of -- of the 

doctrine. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that is not 

altogether true, because there was always recognition 

that a so-called built-in statute of limitations was 

substantive. 

MR. NELSON:  If -- if the right of action 

itself is delimited, as opposed to a statute of 

limitation which, you know, cuts off your ability to 

sue but supposedly doesn't cut off the underlying 

right, yes, I think that's right.  But, again, that goes 

to -- to the fact that, you know, it does make a 

difference whether a legislature chooses to establish a 

rule as a general procedural matter or whether it makes 

it integral to the -- to the definition of the right. 

And as this Court said in the -- in the Byrd 

case, that when looking at -- at State law -- and there

the question was whether an issue was an issue for the 

jury.  But in determining whether it would be considered 

to be substantive or procedural, the question is whether 

it is so bound up with the definition of the rights and 

obligations under State law that it will be deemed to be 

part of the substance of the law or whether it simply 

relates to a mode of enforcing the right.  And -- and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought Byrd turned on 

the characteristics of a Federal court and that is the 

judge/jury relationship. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, Byrd -- Byrd turns in 

part on that, but it also turns on -- on the Court's 

view that -- that that issue, whether a case -- an issue 

is decided by -- by jury or judge, is -- is one that is 

not substantive under the Erie doctrine.  So -- so there 

are two aspects, I think, to what the Court is doing in 

Byrd.  But one of them --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it wouldn't matter 

what the answer to that was, with the Seventh Amendment 

looming over that case. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, you know, the Court 

didn't decide it as a Seventh Amendment issue, and --

and because that particular question, I think, was --

was a question that arose out of a State law 

administrative scheme, I think it's controversial

whether it -- whether the Seventh Amendment would apply, 

and the Court, I think, advisedly decided that as an 

Erie case rather than as a Seventh Amendment case. 

I want to also --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Can I ask you one brief 

hypothetical? 

MR. NELSON:  Sure. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Supposing this statute, 

instead of being as broad as it is, said any statute 

imposing penalties against insurance companies may not 

be brought as a class action, any claims brought under 

that statute? 

MR. NELSON:  Justice Stevens, I think the 

outcome there would more clearly be the same, because, 

again, it would not be -- it would not be part of the --

of the New York State law definition of the right to 

insurance --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I thought you said that if 

it puts a ceiling on it, that would be -- that would be 

substantive rather than procedural. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, if -- if -- if the Court 

put a ceiling on rights of action under its own law --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right. 

MR. NELSON: -- its own State laws, that I 

think becomes a substantive matter.  The statute that I

think you've -- you've hypothesized here is one that is 

based on the characteristics of the defendant regardless 

of the source of law under which it's being sued. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, you can make it a 

claim brought under the insurance code, instead of 

against insurance companies. 

MR. NELSON:  Yes.  Well, that then, I think, 

becomes very similar to the -- the hypothetical statutes 

that Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor were positing, and 

I acknowledge that that is -- that that is a much harder 

question. 

But, again, I think, ultimately, if the –-

if the issue addressed by the statute is, shall claims 

of individuals be aggregated and adjudicated as part of 

one unit, that is a substantive matter -- or a 

procedural matter and is governed in the Federal courts 

by a Federal procedural standard. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the basis 

for the restriction is the additional administrative 

costs of a class action?  In other words, it doesn't 

say you can't bring it, but it says any recovery shall 

be reduced by 10 percent because class actions cost more 

than individual actions? 

MR. NELSON:  Well, there -- that I think 

would be a statute that is serving a manifestly

procedural interest, and if the Federal courts have not 

chosen in their rules to impose an administrative charge 

on class actions, a State law that purported to do so 

would -- would not -- not have any application to 

Federal procedure. 

That -- that statute I think would be not 

only foreclosed in its operation by the Rules Enabling 

Act and Hanna v. Plumer, but would just be, on its face, 

something that, even leaving aside the Federal rules, 

would fall on the procedural side of the line in just 

classic Erie terms because the policies that it reflects 

are manifestly procedural. 

And I think, actually, the same is true 

here.  A statute --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How is it different from 

security for costs?  I mean, that's what I started with. 

That's -- there's nothing in the Federal rules that 

say security for costs. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, the -- the -- as I 

understand the Court's reasoning in Cohen, the security 

was -- was not just for the cost of the action, but for 

the plaintiff’s liability to the corporation that was 

created under State law in the case of an unsuccessful 

derivative action. 

And that liability was what the Court looked

at in Cohen as -- as making -- making the fundamental 

issue substantive, and the bond was sort of the -- you 

know, the tail on the dog, in the sense that the Court 

characterized it as substantive, having first 

characterized the damages remedy as substantive because 

without the bond, according to the majority, the remedy 

would be meaningless. 

I -- you know, the proposition was certainly 

debatable -- even Justice --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Without the bond, the 

remedy would be -- I don't -- this is a plaintiff 

that had to put up security for costs. 

MR. NELSON:  Right, and -- but -- but the 

remedy I'm referring to is the defendant's right to 

recover damages from the plaintiff under State law if a 

derivative action was unsuccessful.  And it was securing 

that remedy that the -- that the Court saw the bond to 

be critical to, which was not only why it -- it treated 

it as substantive, but also granted an interlocutory 

appeal because, if -- if the bond wasn't there, the 

right to recover from this plaintiff would be -- would 

be meaningless. 

That was -- that was, as I understand it, 

the Court's reasoning.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Landau. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. LANDAU:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

As some of Justice Ginsburg's initial 

questions point out, this case falls within the 

heartland of Erie because allowing plaintiffs to recover 

State law penalties in Federal court that they can't 

recover in State court on a State law cause of action 

would powerfully distort ex ante forum choices, which is 

precisely what the Erie doctrine seeks to avoid. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But isn't Rule 23 a 

judgment by Congress that class actions that meet the 

criteria of Rule 23 are fair and efficient, correct? 

That's Congress's judgment? 

MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Under your theory, any 

State could pass a law that says no cause of action 

under State law can be brought as a class action ever. 

That would be your theory because it's substantive, if 

it's an Erie choice.

Official 

MR. LANDAU:  Two points, Your Honor.  First, 

of course, Rule 23 is not enacted by Congress.  That's 

one of the important points here, that it comes out of 

this Court. 

It's delegated authority under the Rules 

Enabling Act to set forth these rules, so there is 

always a limitation on what a rule of procedure can do. 

That's why there is an advisory committee that sets it. 

It's not a statute, and there are -- there are 

restrictions on -- on the rules that don't apply to 

Congress. 

But going to the substance of your question, 

Your Honor, Rule 23 governs the criteria for when --

when you can have a class, but it doesn't address the 

underlying question, which is:  Can you have a class in 

the first place? 

Is there -- the legislature that creates the 

cause of action can say, this is categorically 

ineligible for class certification. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You haven't quite 

answered my question. 

MR. LANDAU:  I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Your State can come in 

and say, no State cause of action will ever be subject 

to class treatment.  And you would say there is no

conflict between that and Rule 23? 

MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor, if the State 

is talking about its own State law causes of action, the 

State is the master.  The State creates these causes of 

action in the first place.  If a State, like New York 

did here, says certain causes of action –-

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  No State cause of 

action can be brought as a class.  You're saying there 

is no conflict with Rule 23's judgment about efficiency 

of Federal court litigation? 

MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor, it could be, 

if a State said that no State cause of action could be 

brought as a class action, that that -- you have to look 

at what the State was doing in making that rule. 

If the State --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just what it's doing 

here.  There are some things -- we make a policy choice, 

the State, that, contrary to Rule 23, that there are 

some causes of action that are not fairly and 

efficiently brought as a class. 

That's what the State has said as a policy 

choice, correct? 

MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor, no, because 

the policy choice here is a substantive policy choice to 

limit penalties from being distorted in a class action

case. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's a policy choice. 

MR. LANDAU:  Well, if the -- if the State, 

Your Honor, makes a policy choice, it is a substantive 

policy choice, as I believe -- your hypothetical, at 

some points, was talking about what sounded like a 

substantive policy choice. 

If it makes a procedural policy choice, as, 

in a sense, Mississippi has done and Virginia, by simply 

not having class actions at all -- they don't have that 

-- well, then that doesn't raise an issue under the 

Rules of Decision Act because it's not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you have answered my 

question.  Under your view, a State could say, no class 

actions. 

MR. LANDAU:  A State --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And -- and a Federal 

court, sitting in diversity, could never aggregate those 

claims, those State law claims? 

MR. LANDAU:  For State law claims, yes.  If 

it makes a substantive decision that we want -- a State 

could abolish that cause of action altogether, Your 

Honor.  And I think the concern that Your Honor is 

expressing is somehow that Federal courts could be 

flooded with State law causes of action.  Well, that

won't happen because they would still have to meet 

Federal jurisdictional norms to get into Federal court. 

So you won't get small State law claims. 

You would still have to meet the requirements for 

Federal jurisdiction. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, do I –- do 

I understand your response to turn on -- let's say the 

State, for example, limits class actions because it 

doesn't want vast exposure under the penalty provisions 

that you could get in a class action.  It only wants to 

pay when they can be brought on an individual basis. 

But they may also limit class actions by saying, as 

Justice Sotomayor suggested, that they are not fair and 

efficient.  Do you get one result in the former case and 

a different result in the latter? 

MR. LANDAU:  Well, the Erie -- you could, 

Your Honor.  The answer -- the short answer is "yes", 

because the Erie cases have looked to the purpose. 

I think Justice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you -- how do 

you tell? 

MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor, it's not 

always easy. 

Erie cases, for that reason, are not 

always -- result in easy line-drawing.  Certainly, in

making the Erie choice, this Court has looked to the 

State's purpose. 

Here, in this case, it happens to be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose it's 

pertinent, then, whether they do it, as I think you 

were -- was discussed earlier, on an across-the-board 

basis or on an individual basis? 

MR. LANDAU:  I think that's something that 

one could look at, as part of determining how -- what is 

the design and operation in State court. 

And on that point, I'll say the other side 

does try to make it seem like it is absolutely 

dispositive that this is being applied more broadly than 

New York State law causes of action. 

There is two responses.  First, they really 

haven't proven that.  The only case they have that 

actually has applied it to anything other than a New 

York cause of action is the Rudgayzer case under the 

Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which is a very 

unique Federal statute that specifically incorporates 

State law.  It looks to State law.  And the Rudgayzer 

court didn't come in and say, this is broadly applicable 

to a Federal cause of action.  It relied on that very 

language. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, how can you say

that?  The case itself says:  We read the language of 

the statute; Congress didn't say this was to be a class 

action; we are not permitting it.  I understand the 

difference, and it could have argued or analyzed the 

case the way you said, but the appellate division there 

did exactly what your adversary said it did. 

MR. LANDAU:  We are -- we disagree –- I 

mean, what the court did in Rudgayzer -- they did not 

say, this applies  broadly to all New York -- to all 

Federal causes of  action.  It looked at the TCPA and 

said the TCPA is a special statute that refers to the 

law of the State.  It's an unusual statute.  So again, I 

think the Rudgayzer case, if you look at the analysis, 

it supports us. 

But even more broadly, Your Honor, I think 

the key point is what they are trying to get at somehow 

by -- by saying that this applies broadly is to say that 

New York would treat this as procedural.  And they are 

-- they are asking this Court essentially to speculate 

on that.  But there is no need to speculate because the 

New York Court of Appeals 2 years ago addressed this 

statute in quite some detail in the Sperry case, and the 

New York Court of Appeals actually went through why the 

statute was adopted, why 901(b) was adopted.  And the 

New York Court of Appeals specifically said it was a

response.  The word -- it said, you know, when -- when 

New York modernized its class action statute regime in 

1975, there was concern expressed among a lot of people 

that applying penalties on a class-wide basis, statutory 

penalties and minimum measures of recovery unrelated to 

any actual damages, would be distorted and there would 

be overdeterrence and overkill in the class action 

context. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose the reason --

suppose the reason that they did that -- suppose they 

are very honest about their reasons, and they say, we 

think class actions are very often a very good thing, 

because a lot of people who are hurt can get some 

recovery and it acts as a deterrent.  But there is some 

bad things about them.  And one of the bad things is, 

somebody files a lawsuit, and before you know it, the 

litigation expenses are so high that the company feels 

it has to settle.  Now, in our view that latter factor 

predominates.  And that means that these procedures, 

class actions, will sometimes -- too often -- lead to 

the unjust, inefficient settlement of disputes.  And 

that's why we are doing it. 

MR. LANDAU:  I think that's exactly what 

they did here, Your Honor.

exactly what we did, why isn't that second-guessing the 

judgment of the rule that they are saying it 

is efficient -- an inefficient procedure.  It is 

inefficient in terms of the object of -- of the Federal 

rules and what the class wanted.  We want efficient 

methods of achieving justice. 

MR. LANDAU:  I'm sorry, to the extent -- the 

hypothetical I thought you were saying, they were 

recognizing that it would be overdeterrence --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Overdeterrence because they 

feel that the class action procedure is one that leads 

to forcing companies to settle, and to that extent the 

class action procedure does not lead to the efficient 

determination of disputes but to the inefficient and 

unjust determination.  That's their honest reason. 

MR. LANDAU:  Right, Your Honor.  I think 

what -- what I hear them saying in your hypothetical is 

not really the operation of judicial process.  It 

doesn't go to the criteria. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it does.  It says 

it’s the judicial process that does it. 

MR. LANDAU:  Well, I think --

MR. LANDAU:  Right, but I think there they

JUSTICE BREYER:  That may be, and suppose 

they said, you know, a 30-day period for appeal creates 

unjust results in our opinion, and therefore we think it 

is more efficient to have a 90-day appeal period.  That 

wouldn't last for 2 seconds, wouldn't it? 

MR. LANDAU:  No, because then you would --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So how is this different? 

MR. LANDAU:  Because then you would have 

a clear Hanna problem, Your Honor.  I think -- let's go 

back to the threshold question.  They try to get around 

what is a clear forum distortion, a clear Erie problem 

by saying you don't even get to Erie because you have a 

threshold Hanna issue, which is Rule 23 answers this 

question. 

I didn't hear any real analysis from the 

other side of what is it in Rule 23 that actually says 

that you must be able to certify a class in every single 

cause of action that comes before you, even if the very 

legislature that created the cause of action says you 

may not have a class?

In fact, I think the Chief Justice earlier 

asked how this case differs from the statutes in 

appendices A and B.  And I think I really didn't really 

hear a very clear answer.  The statutes in Appendix A 

are all statutes where States and the Federal Government 

have put caps on the recovery in class actions.  That 

shows that you can have a substantive cap on what is a 

procedural device. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, well, let me be -- I 

just say I want -- I want to be sure I understood your 

answer to Justice Sotomayor.  Is it your position that, 

if we follow your view in this case, it would also be 

true that -- if New York had passed a statute saying no 

cause of action based on New York law may be maintained 

as a class action? 

MR. LANDAU:  Yes, Your Honor.  If New York 

did that -- I guess my answer is -- you really would 

have to look behind that.  If it simply said -- if 

Mississippi and Virginia codified their current 

nonexistence of -- nonauthorization of class actions 

under State law and affirmatively said that there may 

not be a class action --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  And that would -- that 

would apply not only to statutory causes of action but 

causes of action based on New York common law.

MR. LANDAU:  Right.  Under -- under New York 

law.  If they were making decisions, they having created 

these causes of action under their own State's law, if 

they think it would be overdeterrent to have these kinds 

of actions brought on a class-wide basis and they were 

really enacting this for purposes of limiting the 

remedies that were available for these causes of action 

that they created, I -- there would be a strong argument 

that that should apply under --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I guess --

MR. LANDAU:  -- under Erie. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But -- but 

wouldn't Justice Stevens's hypothetical suggest that 

they were less concerned about the impact of -- of the 

class action procedure than they were about its 

procedural efficiency?  In other words, I understand 

your position if you're saying, look, we've only got $20 

million in this fund to pay plaintiffs and we think it's 

better to go on an individual basis, because if it's a 

class action, you know, it would be over in one shot or 

whatever --

MR. LANDAU:  Right.

appropriate to say, we don't like the class action 

procedure as a general matter.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And in Justice 

Stevens's hypothetical, it applied across the board, 

which would cause me, anyway, to think it was the 

latter. 

MR. LANDAU:  I would agree with Your Honor. 

If you have an unadorned prohibition on class actions in 

the State -- from a State, I think the most natural 

understanding of that is that was their determination of 

how the procedures in their courts are going to work. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has to be one or the 

other, though.  You -- you -- is it your position that 

if this is substantive, as you contend, it cannot be 

procedural?  So New York State could not apply this --

this rule to out-of-State causes of action, and if it 

did, you -- you ought to have lost this case. 

MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor -- again, I 

think they can blend.  I think in Gasperini this Court 

pointed out that the -- the heightened standard of 

judicial review of damages awards had a manifestly -- it 

was a procedural command with a manifestly substantive 

purpose.  I think this case is not really dissimilar. 

Instead -- the cases in Appendix A say that in a 

class -- excuse me, the statutes say in a class action 

you may not recover more than X.  The only difference

here is it says, if you are seeking to recover more than 

X, you may not have a class action. 

And with respect to the statutes in Appendix 

B, those say there may not be a class action for 

particular causes of action.  I don’t --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  New York doesn't have --

as the -- the question that Justice Sotomayor asked and 

that Justice Stevens asked -- doesn't have any 

anti-class action as a procedural policy.  It has picked 

out a particular kind of action, one for a penalty, one 

where there’s -- what is it -- minimum recovery, and 

said that category, we have -- we're not anti-class 

action in general, but these penalties that we created, 

we don't want those brought as class actions. 

MR. LANDAU:  Precisely, Your Honor.  And I 

think that underscores is why this is substantive or the 

fact that this reflects a substantive policy decision. 

It is not about the efficiency or operation of the 

class action process itself, the judicial process.  This 

is a substantive decision to calibrate the remedy that 

New York has afforded under its own law, and a decision 

that when you have penalties that New York has decided 

-- and the Sperry case is very explicit on this -- that 

New York made a decision that the -- the appropriate 

level of enforcement for those was the level in an

individual action, and that when you got -- when you 

tried to make it into a class, that that would be 

overenforcement of those.  And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One -- one question that 

was raised by the other side is, well, if you're saying 

this kind of restriction -- restriction on class action 

-- applies in a diversity case, why not a State that 

says we love class actions and we want class actions to 

be -- not to be hemmed in by all of the Rule 23 

requirements? 

MR. LANDAU:  Then, Your Honor, you would 

have a Hanna issue because Rule 23 does set forth the 

criteria for a Federal court to certify a class. 

State law cannot change or water down those 

criteria or direct that you get to the goal line of a 

certified class by some mechanism other than the Rule 23 

criteria. 

Our position, Your Honor, our point is that 

you don't get to the Rule 23 criteria if the State law 

or the substantive law that creates the cause of action 

sends you off the highway before you get into the land 

of the criteria. 

If it just says, this is categorically 

unavailable as a class, as many States have, in fact, 

done in the statutes in Appendix B -- they have come up

with novel causes of action sometimes, abusive e-mail 

cause of action. 

And they said, well, we do not want a class 

action to be brought for this kind of claim.  That is a 

decision that reflects a substantive choice by the 

legislature that it would be overdeterrence and 

overenforcement to have this brought on a class-wide 

basis. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it -- it only 

reflects a substantive choice -- if it is a substantive 

choice.  If they say, we are not going to allow class 

actions because we think, procedurally, they are a bad 

idea because we think lawyers get too much recovery when 

they recover -- in other words, it -- your -- your 

position depends upon a characterization of the ban, and 

the restriction on class actions is either substantive 

or procedural. 

MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor, I think what 

you can -- you can assume that, if they are not changing 

their criteria and not changing the rules governing all 

class actions, but singling out particular causes of 

action or particular penalties, that it's done for a 

substantive reason. 

Here, in New York, we actually know that's 

true because the Sperry court says that.  And one, I

think, important point in 901(b) is the initial clause, 

the “unless” clause, that we have been focusing a lot on 

the last clause that says it may not be brought as a --

as a class action, if it's seeking a statutory penalty. 

But it says, "unless a statute creating or 

imposing a penalty or minimum measure of recovery 

specifically authorizes the recovery thereof in a class 

action." 

That's showing, that even though this is 

located in the CPLR, that it's really part and parcel of 

their statutory regime.  It's saying, this is our 

statutory default rule. 

To be sure, a New York statute can override 

that, but the idea that this is somehow simply 

procedural because it's in the CPLR is really belied by 

that language that -- that really shows that -- and, 

frankly, I think it also belies the fact that this 

applies to causes of action outside of New York because 

the “unless” clause really can only be understood as 

setting a default baseline for the New York legislature 

in enacting a statute, that they may want to 

specifically authorize class actions for penalties. 

So, again, I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me just be sure I am 

not lost on one point.  Does this just apply to

statutory cause of action created by New York law?  Or 

does it apply to a statutory cause of action created by 

New Mexico law? 

MR. LANDAU:  New York law, Your Honor. 

There's nothing --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  The language doesn't limit 

it that way, does it? 

MR. LANDAU:  You are right, Your Honor, but, 

again, you read language against certain background 

assumptions and norms that States when they’re --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, let me ask you this 

question:  Supposing it did apply to statutory cause of 

actions created by New Mexico law? 

MR. LANDAU:  You know, and the truth is, 

Your Honor, I think it still wouldn't matter at the end 

of the day.  I think, in Gasperini, the law -- the 

provision of the CPLR in Gasperini provided for 

heightened review. 

There was no indication that that applied 

only to New York causes of action.  Again, it may be one 

clue, but it's not dispositive. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it seems to me that 

your position basically is that New York can decide what 

kinds of cases shall be brought as class actions, 

period.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it could be -- it 

could be, as I -- the example of the statute of 

limitations.  We create a claim.  It has a certain life. 

It's dead after that time.  That's New York law. 

A sister State may say, we create the same 

claim, but we think it has a longer life.  New York 

would say, that's fine.  Bring that claim in your own 

State.  Don't clutter up our courts with out-of-State 

claims when we would not hear the identical claim under 

our own law. 

There are policies that do operate as 

procedural limitations and have a substantive thrust. 

MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  New York might well say, 

look, we don't hear in New York penalty cases, and so we 

are not going to entertain the sister State claim for 

any -- when we wouldn't entertain our own.  We are not 

frustrating the sister State.  They could bring the 

class action there, but not in -- not in our courts. 

MR. LANDAU:  And I think the point -- I 

agree 100 percent.  I think the point that you are --

that point underscores, Your Honor, is that, ultimately, 

the Erie issue is a Federal issue. 

You can look to New York to try to 

understand the design and operation of the State rule at

issue, but, ultimately, you are being asked, as a 

Federal court, to set the appropriate relationship 

between the State court system and the Federal court 

system. 

And, again, the lesson of Erie is you don't 

want to create incentives that will bring people like a 

magnet to Federal court and distort these ex ante 

foreign choices of litigants for State law claims. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, they -- they bring 

up the Class Action Fairness Act, which allows a 

plaintiff -- they allow a defendant to remove a 

class action from a State court to a Federal court, but 

they also allow a plaintiff to initiate an action in the 

Federal court. 

MR. LANDAU:  That's correct, Your Honor, but 

the Class Action Fairness Act, on its face -- and the 

legislative history actually makes this point explicit 

-- it had no intention to change the operation of the 

Erie doctrine in class actions. 

And so there is nothing in the Class Action 

Fairness Act that changes the scope of Rule 23.  Again, 

Rule 23 just doesn't address this antecedent issue.  It 

assumes, but does not require, that you have a cause of 

action that is amenable to class certification in the 

first place.

And if you were to construe Rule 23 

otherwise, as overriding this kind of statute -- all the 

statutes in Appendix B, that would be a truly remarkably 

substantive interpretation that this Court has always 

stressed, that it must, in construing the rules, be 

careful not to tread into that territory and has 

construed the rules with an eye towards the limitations 

of the Rules Enabling Act. 

The other side -- Shady Grove would walk you 

right into an extremely problematic situation from the 

point of view of the Rules Enabling Act, as well as 

creating these -- these incentives that really go 

against the heart of the Erie doctrine that would turn a 

$500 case into a $5 million case. 

And one interesting point, I think, is that 

all these statutes that are listed in our Appendix B 

that limit class certification for particular causes of 

action -- under their theory that Rule 23 requires that 

everything be amenable to class certification, those 

would all be out the window. 

I don't think counsel really wanted to admit 

that this morning, but the logic of their theory that –-

is that Rule 23 governs this case and Rule 23 requires 

that every cause of action that comes before it be 

eligible for class certification.

That would knock out each and every one of 

the statutes in Appendix B.  They don't live up to -- in 

their reply brief, at footnote 10, on page 15, they try 

to distinguish those statutes by saying, ah, well, the 

limitation on class actions in those statutes is in the 

substantive cause of action. 

It's not in -- it's not somewhere else in 

the code, but that doesn't -- that doesn't save their 

argument under Rule 23.  They really can't square that 

with their -- their core position that Rule 23 itself 

answers the question presented in this case. 

And, again, what we would ask the Court is 

just to -- is to recognize that Rule 23 occupies the 

ground it occupies, but it doesn't go -- it occupies the 

ground of the criteria, which go to the efficiency and 

fairness of the process. 

But where a State has made an antecedent 

decision that -- that a particular cause of action or 

a particular remedy is categorically unavailable -- or 

ineligible for class certification, that's a decision 

that Federal courts should respect under the Erie 

doctrine. 

If there are no further questions, I see my 

time is about to expire.

MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Nelson, you have

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. NELSON:  Thank you. 

I would like to begin with the point that my 

friend made about the "unless" clause in 901(b) and that 

that somehow indicated that it applied only to New York 

State statutes.  In fact, the New York courts have 

applied that "unless" clause to Federal statutes, 

holding in one case that the Truth in Lending Act 

satisfied the "unless" clause because it authorized a 

class action, and in another that the Telephone Consumer 

Protection Act did not because it didn't authorize a 

class action. 

So it actually is, I think, quite clear from 

the language of the statute and from the Court's 

application --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There -- when you are 

dealing with a Federal statute, there’s a -- there’s a 

factor that doesn't come up when you are dealing with 

sister States, and that is the Supremacy Clause. 

If Congress has made a judgment -- let's say

1983 -- I don't think the State that says, for our 

comparable claims, we don't allow class action could --

could apply that --

MR. NELSON:  I think that's right.  If 

Congress had provided that a class action was authorized 

in any court under a statute, New York couldn't prevent 

it. 

But my point here is that the "unless" 

clause is simply consistent with the rest of the 

statute, which makes clear that it applies to statutes 

from any source. 

And that means that far from being in the 

heartland of Erie, this is far outside the heartland of 

Erie.  It's a case where the State court for procedural 

-- or the State's legislature, for procedural reasons, a 

balancing of the fairness and efficiency, the –- of 

class actions and those things that must -- that are 

requisite to the just, speedy, and efficient --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I can't see how that's so 

when they limit just a particular remedy or penalty.  If 

they were saying, well, across the board we don't want 

class actions, I could follow your argument much better. 

But when New York singles out penalties, it seems to be 

talking not about the efficiency and fairness of 

proceedings, but that it doesn't want penalty claims to

be magnified. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, but that's an aspect of 

-- of the fairness and efficiency of proceedings. 

Remember, of course, these are not claims for which the 

plaintiffs can't recover in State court.  They are 

simply claims that they have to proceed individually in 

State court to pursue. 

And the further point I would make is that 

the judgment that the -- that the New York legislature 

makes, that statutory penalties under any set of 

statutes are not appropriate for class treatment, is 

really contrary to the decision that the rules drafters 

of Rule 23 have made, which actually specifies the 

circumstances under which classes can be certified 

exactly by reference to the type of relief sought. 

So it's a case where the rule and the State 

statute really do cover the same ground, to use the 

approach this Court took in the Burlington case, where 

it said that a State statute would not be given 

effect when the Federal rule occupies the territory. 

And that's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it didn't say that 

about Rule 59, and it didn't say that about Rule 41(b). 

MR. NELSON:  And -- and Rule 59 doesn't 

occupy the territory of the standard to be applied, and

Rule 41(b) as construed in Semtek just does not address 

preclusive effect. 

And finally, again, on the issue of ex ante 

forum choice, Congress, in the Class Action Fairness 

Act, provided jurisdiction so that Federal procedural 

rules would apply.  If, as my friend argues, whether or 

not a case can proceed as a class action is a matter of 

substantive right, that principle can't be cabined to 

cases where the substantive -- or where the State 

standard precludes class actions. 

If a class action, yes or no, is a matter of 

substantive right, that applies equally to State 

standards that -- that would promote class actions, and 

therefore, even though as -- as my friend says, it would 

be a Hanna issue, there would be an abridgement of a 

substantive right.  So -- I see that my time is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish your 

thought, if you like. 

MR. NELSON:  Well, the thought is that 

that's an indication that amenability to class actions 

should be treated both for plaintiffs and for defendants 

as a matter of procedural right governed by the Federal 

rules.  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
