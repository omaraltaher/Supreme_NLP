 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 
argument next in Case 08-88, Vermont v. Brillon.

 Ms. Rainville.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA RAINVILLE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. RAINVILLE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 There are many reasons to reverse the 

Vermont Supreme Court in this case.  I am going to begin 
by addressing four reasons as a matter of law that do 
not require the Court to -- to review the record.  The 
first is, even if we assume that the public defender is 
an assigned counsel -- and for the purposes of argument, 
I am just going to use the term "public defender."  If 
we assume that public defenders do little or nothing in 
a case, one cannot have a rule that that time is 
chargeable under the speedy trial right to the State 
because to do so creates chaos of constitutional 
proportions in the criminal justice system.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I ask you a question 

that goes at least to one possible application of -- of 
your argument?  Your argument for the State, the 
position that you just took, would -- would apply to the

period of time, as I understand it, in which the 
individual named, the defender named Sleigh, had been 
appointed to -- to represent the defendant.

 And as I understand it, when this case was 

argued in the Supreme Court of Vermont, the State 
conceded that, in fact, some prejudice should be 
attributed and it should be held against the State that 
Sleigh in effect did nothing.  They said, well, don't 
hold it against us quite as much as you might, but, in 
any case, that can be held against us.

 Here you don't take that position, and I --
I don't know whether it's open to you -- it seems to me 
that it's not open to you -- to take a different 
position with respect to Sleigh here than the Attorney 
General of Vermont did when it was before the Supreme 
Court of Vermont.  And I -- I have to assume that you 
just see it differently from the way the Attorney 
General did.  But would -- would you comment on -- on 
the position that the State took and tell me why you can 
take a different position here?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.  The 
State did take the position that the eight-month period, 
which included the four months where Attorney Sleigh was 
involved, was a neutral factor.  And under the dicta in 
Barker, that would allow the Court to apply it against

the State, although not to weigh it heavily as a -- as a 
neutral factor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.
 MS. RAINVILLE:  That was dicta in Barker, 
but controlling to the Vermont Supreme Court.  Before 
this Court, however, on these facts --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it was conceded, wasn't 

it, in the -- in the Vermont Supreme Court?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  It was conceded that it was 

a neutral time period.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.
 MS. RAINVILLE:  And -- and --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, then, why isn't that 

concession binding here?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  I think it -- it may be 
binding if the Court determines it's binding.  But I 
don't think it should be binding because this Court is 
considering policy that's going to affect all States and 
all courts.  And the issue that was raised by the 
National Governors Association, for example, as to 
whether public defenders can be State actors -- and the 
law is clear that they cannot -- that's an important 
issue.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it is, but that is 
not an issue that is necessarily implied by the -- by

the concession that the Attorney General made in the 
Vermont Supreme Court.

 MS. RAINVILLE:  Yes.  Yes, but also if you 
look at the record, the three years of delay, the time 
period involving Mr. Sleigh is approximately four 
months.  If you take all four months where he was 
appointed by the docket or two months if you take the 
time where he thought and understood that he was on the 
case, and in light of the three-year delay, that amount 
of time is really inconsequential.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It may have been a 

good concession below.  I mean, it would -- as I 
understand it, the problem arose because of change in 
the contract, right?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  That's correct.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, that may 

well have been attributable to the State.

 MS. RAINVILLE:  It -- it may well have been 
attributable to the defender general.  And that's one of 
the problems in this case is that we don't have a record 
of why different attorneys -- Attorney No. 4, Donaldson, 
and Attorney No. 5, Sleigh, were never asked what they 
did or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose you are 
willing to concede that there are situations where the

delay would be attributable to the State because of 
systemic problems?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The State has so 
many cases, and it's only willing to hire one lawyer. 
That lawyer can't possibly handle all the cases.

 MS. RAINVILLE:  Absolutely.  But that's not 

the case here.  That might be the situation if, for 
example, the defender general said to every defendant: 
If you want a trial with a lawyer, you have to wait a 
year.  That's not what happened here.

 What happened here is the defender general 
was incredibly diligent.  He appointed new counsel five 
times the same day.  The day of the arraignment Mr. 
Ammons was appointed.  The day Mr. Ammons withdrew, 
replacement counsel, Mr. Harnett, was appointed.  The 
day Mr. Harnett withdrew, replacement counsel was 
appointed.  The day Mr. Donaldson withdrew, the docket 
shows that Sleigh was appointed.  Five times the same 
day the defender general appointed counsel.

 The sixth time, given that we are in 

Vermont, a very small State with few lawyers, he had 
difficulty finding a sixth lawyer.  But the defender 
general took extraordinary measures and went to the 
Vermont Legislature and obtained funding, and the

legislature came up to the plate very quickly, in a 
matter of weeks.

 The last withdrawal of Lawyer No. 5 happens 
on April 10th.  It's June 20th that there is the letter 
in the appendix from the defender general saying that 
the legislature has approved new funding.  It's -- it's 
literally a matter of weeks before the legislature comes 
to the plate and provides additional funding.

 So to the extent that -- that that is State 

action, the defender general has been incredibly 
expeditious, incredibly diligent, and went to the 
extraordinary length of getting additional funding for 
the sixth lawyer.  We -- we would concede --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess when -- when the 
last two lawyers withdrew because their contracts had 
expired, I suppose the court could have refused to 
permit them to withdraw, couldn't it?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  It could have.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Couldn't it say you -- you 
have an ethical duty; having undertaken representation, 
and it being very difficult to get anybody else, you --
you stay in the case?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  The -- the court could have, 

and certainly --

State's court -- not the State's fault no matter what? 
Is -- is the court's misfeasance the State's 
misfeasance?  Do you attribute that to the State?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  The court's misfeasance 

would -- would certainly be attributable to the State, 
but we would argue that it would be a neutral factor. 
But here, Your Honor, Brillon would -- in terms of the 
fourth lawyer, Mr. Donaldson, he sought to have him 
fired.  And, in fact, it was his letter to the court and 
then a subsequent motion to the court to have that 
lawyer dismissed.  And in that colloquy when the -- when 
the -- the trial judge asked Brillon, do you want to 
have -- do you still want to have him fired despite all 
this delay and everything, and Brillon says yes, clearly 
the court with regard to Donaldson could have said to 
Donaldson, you stay on this case and get this case to 
trial.  But Brillon waived that.  Brillon said that he 
wanted a new lawyer.

 With regard to Sleigh --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- with that particular 
period.  The trouble that I have with that particular 
period is August 1, 2003, to June 14, 2004, isn't that 
right?  That is Donaldson -- or that's Moore?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  That's Moore.

the first one?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  Donaldson was actually 

Lawyer No. 4.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Go ahead.
 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Before you start, let me 

just make a comment and a -- and a question based on it. 
The comment is I -- I'm willing to accept a lot of what 
you say here, there is plenty of blame to go around. 
But you accept, as I understand it, the proposition that 
the State has simply got an affirmative duty to make 
some kind of effective trial and representation 
arrangement.  It -- it -- it has that duty through 
providing the public defender, it has that duty simply 
through providing a court that will keep things moving, 
and I think that's common ground.

 If that, as it seems to be, is common 

ground, then do we have anything before us in this case, 
except sort of going through the list of counsel, the 
list of reasons, the list of delays and reviewing the 
Vermont Supreme Court on, in effect, the details that it 
assumed in applying the rule?  In other words, it seems 
to me that there isn't an issue of principle dividing 
the parties here, it's a series of issues of details. 
Is that an unfair way to look at the case as we've got

it?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  You can certainly look at it 

in terms of details, and I think that the Vermont 
Supreme Court's findings are unsupported by the record. 
But as a matter of law, you have delays by State actors, 
and even if you take the two or the four months for 
Sleigh aside, the rest of the delay, three years of 
delay minus -- there's four months, of course, which he 
had no counsel -- but three years minus that time, is 
all caused by non-State actors.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yeah, but if you take 

Sleigh, Donaldson, and the period in which there was 
no -- I guess, following Sleigh, in which there was no 
counsel appointed at all, you're already up to just 
about a year.  And a year is -- is enough to trigger 
Neil v. Biggers.  And so, it seems to me that what --
what the fight, what the serious fight is about is, 
well, within the further total of two-year period, who 
is to blame for this, who was to blame to that, and 
I'm -- I'm not sure that it's of any value to just go 
through and second-guess the Supreme Court of Vermont on 
those details, because you've got enough in Neil v. 
Biggers before you even get to those details.

 MS. RAINVILLE:  Well, also in terms of just 

based on Brillon's admission, there's enough for this

Court to decide the case.  He admits that he fired three 
different lawyers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't there -- isn't there 

that very important principle involved here that doesn't 
simply involve calculating particular periods of delay? 
When you have a defendant who starts out by firing a 
lawyer and engineering the withdrawal of another lawyer 
by threatening a lawyer, is it appropriate then to go 
through all of the subsequent periods and attribute the 
delay to the defendant or to the prosecution or as a 
neutral factor as if those, the initial events, hadn't 
occurred?

 We don't know how quickly this case would 

have gone to trial if the first lawyer hadn't been fired 
or if the third lawyer, I guess it was, had not been 
threatened and forced to withdraw.

 MS. RAINVILLE:  I believe you're absolutely 
right, Justice Alito.  In this case his conduct was so 
unconscionable in threatening both his lawyer, and the 
facts there --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I really wanted to ask you 

pretty much exactly the same question.  If we assume 
exactly the terrible way he fired the first two -- the 
first lawyer certainly, maybe the second, would it be

true that no matter how long the delay occurred after 
that, he could never get Sixth Amendment relief?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  I would -- I wouldn't go 

that far, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why not?
 MS. RAINVILLE:  Because what if the State 
kept him for ten years without a trial?  I don't think 
that would ever happen.  Certainly on these facts 
there's no basis, given his conduct, to balance anything 
in his favor.  Vermont's --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there -- as I 

understand it, that that first year the Vermont Supreme 
Court agrees with you.

 MS. RAINVILLE:  That's right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  They said, we're not 

counting any of that against you.

 Now we go into the second year, and the 

second year had to do with Mr. Donaldson, a lot of it. 
And it turns out that Mr. Donaldson actually had left 
the office within a few days of his having been 
appointed to do this and then he never did anything.  So 
the Supreme Court of Vermont says, as far as Mr. 
Donaldson is concerned, we do hold that against the 
State for the reason that it is the equivalent of not 
giving him anybody.  The guy they gave him wasn't even a

public defender, he never did a thing.  All right.

 Now we go to the third group.  The third 

group, the State agreed they should be charged.  That's 
Mr. Sleigh.  The third one they agreed with it.  They 
said lightly, but they agreed with it.

 And as to the final group, Mrs. Moore, well, 
it looks like from the record as if the reason that was 
held against the State had nothing to do with her 
performance.  It had to do with the fact that the State 
didn't give certain records to her, which everybody 
would agree, if it's true, should be chargeable to the 
prosecution, which is the State.

 So we have four periods.  In one of them you 

won; in the second one he had no lawyer at all, 
according to the court; in the third one you agree it 
should be chargeable to you; and in the fourth one it 
has to do possibly with prosecution errors, not defense 
errors.

 Now, what are we supposed to decide?  Are we 

supposed to decide whether my statement is, in fact, a 
correct statement?  If so, why isn't it?  I guess we 
have to read the record.  But what else is there to 
decide?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  I think you can decide it 

without reviewing the record, based on the fact that you

have a defendant who fired his first lawyer six months 
into the case, one day before trial.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And you won that.
 MS. RAINVILLE:  And then filed -- fired a 

second lawyer when the lawyer initially argued and said, 
no, no, it's not true, I've been working; he then 
threatened to kill the lawyer.  Then he at that time was 
told:  If you want a new lawyer, there's going to be 
inevitable delays.  He said:  That's okay, I still want 
to fire this lawyer.  Then he went on and fired yet 
another lawyer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose -- I'm not 
sure that we necessarily want to get into the particular 
details of a very complicated record, but there are 
several points in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion 
where it says that the failure of assigned lawyers to do 
anything to move the case forward is attributable to the 
State.  And I thought the fundamental principle we were 
debating is whether or not assigned lawyers who fail to 
move a case forward, whether that is attributable to the 
defendant or whether it is attributable to the State 
because they happen to work for the State.

 And I would assume one way to dispose of the 

case would be to decide that general question and send 
it back for the Vermont Supreme Court with that guidance

that they were wrong, as a general matter, to assign 
delay caused by the counsel to the State, to sort 
through the record themselves.

 MS. RAINVILLE:  And I think that's a very 

important point, Mr. Chief Justice.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that point in the case? 
Where -- where is that in this case?  I don't know who 
-- I didn't see anywhere where the Vermont Supreme Court 
said anything, said that, except in the instance where 
you agreed with them.

 Where is it in their -- where is it -- who 
are they are referring to when they said that?  Is that 
Donaldson?  Because I thought the claim with Donaldson 
was it -- it was not his attribution, nothing he did was 
attributed.  Rather, it was the State's failure to 
appoint anyone, because to appoint Donaldson was to 
appoint no one since he had left the office and since he 
did nothing.

 Now, is that what we're supposed to decide: 
When a State appoints a person who has already left the 
office and does nothing, under those circumstances is it 
correct to attribute to the State their failure to 
appoint anybody?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  Well, first let me address 

this point of two lawyers who did little or nothing.  In

Strickland v. Washington, this Court said how extremely 
important it is when determining ineffective assistance 
to have a strong presumption that counsel's conduct 
falls within the wide range of reasonable professional 
assistance, and that there should be a hearing to ask 
counsel what they did.

 Here the Vermont Supreme Court makes this 

ruling without anyone at any point ever asking Mr. 
Donaldson or Mr. Sleigh what they did.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Rainville, underneath 
or between the lines there seems to be great discontent 
on the part of the Vermont Supreme Court with the way 
the public defender system is operating.  And if we hold 
for you as a matter of the federal speedy trial right, 
the Vermont Supreme Court could go back and decide just 
the same thing under the Vermont Constitution, couldn't 
it?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  It could except for that we 
believe that this decision creates an unconstitutional 
situation in creating two different classes of 
defendant, indigent and non-indigent, in their speedy 
trial rights, such that henceforth the prosecution and 
the courts must treat every indigent defendant 
differently merely because they're indigent when they 
ask for a continuance or when they ask for change of

counsel.  We have to oppose those.  So that we make the 
unpleasant choice of the constitutional due process 
violation, that we would rather push a defendant who's 
indigent to trial before his counsel's ready, because 
the constitutional violation there is only one of due 
process and he'll get a new trial, versus agreeing to 
allow their counsel to have time to prepare, in which 
case we risk a speedy trial violation, where he will be 
able to walk free despite his guilt.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Rainville, you -- you 

began your presentation with a statement that gave me so 
much hope.  You said you were going to give us three 
reasons why we wouldn't have to get into the hairy facts 
of the case and could decide it on -- on issues of law. 
Okay?  You only mentioned the first.  What are the other 
two?

 MS. RAINVILLE:  The second is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Remind us of the first.
 MS. RAINVILLE:  The first is that this 

creates an unconstitutional situation where there are 
two classes of defendants treated differently by the 
State and by the courts.

 The second is that the delays in this case 
were caused by non-State actors and as a matter of law 
under Polk County cannot be a constitutional violation.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that sort of gets us 
into the facts at some point.  I mean, that does get us 
into the facts.

 What's the third?
 MS. RAINVILLE:  The third is that, based on 

his concessions, his admissions in the brief, he's 
waived it; and that's under Barker v. Wingo where the 
Court talks about standard waiver doctrine applies in 
speedy trial.

 And the fourth is that under the balancing 
test based solely on his admissions, his conduct ought 
to weigh like a ton of bricks against whatever happened 
with the State.

 and I'll reserve the rest of my time if I 

might for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 We'll hear from Ms. Kruger first.
 MR. NELSON:  Oh, excuse me.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Kruger.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MS. KRUGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

19

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

If you look on pages 27 through 28 of the 
Vermont Supreme Court's opinion, it is clear that the 
Vermont Supreme Court decided this case on the basis of 
a single principle that it applied to the entirety of 
the final two years of the pretrial delay in this case, 
and that is, as the Chief Justice has noted, that the 
failure of defendant's series of assigned counsel to 
move his case to trial should be attributable to the 
State.

 As the question comes before the Court 

today, I think the primary point of dispute is whether 
there should be an exception to the general rule that a 
defendant is responsible for his own lawyer's delays in 
situations in which the lawyer purportedly does little 
or nothing to move the case to trial; and for four 
reasons we think that the Court should decline to create 
a kind of attorney inaction exception to the general 
rule.

 First of all, we think that such a rule 

would be inconsistent with the role of a lawyer in an 
adversarial system and would undermine a lawyer's 
authority to make day-to-day decisions about the 
scheduling of pretrial proceedings.

 Second, we think that such a rule would be 

enormously difficult for courts to administer in

practice, because attorney inaction is generally 
difficult to discern in the midst of pretrial 
proceedings and the risk of error would be to deprive 
the defendant of the time that his lawyer may genuinely 
need in order to prepare an effective defense.

 The third reason is that it would create 

opportunities for gamesmanship; it would create 
incentives for defendants to use the services of their 
lawyer so long as it suits them, but then to complain 
later that the lawyer was inactive and therefore they 
should not be held responsible for the lawyer's delay. 
And as to the lawyers themselves, it would create an 
incentive to unreasonably delay, with the comfort of 
knowing that the worst that would happen is the best 
possible outcome for their client, which is the 
dismissal of charges with prejudice.

 And finally, we think that such a rule would 

create an unjustifiable distinction between the 
treatments of appointed counsel and retained counsel in 
our system.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  With respect to that last 
point, let me ask you this question.  Let's assume we --
we have paid counsel in a criminal case and, as a result 
of -- of delays by the prosecution, but primarily as a 
result of requests for continuance after continuance

after continuance, the -- the case is not tried; it's a 
simple case and it's not tried for three years.

 Is -- is it open to a reviewing court on 

constitutional grounds to say that the State has got an 
affirmative obligation, a non-delegable obligation, to 
bring cases to trial in a reasonable time?  And whether 
the reason for the failure in this three-year case is 
because counsel just kept trying to -- to shove it off, 
or the courts were not diligent in scheduling it for 
trial, at some point that non-delegable obligation has 
been violated.  Is -- is that a -- a possible 
constitutionally based position?

 MS. KRUGER:  I think that Barker makes clear 
that defendants can waive their right to a speedy trial 
and that indeed defendants will often desire to put off 
trial as long as possible.  I think that in giving 
proper consideration to the Barker Court's explanation 
of the nature and purposes of the right, and in 
particular focusing on the fact that the only possible 
remedy for the speedy trial violation is a remedy that 
uniquely advantages defendants and poses substantial 
burdens on society, we think ultimately a defendant 
can't escape responsibility for continuances that he has 
requested through or without the assistance of counsel, 
simply by blaming the prosecution for failing to object

or by blaming the courts for failing to go along.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, what if the -- what 
if we change the facts slightly.  What if the defendant 
himself never says anything on the record?  The only 
thing we've got on the record are repeated requests by 
paid counsel for continuances, and then after three 
years the defendant fires paid counsel and says:  I've 
been sitting in jail for three years awaiting trial, and 
I shouldn't have to wait that long.  The State has 
failed in its non-delegable duty.  Would your answer 
still be the same?

 MS. KRUGER:  It would still be the same.  We 
think that fundamentally the principal safeguard against 
that kind of unreasonable attorney-caused delay is the 
attorney's ethical obligation, which creates a duty in 
the attorney to represent his clients with reasonable 
diligence and promptness.  We think that a rule that 
would require --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Lots -- lots of very 

effective criminal trial lawyers believe that the first 
tactic is delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.

 MS. KRUGER:  And I think it's precisely for 

that reason, because a delay may ultimately be in the 
client's interest, that this Court should decline to 
fashion a rule that makes the exercise of the remedy,

which is again an extreme remedy that advantages the 
defendant alone, exercisable at the option solely of the 
defendant.

 We think for that reason the defendant 

necessarily has to be responsible for any delays that 
are caused either by him or by the person who is 
appointed to represent him.  Again, the ethical duty of 
the lawyer is to zealously advocate on behalf of the 
defendant's interests, and if the defendant desires to 
go to trial as quickly as possible, it's still the 
lawyer's duty under the ethical rules to try to 
accommodate that request, while at the same time doing 
everything he can to prepare an effective defense.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask you this 

question about your reliance on pages 27 and 28.  If you 
describe it as delays by the lawyers themselves, I 
understand your comment as being right on the nose.  But 
I understood part of that to be talking about the 
situation in which the defender general's office has not 
performed its duty with sufficient promptness.

 And would you not agree if there were a 

period, say, of seven or eight months in which they just 
didn't get around to appointing a lawyer, that that 
should be charged against the State?

 MS. KRUGER:  We would agree, Justice

Stevens.  In this case there were a period of a total of 
about six months during which the Respondent was not 
represented at all, and we think in view of the State's 
ultimate responsibility for providing counsel to 
indigent defendants, when the State doesn't comply in a 
timely fashion with that duty, that delay is properly 
attributable to the State.

 Although in this case, because the delay was 

not the product of a deliberate effort to hamper the 
defense, we think that that period should weigh only 
lightly against the State; and ultimately, given the 
other factors at issue in this case, the absence of any 
actual trial prejudice in particular, we think that 
ultimately those six months are insufficient to 
establish a speedy trial violation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Isn't the prejudice factor 

pretty much established as long as the guy has to stay 
in jail during this entire period?

 MS. KRUGER:  I think that that's certainly 

one form of prejudice, but in the Barker balancing -- in 
Barker itself, for example, the defendant was 
incarcerated for ten months during the pretrial 
proceedings, and the Court nevertheless found that there 
was no speedy trial violation.  We think a similar 
principle applies in this case.  Although incarceration

is obviously prejudicial to defendants, in this case 
there was no prejudice above and beyond that.  The 
Vermont Supreme Court was clear in finding the absence 
of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did he get to offset it 

against the time for the pretrial incarceration?

 MS. KRUGER:  I am not aware that he did, but 
this Court made clear in Strunk that getting credit for 
time served is not an appropriate remedy for a speedy 
trial violation, that the only possible remedy is again 
what the Vermont Supreme Court did, erroneously in our 
view, which is to dismiss the charges without 
possibility of reindictment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What would you think of a 
rule that said where most of the delay is attributable 
to the defendant, he doesn't -- he doesn't walk?  That 
seems like a reasonable rule.  Whatever the delay is, if 
most of it is attributable to the defendant himself, it 
is -- it is not a basis for dismissing the indictment?

 MS. KRUGER:  We think that a defendant -- we 

think that that rule would make a great deal of sense. 
When a defendant --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That would make it easy to 

decide this case because the -- the supreme court's 
opinion acknowledges that most of the -- most of the

delay was caused by the defendant.

 MS. KRUGER:  Well, the Vermont Supreme Court 

thought that some of the delay was caused by the 
defendant and didn't charge most of that period to the 
State to support its finding of the speedy trial 
violation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would you really get by 
that rule if there were, say, four years of delay and 
two years and one month was attributable to the 
defendant and two years to the State?

 MS. KRUGER:  We would think that a court 

evaluating a speedy trial claim in that case would 
properly exclude any period that was attributable to the 
defendant and focus specifically on that period that was 
attributable to the State in determining whether or not 
the right was violated.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I'm sure 

you have gone through the record and, agreeing with 
Justice Stevens that the periods where there wasn't a 
contract, the State couldn't provide somebody, do count 
against the State, but disagreeing with the Vermont 
Supreme Court that when an assigned counsel fails to 
move the case forward that is attributable to the State 
and not the defendant, what's the difference in time?

 MS. KRUGER:  The difference in time is -- I

think that the -- as the case comes to the court, the 
final 11 months of the pretrial delay is not seriously 
in dispute.  I think that Respondent has raised a number 
of arguments about concurrent causes of delay unrelated 
to the performance of his counsel.  I think that those 
arguments are not properly before the Court because they 
fall well outside the scope of the question as to which 
this Court granted review and because they were neither 
pressed nor passed on below.

 I think that leaves the middle 14 months of 

the pretrial delay.  And I think, given the Vermont 
concession, the Vermont Supreme Court focus naturally 
rests on the 5.5-month period during which Paul 
Donaldson represented Respondent.  And we think, with 
respect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes?
 MS. KRUGER:  We think with respect to that 

period, we think that there is no basis for shifting the 
responsibility for that delay that Paul Donaldson sought 
before going to trial from defendant to the State 
because, as Justice Scalia has rightly pointed out, any 
contract expiration didn't in and of itself end the 
attorney-client relationship, and Paul Donaldson 
remained the agent and advocate of his client during 
that period.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. NELSON

 ON BEHALF OF the RESPONDENT

 MR. NELSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I apologize for jumping the gun.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sorry to delay you.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it's not going to get 

you off.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. NELSON:  I would like to respond to --

to Vermont's argument about there being no detailed 
record about why these attorneys left when they left. 
And I -- I think if they're right, then that augurs a 
remand, that suggests a remand.  But the reason there 
was no record of those departures is because the courts 
who presided over those departures never requested an 
explanation.

 With Paul Donaldson, the matter was a 

foregone conclusion.  He had no contract.  He was going 
into another line of work.  So be it, he's out of there. 
No questioning concerning Mr. Brillon's complaints about 
his inaction, his failure to investigate, and so forth; 
nothing about are you ready to go to trial, what have

you done, what have you accomplished, what are you 
passing on, if anything, to the next lawyer in line, 
none of that.

 And with Sleigh, the judicial disinterest, 

if that's what it was, the judicial silence is even more 
resounding.  Sleigh did not request permission to 
withdraw.  He put the court on notice that he was 
withdrawing, and this came out of the blue.  I don't 
think there was any heads-up for the court that this was 
going to happen, although Sleigh had expressed some 
serious reluctance to take the case and hadn't done 
anything.  He didn't -- he had a filing deadline of 
April 11th, and he was supposed to file motions on that 
date, and instead of filing motions he filed this notice 
of withdrawal with no response from the court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is the -- what 

is the distinction in your theory of the case between 
delay and failure -- failure to move a case -- what did 
-- what did the Vermont case say:  Failure to do 
anything to move the case forward?

 When do we know that that's attributable to 
the defendant, and when is it attributable to the State?

 MR. NELSON:  I think it -- I think it 

depends on the facts, and I think in each of the -- in 
the case of each of these two attorneys, the facts are

different.  With Donaldson, I think the State's 
responsibility -- the State's involvement in a 
do-nothing attorney, an attorney who was really a 
nominal attorney, started from the beginning.  It 
started from the appointment of -- of counsel who had 
been on contract with the State to perform defense 
services and was appointed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course, if the 

lawyer is a do-nothing lawyer, then I suppose there's an 
ineffective-assistance claim?

 MR. NELSON:  Well, it might mature into an 
ineffective-assistance claim, but there couldn't be an 
ineffective assistance claim on the record here because, 
well, ineffective assistance is -- is something that 
occurs at a trial.  And it can't be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's an anomaly, though, 

isn't it, that easily might have matured into 
ineffective assistance?  It wasn't yet, but if Attorneys 
4 and 5, Donaldson and Sleigh -- if the case were for 
ineffective assistance of counsel, then the defendant 
would get a new trial, but here the result is he walks.
 MR. NELSON:  That's -- that's a consequence 

of the speedy-trial clause in Barker and Strunk.  A 
speedy-trial violation happens, by definition, before 
trial.  Ineffective assistance happens, by definition

and by this Court's decisions, at trial and can't be 
determined until after trial.  Unless there is -- is a 
speedy trial right and unless it's going to be enforced, 
this is the consequence.  And that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In the abstract, you 

have a lawyer who is a public defender or hired as a 
public defender, and he keeps asking for continuances --
continuance, continuance.  How do we tell that that's 
the State's problem as opposed to what the defendant is 
doing through his lawyer?

 MR. NELSON:  I think at first you would have 

to assume that the continuances were sought in good 
faith and -- and for purposes of defense preparation. 
If the defendant had demanded a speedy trial, as this 
defendant had an early date, I think the court, looking 
at -- at a continuance motion, would have to look at it 
in that light.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what is the trial 

judge supposed to do?  The defense attorney keeps asking 
for continuances for purposes of investigation.  I need 
more time to investigate.  If -- and -- and -- can the 
court say:  You need to tell me exactly what you are 
doing?

 MR. NELSON:  I think, Justice Alito, that a 
court -- when a defendant has demanded a speedy trial,

that a court does have some obligation to -- to 
supervise, to monitor, to -- and -- and it happens all 
the time in criminal courts.  What have you done?  Have 
you seen your client?  What -- how much time do you need 
for these motions?  When are you going to be ready for 
trial?  That happens all the time.

 And as the -- as time goes by, as the months 
pass and -- and become years, I think a court's granting 
of continuances has to be more grudging.  The courts are 
under a duty because they have a duty to assure the 
speedy-trial right.  Because they are the -- they are 
the primary actors in that, the court has a duty to be 
--

JUSTICE ALITO:  Aren't you giving the 

attorney a very perverse incentive there?  I mean the 
delay may help the ultimate outcome of the case, and if 
the -- if the defense attorney can engineer enough 
delay, he or she may also produce a speedy-trial 
violation.

 MR. NELSON:  Well, I -- yes, of course, 

that's a -- that's a problem, and it's a problem that 
was recognized by Barker, and -- and it's a problem that 
-- that courts are well equipped to handle.  They --
courts are able to and commonly do.  In fact, it's their 
pretrial business -- main pretrial business to -- to set

that line to make sure lawyers adhere to them and make 
sure that the case goes to trial.  They -- courts are 
well equipped to deal with that.

 But I -- I would like to point out that your 
hypothetical is not this case.  That we are not dealing 
here with delays that were caused by continuance 
motions.  In fact, if you look closely at the record, 
trial dates were not pushed back by continuance motions 
in this case.  Trial dates were pushed back by attorney 
inaction and withdrawals.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And by your client firing 

the first attorney, correct?

 MR. NELSON:  My client -- that's correct. 
My client fired -- fired the first attorney, which --
which the State says was the bad act.  But look at the 
record of that firing.  It wasn't really a firing, of 
course.  He had no right to fire assigned counsel.  But 
he had just heard his lawyer telling the judge, I'm 
handling 150 odd cases, I cannot be ready for trial, 
give me more time.  I -- I -- I could be ready maybe in 
March or April, but I can't be ready now.  And that was 
like three or four days before trial.

 And I would submit that any client, hearing 

his lawyer making those representations to a judge, 
would have been very upset and would, in fact, have

wanted another lawyer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But knowing that the new 

lawyer would have to start from scratch, from the 
beginning, so it was going to take more time.  If he got 
a new lawyer, it was going to take more time than if he 
stayed with the lawyer who was already acquainted with 
the case but just needed a few more weeks.

 MR. NELSON:  Well, yes, but the lawyer who 
had been appointed wasn't going to get those few more 
weeks, and as Mr. Brillon said to the court, I would 
rather do it right the first time.  Being charged with a 
life imprisonment offense, one can hardly blame him. 
Yes, he had to make a tradeoff, but he had to do it 
because his lawyer was not ready.

 Now, we argued in the Vermont Supreme Court 

that that time could not --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, is that the 

proper remedy?  I mean, it seems to me he should appeal 
to the judge and say, look, this lawyer -- is -- is that 
the way you solve the problem of -- of an attorney who 
is not ready, like fire him so you can get another 
attorney?  That seems to me very strange.

MR. NELSON:  And --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And from what you told me 

it should have been given, right?

 MR. NELSON:  Pardon me?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  From what you tell me, it 

should have been given if indeed he was unable to 
prepare adequately for the trial?

 MR. NELSON:  I believe so.  The judge took a 
different view.  It was fully argued.  The judge was the 
only one who had -- the judge was the decider on that 
one, and she said no.  You don't get it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, wasn't there a 

concern about this defendant trying avoid a particular 
judge?  That's why he wanted the continuance?

 MR. NELSON:  The -- the State made that 

allegation, and it made that claim here.  No court has 
found it.  The Vermont Supreme Court found the opposite. 
The Vermont Supreme Court held that Brillon fired or 
asked for the dismissal of his first lawyer because he 
was not prepared to go to trial, which seems like an 
ample, sufficient and supported reason for the action he 
took.  That explains the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Not only did the Vermont 

Supreme Court make that finding, it does not hear the 
witnesses, it -- it has a record before it.  I can

understand if you're talking about a finding made by the 
court of first instance, but the Vermont Supreme Court 
is reviewing a record, it's not making findings.

 MR. NELSON:  That's -- that's true, Justice 

Ginsburg.  The trial court, however, also didn't make 
that finding, although it was asked to.  And, in fact, I 
think any such finding would be entirely speculative.

 It would require the court, the fact finder, 

to interpolate various happenings that are not of 
record, and that we say never happened.  It would 
require us to assume that Brillon told Ammons, I want 
you to move for a continuance on whatever grounds you 
can think of, but the real reason is to get rid of the 
judge.  And that Ammons would do that for his client, 
and, you know, for the ostensible reason that he 
presented to the court, namely, he was overloaded and 
not prepared to go to trial, his secret reason was to 
get rid of the judge.  And I think the record doesn't 
warrant that kind of inference, especially since it's 
been presented to and not accepted by the State courts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is not an 
unusual reason for criminal defense lawyers in the 
private sector to ask for a continuance.  It's quite 
common for the lawyers to go before the judge and say, 
look, I've got this other case going to trial next week,

I've got this and this, can I get more time, and judges 
give them the first two but not the third.  And why in a 
case simply where you're dealing with a public defender 
do you presume the opposite and blame the State for 
what's a quite common practice in the private part?

 MR. NELSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I'm 

only saying that this -- on this record, the conclusion 
that that was what was happening, which would be 
significant if the court were then to say, and 
therefore, it was done by the defendant who wanted delay 
despite what he said, and therefore, this is time 
considered waived under Barker.  There is no basis for 
that finding.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  My point is, I 

guess, how do we tell?  I mean, if this is normal -- I 
think it is normal, I think it's quite unusual for a 
defense lawyer to be prepared to go to trial the first 
time the trial date is set.  If it is normal, how do we 
tell?

 MR. NELSON:  Well, actually, this wasn't the 

first -- the first request for a continuance, Chief. 
Ammons had moved for a continuance before, and it had 
been denied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, but -- again, 

I assume that's -- there are probably cases in the

private bar where that's true as well.

 MR. NELSON:  How does one know?  I think 
one -- I think what makes a major difference here is 
that Brillon had demanded a speedy trial.  He had done 
so long before Ammons' motion for a continuance.  He had 
done -- he did so almost every chance he got at almost 
every court hearing.

 You could, and I think the State does, 

assume that this was all tomfoolery and an attempt to 
manipulate the court, but there is nothing in the record 
to suggest that.  That was the debate between the 
majority and the dissent at the State court.  The 
majority won.  As in Doggett, the -- the State is now 
coming back and trying to refight here an essentially 
factual issue which it lost in -- in the courts below.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  What about Donaldson and 

Moore, those two periods?  Those two periods, the 
Donaldson period and the Moore period, seem, as far as I 
can tell, which isn't that far, they seem to be periods 
when the State -- when the court below was saying that 
all that happened here was that the lawyers who were 
appointed, did a very bad job.

 You can't say they weren't appointed.  It 

isn't that he didn't have counsel.  He had counsel, and 
they just didn't do very much.

Now, why should that be accounted against 

the stayer?  Is Moore special?  Was there really a 
problem of prosecutorial behavior?  Is Donaldson the 
same as Sleigh?  I don't know.

 MR. NELSON:  Let me start --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is Donaldson a case where 

they -- is equivalent to having no lawyer?  I don't know 
how to deal with it.

 MR. NELSON:  Let me start with Donaldson, 
and I think in answer to your question, I don't think 
Donaldson is substantially different from Sleigh.  I 
won't go over the circumstances of Donaldson's 
appointment, but once he was appointed, he began 
conversations with the defender general about getting 
off the case.  And I think the sense -- and -- and a 
significant fact about those conversations is that the 
defender general told Donaldson he was going to be 
replaced.

 We don't know exactly when that happened, 

but he told him he was going to be replaced with someone 
who was more competent, more qualified to deal with a 
life imprisonment case.  So this is not information 
which will light a fire under a lawyer to prepare a 
case, that he knows he's not going to try.

 Donaldson then asks for time.  It's the only

request he ever made of the court.  The court gave him 
time and set filing deadlines, and he missed them. 
Missing those deadlines should have been a red flag to 
the court in a case that was already over a year old. 
The court let those deadlines pass without a word.

 The court also said, we're going to try this 

case in October.  Get ready for trial in October. 
Everything should be filed by September 23rd.  And for a 
reason, which the record has no explanation for, the 
October trial never happened.  Donaldson was still on 
the case, his name was still on the case, and the 
October trial date passed without a murmur.  It was not 
until late November that Donaldson came to the court and 
explained the situation.

 Now the court -- I think the defender 

general failed in his responsibility with regard to 
Donaldson.  That's State involvement.  The court failed 
in not noticing the -- the missed deadlines and in 
allowing the trial date to pass without a trial; and I 
think the Court also failed in its duty in allowing 
Donaldson off the case, which rendered any catch-up time 
that he had to do pointless, without any inquiry at all. 
The court, it's clear from the record, deferred entirely 
to the defender general, and so I think the Vermont 
court on that record thought that there was enough State

involvement here to charge -- to find the State 
responsible and to weigh some of that responsibility 
against the State.  The court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What does your --
your argument do to the fundamental and I think quite 
vital principle in Polk County that public defenders 
work for their clients; they don't work for the State?

 MR. NELSON:  It does nothing to Polk County, 

and we acknowledge that -- that Paul Donaldson's 
inaction by itself, if it had nothing to do with the 
State, if the State did not involve itself or condone --
if the State had no responsibility with regard to that 
time, the State would have no responsibility under 
Barker.  That's perfectly clear, and I don't think the 
Vermont Supreme Court's opinion, fairly read, fairly 
read says anything other than that.  The Vermont --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess fairly 

read, it does say the failure of several assigned 
counsel to do anything to move the case forward is 
attributable to the State, because they didn't do 
anything, I guess is the touchstone.

 MR. NELSON:  Well, I think I have two 

responses to that.  One is that in the context of the 
rest of the opinion, what the court was talking about 
was a breakdown of the system, and the focus was on two

actors, both State actors, the assigning agency, the 
defender general, and the court and I don't think 
there's any dispute that both of those are indeed State 
actions, and that delays which can be traced to them, 
which they have a hand in, can be weighed against panned 
the State under Barker.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it doesn't say that; it 

really does say most of the delay was caused by the 
inability or unwillingness of assigned counsel, not of 
the -- of the institution that appoints them, 
unwillingness or inability of assigned counsel to move 
the case forward.  That looks to me like --

MR. NELSON:  I think -- elsewhere in the 

opinion, Justice Scalia, I think the court is clear that 
-- that they were faulting the defender general, and to 
a lesser extent the court.  I think we are putting more 
stress on the court's nonfeasance than the Vermont 
Supreme Court did, but in fact, the time adds up to the 
same.  The time, we're talking 14 months from 
Donaldson's assignment until Moore's assignment in 
August.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you agree -- just

following up on your latest answer, do you agree that it 
has to be a systemic problem?  I mean, you gave us that 
-- the situation where the lawyer says I've got 150 
cases, I need a -- need a continuance.

 What if there's none of that?  They've got, 
you know, 500 public defenders, and the -- but the guy 
still delays.  He's responsible for not doing anything 
to move the case forward.

 MR. NELSON:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it still 

attributable to the State?

 MR. NELSON:  I don't think -- I don't think 
the result depends on there being a systemic problem.  I 
think in this case there was a systemic problem, and the 
Court knows about that from the findings of the indigent 
defense task force, which --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the Chief Justice's 

question, I'm interested in it as well, are there 
instances in which a State-appointed counsel can delay 
and have that not attributed to the State?  Is it always 
attributed to the State --

MR. NELSON:  No.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just because he's State --
MR. NELSON:  Absolutely there can be 

situations like that, where there is no --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There is a delay, but it's 

not attributable to the State.

 MR. NELSON:  It's not attributable to the 

State, it's attributable to counsel.  And just the same 
as -- just the same as for private counsel.  We're not 
proposing a two-tiered system there.  We're --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, when is that? 
The -- you have the same situation, the defense counsel 
appointed by the State does nothing to move the case 
forward, that's as I understand it the Vermont Supreme 
Court touchstone.  When is that attributable to the 
State and when is it not?

 MR. NELSON:  It would not be attributable to 

the State if the assigning agency was -- had no fault, 
had no supervising duty that it failed to perform, that 
the lawyer was essentially on his own or her own; and it 
would also assume, I think, if the delay went on long 
enough, that there was no fault in the court in failing 
to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I --
MR. NELSON:  -- to notice that nothing was 

happening.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It does sound to me, 

then, that you're saying there has to be some systemic 
problem, that the rule that I understand the Vermont

Supreme Court to have adopted, that when assigned 
counsel does nothing to move the case forward, that 
that's attributable to the State, you would disagree 
with?  You would say no, there has to be a systemic 
problem, not the -- not just the individual lawyer, but 
they're not assigning enough defenders, they're not 
supervising them, whatever.

 MR. NELSON:  Maybe I'm not using the word 

systemic in the same sense you are.  All I would say is 
say is it doesn't have to happen to a lot of people, it 
could happen to just one person, but it would only 
happen to that one person if a public, State agency was 
responsible for the delay.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if you have a situation 
in which the -- an attorney is appointed, the defendant 
threatens that attorney, the attorney withdraws.  A 
second attorney is appointed, the client threatens that 
attorney, the attorney withdraws, and then thereafter a 
new attorney is pointed, and there is great delay. 
Maybe more -- two or three attorneys are appointed. 
There's great delay.  Is -- does the -- does the chain 
of events that started all this get taken into account 
or do you just start counting the time from the 
appointment of the last attorney who wasn't threatened?

happened before, but you can -- but -- but if what 
you're saying or suggesting is that earlier bad actions 
result in a forfeiture of speedy trial rights, I would 
disagree.  The way you -- the way it matters is that by 
firing, threatening, unjustifiably getting rid of a --
of a lawyer, you require the next lawyer to spend some 
time getting up to speed on the case.  And that time --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What if a small -- I don't 
know how many lawyers are available for appointment in 
Bennington.  What if it's a small jurisdiction where 
there aren't that many who are available to be 
appointed?  And so you fire the public defender, you 
threaten the first appointed counsel, and pretty soon 
you don't have very many left, or the ones that you have 
left are busy with other cases and delay results.

 MR. NELSON:  But that's not the case here, 

and I think my answer to your question is that what 
makes this a State response -- failure of responsibility 
is that the State had the ability to do something about 
it.  If the State's hands are tied, if they run out of 
legal talent, if there's no other way to get counsel on 
the case than by a broken-down contract system, which 
was not the case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the point that 
Ms. Rainville made?  And she talked about this balancing

that comes out of Barker, and she said you have to weigh 
against the defendant very heavily, the episodes with 
lawyer number one and number three, because that was 
really bad stuff.  The State is perhaps responsible for 
some of the other delays, but she called those "neutral" 
in the weighing process.  Don't those two episodes, 
counsel number one was fired, counsel number three, who 
says his life was threatened by the defendant, don't 
those have to count very heavily against the defendant?

 MR. NELSON:  Justice Ginsburg, I don't think 
that Barker works that way.  I think what Barker says is 
that time which is attributable to the defendant gets 
subtracted from the total delay; that that's not 
considered.  That the rest of the time is a period which 
the State has to account for; and there are -- there 
will be segments of that time, segments of that delay 
which are nobody's fault, and those delays would in fact 
be truly neutral in the sense of they would have no 
weight against the State; and there are others that 
would count more or less heavily against the State.

 So I think the effect of what went on with 
Jerry Altieri, which I think was not much more than two 
months of the total time that he was on board, I think 
the effect of that is to subtract that period, and then 
any catch-up period that his firing or his dismissal

required, subtract that period as well from the total, 
and weigh the rest more or less heavily or perhaps not 
at all against the State.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the rest, I 

couldn't find in his final counsel's representation -- I 
didn't see anything in her representation that would 
suggest any lack of diligence on her part or any reason 
to count that in the speedy trial calculus.  That runs 
from August 2003 to June 2004.

 MR. NELSON:  To June 2004.  That's correct. 

I -- I think that the opinion is not clear as to how 
much responsibility the Vermont court attributed to the 
State for that period.  Vermont says they charged every 
second of the -- of that time to the State, and it's 
quite clear from the opinion that they didn't.  They 
said that most of the remaining two years, as of 
Donaldson's appointment in June of '02, was attributable 
to the State.  It's not clear how much of that time or 
if they actually counted it.  I think that any precise 
calculation of that time period is impossible.

 We argue, and the record supports, that much 

of that time had to do with Ms. Moore getting files 
together, not only from predecessor counsel but from the 
State, and that the State delayed for many months in 
providing an updated witness list with current

addresses.  She needed that to interview the witnesses. 
The case was old, and she needed the State's help there, 
with other discovery material which the record shows --
it's not in the joint appendix, but it is in the printed 
case, which was essentially Vermont Supreme Court's 
equivalent of an appendix.  These materials were at 
issue for Moore.  She needed them.  The prosecutor was 
dilatory in providing them.  And I think that that's a 
kind of vanilla reason to attribute some of that time to 
the State.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Nelson --
MR. NELSON:  The court was also --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- what is your judgment 
on how much time all together was attributable to the 
State?

 MR. NELSON:  I think 14 -- I think the 

Vermont court was clear about the 14 months from 
Donaldson through Moore, including the six months of no 
counsel.  It adds up to 14 months.  And then the rest of 
the time I don't think you can put a number on.

 Maybe it's not time that we're trying to add 
up, but responsibility.  And what the -- what the State 
court was saying was when a case is as old as this one 
was when Moore took it over, the court should be very 
vigilant and grudging in its grants of continuances, and

the case could have been tried sooner than in eight 
months.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your 14 months, 

just so I understand, that includes the August 2003 
through June 2004, when Moore was representing him?

 MR. NELSON:  No.  The 14 months goes from 

Donaldson on June 11th, 2002, through Moore's 
appointment in August 2003.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA RAINVILLE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. RAINVILLE:  Very quickly then, Justice 
Ginsburg, the answer to your question, he did receive 
credit for his time served.

 The important distinction that the questions 

raised show, what's so fundamentally wrong about this 
case, is the distinction between Strickland.  There you 
ask the lawyers what they did.  They're given deference. 
They're given the right to defend themselves.  And if 
you prove that it would have had an effect on the 
outcome of the case, the defendant gets a new trial. 
Here the lawyers are never asked, no presumption is

given, and the defendant is allowed to walk free for the 
rest of his life.  It's fundamentally wrong.

 Letting a defendant walk free from a crime 
is an extraordinary remedy that should only be given in 
an extraordinary case, and that case is not this one.

 Thank you.
