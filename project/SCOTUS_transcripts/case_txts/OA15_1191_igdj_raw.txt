ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

please the Court: 

 

 

11 

            

The United States Constitution does not 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

confer U.S. citizenship on anyone born outside the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States.  Rather, pursuant to its plenary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

authority under Article I of the Constitution, it is for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress to determine which categories of such persons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be granted U.S. citizenship by statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

In doing so, Congress has always required 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

that the persons involved have a demonstrated and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient connection to the United States, either in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves or through their parents, to warrant the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conferral of citizenship, because citizenship carries 

 

 

 

 

 

with it attendant duties and rights on the part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual, and important duties of protection and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation on the part of the United States government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

This case concerns the framework under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as originally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted for granting citizenship to persons outside the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States as of the date of their birth. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

Other provisions deal with the granting of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

citizenship later in life.  Those were open to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent or his father in this case, but were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken advantage of. 

 

 

8 

            

In particular, this case concerns the 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

granting of citizenship to children born out of wedlock 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abroad, a situation in which this Court's -- this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's cases made clear that mothers and fathers are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not typically similarly situated with respect to their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal status concerning the child at the moment of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

birth. 

15

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

The general rules for citizenship at birth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are set out in 8 U.S.C. 1401.  And I'm referring to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act as originally enacted; it was revised in 1986.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both parents were U.S. citizens, then a child born 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside the United States would be a citizen of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States as long as one of the parents had resided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the United States for any period of time.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not deem that to be a sufficient connection to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States, given that both parents are citizens. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On the other hand, if one parent was a U.S. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen and one parent was an alien, Congress had a

markedly different approach.  The U.S.-citizen parent 

  

 

 

 

 

had to -- had to have resided in the United States for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ten years, five of which were after reaching the age of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14.  Congress evidently determined that because such a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

child would have competing claims of allegiance, that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greater residency was -- was required for the parent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish the connection to the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that an argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we heard much about in the Flores-Villar case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  It was -- it was made at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oral argument in -- in Flores-Villar, and -- but we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's also evident from the face of the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As this Court said in Nguyen with respect to another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument that the -- that the Court addressed there, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's important for the Court itself to look at the -- at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the structure, text, and operation of the statute to see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought, in Villar, 

    

 

 

 

the -- the government spent most of its argument talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the differential treatment primarily on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grounds of statelessness. 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and here your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument is -- the thrust of your argument is -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat a different need to ensure sufficient ties. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  What -- we're making both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

arguments.  And -- and we did -- we did argue in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Flores-Villar that there should be a connection to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States and that the statutory framework is set up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

that way.

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

It's true that our emphasis was on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statelessness, but we are now arguing -- and, again, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's -- it's entirely evident from the face of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute -- that what -- what these provisions are after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is connection to the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why aren't men and women 

  

 

 

 

 

 

who are parents similarly situated with respect to their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affiliation, their attachment to U.S. values?  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

there's no reason to think a man is less -- has less of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a sense of U.S. belonging than a woman? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  And we're -- and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

we're making no such argument.  The -- the point is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you have -- where you have -- at the -- at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moment of birth, the mother, as -- as this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized in the -- in the Nguyen case and has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized in cases like Lehr v. Robertson in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic context, the mother is the only legally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

recognized parent. 

 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There are many cases, 

  

 

 

 

 

especially generations back when this law was on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

books, where the mother -- the birth certificate came 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometime after the child was born, and both the father's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

name and the mother's name might be on it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

So it is -- it is not -- the moment of birth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

doesn't necessarily tell you who is the mother if she --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if there is no birth certificate, and then the child, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when they get the birth certificate, both names are on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

it. 

9 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  But I -- I think this Court's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

decision in Nguyen and the -- and the State statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we identify in a footnote in our brief are premised 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on -- on the proposition that the identity of the mother 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and her relationship to the child will be known by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

virtue of the birth alone, or at least will be known in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the overwhelming majority of cases. 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

In that situation there is only one parent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

There is not a competing claim of citizenship to -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competing claim of allegiance to another country through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

another parent. 

 

20 

            

On the other hand, when the father 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

legitimates, at that point you have two parents, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- in the situation where they are of different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationalities, then you are put in the situation where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are competing claims --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why do we look, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

Mr. Kneedler, to the moment of birth?  Why shouldn't we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look to the moment when citizenship is sought? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Because this -- this 

  

 

 

 

 

statutory provision specifically deals with citizenship 

 

 

 

 

 

at birth, and the -- the statute that that's its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caption, of 1409(a), with respect to the situation where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the father legitimates, says the child shall be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen as of birth, and it's important to understand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what is operating here. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

At -- at the moment of birth, again, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child only has one -- one parent.  When the father 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimates, what Congress has done generously, one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could say, but at least sensibly, is to say we will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treat the couple as if they were married at the moment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of birth.  They are giving retroactive application to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the legitimation so that the -- so that the children --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the child is treated as the child of married parents at

9 

10 

11 

12

16 

17 

18 

that point. 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

If the -- if the legitimating father is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. citizen, in that situation you would have two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.-citizen parents, and the very generous rule for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.-citizen parents would apply in that -- in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

situation. 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But Nguyen -- Nguyen was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

more a matter of -- of proof, whereas this case, as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

Justice Ginsburg indicates, is a question of which --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

does the child have sufficient ties to the country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's quite a different -- quite a different proposition 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that the two address, it seems to me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Two -- two things about that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

This Court's decision in Nguyen had two -- had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified two separate interests.  One was the proof of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paternity, and -- but the other was recognizing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection to the United States. 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

The connection to the United States in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

situation like this has two steps:  What is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship of the child to the parent?  And Nguyen was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about establishing that relationship, that 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in some formal sense and also underlying it, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real sense of establishing that relationship. 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

This case deals with the relationship of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

parent to the United States. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem is with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

exception that's been created for unwed-citizen mothers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first prong, the interest of the connection to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States doesn't exist, because the statute doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require any connection to the United States except 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. citizenship.  She could have been born, lived here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a day, and moved somewhere else, and she would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

automatically confer.

Under the -- that was true under the 1940 Act.  Under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 1952 Act, it's continuous presence for one year, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress deemed that to be basically somewhere in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the two U.S.-citizen parents situation in which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any period of residency was okay and the mixed -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed nationality situation where Congress said it had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be ten and five.  Congress chose a -- a period 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

somewhere in between. 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why should it be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

different for an unwed father who has legitimized the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

child? 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Because in that situation 

  

 

 

 

 

there are two parents.  The argument is not that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

father's ties are less.  It's that there are competing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ties, and Congress wanted to make sure that the -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the strength of the U.S. citizen's ties were sufficient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they would outweigh or at least counteract where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress could be sufficiently confident of the tie to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States to grant citizenship in that -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that situation.  And again --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why couldn't that have been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

done, Mr. Kneedler?  Why couldn't these objectives have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been served through entirely gender neutral language? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For example, I know that there was a proposal that the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11 

Secretary of State made earlier than this statute was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed in the 1930s, which talked just about legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents, which didn't refer to mothers and fathers at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

all. 

5 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  Several things about 

  

  

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

that.  I don't think there is a claim in this case that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent would benefit from reading the statute in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that manner, because I -- I don't think there's any 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

question that he had citizenship and a legal parent when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he was born. 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

But beyond -- beyond that --

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That would get rid of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

gender inequality that is at the heart of his complaint. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whether or not he in the end benefits from it, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question here is whether the statute makes --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes a violation of equal protection. 

   

 

 

 

17 

            

One question we ask when we think about a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

question like that is, could Congress have written the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute?  Could Congress have served its objectives in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an entirely gender neutral way?  And it seems as though 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here we have the -- the Secretary of State presented a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute to Congress that actually did that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  But it -- but as was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

pointed out at the time, as we point out in our brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while that statute on its face looked gender neutral, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

fact, it would have operated in exactly the same way as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute that Congress enacted operated, because --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and no one has really taken serious issue with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposition we have in our brief that at the moment of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

birth, it was the overwhelming rule that the mother was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only legally recognized parent. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

So in that -- this -- it would have operated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

in essentially the same way. 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

And let me -- let me come at this in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

slightly different direction.  If, when you have one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

parent, the -- the mother in -- in this case, she gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make all of the pertinent decisions about the child. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where they will live, where they will be domiciled, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations like that. 

 

 

15 

            

When a father legitimates, he does not -- he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

does not then acquire the right to make -- the sole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to make all the decisions for the child.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are then two parents.  He gets to --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  There's a lot of 

   

  

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

complicated things, but the question I think is, think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the child.  The child is born out of wedlock.  Now, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if his mother was an American, he becomes an American if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she's lived here for one year.  If it's his father who's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an American, she becomes an American only if he's lived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here for like eight years or ten years.  Now, that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

difference, and why does that make a difference?  What 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

justifies the gender discrimination? 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  But that's the same rule that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

applies if the parents are married, which is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Two -- two wrongs don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

make a right. 

   

7 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but -- I don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

8 

it -- no one is challenging --

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Perhaps.  Yeah, yeah, I 

  

  

 

 

 

10 

accept that no one is challenging, but I'm not asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

that question. 

 

12 

            

I'm asking the question of what it is -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

would repeat the question, which you heard, which I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think is the equal protection question at the heart of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

the case. 

 

16 

            

17 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And the answer that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

give in your brief was some endlessly -- I mean, it was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very well-written and brilliant --

 

 

 

 

20 

            

(Laughter.) 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and -- and -- but it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

went into this thing about statelessness persons, and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then we have, like, 17 briefs that say, no, no, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't what the situation was with statelessness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persons.  And so I guess the question would be there: 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

Was it enough of a statelessness person justification to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant this gender discrimination? 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

There is no point in you repeating that.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

think I've taken in that argument.  I'll have to make up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my mind about it. 

 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

Is there anything else? 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the -- the first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

argument we're making, again, is -- is the point of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection to the United States, and that's where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

married couple comes in.  Because no one is challenging 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proposition that Congress can impose a residency 

   

 

 

 

 

 

12 

requirement. 

13 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Wrong -- wrong residency 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

requirement.  I did have Justice Kagan's question in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

mind when they read it. 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

Why don't they ask the child if it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

like, when it reaches the age of 21, to be connected to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States and see if the child votes in American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elections and lives there a while?  Why are they so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

worried about the child's parents? 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, in any case, you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

23 

don't have to answer that. 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No, no.  The Act provides for 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

the acquisition of citizenship at a date after birth, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

and then --

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Lived here for 14 years and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

so forth.  All kinds of stuff.  But --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

5 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to argue with 

    

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

you on this point.  I want to know if I've got the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for saying the mother, if she's the U.S. citizen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and he is born out of wedlock, he only lived here for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year, but the father has to live here for, like, ten 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years or eight years or something like that, the real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification for that you've been able to find and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only one you've been able to find has to do with this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing about statelessness? 

 

 

14 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  We have two -- we have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

two reasons.  The first one is the connection to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States, which is evident on the face of -- of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  When the father legitimates, what -- what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute does is treat the couple as if they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

married.  In fact, in this case, the child was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimated by marriage, and what the statute basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did was make the marriage retroactive to the date of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

birth. 

23 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm going to make an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

example where they never married. 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  They -- they like living 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

together without being married.  Now what's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

justification? 

4 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, under the 1986 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

amendments, it's -- it is easier for the father to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledge the child.  But in that situation, again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are two -- there are two parents.  And in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation, the father does not get to make unilateral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions about the child.  He gets to be a parent too. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He doesn't get to be the only parent the way the mother 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the only parent before legitimation. 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

And this is true in Lehr v. Robertson and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

and the cases this Court has had in -- in the domestic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

context. 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kneedler, you're --

  

 

 

 

 

you are giving a sophisticated rationale, but we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

talking about legislation from 1940 and 1952. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

At that time, the statute books were just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shot through with distinctions between children born out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of wedlock and affiliation with the mother and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

father.  So this was a piece with all that legislation. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And it wasn't until when Ms. Trimble again scored a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typical.  And the Illinois Probate Code said a child 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

born out of wedlock can inherent to an intestate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

succession from the mother only, not the father.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

1 

2 

laws just put mothers and children not born of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marriage together and separated fathers from their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

children. 

4 

            

5 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And nobody thought until 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

the 1970s that that was a violation of equal protection. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But in a whole series of cases in the '70s, the Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized that, indeed, there was a violation of equal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

protection. 

10 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, insofar as -- I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

there are two equal protection arguments that have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made in cases like that.  One of them has to do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal protection on the basis of illegitimacy.  That --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that claim is not raised here with good reason, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- because Respondent, as -- as an alien outside the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United -- person outside the United States and an alien 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by statute, did not have constitutional rights.  So it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

the --

 

19 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  My point was that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

laws that existed put mothers and children born out of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wedlock together and separated fathers from their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

children --

 

23 

            

24 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- out of what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

reality of their life was. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

1 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  And in this Court's decision 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

in Fiallo in the immigration context, that was exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the situation, and the Court rejected equal protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims based both on -- on sex discrimination and on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

illegitimacy. 

6 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was not a claim of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

7 

citizenship. 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  It wasn't, but we -- but we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think -- we think, if anything, it follows Ofar Sharar, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because citizenship is -- is entering into the citizenry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or the membership of our society on a permanent basis 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with rights to come and go with all the rights and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

obligations. 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

But I -- but I also wanted to address 

   

   

 

 

 

 

your -- your question with respect to the domestic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context.  This Court's decision in Lehr v. Robertson 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sustained a situation where you -- where a child was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

going to be put up for adoption.  The mother would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinarily have the sole right to decide that, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation was, what -- what about the father?  Well, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

father had to take some affirmative steps to put himself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a position where he could have a role, essentially a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

veto power over --

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the father did --

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

this father -- didn't the couple marry?

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, they did.  But, again, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

at that point, he is -- he is not similarly situated to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mother, either at the time of birth or at the time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

he legitimates. 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

this question:  If the Court thinks that this statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates the Equal Protection Clause, does it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily follow that the Petitioner is entitled to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relief that was awarded to him by the Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit; in other words, the granting of citizenship? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

And I --

   

13 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No, it by no means follows. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, could you address 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

that?  We -- we had a similar issue a few terms ago in 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Flores-Villar case, but that was a criminal --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, what was at issue was a criminal conviction. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here, criminal convictions are not at issue.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal convictions had nothing to do with alienage; is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

that correct? 

 

20 

            

21 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  The underlying criminal 

  

 

 

 

22 

convictions. 

23 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Right, right.  No.  They --

  

  

  

 

 

 

24 

 

 

they were -- they were regular state law convictions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I take it that the thrust 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

2 

3 

of Justice Alito's question is, what -- what is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy if we -- if we level up, then it's easier for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both?  If we level down, then -- then it's harder for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

both? 

5 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  We -- we think that -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

think the Court clearly should not apply to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.-citizen fathers the one-year limitation.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

general rule -- 1409(c) is an exception to a general 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule that governs -- governs the vast majority -- or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three categories of cases:  married fathers, married 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mothers, and unmarried fathers.  There is no reason to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that Congress would have wanted unmarried fathers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have a more --

   

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, are --

  

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  One I could think of -- one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I could think of, possibly, but I'd like your opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it:  How many, do you think, unmarried fathers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there were in 1952 who couldn't qualify under the long 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period of time -- eight years, you know -- and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not so hard to do, if you're in the Army, because all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your active duty counts.  But they would have qualified 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the one year.  Now, I use the numbers in your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, which were brilliant of you to try to find.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know how you found those. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I -- I -- that 4,000 number kept coming 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

1 

2 

3 

back.  I thought maybe there were a couple of thousand a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

year.  But do we know that there are more than a couple 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of thousand a year? 

   

 

4 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You know, I thought -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

5 

thought you said there were untold numbers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, and there were the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

untold numbers, but that's -- that's true, they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untold numbers, and then that's not told.  I'm trying to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find the --

 

 

10 

            

(Laughter.) 

11 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm trying to find how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

close we could come to a guess. 

   

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  It's -- it's -- it's very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

hard -- it's very hard to estimate.  But -- but this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's decision in -- in Nguyen identified the number 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of people who travel abroad, and the numbers are a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little bit higher even now. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, let's go back to '52. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  It was like 70 million that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

take trips abroad. 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's go back to '52, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the couple is unmarried and it's a father who, in fact, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would qualify if he only had to live here for a year, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but he wouldn't qualify if he had to live here for eight 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years before the baby's born.  Never marries the baby --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

1 

never marries the mother.  Okay. 

  

 

 

 

2 

            

So I'm thinking, who could those people have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

been?  They would have been -- they would have been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people maybe working for American businesses or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something, and there weren't that many at that time.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I used your 4,000. 

   

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

9 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I --

    

   

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That perhaps was not right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  We have -- we have wondered 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

the same thing. 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  What if the --

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- the only thing we were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

able to identify -- and this -- this is really not very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closely on point, but the State Department told us that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today, they -- they grant approximately, I think, 8,000 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

certificates of birth abroad.  And of those, I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

around 3,000 are under 1409(c), which means that those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the ones granted to U.S.-citizen mothers abroad. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That doesn't -- the number of fathers who might benefit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be far larger than --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I -- I'm sorry.  Were 

   

  

  

 

 

 

22 

you finished? 

 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I -- I mean, we 

   

   

  

 

 

generally have a rule that when we find an equal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

1 

2 

3 

protection violation, we level up rather than level 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down.  That's been the Court's consistent practice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Wouldn't you agree? 

 

 

4 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  That's been its practice, 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

yes.  But that -- that -- the Court has made clear that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is not constitutionally compelled.  And there --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are compelling reasons here not to do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I find one compelling 

   

  

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

reason to do it -- and I just thought I'd offer this up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to you and see what you have to say -- is that in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, unlike in some cases, there really isn't a choice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between leveling up and leveling down in one sense, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because if you level down, this party gets no relief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

In other words, you say, well, you level --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

you just apply it prospectively.  But then this party 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets absolutely no relief.  And so isn't that a problem? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Isn't it the kind of the same problem as Justice Harlan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized in -- in Welsh when he was dealing with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal matter?  He said, you know, you can't level 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down because you can't give everybody the exact same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

benefit. 

22 

            

23 

            

24 

            

So how do we deal with that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, several things. 

  

 

 

 

In this context in particular, there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

 

 

serious questions about whether the Court can, but, at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

1 

2 

3 

the very least, substantial reasons why the Court should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not grant citizenship to someone -- effectively grant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship to someone to whom Congress itself has not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

granted it. 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's not -- it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

citizenship.  It's excising the unconstitutional part of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

the statute. 

 

8 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  But if it -- it -- it would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

have -- it would have that effect.  And -- and in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation like this, we think the only proper remedy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given Congress' plenary authority, is to apply the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ten-year rule to everyone and let Congress step in and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- and address the problem. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  If Petitioner's parents had 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

been married, would he be entitled to relief? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  And -- and that's --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

that's the point. 

 

 

18 

            

And -- and another point is there are other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

situations in which the Court finds a constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

violation but does not grant relief.  The qualified 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity context or the exclusionary rule.  The Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

might adjudicate a violation --

   

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  If we were to -- if we were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

to level up, we would --

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Go ahead. 

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

1 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  If we were to level up, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

effect would be that Petitioner would be given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preference over someone who was similarly situated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except for the fact that that person's parents were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

married. 

6 

            

7 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And if such a person were to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

then bring a suit, they would have a strong equal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

protection claim, would they not? 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

they --

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I hesitate to say what 

    

   

 

 

 

 

12 

            

(Laughter.) 

13 

            

14 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The claim -- the claim --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KNEEDLER:  It illustrates the problems 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

of the remedy --

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kneedler, the claim 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

is gender discrimination.  And married parents, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

both have been -- mother and father have been treated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equally badly.  But when they are unwed, the mother is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given the preference and the father is not.  So we're --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about equal protection, not qualified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity.  You have two people, similarly situated. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They have to be treated equally.  The unwed father is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal to the unwed mother.  The married mother, equal to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the married father.  So --

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  My only point was that there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

are situations in which the Court has found a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional violation but not granted relief. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But not really a situation 

   

  

 

 

 

like this.  Not a situation where we say, uh, there is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an equal protection violation, and if we extend the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit to everybody, we can take care of that equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection violation, we can remedy the problem.  But if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we do not, if we try to level down, the effect of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the -- the party before us who has proved an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal protection violation gets absolutely no relief at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

all.

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I would like to answer 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that quickly and then reserve the balance of my time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of -- for rebuttal. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think it's also relevant, in taking into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account the remedy, that this is not Respondent's own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional right.  It's a third-party claim. 

   

  

 

 

There's no automatic right to raise the rights of third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties; in this case, the father.  So I think that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would properly be taken into account in deciding whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a remedy at all is feasible and what it would be.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN A. BROOME 

 

 

 

2 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. BROOME:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Respondent's father was a citizen of the

8 

9

been the mother instead of the father, there would be no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that he transmitted citizenship to Respondent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Section 1409.

the same terms of the mother is not based on any innate

reducing statelessness, or -- nor does it serve an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in reducing statelessness or ensuring that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that citizenship by descent pass only to those children 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who are likely to learn American values.  Both of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's justifications for the gender differential 

 

 

 

 

 

at here therefore fail. 

 

 

 

              

I would like to begin by addressing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard of review.  There is no dispute here that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent has third-party standing to assert the equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection claim of his father.  That claim plainly is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to intermediate scrutiny.

rational basis review to the claims of aliens who were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking Visas based on their relationship to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.-citizen relative.  It is true, as the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

points out, that the Fiallo plaintiffs included a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.-citizen father, but the Court in Fiallo disagreed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- with -- with the dissenting justices and with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plaintiffs that his equal protection rights were at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stake.  And there was never any question that the aliens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that case were not U.S. citizens. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here the -- the dispute is one of -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute centers on a -- on a right of Respondent's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

father to be treated equally to transmit his citizenship 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the same terms that a mother could transmit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship under Section 1409. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  On this, but -- I would say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

at some point, the problem that worries me the most is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming this is unconstitutional, do you put the 14 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years or whatever it is, ten years, on both, or the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year on both? 

 

 

            

And I -- I want to -- because he does have a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point.  You put the one year on both and then you have, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the parents are married, it's the ten years, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it's the -- they're not married, it's the one year, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that really doesn't make much sense.  But the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- so I'm -- I'm -- hope you'll get to that.

brief that bothered me a lot, and it said, actually, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one-year requirement is tougher.  And the reason it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tougher, it says that the State Department administers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  How they do this, I don't know, and I want to know 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if that's really true. 

 

 

 

7 

            

But they administer it to say that if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8

11 

12 

13 

14 

are living in the United States you have to live here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for one year.  And if you set one foot across the board 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to get a drink of water at -- at Niagara Falls, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't qualify.  And, moreover, you have to prove that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you never did set one foot to get a drink of water. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well, nobody could prove such a thing.  So -- so I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interested in that word "continuous" and how it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

actually administered. 

 

16 

            

Those are the two things that are worrying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

me in respect to remedy. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. BROOME:  Justice Breyer, let me address 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

the last question first. 

 

 

 

20 

            

The word "continuous," I do not think, 

   

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

would -- is going to -- as a practical matter, it can't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be applied in a way that somebody would have to come 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward and prove that they were in the United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for 365 days.  They would not have to show proof that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were actually in the United States on each of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

30

days. 

2 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So I -- I --

   

   

  

  

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

that question.  That is your answer.  And maybe, if the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor General has time, he could simply confirm that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer by saying yes. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOME:  Well, let me tell you how it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- how it was applied in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So this case, when we were in the court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals, the court was -- th court remanded the case to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Western District of New York for a determination on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that very question. 

 

 

            

Whether or not -- if -- if the -- in order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide whether the court should address the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional issue, the court first asked whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's father would have satisfied the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuous year rule. 

 

 

17 

            

So we went to the Western District of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

New York, and we were not -- the government ultimately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stipulated that, yes, because we have evidence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's father being in the United States, or in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case an outlying possession, from his birth in 1900 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until the date of his departure for the Dominican 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republic in 1919, we will -- we will presume that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was at least some period in there where he was in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States for one continuous year.  And I think that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

that presumption would apply in most cases.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly was applied in this case that we would not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to come forward and show proof on -- that he was in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States on every single day. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I think if the Court were troubled that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps that -- that rule could be harder for some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fathers or some -- or people to follow, but an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative remedy could be to leave both options on the

table. 

10 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If we leveled down and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

made it harder, would that affect the status of people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who have obtained citizenship under the more lenient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision applicable to the mother? 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

MR. BROOME:  Justice Kennedy, if this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

applied the leveling down remedy in a way that -- in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way that would actually equalize the -- the two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similarly-situated classes here, it would have to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes, it would impact people dramatically because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would take citizenship away from people who already have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

it. 

21 

            

22 

            

And the Court has held --

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's not 

  

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

necessary -- I assume it could be prospective because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

once you have citizenship, it's -- we -- we have cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that say it can't be taken away. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

            

MR. BROOME:  Right.  And you can't -- I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

would submit --

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it would just be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

prospective by reason of that doctrine. 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

MR. BROOME:  You could not apply a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

prospective remedy in this case, Justice Kennedy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it would not affect anybody whose citizenship 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was governed by the 1952 Act.  It would not affect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent -- it would not affect Respondent's father, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyone who was born between 1952 and 1986.  If the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

to --

 

12 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, the problem, isn't 

    

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

it, Mr. Broome, that the very inequality that you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaining of would remain, because it's impossible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claw back everybody else's citizenship, so it's really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible to level down.  And the very inequality that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've just found would remain. 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. BROOME:  That's right, Justice Kagan. 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

The government's proposal, the prospective remedy is no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy.  It would not affect -- it would not -- it would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- it would leave in place all of the gender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminatory effects caused by this statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's not just that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't give you citizenship, it's that it doesn't cure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the inequality at all.

2 

            

MR. BROOME:  But --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Either by leveling down or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

by leveling up. 

 

 

4 

            

MR. BROOME:  That's right.  That's right, 

  

  

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

Justice Kagan.  And -- and -- the government -- I would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submit that the government's position would have to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same if this was a case of race discrimination.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government would have to say that, yes, if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship -- that the citizenship statute 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminated on the basis of race, this Court would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powerless to correct the residual effects of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

racially-discriminatory statute. 

 

13 

            

The Court -- we're not aware of any case in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

which this Court has said it is powerless to correct a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case of race discrimination or gender discrimination or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any equal protection violation. 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the argument 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

that in most of the cases where a benefit was extended, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the group that -- to which the benefit was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extended was a smaller group than the group that already 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got the benefit, and here, if you add in married 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents, then most people are under the more difficult 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule, ten years or whatever it is, and it's the smaller 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

group that gets the benefit. 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. BROOME:  Right. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

1 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you would be extending 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

a benefit enjoyed by a smaller group to a larger group. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. BROOME:  Well, we're not -- we're not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

asking for -- the remedy we would propose, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg, would not affect marital couples, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government has pointed out --

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wouldn't you have an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

anomaly, then, that parents who are not married are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preferred to parents who are married? 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. BROOME:  It -- it does appear at first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

that there is an anomaly there, but that anomaly is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

built into the statute as we see it today. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

The -- if you take the case of the unmarried 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

mother, if she marries the father the day -- the day 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the child is born, the ten-year requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies.  If she marries the father the day after the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child is born, the one-year applies. 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that is true, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

isn't it something else when we devise a remedy that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deepens and extends an equal protection violation?  Have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we ever done that? 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. BROOME:  Well, I don't think the Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

would be extending the -- the equal protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation.  I think that the --

    

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Whatever it is, it 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

wouldn't be gender discrimination. 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. BROOME:  It wouldn't be -- it could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

possibly be a legitimacy discrimination, but I think 

   

   

 

 

 

that that --

 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it would be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

legitimacy discrimination.  The -- the laws that are --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what are they subject to, and the case -- the past cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have involved discrimination against the children of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unwed parents.  And what has -- what is the standard of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

review there? 

 

11 

            

12 

scrutiny. 

13 

            

MR. BROOME:  It's also intermediate 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And have we ever said there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

would be a different level of scrutiny if the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination was against children who were born to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

married parents?  Would you make that argument? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. BROOME:  No, I wouldn't make that 

   

  

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

argument, but I -- I think that that claim, that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

legitimacy claim could be brought by people today, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people who are born to unmarried United States-citizen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

mothers. 

22 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  But to children who 

  

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

are born to unmarried mothers, but not to children who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are born to unmarried fathers, and you would extend the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  You would have this Court extend the problem. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

36 

1 

            

MR. BROOME:  Well, it -- it would -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

same claim could be brought today.  The only difference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is whether or not it could be brought by the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child of a mother or a father.  But I think if you go to 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the heart of the equal protection violation -- violation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, the fact that there may also be a legitimacy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination going on does not eradicate the equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

protection violation.

20 

              

I think the two similarly situated classes 

 

 

 

 

 

here are unmarried United States-citizen fathers and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unmarried United States-citizen mothers, and it quite --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it could be, Justice Alito, that Congress had good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons for treating nonmarital children more leniently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than -- at least in the case of mothers -- than marital 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children, because historically nonmarital children were 

 

 

 

 

 

a much more vulnerable class.  They were the bastards. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They were illegitimate.  And they didn't have the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of rights, and, until 1940, in fact, they didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a statutory right to citizenship.  So it could --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite -- there could be logical reasons for --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And you think that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

Congress' intent in 1952? 

 

 

 

23 

            

24 

this --

 

25 

            

MR. BROOME:  I think in 1940 when -- when 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  In 1940 you think that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

Congress' intent. 

 

2 

            

MR. BROOME:  I think that in Congress' 

    

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

intent, what we've seen from the historical record, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito, is that in 1940, when Congress passed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, it -- it was concerned about nonmarital 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children being separated at the borders from their --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from their guardian parents. 

 

 

 

8 

            

The problem is that Congress assumed or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

the -- the administrative officials who enact -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafted the statute assumed that the -- the guardian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parent was always going to be the mother. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, you can conceive 

    

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

the -- the possibility of members of Congress in 1940 or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1952 taking the floor and arguing, you know, we need to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discriminate against the children of married parents, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and in favor of the children of unmarried parents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. BROOME:  No, I -- I don't think that's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

18 

what was going on at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They were giving -- they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

were -- the one thing I think is they were giving a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit to the unmarried mother. 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. BROOME:  That's correct, 

  

 

 

23 

Justice Ginsburg, and the --

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because they thought she 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

was different from the unmarried father. 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. BROOME:  They -- they presumed that she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

would be -- that's a reflexive assumption that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mother -- at that time, it was a reflexive assumption --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't think it's as true today -- but that the mother 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was going to be the guardian parent, and they wanted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make sure that -- that the physical presence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements that -- that Congress was passing were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to have the impact of separating that nonmarital 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child from who they presumed to be the parent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose -- suppose there 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

were some statistics that would indicate that over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

100,000 new citizens would qualify or new persons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would -- would qualify for citizenship if -- if we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted leveling up.  Would that affect our -- should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that affect our decision? 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. BROOME:  I don't think it -- I don't 

    

   

 

 

 

 

17 

think it should, because at the end of the -- at the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

200,000. 

20 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And outside would gain 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BROOME:  Ultimately, I think the Court 

   

  

 

 

 

21 

22 

has to decide whether or not there is an equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection violation here, whether or not --

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Don't we have to consider 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

what the Congress likely would have intended? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. BROOME:  Yes, and -- and I think what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

39 

the record shows is that given Congress' purpose here --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in fact, if you take either the purpose that -- that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have argued was the purpose of Section 1409, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose that the government has argued, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statelessness purpose, both of those purposes are served 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the remedy we -- we propose, by extending the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits to unmarried -- unmarried fathers.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  If we

12 

leveled up, how would that affect children who were born 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to an -- to a citizen father, who were previously denied 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship, could they come in and claim citizenship 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

now? 

14 

            

MR. BROOME:  If -- only if they satisfied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

all -- all -- all the other statutory requirements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

is yes? 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which means?  The answer 

  

  

 

 

 

MR. BROOME:  Yes, yes, if they satisfied the

other statutory requirements.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The continuous one year.

requirements.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the legitimacy. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOME:  Yes.

it would be -- at first the father would have had to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have sired this child abroad, would have had to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized the child, would have had to support the

child. 

5 

            

6 

            

7 

            

MR. BROOME:  That's correct, yes. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So I don't think that --

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BROOME:  We're talking about a fairly 

   

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

limited class, I think here, Justice Ginsburg, and I --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

I would like to turn to the government's arguments about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the U.S.-connection interest. 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But before you -- before you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

do that, Mr. Broome, just on the remedy question, very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasionally this Court has faced a situation when the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural remedy of something that it is holding.  We were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned a little bit about how -- whether Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would prefer a different remedy. 

   

 

 

17 

            

So, for example, in the Northern Pipeline 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

case, what we did in a situation like that was we stayed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our judgment for a period of time and allowed Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially to do it a different way if it wanted to. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I'm wondering whether you had considered that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility here, that we could order a kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

leveling-up judgment but stay it for some period of time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so that Congress could decide whether it instead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preferred some other way of dealing with the problem, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

1 

whether that would be appropriate? 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. BROOME:  I -- I think, Justice Kagan, 

    

   

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

first and foremost, the Court needs to remedy the equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection violation suffered by the parties.  So if --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if that -- if the Court were to level up and make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent -- Respondent a citizen, and then stay the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment thereafter, I -- you know, I think potentially 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that could work, but certainly --

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What relief -- the relief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

would have been granted to this person.  This is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some kind of class action. 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. BROOME:  Right.  Ultimately, the Court 

  

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

has to decide -- has to remedy the equal protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation before it and -- and not be thinking about --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, it is not trying to remedy an equal protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation only in the future.  And I think that the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental problem with the government's remedy is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it could only apply to unborn children and future 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents, and it would have no impact on anybody who is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected by the statute at issue before the Court today. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Justice Kagan's 

  

 

 

22 

23 

suggestion, Congress apparently should -- should have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been aware of this after our Flores-Villar, but they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

were soporific.

(Laughter.) 

Alderson Reporting Company

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

Kennedy is that since the date that this discriminatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision was first enacted in 1940, it has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistently -- Congress has consistently reduced the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden on -- on fathers.  So I think if -- if the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is, what would Congress do today, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has shown that it is continually reducing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical presence requirements and the age calibration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

component of it to -- so that it has -- precludes the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transfer of citizenship --

 

 

 

11 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but, I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

that argument seems to me that, in other words, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have considered the issue several times, and at no point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did they take the step of eliminating it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MR. BROOME:  That's -- that's correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

Mr. Chief Justice, but they also haven't been confronted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a -- the last time that Congress considered the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute was in 1986, and it -- and it -- an equal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection challenge to these physical presence 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements was not -- was not made until the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Flores-Villar case.  And that was --

  

 

 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why -- why -- why did you

use the word "today"?  I thought what we were supposed 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do is go back and figure out if they had known that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was unconstitutional to give the unmarried woman a

give the unmarried man where he is a citizen eight 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years' requirement, suppose they had known that was

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's a lot easier for you

if it is now, I think. 

   

 

 

 

9 

            

10

it -- is there anything -- I mean, you know, you are not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to help me if you just say that because that's in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your interest to say.  Is there anything that -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you could -- you could point to that would say it's now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not then?

MR. BROOME:  Well, as -- as a practical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

matter, I think that if this -- if the question is how 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would Congress remedy the statute, it -- it can only be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedied by the Congress sitting today. 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that's not

that passed this statute intend. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOME:  And I think the answer to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that -- well, the question is what -- is how the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress would pass the -- if the question is how did

the Congress that passed this statute, how would they

3 

            

4 

            

THE COURT:  Not how they would remedy --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BROOME:  Sorry.  How -- how would they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

remedy that -- that -- that statute if that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What would their

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

understanding have been about the appropriate remedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when they passed the statute? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOME:  I -- I think -- I think the 

    

   

   

 

 

 

answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that they --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they -- they were -- they were -- were concerned that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the physical presence requirements would create a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant burden on -- on marital children, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is why they lowered the requirements for the mother, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they presumed the mother was going to be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guardian and that -- and they -- and they presumed that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the child should stay with mother.  And they didn't want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the physical presence requirements to create further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden on that child -- that -- that relationship. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What the Court -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress in '40 or '52 would do is strange in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, because the Court -- the Congress sitting then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took gender-based lines for granted. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOME:  That's right.  And I think that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

the -- if I could just sort of finish the Chief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

45 

Justice's question, the -- it is not clear at all that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that the 1940 Congress would have chosen to just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sever the 1409(c) entirely.  And I think it would be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just as destructive of Congress' intent to withdraw a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit that Congress plainly intended to confer than it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be to extend the benefit that perhaps Congress did

not --

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So do -- do I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand you to agree that when we approach these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions, severance and remedy, that we do look at what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Congress at the time when they passed the law would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

have done? 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

            

MR. BROOME:  I'm not sure if there is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court could look at what Congress would do today and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Congress has done in the decades since. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did you find any case which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

supports that? 

 

19 

20 

            

MR. BROOME:  No, I haven't. 

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did you find any case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

against it? 

 

22 

            

MR. BROOME:  No case for it or against it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

Justice Breyer. 

 

24 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We're going to find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

lots of cases when we address this question that talks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

1 

about the intent of the Congress that passed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

statute. 

3 

            

MR. BROOME:  Certainly -- certainly there 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

are plenty of cases on -- on that, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But the --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I don't think 

   

  

 

 

 

there are any, but -- you haven't found one, and I don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think anyone could find one. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOME:  But --

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But let's say, when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're looking at a question of congressional intent and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a question of this, we look at what a Congress 60 years 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later would have thought. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOME:  But if -- as -- if we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at --

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that true -- is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

true of, say, Westcott when they -- the category was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unemployed father and -- and it was enlarged to include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unemployed mothers?  Is it true of Goldfarb, the Social 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Security cases when -- what Congress did when it did it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was just a piece with everything where the man was the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dominant person in the family and the woman was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

subordinate person. 

 

24 

            

So to say we want to go back to a Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

that had that mindset and ask what they would have done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

1 

is a little hard. 

   

 

2 

            

3 

            

MR. BROOME:  It is difficult, and -- and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then don't 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

pretend that you're implementing Congress' intent when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say we're going to -- we're going to put in place 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when we're talking about a remedy, not in terms of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding a violation.  Don't pretend that you're 

   

  

 

 

 

implementing Congress' intent when you look at what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress -- a Congress 60 years later would do. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. BROOME:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

you are remedying a gender-discriminatory statute by 

   

 

 

 

 

leveling up or leveling down, you are never implementing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress' intent.  You're trying --

  

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true.  But you can 

  

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

ask, what would they have wanted if they knew they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't make this discrimination?  That's why I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thought, well, if you have to go back to '52, they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to either have to take the benefit away from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

woman or give it to the man.  And the two principles 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that support you is Congress hates taking away a benefit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they give anybody.  They get into a lot of trouble when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they take benefits away. 

 

 

 

23 

            

(Laughter.) 

24 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So that would move them in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

one direction.  And it would also move them in the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

direction if there are just a handful of them who might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really benefit.  That's why I asked that question.  But 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

nobody -- but if there were millions of men who might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit, then they might get a little worried about what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're doing, particularly since they're discriminating 

 

 

 

 

 

even more, you know, the other way against the married 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

couple. 

8 

            

So that's why I was interested in those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

questions.  But I take it you have said pretty much what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can say on that. 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. BROOME:  As to Congress' intent, yes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

Justice Breyer. 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  As to the number --

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

number of people, all you can say is they would have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meet a lot of requirements that you would have -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. citizen sired a child abroad, recognize that child, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

supported that child, and --

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. BROOME:  Right.  You're -- we are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

talking about, I think, a fairly limited class.  These 

   

   

  

 

 

 

are -- this is just children who were born outside of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States to unmarried United States-citizen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fathers who cannot satisfy the ten-year requirement, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they can satisfy the one-year requirement, so they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhere in that nine-year period.  I think that --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Perhaps you're assuming 

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

49

2

4

6 

Justice Ginsburg's point that the father still has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have legitimatized the child without marriage.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if they married the mother, they would end up having to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fulfill the five-year.  So it would have to be -- are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you accepting her proposition that the father has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimatize the child? 

 

 

7 

            

MR. BROOME:  We're not -- we're certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

not challenging the legitimation requirement. 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that -- that's 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

statutory and also the support requirement.  Now, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

may be independently challengeable, but they are --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. BROOME:  And I think in this case they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

could be, because this is -- this is a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement than -- than what was at issue in the Nguyen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  In Nguyen, the Court addressed a paternal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

acknowledgement requirement and said, well, that is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimal burden for the five-year satisfied.  He can --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he is not similarly situated as -- with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

biological proof of his relationship with the child. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But the requirement that he then come forward and take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some affirmative step to demonstrate that by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledging the child, that -- that is -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfies intermediate scrutiny. 

 

 

24 

            

But here we're talking about a legitimation 

   

 

 

 

 

25 

requirement.  And if, as the Historians have pointed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

out -- the -- the Historian amicus brief points out, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that legitimation really meant marriage, then that is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much more significant burden placed on the father 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the father may not be able to -- may not be able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to satisfy that requirement at all.  For example, if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mother is not around -- is not available, if she doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to marry the father, or if she is dead. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

married. 

10 

            

11 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or if she is already 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BROOME:  Or if she is already married. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where is the legitimation 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

requirement?  I see 8 U.S.C. 1409(c).  It doesn't say a 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

word about legitimation. 

 

 

14 

            

15 

            

MR. BROOME:  It's in 1409(a). 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, 1409(a) doesn't 

  

 

 

 

16 

apply.  It says "notwithstanding subsection A." 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

            

18 

            

MR. BROOME:  Right.  And so the --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It says:  "Notwithstanding 

  

  

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

subsection (a), somebody who is born outside the U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of wedlock shall be held to have acquired at birth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the nationality status of his mother if the mother is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. citizen and had been physically in the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States for one year." 

 

 

 

            

So I don't see anything that says they have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be legitimized for the mother to get that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

1 

            

MR. BROOME:  In 1409(a), it applies only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

after -- after there's been --

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  In 1409(a).  And what the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

first words of (c) are, "notwithstanding the provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of subsection A."  Anyway, I guess I could figure it out 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

later. 

7 

            

MR. BROOME:  Well, no. 

  

 

 

8 

            

(Laughter.) 

9 

            

MR. BROOME:  Let me see if I can try and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

help you, Justice Breyer. 

 

 

 

11 

            

The remedy imposed by the Court of Appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

is to -- as 1401(a)(7), which the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical-presence requirement, the ten- and five-year 

 

 

 

 

 

physical-presence requirement, the Court of Appeals --

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that applies through 1409(a).  1409(a) is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that applies to fathers. 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

So the -- the remedy would be to apply the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

one-continuous-year rule in 1401(a)(7) -- and I grant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you this is complicated -- 1401(a)(7) as it -- as it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies through 1409(a).  And that would put mothers and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fathers on equal footing with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical-presence requirements.  And then the 

  

 

 

 

legitimation requirement still applies to fathers. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But if I could address the -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government's U.S.-connection interest in my time 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

remaining. 

2 

            

The statute here absolutely bars a

10 

11

19 

U.S.-citizen father under the age of 19 from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transmitting citizenship to his foreign-born child, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the father spent his entire life in the United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up until the day the child is born, and even if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

father legitimates the child and seeks to raise the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child in the United States. 

 

 

 

 

            

By contrast, the statute automatically 

 

 

 

 

confers citizenship on a child whose U.S.-citizen mother 

   

 

 

 

 

 

spent only a year of her life at any point in her 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time -- any point in her life, even during infancy, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if the -- even if the mother marries the alien 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

father, and then -- and then the child is raised by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mother and the alien father. 

 

 

 

 

            

It is impossible to view a statute that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

permits these results as related to a U.S.-connection 

   

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  And I would submit, Your Honor, that the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

statelessness interest does not justify the 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

discrimination either. 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

There is no dispute here that the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creates a risk of statelessness for children born abroad 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to unmarried United States-citizen fathers who 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate their children but who cannot satisfy the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ten -- ten- and five-year physical-presence requirement.

And the statute -- the -- the statute confers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship on a child born abroad to an unmarried 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States-citizen mother, even if that child 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faces -- even if her child faces no risk of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statelessness at all because she is born -- the child is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

born in a country that assigns citizenship by virtue of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being born there.

point is that her child may have no risk -- face no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk -- risk of statelessness at all, and -- and yet, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute still confers citizenship --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I just said they do. 

    

 

 

 

 

Because the mother can only pass on citizenship if she's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been in the United States continuously for one year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior to the birth of the child, correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOME:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what happens to a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

citizen mother who can't meet that one-year requirement? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What happens to her child? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BROOME:  That -- that child could be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

stateless.  That child is not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So there is a risk of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

2 

statelessness no matter what? 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. BROOME:  There is a risk of 

   

  

 

 

 

4 

5

7 

8

10 

11 

12 

statelessness, but that risk of statelessness is created 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by these physical-presence requirements that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

chose to impose, whether it's the mother or the father. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The risk is greater with respect to the fathers.  It is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lesser with respect to the mothers.  But it is these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical-presence requirements that create the risk of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statelessness, and therefore, this scheme cannot be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justified as seeking to reduce a risk of statelessness. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If the Court has no further questions, thank

Three minutes, Mr. Kneedler. 

 

 

 

         

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

First, on the merits.  The provision here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

furnished two substantial governmental interests.  At 

  

 

 

 

 

the time the child is born, and there is only the mother 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that as a recognized parent, it is uncertain whether the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child will ever be legitimated. 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress has a substantial interest in 

   

 

 

 

conferring citizenship on that child at birth if it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

55 

1 

concludes that there is a sufficient connection to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

United States. 

 

3 

            

Congress also has a substantial interest in 

   

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

not divesting that child of citizenship if the child is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later legitimated by an alien father.  So there are two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial interests that are furthered, and it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely tailored to take care of those two interests. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if you're concerned 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

about the stateless children in the world, then -- if --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you have a problem with the father who can't transmit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his citizenship in a country where women citizenship 

   

 

 

 

 

 

goes by who is the father. 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it -- it -- if the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

if the father later legitimates, he's put in the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position as if the -- if they were married at the time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the child was born.  And we know from 1401 that that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that is a -- that that is a --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But today there are --

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

today there are lots of fathers who do look after their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children.  I don't say they do it perfectly, but they 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

try. 

22 

            

23 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but all --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, suppose just the words 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

you said, take the same words, just put in "father" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead of "mother," and today why is it any different?

1 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it -- it isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

different.  I -- I just want to repeat again.  When the 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

father legitimates, there are two parents.  In Lehr v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

Robertson --

 

5 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

legitimacy.  I'm talking about the ones -- a surprising 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

number of people, unfortunately, never get married.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a lot of them do live abroad, and they do have children. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, certainly --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So that's one focus.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

certainly your words applied where it is the mother. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And all my question is, couldn't you take those same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words and apply it where it is the father? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I -- I think it's a 

    

   

  

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

critical importance in citizenship laws to have a legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurrence in order to pass citizenship, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimation.  Your suggestion that you could -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the father could pass on citizenship without even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimation, which this Court basically sustained on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

the --

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Doesn't (c) say that? 

  

 

 

 

 

Doesn't (c) say that? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  But -- but this is a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of remedy.  And -- and to -- to -- but -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also Lehr v. Robertson, if the father filed -- filed a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

57 

notice and -- or filed a document and got notice of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding, he didn't get the veto power that the mother 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had before legitimation.  He just got to be a parent 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

too.  And that's exactly what happens here when the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

father legitimates.  He's not put in the same position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the mother because of two parents; it's a two-parent

family. 

8 

            

With respect to remedy, let me point out at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

page 38 of our brief where the statelessness is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed.  It's clear the interests that I identify, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that Congress wanted to ensure that the child would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship at birth and not be divested. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13
