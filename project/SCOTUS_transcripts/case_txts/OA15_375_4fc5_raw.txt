CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  15­375,  Supap  Kirtsaeng  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

John  Wiley  &  Sons. 

   

 

            

Mr.  Rosenkranz. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  E.  JOSHUA  ROSENKRANZ 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice,  and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  Congress  modified  the  American  Rule  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Copyright  Act,  it  was  not  just  trying  to  punish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  who  took  unreasonable  positions.  It  wanted  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

encourage  parties  to  advance  important  principles  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  other  side's  arguments  are  good;  indeed,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say,  especially  where  the  other  side's  arguments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  good. 

 

            

When  a  defendant  is  trying  to  decide  whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  fight  for  a  principle,  the  availability  of  attorneys' 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  can  make  all  the  difference  in  that  decision,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  turn  can  make  all  the  difference  in  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public's  rights  are  vindicated. 

 

 

 

            

The  Second  Circuit's  standard  flouts.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

plain  language  of  the  statute  undermines  Congress's  goal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  is  consistent  with  this  Court's  opinion  in  Fogerty.

It  does  nothing  to  encourage  a  defendant  who  has  a  good 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  but  is  facing  off  against  a  powerful  adversary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

armed  with  a  reasonable  position.  That  encouragement 

   

  

 

 

 

has  not  happened  once  in  the  last  15  years.  That's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once  in  187  cases  decide  ­­ decided  under  the  Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's  Matthew  Bender  rubric,  and  will  never  happen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anywhere  outside  the  Second  Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Rosenkranz,  if 

  

 

 

 

Kirtsaeng  had  lost  this  case  ­­ if  he  had  lost  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  should  fees  have  been  awarded  to  Wiley,  given  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significance  of  this  decision?  I  mean,  it's  an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

important  decision.  It  needs  both  sides  to  be  aired 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  Court.  So  suppose  he  had  lost  and  Wiley  won, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  Wiley  be  entitled  to  attorneys'  fees? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Wiley  would  have  an 

  

 

 

 

 

argument,  Your  Honor,  certainly  on  one  of  the  factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  have  suggested,  which  is  it  would  say  we  won  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  case.  It  didn't  win  it  against  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  would  have  had  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

than  that.  It  would  have  had  circuit  precedent.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  have  been  woefully  infringing,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Not  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  I  were  going  to  bet, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I  would  say  yes  to  that  question.  Wouldn't  you? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  I'm  sorry.  Our  client

would  have  been  ­­ was  already  found  to  have  woefully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringed. 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 

  

 

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  So  our  client  had  a  lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

already  weighing  against  him. 

 

 

 

            

But  just  to  get  back  to  finish  the  answer  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg's  question,  but  there  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  factors.  The  Court  would  have  ­­ the  district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  would  have  evaluated  what  the  incentives  for  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sides  were.  So  Wiley  would  have  had  an  enormous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic  incentive  to  advance  its  position.  Kirtsaeng 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  had  much  less  of  an  incentive  to  do  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  than  to  cave. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Why?  It  was  a  lucrative 

   

  

  

 

 

business  he  was  engaged  in. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Your  Honor,  he  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

student  who  had  this  side  business  who  was  making  just  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

few  dollars  per  book.  I  mean,  it  was  a  ­­ it  was  a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

large  volume,  but  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Several  hundred  thousand. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Several  hundred  thousand 

  

 

 

 

dollars  in  revenues,  Your  Honor,  but  not  in  profit.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  to  Wiley  ­­ as  to  the  books  of  Wiley  that  he  sold,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  $37,000,  Your  Honors,  for  which  he  was  hit  with  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$600,000  judgment,  which  also  would  have  been  considered

by  the  district  court.  It  would  have  thought  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  asked  itself:  Is  this  fair? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  problem  with  the  Second  Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  is  that  it  prejudges  in  every  case  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  substantial  weight  on  the  reasonableness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Rosenkranz,  just  to 

  

 

 

 

 

continue  on  with  what  Justice  Ginsburg  was  asking  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As  an  ex­post  matter,  you  have  a  great  David  versus 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goliath  story  to  tell.  But  as  an  ex­ante  matter,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wonder  if  the  rule  that  you  suggest  is  not  going  to  harm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Kirtsaengs  of  the  world. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  you  know,  you  might  take  these  couple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  into  account:  That  the  Kirtsaengs  of  the  world 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  probably  think  that  the  ­­ that  they  are  spending 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  on  their  lawyers  than  the  John  Wileys  of  the  world. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  they're  also  more  risk  averse,  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  less  money.  So,  you  know,  given  those  two  factors, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  your  rule,  actually  as  an  ex­ante  matter,  cut 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  Kirtsaengs  of  the  world? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Your  Honor,  the  answer  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

no,  and  for  this  reason.  The  Kirtsaengs  of  the  world, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  they  are  facing  off  against  a  John  Wiley,  the  first 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  on  their  minds  before  they  ever  think  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys'  fees  being  awarded  against  them  is  how  am  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  pay  for  this?  And  critical  answer  to  that

question  will  be  in  many  circumstances,  there's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

availability  of  attorneys'  fees  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  but  that's  only  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

side  of  the  question.  I  mean,  what  you're  doing  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  upping  the  stakes  generally  so  that  Kirtsaeng  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  know,  well,  it's  true  I  might  be  able  to  get  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  back;  but  at  the  same  time,  I  run  the  risk  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  to  pay  John  Wiley's  fees.  And  John  Wiley,  as  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  is  probably  going  to  be  paying  its  lawyers  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  I'm  going  to  be  paying  mine.  And  I'm  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk­sensitive  as  a  Kirtsaeng  type.  So  that's  a  huge 

   

   

  

 

 

 

deal  for  me  to  increase  my  stakes  that  much. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Your  Honor,  understood. 

  

 

 

 

That  will  be  part  of  the  calculus. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  in  the  Ninth  Circuit  where  the  test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  are  suggesting  predominates,  and  in  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit  that  doesn't  accept  the  Second  Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position,  which  is  to  say  every  other  circuit,  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  dearth  of  copyright  litigation.  People  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Kirtsaeng's  position  are  fighting  ahead.  And  why  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that?  It's  because  district  courts  have  been  entrusted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  making  reasonable  judgments  and  asking  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question:  If  a  defendant  is  in  exactly  this  position  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  next  case,  what  are  the  incentives  that  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriately  incentivize  both  the  plaintiff  to  push  on

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  they  don't  in

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Then  the  truth  is  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  few  starving  artists  in  any  copyright  litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So,  yes,  they  may  show  up,  but  they  won't  be  able  to  pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  their  own  lawyer.  And  so  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Do  you  suggest  that  one  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  solutions  to  that  problem  is  for  the  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  take  into  account  the  relative  financial  resources  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  parties;  is  that  correct? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  as  ­­ as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  the  factors.  So  what  the  district  court  should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  in  every  case,  in  addition  to  all  of  the  footnote  19 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors,  is  to  ask  itself:  If  a  ­­ if  a  party  in  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  position  reads  the  precedents  or  their  lawyers  read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  precedents,  what  lessons  will  they  glean  from  them? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  one  of  the  things  a  district  court  should  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analyzing  in  every  case  looking  backwards  is:  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  been  the  right  economic  incentives  for  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  and  this  defendant? 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  there  anything  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Have  we  ever  said  in  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  we  ever  said  that  the  availability  of  attorneys' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  is  dependent  on  the  financial  resources  of  the

party? 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Your  Honor,  it's  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  ­­ it  has  long  been  a  part  of  the  standard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  courts  have  consistently  applied  in  attorneys'  fees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  This  Court  said  in  Fogerty  you've  got  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluate  the  incentives,  and  the  incentives  run  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways. 

              

A  John  Wiley  did  not  need  attorneys'  fees  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  to  proceed,  and  was  not  worried  about  attorneys' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees,  in  order  to  protect  its  interest  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$1.8­billion­a­year  business  for  which,  on  this 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  issue,  it  stood  to  gain  hundreds  of  millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  dollars.  It  wasn't  worried  about  whether  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  pay  Sam  Israel's  $125,000  in  fees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A  Kirtsaeng,  on  the  other  hand,  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  worried  about  that  under  ­­ under  any  standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  in  a  standard  where  he  stands  to  gain  attorneys' 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  for  defending,  that  would  have  been  an  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive  to  ­­ to  encourage  him  to  soldier  on  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Rosenkranz  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  ­­ under  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ it  does  sound  like,  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan  put  it,  that  your  rule  is  if  David  faces 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goliath  and  David  wins,  David  gets  fees  no  matter  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  Goliath's  position  was.  That's  what  it  seems

to  come  down  to. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Your  Honor,  it  doesn't.  On 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  factor  of  ­­ I  mean,  there  are  easily  six  factors  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  should  be  considering.  On  that  factor,  a  David  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

better  positioned  than  a  Goliath  to  make  the  argument 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  should  get  fees.  But  there's  a  lot  more  to  it. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's,  what  else  does  the  defendant  stand  to  gain? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  does  the  plaintiff  stand  to  gain?  What  were  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivations  of  the  parties? 

 

 

 

            

One  of  the  factors  that  the  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  was  completely  irrelevant  was,  what  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significance  of  the  win  to  the  public?  So  all  of  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  one  thing  that  concerns 

  

 

 

 

 

 

me  about  a  test  like  that,  Mr.  Rosenkranz,  is  it's  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard  for  people  to  make  judgments  ex  ante  and  to  figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  what  their  chances  are.  It's  very  hard  to  predict. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  you're  concerned  about  the  Kirtsaengs  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world,  the  Davids  in  these  kinds  of  suits,  what  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  want  is  a  pretty  clear  safe  harbor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  other  words,  if  I'm  taking  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

position,  I'm  not  going  to  be  stuck  with  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side's  fees,  which  are  likely  to  dwarf  my  own.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  something  that  somebody  can  predict,  as  opposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  this  22­factor  test,  which  it's  like  I  just  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  how  this  is  going  to  come  out,  and  I  might  well  be

stuck  with  John  Wiley's  fees,  depending  on  what  judge  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draw  and,  oh,  a  number  of  other  things  that  I  don't  have 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  control  over. 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Understood,  Your  Honor.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

what  the  ­­ what  the  Congress  did  was  to  select  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  based  upon  the  totality  of  the  circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  affirmatively  rejected  the  standard  that  sat  there  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Patent  Act  and  in  the  Lanham  Act  that  was  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  clear  line  that  you've  described,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  exceptional  circumstances. 

 

 

            

To  this  day,  Wiley  has  not  explained  how  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  is  any  different  from  the  one  that  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted.  It's  exactly  what  Justice  Kennedy  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  is  ­­ what  about  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose  I  start  this  thinking  district  judges  do  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

job.  In  part  of  that  job,  they  do  things  that  we  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  worse,  not  better.  And  one  of  the  things  that  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  is  the  case  in  front  of  them.  And  what  we  said  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ our  case  was:  It's  up  to  them  as  long  as  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act  reasonably.  So  you  started  with  a  factor,  which  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  they  could  have  taken  into  account.  Nothing  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  law  prohibits  it.  In  fact,  it  encourages  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what's  the  problem?  What  is  it?  Are  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  we  should,  in  fact,  change  what  we  said  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fogerty?  In  my  own  mind,  I  don't  know  how  to  do  it.

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  No,  Your  Honor.  I  ­­

    

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  So  you  don't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

want  to  believe  that.  Okay.  So  you  want  case­specific 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

correction  of  what  you  believe  is  a  failure  to  apply  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

realize  what  Fogerty  meant.  Is  that  the  idea? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  So  let  me 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  more  precise. 

 

 

            

I've  already  said  one  of  the  things  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  with  the  Matthew  Bender  standard,  that  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

atextual. 

              

A  second  thing,  directly  to  the  question  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fogerty,  is  that  Fogerty  says,  quote,  "defendants  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seek  to  advance  meritorious  copyright  defenses  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encouraged  to  litigate  them.  There"  is  nothing  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Matthew  Bender  that  encourages  a  defender  to  litigate. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  but  you  want  us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case­specific  or  you  want  us  to  say  something?  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  ­­ one  whole  ­­ one  result  would  be  the  Second

which  is  that  all  considerations  ­­ all  considerations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  consistent  with  the  purposes  of  the  Copyright 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  can  be  relevant.  It  depends  on  the  case,  period. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Absolutely,  Your  Honor.

thing,  which  I  don't  know  how  to  do.  The  other  thing  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  you  really  advance  the  law.  I  mean,  maybe  at 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time,  Marbury  v.  Madison  was  viewed  by  many  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  being  just  about  an  appointment,  and  it  didn't  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advance  the  law. 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Maybe  others  thought  it 

  

 

 

 

 

did.  I  don't  know.  How  do  we  know  which  advances  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law? 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Your  Honor,  district  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

know  what  cases  are  advancing  the  law  and  what  cases  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  specific  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Rosenkranz,  I  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

think  that  Justice  Breyer  is  getting  to  something. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Put  on  a  hat  that  doesn't  want  to  win 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

outright.  Okay?  Put  on  a  hat  where  we're  trying  to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

announce  a  rule.  And  I'm  sympathetic  to  your  argument 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Second  Circuit  rule  obviously  stacks  everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  favor  of  a  winning  plaintiff,  publish  a  winning 

   

   

 

 

 

 

copyright  holder  because  80  percent  are  now  winning,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  more.  In  the  Second  Circuit,  it's  almost  89 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent.  It  means,  when  you're  talking  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness  of  a  ­­ a  winning  party's  position,  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

most  cases  the  copyright  holder  has  a  reasonable

position. 

15 

at  what  happened  after  Fogerty,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ after  Fogerty 
 

 

 

 

and  Fantasy,  that's  where  the  Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  tests  began. 

 

 

  

And  the  Court  there  said  there's 

 

 

 

 

 

different  incentives 
 

 

for  plaintiffs  and  defendants.  You 

  

 

 

 

can't  make  the  reasonableness  of  the  position  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

centerpiece  for  prevailing  defendants,  or  otherwise, 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  never  going  to  get  fees,  or  hardly  ever. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  going  back  to  Justice  Breyer's  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  do  we  articulate  what  the  Second  Circuit  is  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  without  necessarily  endorsing  all  of  the  factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Ninth  Circuit? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Understood,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

The  simple  answer  is:  What  the  Second  Circuit  did  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  pick  one  factor  out  of  a  jumble  of  possible  factors 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say,  this  will  be  the  one  that  gets  substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight.  And  what  the  district  courts  do  with  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  hold  up  that  one  factor  and  ask,  is  there  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  outweighs  that  factor  when,  in  the  context  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  case,  that  might  not  be  the  most  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor? 

            

But  I  see  the  Court  wrestling  with  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  the  test  would  be, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  okay  to  have  it  one  among  others,  but  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  that  says  that's  always  going  to  entitle  you

to  defend  against  an  award  or  to  win  an  award. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Agreed.  And  what  Matthew 

  

  

 

 

 

Bender  does  is  essentially  to  announce  a  presumption. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  see  the  Court  wrestling  with  ­­ with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  to  articulate  a  test.  I  can  articulate  the  test  in 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

four  sentences  in  a  way  the  district  courts  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

administer. 

            

So  our  rule  is  that  a  district  court  should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  the  totality  of  the  circumstances,  including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  the  Fogerty  factors,  and  ask  itself,  would  a  fee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award  here  advance  the  purposes  of  the  Copyright  Act? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is  this  the  sort  of  case  in  which,  if  the  same  scenario

litigation  incentives  on  both  sides  of  the  deed,

That  is  ­­ if  ­­ if  this  Court  were  to  say

too,  actually  does  it  right  ­­ it  didn't  just  consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  incentives  on  one  side.  It  considered  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  incentives  for  the  plaintiffs. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  it  seems  to  me  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ a  ­­ a  party  can  advance  the  law  and  a  ­­ a  case 

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  advance  the  law  by  insisting  on  principled, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  application  of  settled  principles.  That's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

advancing  of  the  law.  I  ­­ I  can  see  the  excitement 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  granting  fees  if  there's  some  ­­ some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breakthrough,  something  we've  never  thought  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On  the  other  hand,  there's  something  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commendable  about  applying  the  law  consistently, 

 

 

 

 

 

routinely  in  regular  cases.  That  advances  the  law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Of  ­­ of  course,  it  does. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  in  the  right  case,  that  can  support  a  fees 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award.  For  example,  the  only  way  to  define  fair  use  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case­by­case,  accretively  where  a  common  law  develops. 

   

 

 

 

 

Someone  who  advances  a  fair  use  defense  and  wins  ought

back  to  your  test  now?  Would  you  say  we'll  make  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  district  courts  can  understand  and  readily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply? 

            

So  take  my  question.  Kirtsaeng  loses  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Wiley  win  ­­ wins.  Apply  your  four­sentence  test,  and

tell  me  whether  Wiley  gets  fees. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  The  answer  will  depend  on  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court's  specific  balancing,  but  I'll  do  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance  that  I  would  do  ­­ that  I  would  argue  to  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court. 

 

              

I  would  say,  well,  first,  Wiley  did  win 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  really  big  here.  Although  it  wasn't  against 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

huge  headwinds,  the  precedent  was  in  its  favor.  Good 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  Wiley.  It  gets  credit  for  that.  But  Wiley  had 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  incentive  to  protect  hundreds  of  millions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars.  It  didn't  need  attorneys'  fees  in  order  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentivize  it. 

 

            

Kirtsaeng  also  did  something  important.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

stood  up  ­­ he  stood  up.  He  had  a  reasonable  position. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  counts.  It's  not  dispositive,  but  it  counts.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  good  would  it  have  ­­ would  it  have  future 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigants  ­­ would  it  do  for  future  litigants  to  hit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  poor  guy  who  is  a  student  with  attorneys'  fees  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  already  got  a  $600,000  judgment  against  him? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  would  be  my  advocacy.  I  could  see  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  adopting  it.  I  could  see  a  district 

    

   

 

 

 

 

court  going  the  other  way.  But  a  common  law  will 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

emerge,  as  it  has  in  the  Ninth  Circuit.  Impecunious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants  are  not  shying  away  from  fighting  a  big 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright  Goliath  if  they  can  afford  the  lawsuit  that  is

against  attorneys'  fees  if  the  other  side  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ­­ can  I  ask, 

   

   

  

 

 

Mr.  Rosenkranz,  one  of  the  things  that  confused  me  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  and  about,  actually,  both  sides'  arguments, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  don't  really  understand  why  it  is  that  the  fees 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  awarded  in  such  a  high  percentage  of  the  cases,  both 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Second  Circuit  and  elsewhere.  I  mean,  the  Second 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  says  that  its  ­­ the  first­among­equal  factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  reasonableness,  but  it  awards  fees  in  more  ­­ way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  half  the  cases.  Is  it  that  so  many  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  are  utterly  frivolous? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  So,  Your  Honor,  the  answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  two  parts:  There  is  a  different  test  for  defendants 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  for  plaintiffs,  notwithstanding  what  you  read  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Matthew  Bender.  So  the  plaintiff  ­­

me  about  the  ­­ the  way  this  might  or  might  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pro­plaintiff  or  pro­defendant,  just  why  are  they  all  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high? 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Well  ­­ well,  the  numbers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  so  high  for  plaintiffs  because  plaintiffs  are

was  perfectly  reasonable,  because  there's  a

fees.  And  by  the  way,  there's  often  willfulness,  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  in  this  case,  because  a  legal  defense  is  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense. 

            

On  the  defendant's  side  ­­ and  the  Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  is  certainly  not  more  than  half.  It's  around 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half.  And  that's  only  where  the  other  side  has  behaved 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonably,  either  in  its  litigation  position,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  the  validity  of  its  claim,  or  in  its  litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position's  sort  of  aggressive  tactics. 

 

 

 

 

            

Those  are  the  only  circumstances  in  178 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  in  which  defendants  have  ever  had  copyright  fees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awarded  in  their  favor.  And  this  is  something  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  have  yet  to  hear  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  you  know,  it's  ­­ I

copyright.  That  would  be  outrageous,  right?  That's  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  read  that  in  the  papers  and  other  places  as  a  problem.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Maybe,  from  time  to  time, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  copyright  owners  feel  that,  you  know,  my  employees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  pay  for  gasoline  at  Exxon;  why  should  Exxon's

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Sure,  Your  Honor.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

that's  why  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  So  we  have  no  idea 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

why  ­­ at  least  from  these  briefs,  I  have  no  idea  why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  copyright  numbers  come  out  the  way  they  do  on  fees; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  I'm  thinking,  quite  honestly,  it's  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vary  from  case  to  case.  I  understand  appellate  lawyers

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Yes.  Yes.  And  I  would 

   

  

  

  

 

also  encourage  the  Court  to  say  when  ­­ when  a  district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  is  evaluating  each  factor,  it  should  be  thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  itself,  what's  the  purpose  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  have  added  a  couple  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

standards.  Your  first  two  sentences  were  fine.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  roughly  what  ­­ what  we've  been  talking  about.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  you  had  two  later  sentences  which  I  began  to  think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hey,  that's  going  to  be  a  little  tough  to  apply. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Your  Honor,  my  later 

  

 

 

 

 

sentences  ­­ you're  ­­ you  are  right,  were  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences.  One  is:  Think  of  the  Fogerty  factors  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Footnote  9  and  do  it  through  the  lens  of  the  purposes  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Copyright  Act.  And  the  second  is:  By  the  way, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fogerty  was  about  more  than  footnote  19.  It  was  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentivizing  each  side  correctly.  Don't  forget  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that.  So  consider  the  incentives  on  both  sides. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  The  problem  with  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  different  judges  are  going  to  have  very  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

views  about  what  will  further  the  purposes  of  the

Circuit  think  that  their  rules  are  the  rules  that  best 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  the  purposes  of  the  Copyright  Act? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

that's  why  both  of  them  are  wrong.  I  would  love  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  to  adopt  the  Seventh  Circuit's  standard,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too  prejudges  ­­ in  every  case  it  says  here's  what  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further  the  purposes  of  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  ­­ the  footnote  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  say  further  the  purposes  of  the  Act.  What  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote  says  is,  Judge,  when  you  award  these  fees,  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  that  you  are  faithful  to  the  purposes  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act.  And  that's  very  different.  It  means  don't  do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that's  going  to  undermine  the  Act,  as  opposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  sitting  there  and  figuring  out  whether  the  basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  the  Act  is  to  what  extent  to  encourage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authors  at  the  expense  of  the  readers,  or  the  expense  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  people  who  do  not  want  to  undergo  huge  transaction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs  getting  ahold  of  dead  authors,  all  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  have  several  different  conflicting 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes.  You  want  to  bring  them  in  when  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"further,"  and  the  court  did  not  bring  them  in  because

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  PAUL  M.  SMITH 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

This  is  a  case,  I  submit,  where  the  lower 

   

   

 

 

 

 

courts  did  everything  right.  As  courts  have  been  doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  copyright  cases  for  more  than  a  century,  the  district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  focused  first  on  the  question  of  whether  or  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  losing  party,  here  Wiley,  had  ­­ had  taken  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable  litigation  position  on  the  law  or  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts,  and  concluded  that  it  obviously  had  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  it  looked  at  all  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially  relevant  factors,  including  all  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors  that  had  been  suggested  by  Kirtsaeng's  counsel,

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Except  there  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Smith,  I'm  trying  by  what's  happening  in  the  Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit.  I've  actually,  with  the  help  of  the  library, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked  at  cases  in  the  Second  and  the  Ninth  Circuit  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  last  three  years,  and  this  is  what  I'm  coming  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with:  In  the  Ninth  Circuit,  prevailing  defendants  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

received  fees  20  times  and  lost  17  times,  about  50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent.  In  the  Second  circuit,  prevailing  defendants 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  received  fees  three  times  and  lost  16  times. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  a  huge  difference. 

   

 

            

If  I  look  at  what's  happening  with 

   

 

 

 

 

prevailing  plaintiffs,  in  the  Second  Circuit,  prevailing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  awarded  fees  23  times,  and  prevailing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  denied  fees  seven.  In  the  Ninth,  prevailing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  got  it  46  times  and  denied  fees  twice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Prevailing  plaintiffs  are  winning  everywhere 

 

 

 

 

in  extraordinary  numbers.  And  in  both  circuits, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prevailing  defendants  are  not  winning  hardly  at  all.  At 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best,  50  percent  in  the  Ninth  Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  does  it  say  something  that  somehow, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailing  ­­ that  this  presumption  that  the  Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  is  giving  is  unfair  to  defendants  and  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  of  the  copyright  law? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  No,  your  Honor.  First  of  all,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  note  that  Mr.  Kirtsaeng's  own  attorneys  have

The  ­­

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Sorry.  Five­oh,  50? 

  

  

 

 

 

MR.  SMITH:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  That's  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

their  reply  brief. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  that  was  a  study 

   

  

 

 

 

from  2000,  correct? 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  No,  no,  no.  They  did  ­­ they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  their  own  study,  and  ­­ and  they  reported  that  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reply  brief  and  said  they  would  provide  the  data  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  want. 

 

            

The  80  percent  figure  that  they  report  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  in  the  Second  Circuit  includes,  by  the  way,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

great  number  of  default  judgments  where  fees  are  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  small  and  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Having  practiced  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

area,  I  know  you're  right. 

   

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  So,  you  know,  these  statistics 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  be  thrown  around,  but  it  is  not  as  if  defendants  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  are  not  succeeding  in  getting  attorneys'  fees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  they're  appropriate,  but  what  you  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  ­­ but  isn't  there  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  in  having  one  factor  outweigh  all  others?  It's

much  harder  to  start  a  ­­ with  a  presumption  up  here  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  other  factors  have  to  tie  against  that  one  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overcome  it. 

 

            

            

MR.  SMITH:  But  it's  the  fact  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  don't  we  just  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fogerty  factors,  which  are  it's  one  among  many? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Your  Honor,  two  ­­ two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

responses.  First  of  all,  when  people  ­­ when  judges  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  discretion  to  award  fees,  looking  at  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

losing  party  had  a  substantial  case  or  not  is  something 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  instinctively  you  arrive  at.  That's  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  you  ­­ you  enunciated  in  Octane  for  the  patent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  the  standard  that  you  enunciated  in  Martin  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal  statute.  Of  course  that's  what  you  give  a  lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  primacy  to  in  deciding  whether,  in  your  discretion  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges,  you're  going  to  shift  fees  for  ­­ alter  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American  Rule  or  not.  That's  just  natural.  It  ­­ it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  courts  have  been  doing  under  the  Copyright  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  1909. 

 

            

That  is  the  ­­ the  law  that  was  reported  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  when  they  reenacted  this  ­­ this  provision  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1976,  in  the  Brown  Study,  in  the  register  report. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  understood  that  it  ­­ what  the  ­­ what  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  the  rule  works  is  that  fees  are  being  shifted  when

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  since  most 

  

 

 

 

plaintiffs  are  not  going  to  sue  unless  their  position  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguably,  reasonably  present,  shouldn't  we  be  looking  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  reasonable  the  defendant's  position  was? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  You  do  when  they  ­­ when  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  wins. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  When  the  defendant  wins. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  When  the  defendant  wins,  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  rule  that  says  we're  going  to  shift  fees  against 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  plaintiffs,  then  you're  going  to  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  incentives.  When  you  have  a  case  where  both  sides 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  reasonable  position,  what  you're  trying  to  do  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case  under  Fogerty  is  incentivize  both  parties  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keep  litigating  so  that  the  law  can  be  clarified. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  ­­ this  is  a  classic  example  here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

This  is  a  case  that  was  a  complete  coin  flip  because  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  was  totally  indeterminant.  Nobody  knew  whether  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first­sale  doctrine  applied  here  or  didn't  apply  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  was  no  law  in  the  Second  Circuit  when  the  case  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed.  By  the  time  the  case  gets  to  this  Court,  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  already  ruled  4­to­4  that  the  ­­ on  the  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  nobody  ­­ it  was  ­­ it  was  a  coin  flip. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  that  situation,  the  last  thing  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  do  to  the  parties,  if  you're  trying  to  get  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  keep  litigating  so  that  they  ­­ the  issue  gets

clarified  is  tell  them,  oh,  by  the  way,  we're  going  to

and  whoever  loses  is  going  to  have  to  pay  double. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  just  not  the  way  risk­averse,  profit­maximizing

of  the  case. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  As  you  understand  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  position,  do  they  take  the  argument  you've

MR.  SMITH:  Excuse  me? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  He's  departing  from  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

So  you  say,  just  don't  say  never.  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeed,  the  Second  Circuit  did  say  never.  It  said  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  should  not  award  attorneys'  fees  where  the  case  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

novel  or  close  because  such  a  litigation  clarifies  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

boundaries  of  copyright  law. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Certainly  did  not  say  never, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  The  rule  in  the  Second  Circuit  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  factors  can  overrule  that,  and  indeed,  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  ­­ the  Second  Circuit  has  so  said.  They  have  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  way  they  wrote  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here,  and  they  were  quoting,  it  says,  "As  this  Court  has

That's  ­­ and  what  they  do  is  they  quote. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  says,  "As  this  Court  recently  explained."  And  it

this  factor,  if  I'm  a  district  judge  and  I'm  thinking, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  who  likes  to  be  overruled  by  the  Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit,  it  does  seem  as  though  it  sends  a  pretty  strong 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signal  to  district  courts  that  this  is  the  key  factor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  they  are  not  ­­ you  know,  probably  not  in  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lifetimes  going  to  see  a  case  in  which  that  factor  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outweighed. 

            

MR.  SMITH:  The  fact  that  ­­ that  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

outweigh  it,  and  has  outweighed  it,  is  litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct.  So  you  end  up  in  the  Second  Circuit  with  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  very  much  like  the  rule  that  this  Court  enunciated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  ­­ for  patent  law,  which  is  if  the  case  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable  on  either  side  or  if  there's  been  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  has  magnified  the  cost  of  litigation  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  abuse,  those  are  situations  in  which  courts

But  if  we  have  two  reasonable  parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigating  appropriately  and  we  don't.  They  ­­ they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  don't  know  who  is  going  to  win  because  the  law  is

situation  because  those  are  the  people  you  want  to  keep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fighting. 

            

And  this  case  is  a  perfect  illustration.  At 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  point  where  this  case  is  going  to  go  to  this  Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  already  divided  4­to­4.  Nobody  knows  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan  is  going  to  come  out  on  the  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First  ­­ Kirtsaeng  has  to  decide  whether  to  file  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cert  petition.  He  knows  at  that  point  that  he's  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  free  representation.  But  if  you  had  Petitioner's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  in  effect,  he  would  also  be  ­­ know  that  he  had  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  percent  chance  of  losing  in  this  Court  and  having  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay  all  of  John  Wiley's  attorney'  fees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  mentioned  that 

  

 

 

 

 

he's  getting  free  representation.  Do  you  ­­ you've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned  the  fact  that  he  was  represented  by  pro  bono 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel.  Is  that  a  factor  that  the  Court  should  take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  consideration? 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  I  think  it  can  affect  the  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it  seems  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SMITH:  ­­ of  compensation.  You  don't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

need  to  compensate  Mr.  Kirtsaeng  for  representation  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  didn't  pay  for. 

 

 

 

            

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  quite  an  intrusion  into  the  relationship  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  party  and  ­­ and  counsel.  I  mean,  do  you

and  his  counsel  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  I  think  it's  ­­

    

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ with  the  counsel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

giving  a  discount  on  fees  and  all  that?  I  ­­ I'm  not 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  that  should  be  a  pertinent  consideration. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Perhaps  not.  It's  ­­ it  didn't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  any  major  impact  on  the  outcome  here.  But  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  was  something  that  the  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned.  And,  in  fact,  the  Second  Circuit  kind  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreed  with  them  on  that  in  a  ­­ in  a  footnote  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  opinion. 

 

            

But  the  ­­ the  main  thing  is  that  you  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  have  a  rule  that  says  if  you  file  that  cert 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition,  Mr.  Kirtsaeng,  you're  going  to  be  ­­ 50 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  chance  you're  going  to  have  a  big  bill  at  the

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  maybe  not.  But  I  think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

it's  important  to  look  at  the  economic  situation.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  a  $600,000  judgment,  and  they  would  have  known,

incentives  to  litigate  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  don't  think  you  can  do  these  things 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  after  the  fact  on  ­­ based  on  each  party's

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  problem  with  your 

  

 

 

 

 

situation  is  that  you're  looking  at  incentives.  If  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wiley,  I'm  looking  at  this  and  saying,  there's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

90  percent  chance  ­­ 80  to  90  percent  chance  I'm  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  fees,  because  willful  infringers  ­­ and  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judgment  that  was  being  defended  below  ­­ almost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always,  the  winning  plaintiff  gets  fees. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  I'm  a  defendant,  I'm  Kirtsaeng,  I  know 

   

   

 

 

 

that  the  probability  is  ­­ taking  Mr.  Rosenkranz's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers,  are  that  maybe  50  percent  of  the  prevailing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants  gets  fees.  If  without  pro  bono  counsel,  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  think  he  would  have  continued?

the  incentives  are  very,  very  different  for  a  defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who's  being  asked  to  go  on  with  the  litigation  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  likelihood  of  them  getting  fees  is  so  much  smaller.

MR.  SMITH:  I  think  there  was  never  any 

    

 

 

 

 

 

significant  likelihood  of  anybody  getting  fees  under  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  application  of  the  Second  Circuit's  rule  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  obviously,  both  sides  had  objectively

willfulness  found  in  a  situation  where  you  know  there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  circuit  ­­

MR.  SMITH:  But  the  ­­ the  conduct  was  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  intentional,  but  the  law  was  50/50.  There  was  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  complete  coin  flip.  And  ­­ and  so  it  seems  to  me 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  while  he  says,  we  don't  want  to  pretermit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion  here,  the  reality  is  you  have  to  have  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structure  to  the  decision  making  so  people  can  predict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  outcome's  going  to  be  and  be  incentivized. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Otherwise,  you  just  have  a  black  box.  You  say,  well, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  district  judge  takes  six  factors.  We're  not  going

whether  to  award  fees,  how  much,  to  incentivize  people

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Are  you  asking  us,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

our  decision,  to  endorse  the  Second  Circuit  test  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reject  the  Ninth  Circuit  test,  articulate  it  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Ninth  Circuit  does,  what  ­­ the  Second  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does?  Ask  us  exactly  what  you  want  us  to  announce  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  what  the  test  should  be  or  not  be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  We  think  the  Second  Circuit's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

test  makes  eminent  sense  and  ought  to  be  upheld.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  note,  though,  that  since  all  of  the  factors  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went  the  same  way  in  the  judgment  of  the  district  court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  you  decided  that  they  shouldn't  be  giving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  weight  to  one  factor,  there  wouldn't  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  for  a  reversal  in  this  ­­ this  particular  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  we  do  think  that  starting  with  the  objective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness  makes  a  lot  of  sense.  It  leads  to  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  outcome  and  the  right  incentives,  and  it  gives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  some  basis  for  being  able  to  figure  out  what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  happen  in  the  case  and  decide  which  cases  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigate  to  the  end  and  which  cases  to  settle  or  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  abandon.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  How  do  you  answer  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  you  ­­ you  referred  to  patent  cases,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  patent  statute  says  "fees"  in  exceptional  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

say  that. 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  Copyright  Act  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  SMITH:  And  I  think  that  is,  in  fact, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

how  it's  played  out.  The  fees  are  much  more  rare  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent  cases  than  they  are  in  copyright  cases.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  not  ­­ not  true  that  they're  exceptional  in  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  copyright  cases.  Quite  the  opposite.  It's  clearly  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

large  majority  of  cases  are  ­­ are  having  fees  awarded. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  ­­ the  point,  though,  is  even  if  you  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  layer  on  that  exceptionality  requirement,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors  that  you  look  at,  was  it  badly  litigated,  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  not  have  been  litigated,  was  there  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis,  was  there  abusive  conduct,  that's  the  factors  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  look  at.  That's  what  courts  have  always  looked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at.  Why  would  you  look  at  something  else? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  that  is  the  reason  why  one  awards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  is  either  because  somebody  brought  a  case  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  have,  or  litigated  a  defense  they  shouldn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

have,  or  abused  the  process  and  ­­

inquiry  is  producing  such  skewed  results  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  and  defendants?  Because  as  a  logical  matter, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  would  think  it  shouldn't,  that  ­­ that  there  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  wouldn't  be  this  skew. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SMITH:  I  mean  ­­

    

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Unless  you  really  think  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defendants  are  taking  so  many  more  unreasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigating  positions.  And  I  ­­ I  guess  that  could  be. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

But  is  there  any  other  explanation  or  any,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thoughts  you  have  about  that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Part  ­­ part  of  it  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

default  judgments  where  fees  are  routinely  awarded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  is  nobody  there  to  oppose  them  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  small  amounts. 

 

 

            

But  I  ­­ I  think  the  other  thing  is,  as  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  points  out  in  their  brief,  plaintiffs  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  to  bring  cases,  defendants  don't  decide  when  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants,  and  there  are  a  lot  of  intentional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

infringers  of  copyrights  out  there  in  the  world  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  now.  And  so  people  ­­ it  would  be  bizarre  in  a  way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  plaintiffs  didn't  have  a  higher  percentage  of  claims 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  reasonable,  because  they  decide  what  case  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring,  and  they  know  that  they're  going  to  be  spending 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money,  and  this  is  ­­ they're  going  to  invest  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  and  they  ­­ they  decide  to  go  ahead.  Whereas

defendants  are  simply  often  just  caught.  You  know,

or  is  ­­ is  anything  else  less  than  even  handed.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  means  that  the  facts  on  the  ground  are  leading  to

the  Second  Circuit,  according  to  their  own  statistics, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  the  time.  So  it's  not  like  it's  entirely

the  statistics  are  in  the  Second  Circuit  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Matthew  Bender  standard  which  says  that  objective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness  should  be  given  substantial  weight. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Looking  at  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  cases  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Second  Circuit,  in  the  district  courts,  I  think  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  lot  of  discretion  that  one  can  exercise  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  whether  to  include  cases  in  your  count  or  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  cases  in  your  count,  whether  you  include  default 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments,  whether  you  include  declaratory  judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

situations,  whether  you  include  situations  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  says  as  a  technical  matter,  you  can't  get  fees 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  your  motion  was  late.  But  in  the  alternative, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  I  were  to  consider  it,  I  would  go  on  to  award  or  not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award  you  fees,  anyway. 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  that  there  is  some  ground  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

quibble  with  some  of  the  statistics,  and  I  can  tell  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  statistics  I  came  up  when  I  did  this  look,  which 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  a  little  bit  different,  and  I  think  show  that  there 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  this  vast  disparity.  And  the  statistics  ­­ this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  in  the  district  courts  in  the  Second  Circuit  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Matthew  Bender  on  ­­ show  that  including  default 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments  in  the  count,  77  percent  of  the  time  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  ask  for  fees  and  it  was  decided  on  the  merits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  reported  decision,  they  got  fees,  and  53  percent  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  when  defendants  asked  for  fees.

But  if  you  drop  out  those  default  judgments, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which,  as  Mr.  Smith  indicated,  are  situations  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fee  motion  is  effectively  unopposed,  where  I  think  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  often  looks  very  unreasonable  by  not  having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shown  up  to  defend  the  case,  and  where  the  fee  amount  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  small  by  necessity  because  not  much  has  happened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  case,  then  the  numbers  start  to  look  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar,  59.7  percent  for  plaintiffs,  53  percent  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants. 

            

So  there  is  not  this  huge  gulf  between  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percentages  of  time  when  plaintiffs  and  defendants  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  fees,  at  least  by  my  count.  And  as  I  say,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  there  are  different  ways  to  do  this  count. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  I  think  you  have  to  take  all  of  these  numbers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  a  little  bit  of  a  grain  of  salt. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  don't  think  any  standard  in  the  world 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  give  you  equal  numbers  of  plaintiffs  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants  getting  attorneys'  fees. 

 

 

 

            

The  Matthew  Bender  test  is  neutral.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

even­handed  on  its  face.  It  says  very  clearly  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  and  defendants  should  be  treated  in  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  And  if  the  Court  thought  that  that  somehow  weren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  carried  out  properly  in  the  Second  Circuit,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  Court  could  emphasize  that,  and  it  wouldn't  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  reason  to  reject  the  Second  Circuit's  test.

With  respect  to  giving  objective 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness  substantial  weight,  I  would  like  to  point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

out  that  that  is  the  approach  that  this  Court  took  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Martin  decision,  which  was  a  case  about  removal  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand  and  which  involved  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  Which  case? 

  

  

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Martin  v.  Franklin,  which 

  

 

 

 

 

was  a  case  that  involved  the  statute  that,  much  like  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  here,  just  gave  broad  discretion  to  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  without  a  lot  of  standards  to  guide  them. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  what  the  Court  said  in  that  case  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion  isn't  whim.  In  order  for  like  cases  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated  alike,  district  court's  discretion  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guided  in  certain  ways  so  that  there  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predictability  and  so  that  there  can  be  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  of  justice  can  be  upheld,  even  in  the  absence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  expressed  statutory  restriction. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  didn't  have  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  situation  you  have  here,  where  you're  concerned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  encouraging  people  to  move  for  remand  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discouraging  people  from  filing  for  fees  under  remand. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  was  ­­ the  policy  sort  of  pushed  all  one  way  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martin. 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well,  it's  true  that  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one  side  in  Martin  could  get  fees.  That's  true  that  ­­

that  ­­ it's  the  ­­ when  the  case  is  remanded,  so  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  has  been  unsuccessful  in  removing,  that's  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees  are  awarded. 

 

 

            

But  nevertheless,  like  any  fee­shifting 

 

 

 

 

statute,  it  is  taking  into  account  incentives  on  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sides,  whether  you  should  try  to  remove  the  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  you  should  move  to  remand  the  case  if  you're  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  side.  And  what  happens  in  the  copyright  world 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  this  Court's  Fogerty  decision  is  that  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentives  are  judged  as  to  plaintiffs  and  defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  both  of  them  can  get  fees,  but  I  don't  think  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying  policies  are  different. 

 

 

 

            

In  Martin,  the  Court  wasn't  looking  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  that  was  specific  to  that  statute,  as  to  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history,  or  to  any  policy  that  was  specific  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  at  all.  But  what  the  Court  said  was  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective  reasonableness  was  the  touchstone.  And,  yes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  may  be  true  that  in  some  cases  where  the  losing  party 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  objectively  reasonable,  fees  are  appropriate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  any  event,  because  this  is  an  equitable  matter,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  don't  want  to  restrict  the  district  court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion,  and  it's  hard  to  imagine  every  single  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  could  possibly  come  up  in  the  future.  And  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equivalent  to  what  the  Second  Circuit  has  done  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it's  very  consistent  with  the  approach

that  the  Court  has  taken  to  other  fee­shifting  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there  is  broad  discretion. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Smith  suggested  that  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thought  the  times  in  which  the  reasonableness  inquiry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  outweighed  is  if  you  see  real  litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct.  Is  that  your  sense  too,  or  is  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  else  that  actually  is  capable  of  outweighing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it? 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  My  sense  is  that  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  going  to  be  the  most  frequent  circumstance  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  it  would  be  outweighed,  and  there  are,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Smith  pointed  out,  some  cases  in  the  Second  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  that,  be  the  Video,  Zalewski  cases,  where  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  the  losing  party  was  objectively  reasonable,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  there  has  been  some  misconduct  here  and  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awarded  fees  may  be  appropriate,  or  the  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  go  back  and  see  if  there  was  misconduct  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Maybe  ­­

  

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  So  there  are  other  examples 

  

 

 

 

 

 

as  well  that  I'd  like  to  point  out  beyond  that.  And  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  comes  from  the  ­­ the  Sixth  Circuit,  and  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  is  called  WB  Music  and  Bridgeport  Music,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  situation  where  plaintiffs  indiscriminately 

   

 

 

 

brought  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  claims,  some  of  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  objectively  reasonable,  and  some  of  which  were  not

unreasonable  fashion.  And  so  there's  a  strong 

   

  

 

 

 

deterrence  factor  that's  playing  in  here.  We  don't  want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  to  do  this.  We  want  to  stop  people  from  doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  in  the  future.  And  so  we're  going  to  award 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys'  fees  in  that  situation. 

 

 

 

 

            

That  is  related,  I  think,  to  litigation 

   

 

 

 

 

misconduct,  but  it's  not  exactly  the  same  thing.  And  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  deterrence.  It's  focusing  on  the  deterrence  factor 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Fogerty  footnote. 

 

 

 

            

There  is  another  example  from  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  in  the  Second  Circuit.  It's  a  case  called  Tips 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exports.  It's  a  Eastern  District  of  New  York  case,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  case  where  the  defendant  lost. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  what  the  court  said  again  was  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  deterrence  factor  that  comes  in  here.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  was  reasonable  ­­ objectively  reasonable  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  position  in  its  ­­ on  the  facts  and  the  law,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears  that  the  defendant  is  going  to  take  this  just  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  cost  of  doing  business  and  keep  on  engaging  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringing  conduct  about  because  the  award  of  fees  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  ­­ I'm  sorry  ­­ the  award  of  damages  is  not

enough  to  stop  it.  So  in  that  situation,  again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterrence  will  override  the  fact  that  the  losing  party 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  objectively  reasonable.  So  I  do  think  it  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Counsel,  it  ­­ is  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pertinent,  in  the  government's  view,  whether  or  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  seeking  fees  was  represented  by  pro  bono  counsel? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  think  it  would  be 

    

 

 

 

 

pertinent  if  you  were  to  adopt  an  approach  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  approach  where  you  took  financial  condition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  parties  into  account.  If  you  are  going  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  then  I  think  you  would  certainly  need  to  look  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  whether  somebody  who  appeared  to  be  an  impecunious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  was  actually  represented  pro  bono,  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible  for  their  fees. 

 

 

 

            

But  I  take  some  issue  with  what  Petitioner's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  said,  that  ­­ that  the  financial  condition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  parties  is  something  that  courts  look  to  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  deciding  whether  to  make  a  fee  award  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  incidence.  I'm  not  aware  of  any  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance  where  the  courts  look  to  the  financial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

condition  of  the  parties  under  a  fee­shifting  statute  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  whether  to  award  fees  on  a  granular  level;  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  they  look  to  the  specific  finances  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  party  before  them. 

 

 

 

            

They  certainly  look  at  it  when  it  comes  time

to  decide  what  the  amount  of  a  fee  award  should  be,  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've  already  decided  that  they  are  going  to  award 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees,  and  that,  I  think,  is  perfectly  appropriate.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you'll  see  district  courts  in  the  Second  Circuit,  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Matthew  Bender  standard,  doing  exactly  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  they  have  a  very  unreasonable  pro  se 

   

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff,  for  instance,  they  will  say  that  a  fee  award 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  still  be  appropriate  if  that  party  loses,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps  the  amount  should  be  set  lower,  it  will  still  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  deterrent  to  that  person,  but  it  won't  be  financially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crushing  to  them. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Fogerty  says  ­­ it  adds, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"The  need  in  particular  circumstances  to  advance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations  of  compensation  and  deterrence." 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  lists  the  reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

fact  ­­ you  know,  reasonable  position  is  one  among  four. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  says  there  could  be  others.  Why?  Why  not  stop  right 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there? 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  First  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Maybe  Marbury  was  a  poor 

   

  

 

 

 

man.  Maybe  he  didn't  even  want  the  job.  Maybe  he  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  trying  to  try  to  create  a  situation  where  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country  would  have  a  structure  of  judicial  review.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  can  they  take  things  like  that?  Why  not?

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well,  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean,  I  ­­ I  don't  know. 

    

   

   

 

 

It  has  to  be  consistent  with  the  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  ­­

    

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  are  we  suddenly  picking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  one  thing  out  of  what  could  be  a  bunch  of  things? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  For  a  number  of  reasons. 

   

  

 

 

 

First  of  all,  if  you  look  at  the  factors  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned  in  Fogerty,  they  actually,  many  of  them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

center  around  objective  reasonableness:  Frivolousness, 

  

 

 

 

deterrence,  motivation.  All  of  those  are  kind  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circling  around  this  concept  of  objective 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness,  which,  as  I  pointed  out,  is  pretty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

common  to  the  Court's  approach  to  other  fee­shifting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes,  not  only  in  Martin,  but  also  as  Mr.  Smith 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained,  in  Octane.  So  that  ­­ that's  one  example. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's  another  example  ­­ another  reason, 

 

 

 

 

 

though,  that's  very  grounded  in  the  Copyright  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself,  and  that  is  the  history  of  the  Copyright  Act  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ratification  that  Congress  engaged  in  in  1976  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  chose  to  readopt  essentially  the  same  language  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  1909  Copyright  Act  as  to  which  courts  have,  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  of  their  discretion  over  many  years,  worn  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

groove  that  said,  generally,  when  the  losing  party  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable,  fees  are  not  going  to  be  appropriate.

That's  equivalent  to  the  Second  Circuit's  standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress  had  every  reason  to  know  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  law  under  the  existing  language  because  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  presented,  by  experts,  by  the  register  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyrights,  whose  job  it  is  to  advise  Congress  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright  policy,  by  the  Brown  Study,  which  was  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert  Copyright  Office  study  that  Congress  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commissioned.  All  these  authorities  said  that,  and  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  had  good  reason  to  know  that  it  was  true. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  you  were  thinking  of  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

solely  as  a  policy  matter,  if  you  didn't  think  that  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  was  all  that  overwhelming,  why  is  it  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor  should  be  first  among  equals? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  For  the  ­­ I  think  a  lot  of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  reasons  that  Mr.  Smith  explained  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentives.  When  you  make  that  factor  important,  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

encouraging  reasonable  arguments,  you're  discouraging 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable  arguments,  you're  increasing  the  chances 

 

 

 

 

 

that  close  cases  where  both  sides  are  reasonable  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  actually  get  litigated  to  their  conclusion,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  the  law  of  copyright  will  be  clarified,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  what  this  Court  called  for  in  its  Fogerty  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If,  on  the  other  hand,  you  adopt  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  standard  that  Petitioner  at  least  set  forth  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  brief,  where  you  privilege  the  precedent­setting

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Five  minutes,  Mr.  Rosenkranz. 

 

 

 

        

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  E.  JOSHUA  ROSENKRANZ 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

So  Justice  Ginsburg's  question,  which  got 

 

 

 

 

 

picked  up  through  the  course  of  the  argument,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  gets  to  the  nub  of  the  matter.  The  magic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  in  Mr.  Smith's  presentation  is  that  the  Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  has  adopted  the  Patent  Act  standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Patent  Act  standard  is  different.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  Octane  means  anything,  it  is  we  read  the  words  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  actually  wrote.  "Exceptional  circumstances" 

  

 

 

 

this  Court  defined  in  exactly  the  way  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  and  Wiley  are  defining  this  standard.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  take  Congress  at  its  word  that  it  meant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  different. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  it  does  mean 

  

 

 

 

 

something  different  in  practice  because,  as  we  were  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told,  it's  unusual.  There  are  not  many  fee  awards  made

in  patent  cases,  much  higher  number  in  copyright  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  The  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  that's  because  in  every  circuit  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second  Circuit,  the  ­­ the  district  courts  apply  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  standard  from  the  Second  Circuit  standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  why  you  have  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  We  have  the  ­­ the  Second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit,  and  what  was  it,  50  percent  of  the  defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  70  something  percent,  whatever,  it's  a  much  higher 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage  than  in  ­­ than  in  patent  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Agreed,  Your  Honor.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

it's  important  to  understand  why.  Our  numbers  are  44 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  and  85  percent.  One  can  quibble  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers.  But  I  have  to  emphasize,  neither  Mr.  Smith  nor 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  has  come  forward  with  a  single  case  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  a  defendant  got  fees  where  the  plaintiff  was  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  reasonable.  In  every  single  one  of  their  cases  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Second  Circuit,  when  a  defendant  got  fees,  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  plaintiff's  position  was  illegal  ­­ or  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable  or  the  plaintiff  took  unreasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

positions  within  the  litigation.  There  is  not  a  single 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

case  in  the  Second  Circuit  where  anything  other  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonableness  carried  the  day. 

 

 

 

              

I  want  to  make  ­­ I  want  to  say  a  word  about 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  because  there's  been  a  lot  of  suggestion  that

the  history  before  1976  and  the  Copyright  Act  was  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptional­circumstances  standard.  It  wasn't.  There 

  

  

 

 

is  not  a  single  case  that  the  government  or  ­­ or  Wiley 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  cited,  not  one  case  that  adopts  the  Matthew  Bender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  across  the  board.  So  sure  ­­ that  is  pre­1976 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  talking  about. 

 

 

            

So  sure,  there  were  a  lot  of  cases  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable  plaintiffs  or  defendants  were  hit  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fees.  There  were  cases  where  the  reasonableness  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  for  the  district  court  carried  the  day,  but  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  case  that  ever  said,  here's  how  we  should  figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  out. 

 

            

All  of  the  studies  that  the  government  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred  to  are  studies  that  admitted  that  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  no  one  standard.  This  Court  has  quoted  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  sorry  ­­ this  Court  in  Fogerty  underscored  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  no  standard  that  predated  1976.  And  even  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  that  Wiley  cites,  half  of  them  are  cases  where  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  parties  was  unreasonable.  That  leaves  only  four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  and  those  are  all  cases  that  are  consistent  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we're  saying  the  rule  was. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Final  point:  If  we're  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

incentives,  the  difference  between  my  position  and  Mr. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Smith's  position  is  that  he  wants  a  rule  that  decides  up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

front  for  all  district  courts  that  this  is  the  weight

you  will  put  on  something,  and  I  want  a  rule,  consistent 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  Congress's  language  and  the  use  of  the  word  "may," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  trusts  district  courts  to  figure  out  what  the  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentives  and  disincentives  are,  and  to  figure  out  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  value  is  to  put  on  reasonableness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  That's  an  awfully  hard  task 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  district  judges  to  perform,  whether  ­­ you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  ­­ what  will  further  the  purposes  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Copyright  Act  or  what  is  the  most  faithful  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Copyright  Act.  District  court  judges  are  going  to  see 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  very  differently,  and  there  won't  be  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistency  if  that's  what  they  are  required  to  do  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  to  do. 

 

 

            

MR.  ROSENKRANZ:  Your  Honor,  what  will 

  

 

 

 

 

emerge  is  what's  emerged  in  the  Ninth  Circuit,  a  common 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  of  equity  where  courts  are  following  each  other's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions.  And,  yes,  there  will  be  some  variability, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  variability  is  invited  by  Congress  in  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"may." 

            

Unreasonable  litigants  will  always  be  hit 

 

 

 

 

 

with  attorneys'  fees,  not  because  there  is  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  weight  put  on  it  by  a  court  of  appeals,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that's  what  district  courts  will  do.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  positions  should  be  hit  with  attorneys'  fees 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not  depending  upon  whether  the  Court  believes  that
