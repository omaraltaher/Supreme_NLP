CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’ll hear 

argument next in Case 09-448, Hardt v. Reliance Standard 

(11:05 a.m.) 

Life Insurance Company. 

Mr. Ates. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. ATES 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. ATES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Fourth Circuit vacated an award of 

attorney's fees to Petitioner Hardt even though the 

district court found Respondent violated ERISA in bad 

faith and required Respondent to redetermine benefits 

within 30 days or face adverse judgment.  And Ms. Hardt 

then secured the full disability benefits after that 

court-enforceable order. 

Ms. Hardt is entitled to -- is eligible for 

a fee award under section 502(g)(1) of ERISA by proper 

application of this Court's established fee standards 

under any test this Court has previously established. 

But to be clear --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do you define as --

assuming that we go back to our prior language and use --

in Ruckelshaus, "some success on the merits," what's the

"some success on the merits" that you claim your client 

reached? 

MR. ATES:  In that instance, the "some 

success on the merits" is the finding of the ERISA 

violation in this instance. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I believe that this 

circuit said, yes, there are cases where we have so held, 

but that's because there was a cause of action under the 

complaint that -- that alleged a violation of the Act. 

But here there wasn't.  Here, there was a claim for 

benefits only, and you didn't get benefits.  That was 

the circuit's reasoning.  So tell me where they erred 

and how we go back to defining "some success on the 

merits" in light of that position by the circuit? 

MR. ATES:  They misread the complaint, 

Justice Sotomayor.  We are claiming a claim for 

benefits.  As part of that claim, we asked for equitable 

relief for the ERISA violation.  The heart of ERISA is 

the full and fair review process in 1133 of the statute. 

Because without a full and fair review by the plan 

administrator, that fiduciary cannot get to the right 

result.  It violated that obligation here. 

We asked for the benefits, but the district 

court, instead of awarding the benefits, said in the 

first -- in the second instance, here's your second bite

at the apple; get it right this time.  That's success on 

the merits under ERISA, because they must abide by their 

fiduciary obligations, and they breached it here. 

The relief the district court formulated in 

essence was an equitable-type relief:  Do it again.  We 

asked for that in the complaint.  We asked for equitable 

relief. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do you think 

our -- the meaning of our footnote, Chief Justice 

Rehnquist's footnote in Ruckelshaus, who said a 

procedural victory is not some success on the merits. 

How do you differentiate what he meant by a --

some procedural victory is not enough? 

MR. ATES:  I think it foreshadowed the 

Hanrahan-type case, and we are miles apart from 

Hanrahan.  Hanrahan, which Respondent is relying upon, 

was the circuit court reversing the district court on a 

pure civil procedure issue.  Here, there is a -- a 

right; it is a process right.  So when the process right 

is violated, your relief is going to necessarily be 

process-driven. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It was the same in 

Hanrahan.  There was a right to a certain process in the 

lower court, and the -- the person complaining achieved 

reversal.  It was sent back and said:  Do it right.  Give

this person the process that -- that he’s entitled to. 

MR. ATES:  But, in Hanrahan, there was no 

finding of a violation of law, Justice Scalia.  Here we 

have a violation of ERISA, a violation of a fiduciary 

obligation by the plan administrator.  The relief 

accorded for that violation was a remand back to the 

plan administrator to get it right. 

That's the difference between our case and 

Hanrahan.  In Hanrahan, there was no finding of a 

violation of law.  No one was found to be a legal 

wrongdoer.  We have that here.  The fiduciary breached 

its obligation. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you saying that in 

Hanrahan there was no prod at all from the court, and 

here there is? 

MR. ATES:  I'm sorry --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In Hanrahan, there was no 

prod from the court; the court didn't say anything 

that -- it was the filing of the complaint that led to 

the action, wasn't it? 

MR. ATES:  Well, what happened was the 

district court, I believe, granted a motion to dismiss or 

a motion for judgment as of law at trial.  The -- the 

court of appeals reversed that.  What we have here is a 

prodding from a court, but moreover a finding of a

violation by a court.  The court found Reliance violated 

ERISA.  That's the key distinction between here and 

Hanrahan.  And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose now, in response 

to "Do it right," Reliance on a complete record and very 

careful review finds that total disability was not 

proved.  Then there would be no fees, right? 

MR. ATES:  No.  Under our position, the --

Ms. Hardt is eligible for fees and the district court 

can take into account trust law principles which are 

embodied in what we call this five-factor test to 

determine whether to award fees.  She's eligible for 

fees based on the violation by Reliance in bad faith. 

We have a legal wrongdoer here. 

The amount of those fees, Justice Ginsburg, 

may be determined in part by her degree of success. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, this district court 

kept jurisdiction over the action.  He more or less 

waited to see how the story came out before he wrote the 

plot.  Suppose the district court said:  All you came to 

me for was an order for remand.  I give you the order 

for remand.  Case ended.  At that point, he doesn't know 

how it's going to come out.  At that point, can he --

can the district court award attorney's fees? 

MR. ATES:  Absolutely, the court at that

point, if he’s closing the case out in particular and 

entering judgment as to the violation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So that even if, when it 

goes back to Reliance, Reliance finds that it’s patently 

frivolous, close to a fraud, she -- the employee still 

gets the fee? 

MR. ATES:  The only way it's going back, 

Justice Kennedy, is from a violation of law.  So, in that 

regard, she has succeeded on the merits by proving a 

violation regardless of the outcome at the end of the 

day. 

Now, here certainly she got the benefits, so 

we -- we meet even Buckhannon and beyond.  But in the 

case where the district court is sending it back, it 

must be sending it back for a violation of law, save one 

instance.  The claimant comes forward and says:  I have 

additional evidence that I didn't -- I didn't submit 

below.  I've got an equitable ground to -- to convince 

the court to, in essence, reopen the record.  I want --

I want to send it back. 

In that instance, fees should not be awarded 

because it was the claimant's fault in not getting this 

record -- this record evidence in. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, she prevailed 

in some way to give her another chance to make that

argument. 

MR. ATES:  Again --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm just saying I 

think you’re giving up too much. 

MR. ATES:  Maybe I am, Mr. Chief Justice. 

But my point is to try to distinguish Hanrahan, in the 

sense that we have a judicial finding of a legal 

violation here.  What I was trying to articulate 

earlier, perhaps inartfully, was that she -- she’s 

eligible for fees under the five-factor test, but in 

that instance the district court is not likely to use 

its discretion to grant fees in that instance.  I was 

not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what if you 

get in Justice Kennedy's situation, where the court 

doesn't know what's going to happen on remand?  You 

know, the objection is -- the administrator throws it 

out, saying, you know, you filed the wrong form, so you 

lose.  And the district court says you can't throw it 

out on that basis; under trust law, it doesn't matter. 

And it goes back. 

Now, the district court doesn't know what’s 

going to happen.  Does she get fees or not? 

MR. ATES:  It -- it depends on what the 

district court does with it.  But she has to prove a

violation of ERISA for it to go back.  And if she proves 

that, she’s eligible for fees.  And the district court 

in its discretion can take all these factors into 

account. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is the district 

court -- is the district court supposed to wait until 

the whole thing is over before deciding the fee 

application? 

MR. ATES:  I think the better practice is 

for the district court to hold the case over and 

supervise the remand.  But if the district court enters 

judgment at that point, then -- then under Rule 54 or 

the -- they have to come in and apply for fees within 

14 days of that judgment.  But this case does not give 

this Court an opportunity specifically to give the 

courts, district courts, guidance whether to keep these 

cases open or not, much like the Social Security cases 

that happened in the late '80s and early '90s. 

But to get back to our main point, which is 

this is not a prevailing party statute, that was the 

fundamental error by the Fourth Circuit in imposing a 

prerequisite to determining whether a claimant is 

entitled to fees.  Section 502(g)(1) is not a prevailing 

party statute for three primary reasons:  first, the 

language and structure of the statute.  The words

"prevailing party," a term of art that has been used for 

hundreds of years, is not within section 502(g)(1), but 

it is in other sections of ERISA. 

Its statutory sibling, section 502(g)(2), 

contains a judgment requirement.  Another provision of 

ERISA, 1451(e), uses the terms "prevailing party." 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How could somebody have 

some success on the merits if they don't achieve a 

judgment of some sort? 

MR. ATES:  This case -- in the -- in the 

Bradley case, which was cited in Hanrahan, said you 

have many final orders in a case, and if the court 

determines an issue of -- a particular issue in a 

case -- and here it's finding an ERISA violation --

and as relief for that they are issuing an order 

requiring Reliance to act within 30 days, 

let's say the case settles at that point. 

That's enough for fees to issue should the parties not 

be able to agree on fees as a part of the settlement. 

It's the judicial act in finding the violation that 

triggers -- triggers the success on the merits. 

And this case was on the merits.  As we 

pointed out in our very yellow brief, the district 

court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But under your theory,

presumably no relief has to be granted? 

MR. ATES:  Relief does not have to be 

granted.  The district court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But then what -- what's 

the difference -- is it your theory that if the district 

court -- for whatever reason, if this wasn't an ERISA 

case where a remand -- or where the court said they did 

violate, but I’ve now looked at the evidence that you’re 

proffering, the new evidence they did not consider, 

and it's not enough for benefits; you don't get it.  Is 

your argument that you are entitled to fees because they 

decided there was -- the court decided there was a 

violation of ERISA? 

MR. ATES:  Yes, it is.  My argument is you’re 

eligible for fees, and the amount of fees will be 

taken into account in determining the degree in the 

district court, taking these five factors into account, 

taking into effect your position on the merits, the 

defendant's position on the merits, and determining what 

that fee award should be.  But it should not operate as 

a barrier to getting into an eligibility question. 

So she's eligible for fees in that instance, 

but what those fees should be is at the district court's 

discretion.

Justice Scalia's question, what's the difference between 

Hanrahan, where there’s a violation of the civil 

procedure code which is an entitlement to process?  Why 

aren't you successful, if this is a non-ERISA situation, 

merely for a finding that the district court acted 

improperly? 

MR. ATES:  Because you have to look at the 

party who is violating.  Here it’s the party who’s 

violating the law.  It's a party to the suit who is 

violating the law.  That violation is found in Hanrahan. 

It's a civil procedure.  The district court didn't --

didn't do something right. 

Here -- and that's not a violation of the --

of law.  That's a -- that's a misapplication of a 

civil -- of a rule of civil procedure.  Here we have a 

violation of law by a party.  That's the fundamental 

difference between us and Hanrahan. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask -- ask this 

question?  The question here is whether there was 

eligibility for fees.  Could the district judge in your 

view say, yes, I think the plaintiff is eligible for 

fees, but it was actually a very difficult legal issue, 

and the defendant's position was entirely reasonable, so 

I think as a matter of discretion I will not award any 

fees?

MR. ATES:  The district court can exercise 

its discretion and not award fees.  I think, however, 

that the better result is when a violation of law is 

proven, the plaintiff or in this instance a claimant or 

beneficiary should be entitled to some amount of fees 

because the purpose of the statute, explicitly stated in 

the statute, is to protect beneficiaries and claimants 

and have access to the Federal courts. 

If every case is a close case and you’re 

not giving -- giving fees, then -- these are folks with 

limited means.  These are folks by definition cannot 

work when they are disabled, and you are eating up their 

benefit through attorney's fees.  And that cannot be the 

point of the statute when Congress enacted this.  It is 

to protect beneficiaries, to give appropriate -- give 

appropriate relief and keep open access to the Federal 

courts. 

If I can get back to, again, why this is not 

a prevailing party statute, the language and structure 

clearly show that.  The history and context show it as 

well.  And I'm not talking legislative history.  I'm 

talking about the fact that ERISA supplanted the Welfare 

and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, which required a 

judgment before fees could issue, but Congress chose to 

remove that requirement when it originally enacted

ERISA.  It does not have that judgment language and does 

not have prevailing party language. 

Moreover, this Court repeatedly has held 

that trust law should inform the interpretation of 

ERISA.  Trust law, for hundreds of years, has taken into 

account these principles that the district courts and 

courts of appeals have relied on for at least 30 years 

under ERISA to inform, guide, and limit district courts’ 

discretion in awarding fees. 

I’d like to reserve the remainder of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH, 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. SHAH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The district court found that Respondent's 

original decision denying benefits disregarded pertinent 

medical evidence in violation of ERISA and found that 

the decision was otherwise unsupported by substantial 

evidence.  Based on those findings, the district court 

ordered Respondent to make a new benefits determination, 

after which Respondent finally granted the benefits due. 

Those facts established Petitioner's

eligibility for a fee award under ERISA section 

502(g)(1), which authorizes a court to award reasonable 

attorney's fees, quote, "in its discretion," end quote. 

That discretion, as per ERISA more generally, is to be 

exercised in accordance with well-established trust law 

principles, and those principles quite clearly reject a 

strict prevailing party standard. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me 

whether you differ in your definition of "some success 

on the merits" than your predecessor colleague?  Do you 

define it as in the manner he did, that it's any legal 

judgment in the Petitioner's favor that another party 

has done a wrongful act?  I think -- I think I’m 

summarizing his position accurately. 

MR. SHAH:  Yes, I -- I think we are in an 

agreement, Your Honor, with -- with -- with Petitioner's 

characterization.  When there’s a judicial order 

finding a violation --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, that's different 

than what he said. 

MR. SHAH:  Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Yes, here 

there was an order of remand.  That's clear.  And I can 

understand the difference between an order, because

orders that are not final judgments.  But there are 

decisions, like this one, I think according to him, that 

if the district court had said there was a violation of 

ERISA and the parties then settled without a judicial 

order reflecting that finding and/or requiring a remand, 

I think according to him he would say this party was 

entitled to fees. 

MR. SHAH:  I don't want to characterize his

Your Honor, I think it depends on which framework we’re 

operating under.  I think if we’re operating under 

well-established trust law principles, that clearly 

qualifies as enough success to justify a fee award.  And

our brief and Petitioner's brief.  In re Catell's Estate 

is discussed in all the briefs.  There the plaintiff 

brought a claim to remove a trustee, and the basis for 

the claim to remove the trustee was a contention that 

the trustee wasn't complying with one of the terms of 

the trust. 

After he filed the suit -- and this was 

before even any finding by the judge -- the trustee then 

complied with that particular term of the trust.  And 

then what the court said was, well, because the trustee 

complied with the underlying premise or the motivation 

for your suit, I'm going to deny your claim to have the 

trustee --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that seems like a 

catalyst theory, and that was, at least in dicta, 

rejected in -- in Ruckelshaus.  So how do you deal with 

that? 

MR. SHAH:  Well, it wasn't -- in the dictum 

in Ruckelshaus; it was actually accepted, Your Honor, in 

that -- in the footnote the Court -- in the dictum within 

Ruckelshaus, the Court says quite plainly that Congress, 

in departing from a strict prevailing party language 

in Ruckelshaus, meant to embrace judicial -- relief that 

wasn't encapsulated within a judicial order. 

But we’re far afield from Ruckelshaus here,

because we actually have a judicial order, and we’re 

far afield from the outer limits of the trust --

trust law cases which -- which, for example, In re 

Catell's Estate, which I just mentioned -- and by no 

means is In re Catell's Estate an outlier.  The Third 

Circuit's opinion in Dardovitch, which is also cited in 

our brief, recounts In re Catell's Estate as falling 

well within the history of trust law cases. 

Petitioner's reply brief at page 11 cites 

Grien v. Cavano.  That's another case where a plaintiff 

brought -- brought a claim that a union fund was not 

complying with accounting and proper bookkeeping 

procedures.  After he filed the suit, they fell in line, 

adopted the various procedures that plaintiff had 

sought, and the court still said:  Drawing upon trust 

law principles, we’re going to award fees. 

Now, again, I don't think the court has --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  As the Respondent points 

out, the position you’re taking is unusual for the 

government.  The government is usually arguing against 

fees, because the fees are often assessed against the 

government. 

MR. SHAH:  Right.

you’re making your bed and you’re going to have to lie

in it --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and you’re essentially 

saying that when there is simply a procedural victory, 

which happens all the time, when -- when an agency is --

is reversed in its procedure even though the -- the --

the petitioner here doesn't get any concrete relief 

until it goes back to the agency and may lose in the 

agency ultimately, you’re -- you’re content to say 

that fees are assessable in that situation, just by 

reason of the procedural victory. 

MR. SHAH:  Your Honor, a couple of 

responses:  First of all, ERISA is somewhat unique in 

that ERISA -- first of all, this provision doesn't have 

prevailing party language as -- unlike EAJA, for example. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I'm talking about other 

prevailing -- I'm talking about other statutes that 

don't say "prevailing party." 

MR. SHAH:  Okay. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure. 

MR. SHAH:  I think still this provision 

is unique in that it’s informed explicitly by trust 

law principles, as this Court has held numerous --

in numerous decisions regarding other ERISA provisions. 

And the trust law principles depart from the American

rule.  All of those other statutes which you have in 

mind, Justice Scalia, are premised on the background of 

the American rule.  The trust law departs from American 

rule, and so when you interpret ERISA section 502(g)(1) 

based upon the trust law principles, I think that 

supports a different --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure 

it's reasonable to interpret an attorney's fee provision 

as having anything to do with trust law. 

MR. SHAH:  Well, even --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's -- it's a requirement 

of attorney's fees enacted by -- by the Federal 

Congress, and I -- I find that very artificial. 

MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's a 

fee provision enacted within ERISA which explicitly 

states as one of its purposes to protect beneficiaries 

and to provide them access to courts.  This is in the 

legislative history. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I can see now 

why the red brief has a very substantial appendix with 

statutes.  Now, you say, oh, this is unique.  Well, then 

we may have many, many different kinds of statutes.  This 

does not provide for -- this is not a prevailing party 

statute. 

MR. SHAH:  Correct.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But just in going through 

the list of the statutes, there are many statutes that 

are not prevailing party statutes.  And it seems to me 

that -- you say it's unique.  Well, it's unique in the 

sense it's in ERISA, but I -- I think it's very close to 

many -- many of the statutes with the language there in 

the red brief's appendix. 

MR. SHAH:  Right.  And, Your Honor, 

previously the government has made narrow arguments. 

For example, there were arguments --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Take the case, though --

just take the -- what is the government's position?  The 

ERISA plaintiff wants $5 million.  They get denied 

everything.  The -- the court says:  I noticed here 

there was a 30-day deadline that you had, and he only 

gave you 28 days, so I'm sending it back, but I'll tell 

you your claim that there was enough evidence is absurd; 

you’re never going to win it.  And then he goes back, 

and he loses it.  Okay?  He has had a procedural 

victory. 

Does he get attorney's fees?  Not -- not a 

chance that he’s going to win this claim, and, indeed, he 

loses it.  He doesn't get a penny.  Does he get 

attorney's fees, because on a technicality he won a new 

hearing?

MR. SHAH:  Under your hypothetical, Justice 

Breyer, a district court would be within its 

jurisdiction to deny attorney's fees.  That doesn't --

JUSTICE BREYER:  My question is --

MR. SHAH:  He wouldn’t --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- does the statute, in 

the view of the government, permit attorney's fees in the 

case I just mentioned? 

MR. SHAH:  Probably not in application.  He 

would be eligible, but a district court --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Your answer is, yes --

MR. SHAH:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it does permit? 

MR. SHAH:  Yes.  But a district court 

applying --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  You’re just 

saying it won't be a problem because the district court 

judges are all reasonable, and I know they think that. 

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- what if 

the success is preliminary?  You know, the plaintiff 

survives a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff survives a 

motion for summary judgment, wins every procedural 

issue, wins a privilege issue, gets discovery issues 

resolved, and at the end of the day loses?  The plaintiff

MR. SHAH:  No, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why?  He has had 

some success. 

MR. SHAH:  No, Your Honor, because that 

would be captured within Hanrahan, we think, and 

that's -- and that's easily distinguishable because 

those are errors -- even if some of those procedural 

victories were overturned on appeal or procedural losses 

were overturned on appeal, those are all errors within 

the court system or victories within the procedures of 

the court system, not a violation of -- on the merits of 

the underlying claim, which is what we have here. 

We have a finding of a violation of ERISA 

and then relief ordered to --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But then, aren't you 

treating the statute as though it did have a prevailing 

party clause in it? 

MR. SHAH:  Pardon, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is not your construction 

one that just treats the statute as though it required 

the plaintiff to be a prevailing party? 

MR. SHAH:  Well -- well, Your Honor, no.  I 

think our -- our -- our argument is to interpret it in 

light of trust law principles.

Now, the trust law cases -- there is 

language in some of the trust laws cases that suggests 

that fees -- fees could be awarded to unsuccessful 

litigants or regardless of outcome.  But I think if you 

read those cases, on the facts of those cases they don't 

go that far.  But I think what they do embody is a much 

broader notion of success than the strict prevailing 

party jurisprudence that this Court has promulgated --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, under your -- under 

your rule would it be error for the district court to 

terminate its jurisdiction?  It must keep jurisdiction 

to see how the play comes out in the end? 

MR. SHAH:  No -- no, Your Honor, I don't 

think it must keep jurisdiction.  But certainly in a 

case where it does retain --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but it certainly has 

to in order to adopt the ameliorating factors that 

you -- that you use in order to justify this rule.  And 

I -- I -- it's not clear to me that courts usually 

retain jurisdiction in these cases. 

MR. SHAH:  May I respond, Your Honor?  A 

couple of responses, Justice Kennedy:  First, if they 

didn't retain jurisdiction -- and in the Seventh 

Circuit, for example, that's one circuit which says that 

these orders have to be final, and final judgment has to

be entered -- then we’re exactly analogous to a 

sentence 4 Social Security case. 

And this Court has made it clear in a line 

of decisions that upon entry of final judgment -- and 

those are exactly analogous in the sense that what 

happens is that the court finds that the decision below 

committed some error in law, it vacates that decision, 

and then sends it back to the Social Security 

Administration for a new determination without 

preordaining the result.  Regardless of the result 

there, at the time of the remand and entry of judgment, 

that plaintiff is eligible for -- for fees. 

We think that the same outcome would be 

controlled here, even if the Court applied its strict 

prevailing party jurisprudence. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Rosenkranz. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICHOLAS Q. ROSENKRANZ 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

No judge has ever decided the merits of 

Petitioner's claim for benefits.  Under this Court's 

holding in Ruckelshaus, the Petitioner must demonstrate

some success on the merits, and under Rule 54 she must 

specify the judgment entitling her to an award. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the footnote 

that was mentioned in Ruckelshaus that said:  "Congress 

found it necessary to explicitly state that the term 

'appropriate' extended to suits that forced defendants 

to abandon illegal conduct" -- illegal conduct was found 

here -- "although without a formal court order"? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  Footnote 

8 of Ruckelshaus addressed one sentence of legislative 

history of a different statute, and only so far as the 

Court pointed out that the sentence was of no use to 

Sierra Club in that case.  I don't think the footnote is 

properly read to be a full-fledged endorsement of the 

catalyst theory. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is not merely a 

catalyst.  In Buckhannon, the catalyst theory was 

rejected.  Here the court said:  If I were to decide 

right now -- the district court said:  I am inclined to 

rule for Hardt, but I'm going to give Reliance an 

opportunity to respond. 

So the court had evaluated the evidence at 

that point as favoring Hardt.  To that extent, it wasn't 

a purely procedural ruling.  It says:  As things stand 

now, Hardt should get fees; but I'm leaving the door

open.  So it wasn't just a procedural decision.  It was 

an evaluation of the evidence up to that point, wasn't 

it? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor, but it 

would be an utterly unadministrable rule to attempt to 

weigh the inclinations of district judges in their opinions. 

This Court's precedents have made clear that we weigh 

success on the merits by evaluating judicial judgments. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the judgment is, send 

it back.  That's what it says:  Send it back.  And the 

reason for sending it back is this woman was undergoing 

terrible pain, that the Social Security Administration 

says she’s completely disabled, that she’s entitled in 

the -- on the evidence shown.  There’s no substantial 

evidence to the contrary.  But you, the company, want to 

take money from her instead of giving her the money. 

Now, I’ve read the record.  It doesn't 

support anything contrary to what I’ve said.  So now 

you send it back.  Now, what is that but a big victory 

for the other side?  Which then leaves the company to 

say:  They're right; pay them. 

Now, if that isn't -- I mean, what words of 

English -- if you’re -- we’re talking about partial success. 

Partial success, or not total defeat.  That is the 

language from Ruckelshaus.  Not "total success."  You

still get it.  Okay.  What in the English language can 

we read in a case or a statute that would say you 

shouldn't reach that commonsense result?  Now, of 

course, I’m characterizing it a little bit, but it does 

seem like a commonsense result. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, Petitioner in 

this case, like all plaintiffs, arrived in court 

requesting a judgment, a judgment awarding her benefits. 

Indeed, she believed she was entitled to such a judgment 

as a matter of law, and she moved for judgment as a 

matter of law for summary judgment. 

What the district court actually did was 

deny that motion for summary judgment.  Rather than give 

her the judgment she sought, the district court employed 

a particular procedural maneuver, which was to remand 

the case -- quote, "remand the case" -- to her 

litigation adversary to reconsider the question.  Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  His point -- your 

adversary's point -- is the court couldn't effect that 

procedural move without taking step one in what was 

requested.  It had to find some sort of violation, 

either to remand or to grant benefits, so that the 

relief sought, by definition, needed a finding by the 

court.  And your adversary says the court found an ERISA 

violation.

Now, the type of relief it grants is up to 

its discretion.  This is an equitable situation, and it 

exercised its discretion by doing a remand.  Why is that 

view different than calling it a procedural step?  Isn't 

that a substantive win? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, this is a 

purely interlocutory order.  So this was not an end to 

the case.  This was not a decision on the merits.  This 

was a purely interlocutory order, on the road to a 

decision on the merits, perhaps, but the district court 

denied her motion for summary judgment, did not conclude 

that she was entitled to benefits as a matter of law and, 

instead, remanded the case for further proceedings.  So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, what is the 

impact on your position of our decision last week in 

Conkright v. Frommert?  I know you haven't had a chance 

to brief it, but I'm also sure had you a chance to read it. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, Conkright 

emphasizes that these judgments are to be made in the 

first instance and, in fact, in the second instance by 

claims administrators, that that is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 

that it -- one thing it did emphasize, that in the 

typical case, the likely relief is going to be sending 

it back rather than making a judicial decision, which --

which seems to me, then, that -- and then presumably, in 

most cases, the person would prevail before the plan 

administrator. 

So given Conkright, your position is going 

to severely limit the circumstances under which 

claimants are entitled to fees. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, it's -- you are 

correct that in Conkright, the Court -- Court indicated 

that in most cases the district court should remand 

under circumstances like this.  You are quite correct. 

Under circumstances like this, then, there would be 

fewer opportunities for district courts to award --

to award fees.  And that’s a correct result under 

502(g)(1), which, as informed by --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even though the --

as in Conkright, the claimant's success can -- before 

an agreement, can be quite dramatic.  This was a very, 

very significant victory for the claimant to get it sent 

back under those circumstances. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I'm not sure 

this should be characterized as a victory.  This is not 

a procedural maneuver that the plaintiff sought.  The 

plaintiff asked for summary judgment, and her summary 

judgment motion was denied.  And, instead, the district 

court chose to remand the case to her litigation

adversary.  Surely, at that moment at least, that surely 

could not have felt like a victory. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Future claimants will not 

ask for summary judgment from the district court, 

presumably, in light of Conkright.  They will ask that 

the case be remanded.  So, in future cases, will they 

have obtained a victory? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I don't think that future 

claimants will ask for a remand as their final form of 

relief, Your Honor.  This was -- the relief that one asks 

for in one's complaint is the final judicial relief that 

one wants.  This is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we've -- we've 

already told them they can't get that. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, a plaintiff 

could get an -- could get the relief of benefits if a 

claims administrator had acted severely improperly or in 

very bad faith.  A district court still has power to 

issue an award on summary judgment. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The claimant doesn’t --

doesn't really claim that.  The claimant just says this 

was a wrong decision and they should do it correctly. 

And the claimant knows that all he's going to get from 

the district court is a remand. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  But the correct way to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So he would not ask for 

money and, therefore, would be victorious, on your 

analysis.  If all he asked for was a remand, he got a 

remand. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.  A properly 

framed complaint under ERISA should still be a claim for 

benefits.  The -- the remand that Conkright contemplates 

is still an interlocutory remand, like the remand here. 

One does not put in one's complaint a desire for 

interlocutory relief, any more than one asks --

JUSTICE BREYER:  If someone wants a remand, 

it's a remand, but on limited grounds; that is, a 

holding of the district court.  The ERISA administrator 

was -- it's an abuse of his discretion to refuse to give 

this woman nothing.  In my opinion, she's entitled at 

least to $30,000, but whether it's 30 or 35, I don't 

know.  So I remand it to the ERISA administrator so he 

can decide to act within -- within his discretion, give 

her either 30, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. 

Now, in your view, attorney's fees -- all 

the statute says is the court, in its discretion, may 

allow a reasonable attorney's fee.  Nothing more.  Now, 

what would stop an attorney's fee in that situation? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's what you think.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, a remand order 

under those circumstances might constitute success on 

the merits because it resolves an issue in the case, which 

was liability in the case.  So that perhaps would constitute 

success on the merits.  This resolved no substantive 

issue on the case.  This remand order simply says:  As a 

procedural matter, go back and look at it again. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You distinguish between him 

saying you have to give her at least 30 and his 

saying the evidence that supports giving her less than 

30 is -- insufficient, is substantially -- is -- what's 

the word?  Yes, worthless. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor, this Court 

has -- this Court has expressly distinguished between 

judicial --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the line you draw? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor, the 

difference between judicial pronouncements and judicial 

relief is one that this Court has --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that's 

difficult.  Let's assume that a claims administrator or a 

plan administrator is not deciding the claim.  The party 

comes to court and says:  Under ERISA, I have a right to a 

decision within X number of days; force them, mandamus 

them to give me a decision.  The court says:  Reasonable;

you have a right to one.  And orders them to. 

Under your theory, they’ve won nothing? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor, in your 

hypothetical the -- the remand order would presumably be 

a final judgment, and it might well constitute success 

on the merits. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're -- you're --

wait a minute.  Then we go back to a question that was 

asked by one of my colleagues.  If a plan participant 

came in and said they didn't consider evidence they 

should have; they didn't seek my treating physician's 

documents, and here they are; they should consider them 

now, and the court says you're right, enters a 

remand order, and dismisses the case -- that's enough? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I'm not sure 

that’s a properly formatted ERISA complaint.  If the 

gravamen of the complaint is "I want my benefits" then --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, what -- what’s 

the difference between the first example I gave, a 

mandamus to issue a decision -- that's not a claim for 

benefits, either; it's a claim for a decision.  What's 

the difference between that and the second hypothetical? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  If the -- if the gravamen 

of the complaint is a complaint for benefits, then the 

complaint should ask for benefits, and the judge should

resolve that case.  A remand would always maintain 

jurisdiction -- should always maintain jurisdiction over 

the case, thus always be interlocutory and procedural. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that how it 

works?  Remands always retain jurisdiction?  I would --

I would have thought the district judge would want the 

thing off his or her docket, you know, for the 

statistics, if anything.  And --

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and would say, 

and maybe could say -- well, what if the judge says: 

Look, I don't know if you’re going to prevail or not 

on remand.  My decision actually doesn't help you much 

one way or the other, but if you get benefits, then the 

other side is liable for attorney's fees, and I assume 

you’ll be able to work out the amount.  If you don't, 

he's done.  End of case.  Sent back to the 

administrator. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, on the research 

that we have done, most district courts hold 

jurisdiction on remands such as this, and we believe 

that is the proper course.  When the case -- the gravamen of 

the case is a complaint for benefits, the district court 

merely remands to the ERISA claims administrator, the 

merits of the case simply have not been decided.

JUSTICE BREYER:  That may be, but why can't 

they do this?  What would be wrong with this heretical 

idea, that as long as the plaintiff wins something out 

of the court, the district judge -- that group of people 

we were talking about -- has discretion to decide 

whether ultimately they got something significant of 

what they wanted, and as long as that judgment helped 

them get them something significantly of what they 

wanted, attorney's fees are fine; and we leave it all up 

to the district judge as long as the district judge 

doesn't abuse the discretion that that standard gives 

him? 

What would -- I mean, would the Earth come 

to an end?  What would happen that would be so terrible 

if we said something like that? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I believe that 

would be to embrace the catalyst theory that this Court 

rejected in 2000 --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It didn't say anything 

against the catalyst theory.  It said you have to 

remember this is an American country, we follow the 

American rule, and there has to be something special in 

the situation.  And what would be special in this 

situation is that the judge has to decide that as a 

result of the favorable ruling, the plaintiff really did

get something significantly of what she wanted. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, the Court was 

careful in Ruckelshaus to say that a purely procedural 

victory would not suffice.  Now, purely procedural 

victory may well -- may well result in success for a 

plaintiff at some later stage; it could result in 

out-of-court success.  This Court has been crystal clear 

that we do not look for success out of court; we don’t 

look for it in interlocutory orders --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose 

the complaint was:  I asked for a turnover of certain 

documents; they refused without reason. And the court 

says:  You’re right; you’re entitled to those 

documents. 

It's interlocutory; there is no decision; 

but the only thing that the plaintiff asked for the 

plaintiff got, that is entitlement to the documents. 

The court said:  You are entitled to the documents. 

And then it goes back, and the documents are turned over 

because the court has ordered that. 

Under your theory, because there was no 

determination of benefits, even that ruling which was a 

total victory for the plaintiff doesn't open the door to 

fees. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  On your hypothetical, Your

Honor, that would not be an interlocutory order.  So if 

a plaintiff arrives seeking only documents and the 

district court awards her, her documents, that would be 

the end of the case, and the district court would 

properly relinquish jurisdiction, and we could evaluate, 

compare the result that the district court gave -- gave 

a plaintiff with what the plaintiff originally asked 

for.  But this is not such a case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that would fall --

even if in the end of the -- at the end of the day no --

no award is made?  No benefits are awarded? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, it might be 

proper to frame a complaint under ERISA for a purely 

procedural remedy like some documents.  That is not the 

main run of ERISA cases.  So in the normal case, a 

petitioner arrives -- a plaintiff arrives asking for 

benefits.  And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- but you say --

you called it purely procedural and you said yes, but 

that's the only thing that she asked for.  So she got it. 

So she qualifies for fees.  Even though you just 

characterized it as purely procedural, it's a purely 

procedural ruling, but it's all she asked for --

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- so she gets benefits.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- I'm not sure that 

a properly framed ERISA complaint would be -- would 

be for a purely procedural result.  If one could frame 

an ERISA claim like that, which I think is extremely --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I'm not dealing 

with something obscure.  If the -- the plaintiff says, I 

have asked for certain documents, they withheld those 

documents with no good cause at all, and the court said: 

You’re right; turn over documents. 

It's that hypothetical.  It's just --

that's the situation.  There is a final order:  Turn over 

the documents.  But it's a procedural order, right? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, nonetheless, benefits 

would be -- nonetheless, fees would be available? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, our position is 

that in this case the remand order was both purely 

procedural and interlocutory.  So it fails under both 

those grounds.  On your hypothetical, the -- the order 

would be a final order, but presumably still purely 

procedural, and so perhaps not success on the merits

me was it's a discrete issue -- final judgment, yes, 

qualifies for fees.  Now you’re saying no, no fees? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, it would 

qualify in the sense that it would be a final judgment, 

not an interlocutory order.  Whether that’s properly 

characterized as a purely procedural victory or not, I'm 

not sure.  Most ERISA claims are not framed that way. 

They are usually framed as claims for benefits, not for 

purely procedural --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the claim were: 

They're just not processing my application.  So, Court, 

order them to process my application.  Right; they’re 

not doing anything; we order then to go process the 

application.  End of case in the district court. 

Fee entitlement? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Again, Your Honor, that 

would perhaps be best characterized as a purely 

procedural victory even though it's a final judgment and 

even though it’s what the plaintiff sought.  Again, in 

this case, this order was purely interlocutory, and so 

it's a much easier case.  This -- in this case, this was 

a procedural step on the road to a final judgment.  This 

was not a final judgment at all and not at all what the 

petitioner sought.

to questions about the significance and the consequences 

of its position said, oh, this is a unique statute. 

ERISA -- it's is an ERISA statute. 

Do you agree that if -- if we rule for you, 

it would be applicable primarily to ERISA and it 

wouldn't have an effect on these other statutes? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Justice Kennedy, I 

don't.  The Court has oftentimes emphasized that 

fee-shifting statutes ought to be read in parallel, that 

we ought to have fewer rather than more fee-shifting 

standards in the world.  And so, presumably, the result 

in this case would govern any number of fee-shifting 

statutes of similar language. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the 

parties -- to follow up on Justice Ginsburg's line of 

questioning, what if the parties decide, look, this case 

rises or falls on the discovery issue?  If we have to go 

through discovery, it's going to cost us a lot more than 

to pay you.  So we stipulate whatever the ruling is on 

discovery will decide the issue. 

In that case, can the party -- can the 

claimant get fees? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  In 

this hypothetical, the district court grants the 

discovery order, but the -- but still holds jurisdiction

over the case? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it grants the 

discovery order, and as a result, a direct result of that 

ruling, the plan pays benefits. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  No, Your Honor.  I believe 

that this Court has rejected the direct results theory 

and has instructed us to look at the content of judicial 

judgments, not at their ancillary effects on parties out 

in the world. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what is the 

difference between prevailing party and some success 

on the merits for you?  The only difference is whether 

they won on one cause of action as opposed to four? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, in Ruckelshaus, 

the Courts emphasized that omitting words like 

"prevailing party" or "success" from a statute is 

significant, but it's not revolutionary, that what it 

accomplishes is a decrease in the quantum of success 

required -- the degree, I believe was the Court's 

language -- but not the type of success required.  But 

it was still --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So under Buckhannon, 51 

percent only entitles you to fees.  And under your view 

of this statute, you have -- as long as you get 

1 percent order, that's enough.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, the -- the Court 

in Ruckelshaus was speaking of the interpretation of 

“prevailing party” that -- that held sway in circuit 

courts in the 1970s. 

At that time, “prevailing party” had been read 

quite narrowly to require substantially prevailing, and 

the Court understood Congress to reject that standard in 

adopting a statute that doesn't include language like 

"prevailing party."  Subsequently, this Court has 

adopted a much more liberal understanding of the words 

"prevailing party," so there may not be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you -- you see no 

difference today? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  There may still be a 

difference, but it will be a smaller difference and a 

difference only in quantity, certainly not a difference 

in type.  The result -- the success still has to be 

success that you can find in a judgment of a court. 

Your Honors, if I could -- Your Honors, as 

a matter of policy, the plaintiffs have argued that this 

will result in -- that -- I'm sorry.  As a matter of 

policy, the plaintiffs -- or the Petitioner's rule would 

result in a second major litigation over attorney's 

fees, and this Court has rejected any such rules.  The 

concern is that the fee-shifting inquiry ought to be

simple and easy to administer. 

The ease of administrability of our rule is 

that it turns on the contents of judicial judgments.  If 

the Petitioner wins in this case, the policy result will 

merely be stingier plans.  So these are not plans that 

any private party is obliged to create, and this Court 

has emphasized that the purpose of ERISA is to balance 

the interests of beneficiaries, on the one hand, but also 

the interest in the creation of these plans and the 

generosity of these plans, on the other.  And a fee award 

under circumstances like this would result in far less 

generous plans for -- for --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question? 

You rely very heavy on Ruckelshaus, which of course was 

a case in which the fees were sought to be imposed against 

the government. 

Is there a basis for distinguishing on a 

sort of a sovereign immunity approach for saying that 

maybe there should be a stricter standard when you’re 

taking money away from the sovereign than when you’re 

taking it away from private litigants? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I don't think 

so.  The Solicitor General is here arguing that this 

ought to be the rule, and it would presumably be the 

same rule even in a statute that applied against the

government.  Again, this Court has cautioned against a 

proliferation of different fee-shifting standards.  I 

would think there would be a concern about having a 

different standard applied to the government than to a 

private party on -- on similar statutory text. 

Certainly, no indication in this statutory text --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's a trust -- trust 

law is at issue here, is the government's assertion. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I agree with 

you that it seems artificial in a way to apply those --

to apply -- to import those principles entirely.  On the 

other hand, this Court has emphasized that ERISA is 

informed by trust principles.  And under Sprague, the 

Court emphasized that trust principles would very rarely 

shift fees in a context like this.  So to that extent, I 

do believe that this provision should be informed by 

this Court's holding on that point. 

Just to re-emphasize, Your Honors, what 

actually happened in the district court below:  So the 

Petitioners sought judgment as a matter of law for 

benefits, and that motion was denied.  Instead, she 

received an interlocutory procedural order, a remand to 

her adversary, a private party in litigation, to 

consider the question again.

for abuse of discretion.  It could easily have come out 

the other way, as the district court itself 

acknowledged. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You also received -- she 

also received a conditional judgment in her favor. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  The district court 

specified that if Reliance did not comply with this 

procedural --

JUSTICE BREYER:  She said:  Unless this 

order goes into effect within 30 days, the judgment will 

be entered for the plaintiff, for her -- for her. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's 

true, but I don't think that distinguishes this from --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, she got one judgment 

in her favor.  It was a conditional judgment.  I mean, 

if we’re being technical, if we’re going to just do 

this totally on some kind of procedural theory of what's 

a judgment, what's a judgment in your favor, and we just 

don't want to look to the merits of it and see what 

really happened, then why doesn't she win?  Because she 

got a judgment in her favor, okay?  End of the matter.

judgment.  Let's see.  It says -- it says judgment.  It 

says in a -- what is it called?  I just saw it here. 

My colleague had it here. 

It says -- I think this it.  It says “Conclusion” 

-- it says -- and it's in the conclusion, and 

it says what happens.  And it says it denies, denies, 

denies, denies.  And then it says:  "Reliance to act on 

Ms. Hardt's application, adequately considering all the 

evidence, within 30 days.  Otherwise, judgment will be 

issued in favor of Mrs. Hardt." 

Now, that's in a kind of judgment, I guess. 

It's in an order.  So an order saying we’ll issue a 

judgment -- it sounds to me like you could say that's a 

judgment in her favor.  You don't have to, but you 

could. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I think that's 

only -- the district court was only saying what is 

implicit in most all procedural orders --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Normally, a judge -- a 

judge doesn't say:  It is ordered that if you do not 

act within 30 days, there will be a judgment entered in 

flavor of the plaintiff.  That's not a usual thing. 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  But, Your Honor, if a party 

ignores the procedural order of a district court, it 

does so often on peril of default.  So it --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm just saying, if we’re 

going to be formal and we’re going to look to certain 

words included in -- in certain papers, irrespective of 

what really happened, don't we have those words in the 

paper that's relevant here? 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Again, Your Honor, the 

district court did not decide the merits of this case. 

The district court offered the possibility that it would 

enter judgment if something happened in the future. 

That thing did not happen in the future.  There was 

no judgment in her favor in this case.  Again, the issue 

was remanded to a private party to determine the issue. 

The grant of benefits on remand certainly could not 

constitute success on the merits. 

That was not judicial action at all.  That 

was the action of a private party.  Purely voluntary 

action.  Certainly, couldn't constitute a judgment under 

Rule 54.  And then when the case arrived back at the 

district court, the district court did the only thing 

that it was left to do, which was to dismiss the case. 

And those are the actual actions the 

district court took:  denying the motion for summary 

judgment and dismissing the case.  And under this 

Court's precedents, where we look for success is in those 

judgments.  Those judgments show us no success on the

merits for Ms. Hardt. 

If there are no further questions --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Ates, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. ATES 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. ATES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I have two points on rebuttal:  Under their 

we must have a final judgment on the benefits on her 

claim for -- final judgment on the merits on her claim 

for benefits, that is absolutely foreclosed by this 

Court's decision in Schaefer, where a Social Security 

claimant comes forward, shows a violation by the 

Secretary; it's remanded back to the Secretary; the case 

is closed at that point.  There was no decision on the 

merits for the benefits, and yet this Court found that 

was prevailing party. 

Here, we don't need prevailing party, but 

moreover, even accepting their theory, it leads to absurd 

results.  There is a provision in ERISA, 1132(c), 

that gives a claimant the right to seek documents.  And 

yet, they are saying if the claimant is wholly 

successful to get the plan document from which certain 

claims you don't even know if you have until you read

those plans, they would say it's a purely procedural 

victory; you cannot get attorney's fees.  The whole 

point of that provision was to require the fiduciary to 

give the document over so people can understand their 

rights. 

Moreover, their final judgment on the merits 

for benefits rule leads to perverse incentives under 

ERISA.  The plan administrator is incented to deny the 

first time around, challenge it all the way through the 

courts, on remand maybe, if they get a conditional 

judgment, as here, that says if you don't act within 

30 days I'm giving you that judgment, they then grant 

the benefits and the court gets rid of the case, they 

have succeeded in eliminating the right 

of claimants to get to court to pursue their rights, 

because of the cost of litigation. 

But moreover, here we have a judgment.  To 

be clear, that is not our argument.  We had a 

conditional judgment by the district court sending it 

back:  If you do not act in accordance with law within 

30 days, I will enter judgment on this case. 

We have that, but at the end of the day, 

it was not a dismissal.  They overlooked district court 

docket 57.  There was a judgment entered in Ms. Hardt's favor 

against Reliance in the amount of attorney's fees.  The

original order merges into that judgment.  We have a 

final judgment here as well.  Although we don't need it 

under section 502(g)(1), we have it here. 

This Court should not require a judgment 

before fees can be awarded.  The whole -- and it 

certainly shouldn't adopt a purely procedural rule out 

of thin air that's not in the statute.  This is a 

procedural statute.  The only way claimants can 

effectuate their right is ensuring the procedure is 

followed.  That is what we have here. 

They did not follow proper procedure.  They 

abused their discretion.  They breached a fiduciary 

obligation to the claimant.  In these circumstances, 

under the clear language and clear structure of this 

statute, this claimant is entitled to fees. 

The only -- may I finish? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

MR. ATES:  The only issue that Reliance 

contested was whether she was a prevailing party.  Knock 

that leg of the stool, their case fails. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
