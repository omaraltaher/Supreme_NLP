CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument

ORAL  ARGUMENT  BY  CHRISTOPHER  LANDAU 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  case  presents  the  question  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  stripped  Puerto  Rico  of  access  to  any  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism  to  restructure  the  debts  of  its  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilities  which  provide  essential  services  to  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens,  like  electricity  and  water. 

 

 

 

 

            

Respondents  contend  that  Congress  denied 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  access  to  Chapter  9  altogether,  but  left 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  subject  to  Chapter  9's  preemption  provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  anomalous  result  can't  be  squared  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute's  text  and  structure. 

 

 

 

            

Congress,  in  1984,  defined  the  word  "State" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Bankruptcy  Code  generally  to  include  Puerto  Rico, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except  for  the  purposes  of  determining  who  may  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtor  under  Chapter  9.  But  that's  just  another  way  of

saying  that  Puerto  Rico's  outside  the  scope  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9.  A  State's  only  role  in  the  Chapter  9  regime 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  authorize  its  municipalities  to  be  debtors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Indeed,  Chapter  9  can't  apply  to  Puerto  Rico 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  light  of  the  1984  amendment.  That  amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorically  precludes  Puerto  Rico  from  passing  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  gateway  into  Chapter  9,  which  is  located  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  1  in  Section  109(c)(2). 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Landau,  that's  true. 

  

 

 

 

 

Don't  you  run  up  against,  with  respect  to  the  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  ­­ Puerto  Rico's  legislation,  the  Contract  Clause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  bar  against  impairing  contracts;  that  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  can't  impair  the  lenders'  contracts? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  apart  from  ­­ so  if  there's  ­­ if  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing  only  with  the  Puerto  Rico  legislation,  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  in  ­­ in  requiring  nonconsenting  lenders  to  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  or  have  their  claims  reduced,  Puerto  Rico  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violating  the  Contract  Clause? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Your  Honor,  the  Respondents 

  

 

 

 

 

here  have  certainly  brought  Contract  Clause  claims.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  this  Court  decides  the  preemption  issue  in  our  favor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  they  would  certainly  be  allowed  to  litigate  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  claims  issues  on  appeal  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand.

question  whether  the  Contract  Clause  applies  to  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico,  which,  as  this  Court  is  aware,  is  in  a  somewhat 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unique  position  in  our  Federal  structure.  That  being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  the  First  Circuit  has  traditionally  assumed  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ without  deciding  that  the  Contract  Clause  applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Puerto  Rico.  And  again,  that  is  an  issue  for  remand. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  question  presently  before  this  Court  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  antecedent  question  on  which  the  courts  below  ruled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  us,  which  is  to  say  that  the  ­­ Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusion  of  Puerto  Rico  from  Chapter  9  nonetheless  left 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  subject  to  Chapter  9's  preemption  provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  would  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

preclude  Puerto  Rico  from  Chapter  9?  In  other  words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ what  is  the  background  of  this  provision? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Sure,  Your  Honor.  It  is  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

black  box  ­­ to  answer  your  question  directly,  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  legislative  history  directly  on  point  either  way.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  side  here  is  going  to  be  limited  to  speculation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  that  score. 

 

 

            

The  one  thing  that  we  do  know  for  sure  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  mere  exclusion  of  an  entity  from  Chapter  9  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  typically  deemed  to  be  a  representation  of  intent  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  to  preclude  a  State  law. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  to  answer  your  question  more  directly  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  I  am  admitting  this  is  speculation  just  as  their

position  is  speculation  ­­ one  thing  that  Congress  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  wanting  to  do  is  to  put  Puerto  Rico  and  D.C. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  same  boat  for  Chapter  9  purposes  as  Guam  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virgin  Islands,  the  other  Territories  that  are  not  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  definition  of  "State"  in  the  Bankruptcy  Code 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  first  place.  In  other  words,  two  somewhat 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusual  things  happened  in  ­­ when  this  provision  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

added. 

            

And  again,  to  go  back  to  your  question,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  this  came  about  after  1978 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  definition  of  "State"  that  had  been  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy  Code  going  all  the  way  back  to  1898  fell  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Code.  That  definition  broadly  defined  "State"  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  Territories  and  possessions. 

 

 

 

            

In  1978,  there  was  an  overhaul  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy  Code,  and  there  was  no  definition  of  "State." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  Congress  recognized  pretty  quickly,  as  early  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1979.  There  were  amendments  to  fix  that  omission  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy  Code.  And  the  initial  ­­ the  initial  fix 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  proposed  by  Senator  DeConcini  in  1979  went  back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  old  definition.  It  says,  "All  Territories  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  are  included"  and  had  no  exclusion.  Okay,  then. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  1981,  though,  a  ­­ a  new  definition 

   

   

 

 

 

was  ­­ that  didn't  go  anywhere. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  1981,  Senators  Dole,  Heflin,  and

DeConcini  proposed  a  definition  of  "State"  that  defined 

   

 

 

 

 

 

"States"  to  include  Puerto  Rico  and  D.C.  only,  but  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  exclude  them  from  Chapter  9.  The  exclusion  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Is  there  any  compact 

  

 

 

 

 

with  those  other  Territories  that  precludes  them  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  their  Territorial  power  to  reorganize  their  debts? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  There  is  not,  Your  Honor.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  other  words,  precisely  because  Guam,  let's  say,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Virgin  Islands,  by,  I  think,  pretty  basic  principles 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  exclusio  unius,  when  Congress,  which  had  long  defined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"States"  to  include  all  Territories  and  possessions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suddenly  in  this  definition,  1984,  says  "State"  means  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes  Puerto  Rico  and  D.C.,  I  think  there's  really  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  understand  that  other  than  to  say  that  "State" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  include  Guam  and  the  Virgin  Islands. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  know  that  Guam  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Virgin  Islands  have  Federal  courts. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  they  have  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

judges.  Are  they  subject  to  constitutional  provisions? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Is  it  an  open  question  of  whether  they  are  subject  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Contract  Clause  as  well?  To  the  contract  provision 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitation,  I  should  say? 

   

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  I  think  that,  yes,  Your  Honor, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it  is.  In  other  words,  I  ­­ this  Court  has  never

answered  that  question,  as  to  whether  or  not  they  fall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  on  the  Federal  government­like  side  of  that,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  contract  laws  with  respect  to  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  or  on  the  State­like  side  of  that  line, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there  is  a  conflict  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  that's  the  open 

  

 

 

 

issue  that  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Yes,  that  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ has  to  go  on  remand. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  ­­ an  open  issue.  Yes. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

So  again,  going  back,  in  a  sense,  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice's  question,  which  I  think  is  really  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  everyone  asks  when  they  pick  up  this  case: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why  would  Congress  have  done  that?  And  again,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  answer  that's  as  plausible  as  any  other  that  we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  able  to  come  up  with  is  that  Puerto  Rico  and  D.C., 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  least,  even  though  they  are  included  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  "State,"  at  least  for  Chapter  9  purposes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  the  same  boat  as  the  other  Territories,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  ­­ which  don't  fall  within  the  scope  of  Chapter  9 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  thus  don't  have  to  ­­ aren't  subject  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9  preemption  provision. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Landau,  could  I  ask  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  focus  on  the  text  here  a  little  bit?  Because  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gateway  theory  of  yours,  I'm  not  sure  it  matches  up  with

the  text  very  well.  I  mean,  you  could  have  a  gateway 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  which  said  something  like,  Puerto  Rico  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  for  all  purposes  except  Chapter  9,  or  except  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  provision  in  Chapter  9,  or  something  like  that.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9  ­­ but  this  provision,  101(52),  is  written 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  more  specifically.  It  says  except  for  the  purpose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  defining  who  may  be  a  debtor  under  Chapter  9.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  any  provision  in  Chapter  9;  it's  just  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  defining  who  may  be  a  debtor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  That  is  an  absolutely  critical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  Your  Honor,  and  that  goes  to  an  interesting  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  structure  of  the  Code.  The  eligibility  criteria 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  various  substantive  provisions  of  the  Code,  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  Chapter  9,  Chapter  11,  Chapter  7,  are  not  located  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  substantive  chapters.  They  are  located  up  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  1.  So  in  other  words,  if  Congress  were  to  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  Puerto  Rico  is  not  a  State  for  purposes  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9,  that  would  actually  not  solve  the  problem  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  here,  because  the  authorization,  the  gateway 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  into  Chapter  9,  is  not  in  Chapter  9.  It's  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  1. 

 

            

It's  this  somewhat  unusual  structure  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  that  I  ­­ I  really  think  we  can't  emphasize 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

strongly  enough  that  ­­ that  to  say  that  Puerto  Rico  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  of  Chapter  9  wouldn't  have  stopped  Puerto  Rico

from  authorizing  its  municipalities  under  Chapter  1  to

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Landau,  I'm  not  sure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  understand  that  argument,  so  you're  going  to  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  up  a  minute. 

   

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Okay.  I'm  sorry.  Yeah, 

  

  

  

 

 

because  it  really  is  an  important  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's,  I  think,  critical 

   

  

 

 

to  your  point,  which  is,  Justice  Kagan  asked  a  direct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question:  Why  couldn't  Congress  have  said  much  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly,  under  101,  the  term  "State"  includes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  of  Columbia  and  Puerto  Rico  except  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9? 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Because  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  Puerto  Rico  is  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  for  Chapter  9,  then  it  couldn't  have  authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  municipality  to  file  under  109.  It  would  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reached  the  same  end,  but  more  clearly  saying  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  is  not  a  State. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  That  109  provision  that  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor  just  referenced  is  not  located  in  Chapter  9.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

located  in  Chapter  1.  So  for  Congress  to  say  "except 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  Chapter  9,"  it  actually  would  not  have  reached  that

109  provision. 

 

            

The  way  to  close  the  gateway  was  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  is  not  a  State  for  purposes  of  authorizing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  municipalities  to  be  debtors  under  Chapter  9.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closes  the  door,  which  is  not  located  in  Chapter  9. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Once  you  close  that  door,  then  you  don't  reach  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chapter  ­­ the  provisions  of  Chapter  9  on  which  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely  and  base  their  entire  case  don't  come  into  play, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  their  whole  argument  is  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection  9031. 

 

            

9031  is  a  proviso  to  903.  If  you  look  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  these  now  are  within  Chapter  9,  as  opposed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

109(c)(2),  the  gateway  provision,  which  is  not  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9.  If  you  look  at  Chapter  1  ­­ excuse  me  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  903,  it  says,  "This  chapter"  ­­ i.e., 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9  ­­ "shall  not  limit  or  impair  the  power  of  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State." 

            

If  a  State  ­­ or  if  a  jurisdiction  like 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  is  categorically  barred  by  Congress  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorizing  its  municipalities  to  enter  into  Chapter  9, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  that  reservation  of  power  makes  no  sense.  It  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  no  conceivable  applicability  to  Puerto  Rico.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  the  101  ­­ 9031  proviso,  which  refers  back  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"such  municipality"  in  903,  doesn't  work  either.

asking  you  to  look  at  that  proviso  in  9031  in  isolation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  opposed  to  understanding  how  there  is  a  decision  tree 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  Basically,  the  statutory  definition  in  101(52) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sends  you  to  109(c)(2),  which  is  in  Chapter  1,  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  gateway  provision.  And  that  says  that  Puerto 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico,  we  know,  is  not  a  State  for  purposes  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorizing  its  municipalities  to  enter  into  Chapter  9. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Once  you  understand  that  that  gateway  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorically  closed  to  Puerto  Rico,  unlike  any  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  of  the  union,  then  903,  which  is  the  next  step  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  decision  tree,  makes  no  sense  as  ­­ as  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purportedly  applied  to  Puerto  Rico,  because  what  903 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  is,  "This  chapter  shall  not  limit  or  impair  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  of  a  State  to  control  its  municipalities." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  then  it  has  two  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clauses  which  are  the  key  clauses. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  the  trouble  that  I  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  where  it  says  ­­ the  same  problem  that  Justice  Kagan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised.  I  mean,  you  have  a  statute  that  prohibits 

    

   

 

 

 

 

importing  a  vegetable  that  isn't  a  fish,  and  we  can't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

read  "vegetable"  as  "fish."  I  mean,  it  just  isn't.  And 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  I'm  having  is  the  problem  of  the  language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  No  ­­ but,  Your  Honor  ­­

The  term  "State,"  just  as  she  said  it,  includes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  of  ­­ of  Columbia  and  Puerto  Rico. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Where  do  we  find  that?  In 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  part  of  Title  11,  which  has  to  do  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy.  So  what  it  seems  to  be  doing  is  it's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  Bankruptcy  Code.  It's  11.  So  when  I  see  the  word 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"State,"  that  includes  Puerto  Rico. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  it  says,  "except  for  the  purpose  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defining  who  may  be  a  debtor  under  Chapter  9."  So  I  go 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back,  I  look  at  it,  and  it  says  ­­ one  of  the  things,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  well,  a  State  law  prescribing  a  method  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

composition  of  indebtedness.  That  is  not  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  defining  who  is  a  debtor  under  ­­ under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9.  So  what  am  I  supposed  to  do  about  that? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Again,  Your  Honor,  if  you  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  this  as  the  decision  tree,  you're  already  looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down  here  at  the  third  ­­ at  the  third  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  the  first  part  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tree  says  is,  State,  nothing  we  say  really  stops  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  controlling  your  municipality,  except  in  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  respect. 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  the  important  respect 

  

 

 

 

 

is  that  you  cannot  have  your  own  bankruptcy  law.

MR.  LANDAU:  But  logically,  that  9031  part 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  were  referring  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MR.  LANDAU:  ­­ doesn't  make  any  sense. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  I  read  it  as  a  decision 

   

   

  

 

 

 

tree.  What  am  I  supposed  to  say? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Okay.  So  the  decision  tree 

  

  

 

 

 

 

starts,  as  you  ­­ as  you  recognize,  with  101(52),  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitions.  It  says  Puerto  Rico  is  not  a  State  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  of  determining  who  may  be  a  debtor  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9.  That  sends  us  to  Chapter  1,  to  109(c)(2). 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  provision,  109(c)(2),  says  that  an  entity  must  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  order  to  get  into  Chapter  9,  you  must  have  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  from  a  State. 

   

 

            

So  we  know  that  Puerto  Rico  is  categorically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precluded  from  authorizing  its  municipalities  to  enter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  Chapter  9. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  know  that. 

    

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Okay.  So  that  ­­ that's  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

second  step  in  the  tree. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  They  can't  be  a  debtor. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Okay.  And  so  then  we  get  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  third  step,  which  I  think  is  exactly  what  Your  Honor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  asking.  The  third  step  in  that  decision  tree  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  chapter,  i.e.,  Chapter  9,  does  not  limit  or  impair

the  power  of  a  State  to  control.  So  the  question  right 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  I  think,  Your  Honor,  is  what  you  put  your  finger 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on,  which  is  to  say:  Does  that  make  any  sense  at  all, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  think  that  in  this  provision,  when  Congress  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  "State,"  this  chapter  doesn't  limit  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  State,  that  Congress  would  have  intended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  to  apply  to  a  jurisdiction  that  Congress  has  not  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  categorically  precluded  from  even  authorizing  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipalities. 

            

That's  the  key  question,  in  other  words. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And,  Your  Honor,  it's  a  very  big  deal  to  assume  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  categorically  precluded  Puerto  Rico  from  access 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  anything. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  ­­ so  then  where  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  ­­ where  in  the  Code,  except  for  this  provision  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  there  dozens  of  places?  20?  A  thousand?  ­­ where 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  word  "State"  is  used  outside  of  Chapter  9's  debtor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  where  then  it  makes  sense  to  read  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  it? 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  There's  about  40. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  About  40? 

  

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  And  in  fact,  if  you  look  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  you  have  them  in  your

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  in  all  the  other  40 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

places,  the  State  is  involved  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ by  ­­ inherent  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  what  a  debtor  and  what  a  creditoror  is, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  has  rights  and  responsibilities  under  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions. 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  you  ­­ what  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  you  to  say  is,  Puerto  Rico  has  been  kicked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  Chapter  9  altogether.  It  doesn't  even  get  into 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  gateway. 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Exactly,  Your  Honor.  And  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  so  to  read  it  as

being  involved  as  a  State,  the  only  other  place  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  is  here. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  In  903,  you  have  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  it  in  some  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  That's  exactly  right,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

Honor.  It's  nonsensical  to  think  that  Congress  having 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorically  shut  the  door  on  Puerto  Rico,  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  it  would  mean  for  this  to  apply,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Again,  the  only  thing  a  State  does  under  this  entire 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9  regime,  which  is  not  located  exclusively  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9,  but  also  in  that  eligibility  provision  up  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  1  in  109(c)(2),  then  you  just  ­­ the  question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  arises  ­­ and,  Justice  Breyer,  if  this  actually  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something,  this  would  be  a  different  case.  But  all  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  again,  is  this  chapter  does  not  limit  or  impair 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  power  of  a  State  to  control. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

When  you're  talking  about  a  jurisdiction 

   

 

 

 

like  Puerto  Rico  that  is  not  allowed  to  be  authorizing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  municipalities,  then  there's  nothing  to  be  preserved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Landau,  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

not  very  different  from  what  we  did  in  ­­ last  year  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Utility  Air  Regulatory  Group  v.  the  EPA.  We  had  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  definition  of  a  statutory  term,  and  then  we

looked  at  it  and  its  play  within  other  sections,  and  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  can't  be  given  the  same  meaning,  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  applies  to  one  generalized  feature  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act,  and  the  use  here  is  in  a  more  specialized  way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

that's  ­­

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Absolutely,  Your  Honor.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you  didn't  cite 

  

 

 

 

 

Utility  Air.  Is  there  a  reason  you  didn't? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

cited  King  v.  Burwell,  and  there  ­­ there  are  many  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  proposition  that  you  can't  just  look  at  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isolated  provision  in  context  and  not  understand  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excuse  me,  one  isolated  provision  and  not  understand  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  fits  into  the  context. 

 

 

 

 

            

Again,  I  think  Respondents  are  asking  you  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

just  pick  up  this  case,  read  903(1)  and  say,  here  it  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  I  have  to  do  is  to  get 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

myself  to  do  the  following  thing:  I  could  dress  it  up 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  people  couldn't  understand  it.  But  what  I  would  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  is  saying  the  following:  It  says  a  State  law,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  says  the  chapter  does  not  limit  or  impair  the  power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  State,  okay,  et  cetera,  et  cetera. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  all  I  have  to  say  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  word  "State"  right  there  does  not  include  Puerto

MR.  LANDAU:  Because  Puerto  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  My  only  problem  with 

  

 

 

 

 

writing  those  words  is  somebody  is  going  to  direct  me  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  provision  a  little  bit  later  where  it  says  the  word 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"State"  in  Title  11,  of  which  this  is  part,  means  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico.  Okay? 

  

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  that  ­­ that's  hard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  me  to  do  because  of  that  language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  But,  Your  Honor,  I  would  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor  has  always  been  so  sensitive  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contextual  approach  to  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That  may  be,  but  I  can't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

say  that  an  "airplane"  means  a  horse. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  And  I  totally  ­­ no,  but,  Your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  if  ­­ if  somebody  is  saying  this  doesn't  apply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driving,  and  then  this  one  is  about  a  ­­ a  subsequent 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  is  about  a  right  turn  on  red  regulation,  you'd 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  no,  but  driving  has  been  taken  completely  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute. 

 

            

In  other  words,  you  are  in  a  position  ­­ by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  you  get  to  ­­ this  is  kind  of  a  truism.  This

is  an  important  federalism  limitation  on  Chapter  9. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  actually  stated  more  descriptively  than  anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else. 

            

It  says,  "This  chapter  does  not  limit  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impair  the  power  of  a  State."  If  we  know  by  definition 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  has  shut  the  door,  there  is  no  door  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  and  no  key  for  Puerto  Rico.  Then  to  ­­ to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  along  and  say,  well,  it  says  "State"  here,  then  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  apply  the  power  of  State.  I  think  you  can  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definition  of  "State,"  but  I  think  you  have  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  that  when  Congress  has  given  a  definition  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"State"  that  ­­ that  categorically  closes  the  door  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  antecedent  portion  of  the  decision  tree;  you  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  reach  this  sensibly. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So,  Mr.  Landau,  I  ­­ I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

I  get  what  you're  saying  now,  which  I  didn't  when  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

started  with.  You're  saying  they  couldn't  just  say  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  State,  except  for  purposes  of  Chapter  9,  because,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  there's  something  that's  outside  of  Chapter  9  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

determines  who  gets  into  Chapter  9. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  they  did  was  they  said  it's  a  State, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except  for  purposes  of  this  gateway,  and  then  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumed  that  that  meant  that  all  of  Chapter  9  wouldn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  either.  That's  your  basic  argument. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Precisely,  Your  Honor.

before  this  amendment,  this  903(1)  did  apply  to  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico;  wasn't  that  right? 

 

 

 

            

correct. 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  you're  saying  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

really  super  significant  change,  which  is  903(1)  applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Puerto  Rico  before  1984,  and  then  doesn't  apply  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1984  because  of  this  definitional  move  that  they  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  in  101(52). 

 

 

            

What  you  have  to  admit  is  ­­ I'm  not  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  what  the  ­­ the  word  ­­ I  mean,  it's  a  ­­ it  would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  mysterious  way,  it  would  be  an  extremely  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cryptic  odd  way  to  make  such  a  major  change. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Your  Honor,  but  the  major  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

let  me  just  ­­ I  ­­ I  would  say  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  mean,  it's  almost  like 

    

 

 

 

 

somebody  doesn't  want  everybody  to  recognize  what  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

major  change  is  being  made  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ and  figured  out  this  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  ­­ where  nobody  would  understand  that  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happening,  including  the  judges  who  would  have  to  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  this  meant.

MR.  LANDAU:  The  major  ­­ Your  Honor,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

major  changes  work  both  ways  because  the  major  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  point  I  would  just  compliment  what  Your  Honor  said, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  prior  to  1984  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Please. 

  

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  ­­ of  course  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  ­­ Puerto  Rico  was  within  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedial  scope  of  Chapter  9.  In  other  words,  Puerto 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  ­­ Your  Honor  made  the  point  that  Puerto  Rico  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  preemption  provision  of  Chapter  9,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  got  the  benefits  of  Chapter  9. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  until  1984,  there  was  always  complete 

 

 

 

 

 

 

symmetry  between  those  entities  that  Congress  gave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access  to  Chapter  9  but  then  said,  but  you  can't  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  State  provisions.  So  the  preemption  provision. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

There  was  never  any  situation  in  which  you  couldn't  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either.  You  couldn't  have  any  access  to  a  legal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism. 

            

Frankly,  again,  both  sides  have 

 

 

 

 

elephant­in­a­mousehole  provisions.  The  other 

  

 

 

elephant­in­the­mousehole  provision  that  Your  Honor  just 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  our  elephant­in­the­mousehole  provision,  is 

 

 

 

 

basically  the  same,  to  say  it  would  be  a  huge  elephant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  mousehole  if,  for  the  first  time,  Congress,  by

simply  taking  Puerto  Rico  out  of  the  access  provision  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9,  nonetheless  wanted  to  preclude  Puerto  Rico  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave  Puerto  Rico  in  the  preemption  provision  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  that's  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  that's  your  basic  policy  argument,  and  I'm  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  it  carries  much  weight.  Why  ­­ why  would  it  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrational  for  Congress  to  say,  all  right,  this  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  we're  going  to  apply  to  all  the  States,  but  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  comes  to  Puerto  Rico,  if  they  want  changes,  we  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  to  come  to  us,  partly  because  Congress  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  sort  of  relationship  with  Puerto  Rico  than  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  all  the  other  States?

MR.  LANDAU:  Absolutely.  And,  frankly,  it 

  

  

 

 

 

would  be  very  anomalus,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  in  response 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  yours  because  that  would  be  Puerto  Rico  in  a  worse 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position,  let's  say,  than  Guam  and  the  Virgin  Islands, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  ­­

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  that's  a  very  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  came  up  with  a  very  good  answer,  Mr.  Landau,  to  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  But  I  wonder  why  it's  absurd  to  treat  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  of  Columbia  and  Puerto  Rico  different  from  Guam 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ­­ the  Virgin  Islands.  I  mean,  why  would  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lump  those  two  ­­ those  four  together? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  LANDAU:  Well,  again,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress  made  this  decision.  One  of  the  things  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat  unusual,  and  I  think  this  Court  is  well  aware 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  ­­ some  of  these  constitutional  status  issues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarding  Puerto  Rico  from  the  pending  Sanchez  Valle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  I  mean,  the  one  thing  that  everyone  in  that  case 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreed  on  is  that  Congress,  through  the  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution,  has  ­­ has  recognized  a  status  that  gives 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  an  incredible  degree  of  autonomy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ the  dispute  in  that  case  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  Puerto  Rico  has  this,  you  know,  nearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State­like  status.  It's  ­­ does  that  come  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  of  Puerto  Rico  or  from  Congress?  But  everyone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agrees  that  Puerto  Rico  operates  in  that  very  unique

situation  which  is  really  almost  the  opposite  extreme  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  spectrum  from  D.C.  where  D.C.  has  to  have  its  laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submitted  to  Congress,  and  they  can  ­­ and  they  can  veto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

So,  again,  we  don't  know  why  Congress  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  goes  back  to  the  black  box  ­­ chose  to  lump  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  jurisdictions  which  are  kind  of  at  opposite  ends  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  oversight.  Certainly  the  other  side  came 

  

 

 

 

 

 

up  with  a  theory  that  the  First  Circuit  embraced  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  was  seeking  to  retain  control  over  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico's  municipalities  here,  which  is  a  very  strange 

   

 

 

 

 

 

theory  given  that  Congress  has  not  had  control  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico's  municipalities  since  well  before  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  ­­ the  Commonwealth  was  created  in  1952. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  just  not  the  structure  of  the  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  government  and  its  political  relationship  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Have  you  given  up  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Government  Development  Bank's  position  and  that  of  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  amici  that  the  provision  of  903(1)  applies  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  only  when  a  debtor  is  in  a  Chapter  9  proceeding

we  don't  need  to  get  there.  But  we  ­­ we  don't  reject

Mr.  McGill. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MATTHEW  D.  McGILL 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Everyone  here  agrees  that  in  1984,  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

withdrew  from  Puerto  Rico  and  the  District  of  Columbia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  power  to  put  their  municipalities  into  Chapter  9 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy. 

            

Petitioners'  position  is  that  by  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enactment,  Congress  impliedly  gave  Puerto  Rico  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

District  a  much  greater  power  that  no  State  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

possessed  since  1946,  the  power  to  write  its  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipal  laws. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  no  State  has 

  

 

 

 

 

possessed  the  power  to  impair  contract  rights  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution.  Nothing  about  the  Bankruptcy  Code  changes

the  application  of  the  Contract  Clause.  They  have  to  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  Chapter  9  to  impair  contracts  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

correct? 

            

            

MR.  McGILL:  Justice  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ in  a  meaningful  way, 

   

  

 

 

 

MR.  McGILL:  Yes,  but  Justice  Sotomayor  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  So  what 

  

  

 

 

 

makes  you  think  that  Congress  intended  to  let  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  and  the  District  of  Columbia  have  free  reign  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  they  wanted  to  do? 

 

 

 

 

            

Wouldn't  they  be  subject,  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  ­­ I'm  sure  you'd  be  arguing  they're  subject  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Contract  ­­ Impairment  Clause. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  And  they  are. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 

  

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  The  Contract  Clause  applied 

  

 

 

 

 

directly  to  Puerto  Rico  by  dint  of  the  Jones  Act  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1917. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  you  think  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

intended  to  stop  Puerto  Rico  and  the  District  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Columbia  from  passing  emergency  legislation  that  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  shut  off  the  lights  tonight;  that  ­­ that  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended  that  that  kind  of  temporary  provision  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  be  subject  to  Congress,  who  may  be  on  recess,  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  be  wherever  it  is,  that  it  could  not  do  that?

MR.  McGILL:  Yes,  Justice  Sotomayor,  because 

  

 

 

 

in  1946  that  was  precisely  the  decision  Congress  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  decided  to  overrule  this  Court's  decision  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Faitoute. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  it  decided  to 

  

 

 

 

 

overrule  it  by  giving  States  the  opportunity  to  go  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy,  and  that  would  be  a  temporary  state  to  start 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with. 

            

MR.  McGILL:  So  ­­ so  the  question  is,  as  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  it,  Justice  Sotomayor,  is  what  was  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  in  1984?  Was  it  ­­ we  all  know  that  it  removed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  District  and  from  Puerto  Rico  the  opportunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  put  its  municipalities  into  Chapter  9  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  it  never  gave  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  ­­ everyone  agrees  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  it  never  gave  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Territories  that.  So  the  Territories  can  pass  a  law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  stops  the  lights  from  going  out  today  until 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  comes  into  effect,  'cause  it  can't  do  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permanent  impairment  of  the  contract. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  Justice  Sotomayor,  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

correct,  I  don't  believe.  It's  not  presented  here,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  turns  on  it,  but  let  me  explain  why  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  which  shows  up  for  the  first  time  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yellow  brief,  I  think  is  wrong.

Puerto  Rico  was  ­­ was  considered  a  State. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

It  itself  admits  it  was  a  quote/unquote  State  from  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period  of  1978  to  1984  when  there  was  no  definition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"State." 

            

Prior  to  1978,  all  States,  Territories,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possessions  of  the  United  States  were  States.  After 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1978,  all  States,  Territories,  and  possessions  continued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  treated  as  States.  And  then  in  1984,  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacts  101(52)  which  says  States  include  the  District 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Puerto  Rico  except  for  this  one  purpose,  which  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defining  who  may  be  a  debtor  under  Chapter  9. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  ­­ so  the  question  is  whether  ­­ you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  it  doesn't  say  Ohio,  it  doesn't  say  "State" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes  Ohio,  but  clearly  it  does,  because  everyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledges  old  definition  of  State  has  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carried  through. 

 

            

So  I  don't  believe  it's  correct.  And  no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

court  I'm  aware  of  has  ever  held  that  ­­ that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  ­­ that  the  Virgin  Islands  or  Guam  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American  Samoa  are  not  States  for  purposes  of  ­­ of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy  Code. 

 

            

What  we  have  here,  however,  is  a  clear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

textural  provision  that  says  Puerto  Rico  is  a  State,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  ­­ so  is  the  District  of  Columbia,  except  for  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  purpose,  which  is  defining  who  may  be  a  debtor  under

Chapter  9. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Doesn't  the  definitional 

  

 

 

 

section  of  the  Code  tell  you  who  qualifies  as  a  debtor, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  qualifies  as  a  creditor,  who  can  go  into  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chapter  or  not? 

 

 

            

 

 

It  tells  you  if  you're  this  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor,  you  go  into  that  chapter.  If  you're  that  kind 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  creditor,  you  go  ­­ I'm  sorry.  If  you're  this  kind 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  debtor,  you  go  to  ­­ individual  goes  here,  business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes  there,  this  one  goes  here.  You  have  options. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Isn't  it  what  he  describes  as  a  gateway  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells  you  where  you're  a  part  or  what  you're  a  part  of? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  Today  that's  true,  but  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  true  when  Chapter  9  was  first  enacted  in  1934  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1937. 

            

In  1934,  the  gateway  provision  was 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  83  ­­ I  mean  Section  81  of  the  '34  Act,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  then  known  as  Chapter  X  or  Chapter  10,  and  it  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  83(a)  again  in  1937.  So  it  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recodification  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code  in  1978  that  moved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  the  gateway  requirements  to  Section  109.  And  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  has  ever  contended  that  that  was  intended  to  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  change. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Oh,  but  it  is,  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  tells  you  what  kind  of  debtors  can  make  use  of  what

mean  ­­

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  But  that  was  always  true.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  is  always.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

what  the  purpose  of  a  gateway  is. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  But  ­­ no,  no,  but  it  was  true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  was  part  of  Chapter  9  ­­ old  Chapter  X  and  old 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  IX.  It  was  true  then  that  the  gateway  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gateway  provisions  defined  who  may  be  a  debtor. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  ­­ it  excludes  today,  for  instance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solvent  municipalities,  right?  Solvent  municipalities 

  

 

 

 

may  not  invoke  Chapter  9.  That  is  a  gateway 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

requirement.  And  it  used  to  be  that  ­­ that  the  1937 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  provided  a  laundry  list  of  certain  types  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipalities  that  were  eligible  for  Chapter  9.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  every  municipality  under  the  sun.  It  was  a  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laundry  list  of,  you  know,  six  or  seven  categories.

Rico,  and  you  say  even  though  it's  not  a  part  of  Chapter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  by  definition  in  109,  it  still  remains  a  State  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  of  this  reservation  of  State  powers? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why  aren't  we  using  "creditor"  in  903  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  used  in  the  Bankruptcy  Code?

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  you're  going  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

literal  as  to  "State,"  why  aren't  you  literal  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"creditor"? 

            

MR.  McGILL:  As  the  Commonwealth,  I  think, 

   

  

 

 

 

here  has  acknowledged,  it  ­­ it  has  abandoned  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  And  it's  not  clear  to  me  that  even  the  GDB 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believes  in  it,  because  if  you  look  at  page  8, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

footnote  2  of  their  reply  brief,  they  acknowledge  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico's  own  bankruptcy  laws  were  preempted,  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  until  1984,  which  could  be  true  only  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted  our  version  or  the  plain  meaning  version  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"creditor." 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  let's  go  back.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to  take  the  literal  meaning  of  "State" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitionally,  why  aren't  you  taking  the  literal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  of  "creditor"? 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  Because  we  are  applying  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

principle  that  this  Court  laid  down  in  Lawson  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unanimous  reaffirmed  in  northwest  Austin  that  when  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  definition  mechanically  applied  will 

 

 

 

 

annihilate  a  major  purpose  of  the  statute,  then  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  apply  it.  Or  when  it  leads  to  absurd  results,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  apply  it. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  how  do  I  read  into 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  statute?

MR.  McGILL:  It  would  annihilate  the  major 

  

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  of  the  1946  Act,  which  was  to  ­­ which  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent  States  from  enacting  their  own  bankruptcy  laws. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  is  your  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  you  actually  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

do  that,  meaning  you  can't  do  that  according  to  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior  precedent.  It  is  inherent  in  State  sovereignty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  States  have  to  have  some  method,  their  own  method, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  controlling  their  municipalities. 

 

 

 

            

You  can  have  uniform  bankruptcy  laws,  but  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  don't  make  them  available  to  a  municipality  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  hasn't  approved  it,  can  you  rob  a  State  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  sovereignty  of  all  power  to  regulate  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipality  and  to  save  it  from  ­­ from  bankruptcy? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  Yes.  I  mean,  that's  always 

    

  

 

 

 

been  true.  It  was  true  in  1946  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Actually,  so  why  do  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

many  major  commentators,  bankruptcy  writers,  district 

 

 

 

 

 

and  circuit  courts,  the  Sixth  Circuit  included,  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  that's  impossible;  that  you  can't  rob  a  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  power  to  regulate  its  municipalities  if  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offering  it  nothing  in  return? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  In  1946,  the  preemptive  scope 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  what  is  now  Section  903(1)  embraced  any  municipality. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  barred  States  from  enacting  ­­ it's  essentially  the

same  language  that  exists  today.  Any  ­­ it  barred 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  from  binding,  nonconsenting  creditors  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

composition  if  they  ­­ of  holders  of  municipal  debt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  then  we  said  in

MR.  McGILL:  This  was  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ to  go  into 

  

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy. 

            

MR.  McGILL:  I  believe  that  was  Ashton. 

    

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  ­­ and  it  was  ­­ and  of  course,  Deacon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequently  readdresses  Ashton,  and  ­­ and  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrows  Ashton.  But  the  Tenth  Amendment  problem  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  ­­ was  raised  in  Ashton  was  that  States  ­­ that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  was  giving  municipalities  too  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reign  to  go  into  bankruptcy  themselves  without  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervision  of  their  States.  The  ­­ the  problem  raised 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Ropico  decision,  which  is  a  40­year­old  district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  decision  from  the  Southern  District  of  New  York, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  very  different  problem,  which  is  that  the  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  is  exercising  too  much  power  ­­ too  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy  power  over  municipalities. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  would  submit  that  simply,  you  know,  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  extent  Ropico  was  concerned  about  that  ­­ and  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  holding;  it's  just  a  straight  statement  at  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

fifteenth  page  of  the  opinion  ­­ it's  wrong.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  McGill  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  McGILL:  Sturges  v.  Crowninshield  said 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

that  ­­ that  Congress's  power  under  the  Bankruptcy  Code 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  unlimited  and  supreme. 

 

 

 

            

I'm  sorry. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  talk  to  you  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Landau's  textual  argument?  Because  I  came  in  here 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

thinking  that  your  best  argument  is  straight  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text.  It's  not  about  purpose,  because  I  don't  know  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  purpose  here  was;  it's  not  on  policy.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  straight  on  the  text.  But  I  now  have  a  better 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  of  Mr.  Landau's  understanding  of  the  text, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  I  just  want  to  engage  you  on  that,  which  is: 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Look,  Congress  couldn't  have  just  said  "except  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes  of  Chapter  9"  because  of  this  flukey  thing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  that  the  gateway  provision  is  outside  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9.  So  if  it  had  just  said  "except  for  purposes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Chapter  9,"  somebody  could  have  said,  oh,  well,  look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  am  entitled  to  be  a  debtor  under  Chapter  9,  whether  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  I'm  thought  of  as  a  State.  And  so  they  did  it  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  way,  which  said  ­­ which  attacked  the  gateway 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  particularly.  And  then  in  doing  that,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumed  that  all  of  Chapter  9  would  follow  in  its  wake. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Once  you're  not  eligible  for  Chapter  9,  none 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  provisions  of  Chapter  9  apply  to  you.  That's

basically  Mr.  Landau's  provision  ­­ argument.  So  tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  why  that's  wrong. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  It's  ­­ it  starts  ­­ I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  fundamental  fallacy  of  the  argument  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gateway  requirement  somehow  excludes  you  from  the  scope 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Chapter  9  entirely.  And  we  know  that's  wrong, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  if  PREPA  filed  for  Chapter  9  bankruptcy  today, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  Section  921(c)  of  the  Code,  a  part  of  Chapter  9, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  provide  for  the  dismissal  of  that  petition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9  applies  to  all  persons,  all  people  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compass  of  Federal  law. 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  that  that's  the  fundamental 

   

 

 

 

 

fallacy.  Chapter  9  does  apply.  The  textual  argument  ­­

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  it  doesn't  have  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  that.  He  has  some  ­­ an  additional  string  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bow;  that  is,  what  he  wants  us  to  do  is  to  take  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  "a  State"  ­­ "this  chapter  does  not  limit  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impair  the  power  of  a  State,"  which  is  in  903.  Now,  he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  us  to  read  that  as  if  there  were  then  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parentheses,  "a  State  that  is  a  debtor  under  Chapter  9." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  see?  And  that  a  State  ­­ what  States?  The  States 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  can  be  debtors  under  Chapter  9. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  how  he  wants  us  to  read  it,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  means  that  that  provision  does  not  apply  to  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  or  D.C.  But  it  isn't  just  that  no  part  of

Chapter  9  could  apply  to  them.  It  is  that  if  you  look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  first  sentence  of  903,  is  that  what  it  says  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  those  States  that  are  referred  to  in  that  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  maintain  all  the  power  to  control  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation  or  otherwise  a  municipality. 

   

 

 

            

And  he  says,  what  could  that  apply  to? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those  entities  that  are  not  in  Chapter  9  obviously  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  powers  they  normally  had,  but  the  ones  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Chapter  9  might  not.  And  so  what  this  Section  903  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed  to  are  those  States  that  are  in  Chapter  9, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there's  no  need  to  apply  that  first  sentence  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyone  else,  and  therefore  it  doesn't  apply  to  Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico,  that  first  sentence.  But  since  the  key  sentences, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  and  two,  are  subparts  of  the  first  sentence,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  apply,  either. 

 

 

              

I  think  that's  the  whole  argument.  And  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  requiring  us  to  really  play  that  much  ­­ you  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

play  games  with  the  words.  All  you  do  is  say,  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  those  parts  of  Chapter  9  ­­ not  all,  but  one  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  parts  ­­ that  even  though  it  doesn't  use  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"debtor"  under  Chapter  9,  applies  only  to  debtors  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9.  I  think  that's  the  argument  I  got,  and  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that's,  I  think,  probably  consistent  with  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan  was  saying.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  got  it?  Do  you  see 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  I'm  saying? 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  McGILL:  Two  ­­ two  responses. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Good.  All  right. 

  

  

 

 

MR.  McGILL:  The  first  is  the  ­­ the  textual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  that  you  yourself,  Justice  Breyer,  elaborated, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  spoke  with  remarkable  precision  here  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

101(52).  It  says  you're  not  a  State  for  one  purpose 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only,  which  is  defining  who  may  be  a  debtor  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9,  and  that's  an  unmistakable  textual  reference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Section  109.  And  so  that  tells  you  that  Puerto  Rico 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  State  for  every  other  purpose  under  the  Bankruptcy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code,  because  that's  what  Section  101  says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  not  ­­ no.  In  ­­ my 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  is,  if  we  go  through  Chapter  9,  and  the  parts  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  ­­ do  apply  to  debtors  under  Chapter  9  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  But  States  are  not  debtors. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ whoa,  whoa,  whoa  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

municipalities.  State  municipalities. 

  

 

            

If  we  go  through  Chapter  9  and  look  at  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portions  of  Chapter  9  that  do  apply  to  municipalities 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  are  there  legitimately  as  debtors,  we  will  find  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences  that  clearly  apply  only  to  those  who  are  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  as  debtors  and  clearly  do  not  apply  to  anyone  else 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  world.  And  he  is  saying  this  is  one  of  those.

MR.  McGILL:  So  that  misapprehends  what 

  

 

 

 

 

Section  903  does.  What  Section  903  is,  is  at  the  time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  is  entering  the  field  of  municipal  debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjustment  in  1937,  Section  903  is  enacted  to  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  is  not  also  entering  the  field  of  municipal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reorganization,  reorganization  that  could  occur  under 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  11.  This  was  a  very  important  point  in  both  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1934  and  the  1937  debates.  That  adjustment  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  was  seen  as  within  Congress's  purview. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reorganization  of  municipalities  was  seen  as  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States'  purview. 

 

            

So  Section  903  says  we  are  not  entering  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

field  of  reorganization  when  we're  entering  the  field  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt  adjustment.  And  then  Faitoute  misreads 

  

 

 

 

 

Section  903(1)  ­­ 903,  rather.  At  least  in  the  judgment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  subsequent  Congress,  Faitoute  misread  Section  903 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  permit  conflicting  municipal  bankruptcy  laws. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  Congress  enacts  Section  903(1).  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  now  nine  years  later.  And  it  enacts  it  for  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  purpose  than  Section  903  was  enacted.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacts  a  separate  provision  specifically  to  overrule 

   

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  decision  in  Faitoute,  and  to  make  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  only  under  a  Federal  law  should  holders  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipal  bonds,  which  are  widely  held,  be  compelled  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept  a  restructured  debt.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  McGill,  why  would 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress  put  Puerto  Rico  in  this  never­never  land?  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  it  can't  use  Chapter  9,  and  it  can't  use  a  Puerto 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rican  substitute  for  Chapter  9.  It's  locked  out  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  on  which  you  are  relying,  so  it  has  to  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  bitter,  but  it  doesn't  get  any  benefit  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why  in  the  world  ­­ what  explains  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanting  to  put  Puerto  Rico  in  this  anomalous  position  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  being  able  to  restructure  its  debt? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  There  are  a  few 
 

   

  

 

 

reasons,  I 

 

think.  And  as  Mr.  Landau  has  said,  there 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  no 

 

legislative  history  that  sets  this  forth 
 

 

 

 

 

 

in  detail,  but 

 

 

let  me  suggest  a  few  reasons  why  Congress 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

might  have 

 

done  what  it  did. 

 

 

 

            

First,  Congress  has  for  a  long  time 

   

 

 

 

 

micromanaged  Puerto  Rico's  debt.  In  the  Jones  Act,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  limited  the  amount  of  debt  Puerto  Rico 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  take  on.  That  actually  was  kept  and  retained 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  Public  Law  600.  And  it  was  only  in  1961 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  ended  its  own  restriction  of  Puerto  Rico's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt  on  the  condition  that  the  Puerto  Rico  ­­ Puerto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  include  that  restriction  in  its  own  constitution. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  there's  a  long  history  of  Congress  intervening  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  debt  issues. 

 

 

 

            

Second,  Puerto  Rico  debt  is  uniquely  triple

tax  exempt.  Congress  has  essentially  told  the  nation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ and  encouraged  the  nation  all  over  to  buy  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt.  So  there  is  a  ­­ this  is  ­­ this  debt,  even  more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  than  the  average  municipal  bond,  is  widely  disbursed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout  the  nation. 

 

 

              

I  think  the  ­­ third  reason  is  that  by  1984 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  and  D.C.  are  the  two  most  indebted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Territories  by  a  lot.  Puerto  Rico  already  had 

   

  

 

 

 

 

$9  billion  of  debt.  The  District  owed  1.6  billion,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  about  to  hit  the  general  obligation  bond  market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  first  time  in  its  history. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  question  I  ­­ I  ask  is,  how  would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress,  at  that  moment  in  time,  actually  think  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  was  the  right  time  to  abandon  a  40­year­old  policy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  uniformity  and  preemption  in  the  field  of  municipal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy,  and  ­­ and  for  the  first  time  since  1946, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow  the  District  of  Columbia  and  Puerto  Rico  to  write 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  own  municipal­bankruptcy  laws  that  may  or  may  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treat  their  nationwide  creditors  fairly,  that  may  or  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  result  in  ­­ in  decrees  that  are  enforceable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide? 

            

There's  no  good  reason  or  plausible  reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  think  that  Congress  actually  intended  that  result. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  under  this  Court's  cases  in  Timbers  of  Inwood  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cohen  v.  de  la  Cruz,  when  there  is  no  clear  indication

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  Mr.  ­­ Mr.  McGill,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  could  go  back  to  Justice  Breyer's  question,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer  gave  you  a  view  of  the  way  to  read  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text,  which  is  built  on  Mr.  Landau's  view,  and  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  wrong  with  that?  And  you  ­­ you  go  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gateway  provision,  and  then  even  if  not  all  of  Chapter  9 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follows  in  its  wake,  at  least  all  the  provisions  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9  that  refer  to  debtors  follow  in  its  wake. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  Justice  Breyer  said,  what's  wrong  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  as  a  way  to  read  this  text.  And  then  you  answered 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him,  I  think  this  is  fair  to  say,  by  giving  a  ­­ a  story 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  Congress  meant  to  do  in  903(1)  in  the  wake  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Faitoute. 

            

But,  you  know,  both  of  you  have  stories 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  this,  and  it's  not  ­­ just  not  clear  which  of  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  right.  And  I  guess  what  I  most  want  to  think  about 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  this  text.  Why  isn't  Justice  Breyer's,  Mr.  Landau's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  of  the  text  just  as  good,  if  not  better,  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yours?  And  I  didn't  come  in  here  thinking  that,  but  now 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  kind  of  am  thinking  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  talk  to  me  about  the  text,  why  that's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  as  good  a  view  of  the  text?

unmistakable  textual  reference  to  109(c).  And  109(c)  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling  us  ­­ it's  just  ­­ it  ­­ it  says  it's  only  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  one  purpose,  except  for  the  purpose  of  defining  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  be  a  debtor  under  Chapter  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  that's  ­­ that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  that  tells  you  whether  you're  now  in  Chapter  9 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  debtor. 

   

            

            

MR.  McGILL:  But  ­­ but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  what  Mr.  Landau  is  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  once  you  say  you're  ­­ you're  ­­ you're  not  a  State, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  comes  to  who  may  be  a  debtor  under  Chapter  9, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  a  pretty  natural  thing  to  say,  and  that  means 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  any  provisions  about  being  a  debtor  under  Chapter  9 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  apply  to  you. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  Let's  be  clear  that  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  be  debtors,  right?  So  it  ­­ under  Chapter  9.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ it's  not  that  the  State  ­­ that  the  definition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  "State"  can't  possibly  track  the  definition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"debtor."  It's  the  municipality  that  has  to  track  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  "debtor." 

 

 

            

And  20­plus  States  categorically  exclude 

 

 

 

 

their  municipalities  from  seeking  Chapter  9  relief.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ they  are  in  the  same  boat,  those  municipalities, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  San  Juan.  There  is  no  textual  distinction  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawn  from  those  municipalities  under  109(c)(2).

De  Moines  is,  just  as  much  ­­ just  as  much  as  San  Juan, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lacks  the  authorization  understate  law  to  file  a

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  that's  up  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State.  It's  up  to  the  State  to  make  that  decision. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  isn't  given  that  option. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  Well,  that  ­­ that  is,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  true.  It  is  an  act  of  Congress  that  does  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  ­­ but  there  are  numerous  exclusions  that  are  solely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  dint  of  federal  law.  In  fact,  the  rest  of  109(c)  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusions  that  have  been  enacted  by  Congress  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipalities  from  Chapter  9  entirely. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  So  you're 

  

  

 

 

 

saying  is  ­­ I  take  it  you're  ­­ that  you  say  ­­ you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  ­­ you're  just  used  to  this.  So  you  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  that  I'm  not  used  to  it.  And  the  ­­ the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ you  go  look  at  903.  There  ­­ there  are  three

things.  That  number  2  and  3,  which  are  numbered  1  and

If  I  read  the  cases  you  cite,  I  will  say 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  intended  something  very  clear.  They  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

want  those  States  who  weren't  in  Chapter  9.  They  didn't

didn't  want  them  to  make  rules  for  bankruptcy  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipalities,  not  binding  rules,  anyway.  That  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

their  purpose. 

 

            

And  there's  just  no  reason  to  think  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  they  had  the  specific  thing  before,  they  wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow  to  let  Puerto  Rico  and  District  of  Columbia  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  do  what  the  States  couldn't  do.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  you  say,  well,  there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  good  reason.  They  said  the  good  reason  is  the  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  come  in  to  9,  and  they  can't.  And  you  say,  well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  isn't  a  good  enough  reason. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

Is  that  where  ­­ have  I  got  this? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  McGILL:  Well,  it  ­­ it  certainly  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  a  momentous  change  in  ­­ in  the  policy  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption  that  had  existed  uninterrupted  since  1946 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  had  been  reaffirmed  in  1976  and  in  1978.  This  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

battleground  legislation  in  1976  and  1978.  It  was  ­­

preemption  provision.  And  the  Senate  ­­

what  you  say.  What  do  I  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  I  would  look  at  this  Court's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

cases  in  Iraq  v.  Beaty,  Alaska  v.  United  States,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whitridge.  Whitridge  is  ­­ is  an  older  opinion,  but  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  very  telling  here  because  Whitridge  is  a  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  comes  ­­ addresses  how  you  read  a  proviso  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted  years  after  the  antecedent  provision.  And  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whitridge  says  is  you  look  to  the  purpose  of  the  proviso 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  make  sure  that  your  ­­ your  construction  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  purpose  of  the  proviso. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Iraq  v.  Beaty  is,  of  course,  a  unanimous 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decision  of  this  Court.  And  Alaska  v.  The  United  States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ is  another  not  unanimous  opinion  of  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  I  don't  think  it's  ­­ I  think  it's  entirely  possible 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  read  section  903(1)  as  a  general  independent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

standalone  rule,  and  that  certainly  is  how  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted  it  when  it  was  first  enacted  in  1946. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  have  elaborated  already.  I  think  903 

    

 

 

 

applies  to  every  State  in  the  sense  that  it  demarcates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  Congress  is  not  entering  and  where  Congress  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  the  role  that  903  plays  in  this  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheme.

States  that  don't  permit  their  municipality  to  become 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtors  are  limited  in  what  they  can  do  by  903?  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  their  ­­ their  municipalities  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debtors?  Their  sovereign  powers  have  been  cut  off? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  cannot  reorganize  the  debt  except  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9? 

 

            

Then  we're  talking  about  a  coercive 

   

 

 

 

provision.  We're  saying  you  can't  do  anything  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

composition  of  your  debt.  If  98  percent  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors  want  to  reorganize  their  debt  with  you  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  2  percent  vultures  are  saying  no,  and  a  Court 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

would  say  it's  not  an  impairment  of  a  contract  to  redo 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  debt  because  of  the  need,  everything  else  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  said  in  the  past,  you're  saying  States  can't  do  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  ­­ they  can  only  do  it  under  Chapter  9? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  You  have,  in  your  hypothetical, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor,  I  believe,  supposed  that  the  ­­ that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  composition  does  not  violate  the  contract  clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  question  then  would  be  one  of  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction  whether  the  composition  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothesized  fits  within  the  term  of  901. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Assume  ­­ I  assume  it 

   

  

 

 

 

doesn't.  Assuming.  You're  saying  903  intended  to

not  coercive  about  that?  What's  the  choice  for  States

MR.  McGILL:  The  ­­ the  choice  for  States

And  what  is  going  on  right  now  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  like  the  Tenth 

  

 

 

 

 

Amendment  right  of  States  to  deal  with  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipalities  consistent  with  the  Constitution.  Where

of  States  so  drastically? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  McGILL:  Well,  the  contract  clause,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think,  stands  as  an  independent  bar  to  any  ­­ to  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impairment  of  the  obligation  of  contracts.  It  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  at  the  time  of  beacons  that  States  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powerless  to  act  in  this  area.  That  was  ­­ that  comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  out  of  Bekins.

Respondents'  argument  to  make  any  sense  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  various  Territories,  they  have  to  say  that  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  Territories,  such  as  the  Virgin  Islands  and  Guam, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  encompassed  within  the  definition  of  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"State." 

            

 

They  just  can't  say  that  when  Congress, 

 

 

 

 

 

which  had  long­defined  "State"  to  include  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possessions  and  Territories,  in  1984,  in  the  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  that  we  are  considering,  said  "State"  includes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  and  D.C.  That  is  probably  the  clearest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressio  unius  one  can  imagine.  So  for  them  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that,  well,  even  though  it  said  Puerto  Rico  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D.C.,  it  meant  to  include  everything  ­­ and  again,  Guam, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  instance,  and  the  Virgin  Islands,  have  also  Triple  A 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tax­exempt  bonds.  So  everything  that  is  true  for  Puerto 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rico  would  be  true  of  the  Virgin  Islands  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guam. 

              

I  guess  the  more  fundamental  point,  though, 

 

 

 

 

 

is  when  ­­ when  you  are  asking  them  about  how  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  argument  is,  if  you  accept  our  position,  then  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipality  that  is  not  authorized  to  file  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9  is  also  exempt  from  Chapter  9.  They're  trying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  talk  about  municipalities.  But  I  think,  as  Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg  made  the  point,  no,  here  we're  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States.

Massachusetts,  for  instance,  always  has  the 

 

 

 

 

 

power  to  authorize  its  municipalities  to  seek  Chapter  9 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief.  The  door  is  open  for  Massachusetts,  and  ­­ as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  for  Michigan  when  Michigan,  on  the  same  day, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  Detroit  to  file  for  bankruptcy,  and  Detroit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact  filed  for  bankruptcy.  So  the  States  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  yet  authorized  just  maybe  haven't  had  a  crisis 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  requires  them  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  they  are  trying  to  say  you  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compare  San  Juan  to  Boston.  Our  point  is,  the  relevant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comparison,  since  we're  talking  about  the  word  "State," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  you  have  to  compare  Puerto  Rico  to  Massachusetts  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Michigan. 

            

Unlike  Massachusetts  or  Michigan,  which  have 

 

 

 

 

 

the  door  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ the  key  to  the  doorway,  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gateway  in  109(c)(2),  Puerto  Rico  categorically  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not.  Thus,  when  you  arrive  at  903  ­­ and  the  word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"State"  appears  only  three  times  in  all  of  Chapter  9. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  appears  twice  in  ­­ in  Section  903,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaffirming,  saying  this  chapter,  Chapter  9,  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit  or  impair  the  power  of  States  to  control  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipalities. 

            

So  that  makes  no  sense  as  applied  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictions  like  Puerto  Rico  that  are  categorically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excluded  from  coming  through  the  gateway  of  109(c)(2),

Massachusettses  of  the  world,  regardless  of  whether  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

date  they  have  authorized  their  municipalities. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Finally,  the  last  point  I'd  like  to  make  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  talked  a  lot  about  ­­ about  legal  principles,  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  appropriate,  today.  But  this  is  also  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

flesh­and­blood  situation  in  Puerto  Rico. 

 

 

 

 

            

Puerto  Rico  enacted  this  Recovery  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  is  facing  a  crisis  in  providing  essential 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

services  to  its  citizens.  It  is  implausible  at  best  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  Congress  left  ­­ by  taking  Puerto  Rico  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  9,  meant  to  ­­ and  that's  all  we  knew.  It  took 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  out  of  Chapter  9.  To  say  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precludes  Puerto  Rico  from  dealing  in  any  way  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  crisis  for  its  public  utilities,  which  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ for  its  public  utilities,  which  provide  basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services  like  electricity  and  water  to  its  people  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  question:  Whether  people  in  a  village  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Puerto  Rico  will  be  able  to  get  clean  water. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  ­­ this  is  something  ­­ again,  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine  to  talk  about  the  generalities  of  the  law,  but  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  trying  to  think  about  congressional  intent, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  don't  lose  sight  of  the  fact  ­­ of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental  implausibility  and  the  anomaly  of  saying,
