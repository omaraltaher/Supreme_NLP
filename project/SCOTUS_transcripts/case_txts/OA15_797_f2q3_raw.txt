CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

this morning in Case No. 15-797, Moore v. Texas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

Mr. Sloan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

please the Court: 

 

 

10 

            

In Atkins v. Virginia, this Court held that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

the Eighth Amendment prohibits executing people who are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectually disabled.  And in Hall v. Florida, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court reiterated that the inquiry into whether somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is intellectually disabled for that important Eighth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment purpose should be informed by the medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

community's diagnostic framework and by clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

standards. 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Texas has adopted a unique approach to 

   

 

 

 

 

intellectual disability in capital cases in which it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibits the use of current medical standards.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relies on harmful and inappropriate lay stereotypes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including the so-called Briseno factors.  It uses an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary, virtually insuperable, and clinically 

 

 

 

 

unwarranted causation requirement.  And most 

  

 

 

 

fundamentally, it challenges and disagrees with this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

Court's core holding in Atkins; namely, that the entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category of the intellectually disabled, every person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who is intellectually disabled, is exempt from execution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Eighth Amendment. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Those are --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I -- excuse me, Chief

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a long 

   

  

 

 

laundry list of objections you have.  Your question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented, though, focused only on one, which is that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibits the use of current medical standards and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires outdated medical standards.  And I think 

   

  

 

 

 

several of the other points you made are not encompassed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within that question presented.  And maybe there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions that should be looked at, but they don't seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be covered by that. 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, in what -- you mentioned the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correspondence with clinical practices.  Has that 

  

 

 

 

 

changed?  Did Texas similarly depart from clinical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

practices under the old standard as it is under the new? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  It -- it did.  The prohibition 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

on the use of current medical standards aggravates and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

exacerbates that. 

 

24 

25 

            

But if I could address Your Honor's question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

about the -- the question presented, because I'd like to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

make two points with regard to that, Your Honor, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that, first of all, it is woven into the Texas Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Criminal Appeals' decision and the judgment that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before the Court, because the Texas court grounded its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination on the prohibition of consulting and using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current medical standards on its Briseno opinion and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno framework.  And the Court said, what we decided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Briseno in 2004, that framework governs, including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the clinical standards at the time, but also its view 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that medical standards generally are exceedingly 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

subjective. 

12 

            

That was very important to the Court in its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

determination here.  It's at 6a of the Petition Appendix 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

--

15 

            

16 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Sloan, can I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have the same question 

    

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

as -- as the Chief Justice.  It -- it just seems to me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question presented doesn't cut to the heart of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case as you describe it. 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

My understanding of your argument -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

again, I don't think it's wholly reflected in that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question -- is that whether you use the most current or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even slightly -- slightly older medical standards, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is still a conflict. 

   

 

25 

            

Am I right about that, that that's your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

1 

theory? 

2 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  And if I could 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

add one point, though, it is that the current clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards accentuate the conflict, make it even more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear.  And what has happened with the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  We wouldn't need that, would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we, Mr. Sloan?  We could say that the Briseno standards 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are in conflict with the old Atkins standards, as well 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the new ones.  There wouldn't need to be a difference 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the old ones and the new ones for you to win 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

this case. 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

            

MR. SLOAN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you got in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

door by a question presented that is a little more 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

eye-catching, which is that they prohibit the current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards and rely on the outdated one.  And that's all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it says.  And I'm just wondering if you got yourself in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the door with a -- with a dramatic question presented 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

and are now going back to a concern that was just as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present, as I understand your argument, under the old 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

standards. . 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Two points on that, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

First, again as I was saying, it is woven into the court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of criminal appeals' decision.  One cannot look at their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment on the prohibition of the use of current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

medical standards without looking at the framework in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which they grounded it. 

 

 

 

            

But, secondly, Your Honor --

 

 

 

 

            

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I just make -- I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

sorry to interrupt, Mr. Sloan, but could I just make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure I understand that?  Because what you're essentially 

   

  

 

 

 

 

saying is that the court of appeals said, you are barred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from using new standards; you must use the Briseno 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards.  So the two are flip sides of the same coin, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and what the holding was, is you must use Briseno 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

standards. 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

            

Now, your QP reflected their framing of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue -- you can't use new standards; you must use the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno standards -- but you were just reflecting their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essential holding, which is, we have this Briseno case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you have to use it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  That's -- that's exactly right, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

Your Honor. 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then why 

  

 

 

 

 

didn't you say that?  I mean, really, the question 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented talks about a comparison between current and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

outdated, and it seems -- it's pretty dramatic to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't use current standards; you're only using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outdated.  It's quite a different question, is -- you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

know, they used the Briseno standards and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

1 

shouldn't. 

2 

            

You don't think they should have used the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

Briseno standards under the old medical standards, do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

you? 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

            

MR. SLOAN:  No, that's correct. 

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 

  

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  But I think, Your Honor, first 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of all, the question presented, we absolutely stand by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, because they have prohibited the use of current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical standards and, instead, they have required the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use of the 1992 standard --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me ask you -- let 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me ask you the same question in -- in different terms, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you can tell me that -- whether this is not a fair 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paraphrase of your question.  And I -- if you can give 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me a yes-or-no answer to this question, I'd appreciate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

it. 

18 

19 

20 

            

Under Hall and Atkins, must a State use 

   

 

 

 

 

 

current medical standards, for example, DSM-5, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed to older standards, for example, DSM-IV?  Yes or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

no. 

22 

            

MR. SLOAN:  No, with that wording, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

Honor. 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Then I don't know --

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  It's because --

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

9 

1 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- how you can recover on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

the question -- you can prevail on the question that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented to us. 

 

 

4 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Because, Your Honor, the 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

question presented talks about prohibiting.  If Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor had said can a State prohibit --

   

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I don't understand 

   

  

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

what you mean by "prohibit."  You mean prohibit the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lower courts from using a standard different from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the one that the court of criminal appeals has said is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the standard that has to be used everywhere in Texas? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So each -- each trial level judge would apply a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different standard, whatever that judge thinks is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

right one? 

 

15 

            

MR. SLOAN:  And that the Court said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

prospectively the law of Texas is you -- is that you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibited from using the current medical standards. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And you think that this is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

question of trial court discretion?  A trial court has 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the discretion to use the newer standards as opposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- as opposed to the standards that the court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal appeals says are the appropriate ones? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MR. SLOAN:  No, I don't think it's 

   

  

 

 

 

24 

25 

discretion.  I think the Court has prohibited.  The 

    

  

 

 

 

 

Court said that the State habeas trial court erred by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

10

2 

employing the current standards.  That's the language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Court used. 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  As opposed to the ones that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

the court of criminal appeals had itself adopted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

MR. SLOAN:  From -- from 1992, and so it --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

it's helpful to consider if the court of criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals' decision stands, how --

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Sloan, cut to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

chase of the underlying question.  Was the criminal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court of appeals using any clinical standard, any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical clinical standard? 

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

14 

            

15 

            

MR. SLOAN:  No, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It was making up --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SLOAN:  They -- they --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Sloan, I don't think you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

finished answering my question.  There are two -- let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rephrase it this way:  There are different things in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno or Briseno opinion. 

 

 

 

            

One is the -- the medical standards that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken from the medical publications that were current as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the time of that decision.  And then there are these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional considerations, and that's what's regarded as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Briseno factors. 

 

 

            

But if you -- let's take a -- disregard the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

latter.  The first part are current -- are medical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

standards that were current at that time, are they not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Well, I respectfully disagree, 

   

  

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

Your Honor, in this respect, because what the Court said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Briseno was, after talking about following the 1992 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, it said we view the medical standards as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceedingly subjective.  That's the wording that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court used in Briseno, and that's why we are going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come up with these Briseno factors on our own that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

nonclinical. 

10 

            

In fact, they are anti-clinical because 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

they're -- they're based on these lay stereotypes.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's exactly what the Court said here as its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification for its prohibition on the use of current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

medical standards. 

 

15 

            

Its justification, as it says, is 6a to 7a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

of the petition appendix is the Court's long-standing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view about the subjectivity surrounding the medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diagnosis of the intellectual disability which stands in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sharp contrast to what this Court has said in Atkins and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Hall, where, in Atkins, the clinical definitions were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamentally -- as this Court said in Hall, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinical definitions were a fundamental premise of Hall. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

And as Hall said, the inquiry has to be informed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical community's diagnostic framework, and there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no way that it can be informed by the medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

community's diagnostic framework if the -- if there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an exclusion and a prohibition on using current medical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

standards. 

4 

            

5 

            

And, Justice Alito --

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There is no doubt about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

what the Texas court said.  It's marching orders for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas courts.  It said the habeas judge erred by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employing current clinical definition of intellectually 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled, there in that respect, rather than the test we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established in Briseno.  The test we established in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno is -- is stated sharply and clearly as the test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that must be applied by Texas courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

15 

And --

 

16 

            

17 

            

Is that how you read it? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SLOAN:  Yes, exactly, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's on page 6a in these? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SLOAN:  That's right.  And I think it is 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

helpful here to consider how Atkins adjudications -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously, this is a vitally important, life-or-death 

   

 

 

 

 

issue that goes to human -- the human dignity of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectually disabled and how these adjudications will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed in Texas after the opinion in light of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passage that Justice Ginsburg just quoted the critical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passage, is that, to judges, to lawyers, and to clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experts testifying in Texas, the message is clear and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

1 

unmistakable:  You may not consult or rely on current 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

clinical guidance. 

 

3 

            

And so think about that from a clinician's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11

perspective.  A clinical expert who has been entrusted 

    

 

 

 

 

 

with evaluating and making this vitally important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluation of somebody, about whether they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectually disabled, that person has gotten the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear and unmistakable instruction, and will by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers, you have to go back to the 1992 standard; you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't consider the standards since then. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Sloan, I think it's more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

than that.  Because it's not just you can't consult the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current guidance and you have to go back to the '92 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.  It says, you have to go back to Briseno, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno has these seven factors that are not consistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the old standards, just as they are not consistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the new standards. 

 

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  That -- that's exactly right, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor, and it's also part of a broader problem in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the framework interwoven with Briseno itself.  Where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno is setting up a framework where it's saying that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only those who are the most severely intellectually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled are exempt from the death penalty, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's an open question, it says in Briseno, whether those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who are more mildly intellectually disabled, or mentally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

retarded as they said at the time, are similarly exempt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And this Court in Atkins had just held that there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bright line exemption for the intellectually disabled. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I tried to ask myself if 

    

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

the Court could say, use the Briseno factors first, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after that, if you find no intellectual disability, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turn to the clinical standards.  But as Justice Kagan 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points out, I think there is a conflict. 

   

   

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. SLOAN:  There absolutely is, and it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

all rooted by the conflict of clinical standards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally and the prohibition on the use of current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical standards and the hostility to current medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

standards --

 

14 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it is true that Atkins 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

left some discretion to the States.  What is the rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you propose for how closely standards must hew to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

medical practice? 

 

18 

            

MR. SLOAN:  I think it's the rule that the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Court notes and -- and explained in Hall, which is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State must be informed by the medical community's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diagnostic framework, and so what I understand that to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean is that -- and -- and, of course, as the Court said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Atkins and in Hall and Brumfield, the clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitions are very, very important that you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inform it.  And if a State wants to conflict with or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

disagree with the clinical standard, then there has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a sound reason for doing so.  And I think in Hall, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court identified several considerations.  There are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

four considerations in particular that would go into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluating whether there is a sound reason for doing so. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

And the first is, is there genuinely a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

clinical consensus on that point?  The second is, what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do other States do on that point?  The third is, what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does the State do in other intellectual disability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context?  And very tellingly here, Texas uses these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno factors and this prohibition on current medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards only in the death penalty context, in no other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectual disability context. 

 

 

14 

            

And as the Court explained in Hall, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

condition, as the Court said in Hall, of intellectual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability has applicability far beyond the death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty.  And so when a State does, as Texas is doing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, treats it very differently with much more severe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions on finding intellectual disability only in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the death penalty, it is at the very least a very major 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

red flag.  But --

  

 

 

22 

            

23 

            

24 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Sloan, can we go --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Sotomayor? 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can we go to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

practical application of what you're saying for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

moment? 

2 

            

Let's take the decision of the CCA here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

All right?  They found two prongs that Mr. Moore had not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

met:  That he couldn't prove that he was clinically 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectually disabled, that his IQ was higher than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was generally recognized clinically.  What did they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do wrong with respect to that prong? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then secondly, with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adaptive-function prong, what did the court below do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

wrong? 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

            

Identify the two ways in which what they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing and how they're applying the standards we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about were in error. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  I will, Your Honor.  And as to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

both, they are in very sharp conflict with the clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance generally and especially with current clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

standards. 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

So beginning with the intellectual deficits 

 

 

 

 

 

in the IQ, the Court of Criminal Appeals accepted as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid an IQ test of 74, which, as the Court explained in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hall, with the standard error of measurement would take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it down to 69, well within the range for intellectual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

disability. 

24 

25 

            

But what the court did here is that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chopped off the lower end of the standard error of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

measurement.  It then treated the 74, the number 74, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisive and as in and of itself determining that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Moore could not establish an intellectual deficit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and he could not establish intellectual disability, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which conflicts with clinical standards, current 

 

 

 

 

 

clinical standards, and this Court's decision in Hall. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

The reasons that the court gives for lopping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

off the end of the -- the lower end of the standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error of measurement are completely clinically 

 

 

 

 

 

unsupportable.  The court says that he had a history of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

poor academic performance.  Well, of course, that's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent with an intellectual deficit or with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectual disability.  The court also says, well, he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

may have been depressed because he was on death row. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well, there's no death row -- there is no rule that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody is on death row, you cut off the lower end of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

the standard. 

 

18 

            

19 

to that. 

 

20 

            

21 

            

22 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is no medical rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SLOAN:  That's --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No medical support. 

  

 

 

 

MR. SLOAN:  There's no medical support. 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

There's no clinical basis for that.  And the court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points to what it views as a depressive episode from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2005, which was 16 years after he took the exam in 1989. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

1 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I thought the most 

   

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

significant part of this alleged error by you in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs were that it assumed that things like poverty, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

poor nutrition, poor performance in school were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable to intellectual functioning, but to his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lack of a good home, essentially.  Why is that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

clinically wrong? 

 

8 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Because, Your Honor -- so in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

terms of the causation requirement, which is, I think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Your Honor is referring to -- and there are --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are three major problems with the way the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealt with causation from --

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I think the court's --

   

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

would you say something about the adaptive behavior? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because I think that may be a stronger leg. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

16 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why don't you deal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

with Justice Sotomayor's question first and then Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

Alito's. 

19 

            

20 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

So in terms of the causation, first the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

court says at page 10a of the petition appendix, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphasize that intellectual deficits caused it rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than some other cause like the causes Your Honor is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about.  And it's well understood as a clinical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

matter that there is a very high incidence in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

19 

intellectual disability of multiple causation, 

 

 

 

 

co-morbidity.  So that view of the inquiry is -- rather 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than some other cause is completely at odds with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinical understanding to begin with. 

 

 

 

 

            

Secondly, factors that the court points to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include things, in addition to what Your Honor was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying like, again, poor academic performance, his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terrible childhood abuse that he suffered, which not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only do not detract from a finding of intellectual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability, they are well recognized as -- as risk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors and associated characteristics of intellectual

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

And third, and very importantly, as the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the AAIDD explains in its amicus brief, from a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinical perspective, there is absolutely no way to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the kind of showing that the court requires here about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather than some other cause.  As a clinical matter, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's simply impossible to do.  And this Court in Hall 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talked about the risk and the threat that Atkins would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be turned into a nullity.  And there is no question with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that kind of causation requirement that it turns it into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

a nullity.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now -- now maybe you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can respond to Justice Alito. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

In terms of the adaptive deficits, Your

5 

6 

7 

8

Honor -- and it's important at the outset to recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain points that are undisputed in the record.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's undisputed, for example, that the at the age of 13, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Moore did not understand the days of the week, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months of the year, the seasons, how to tell time, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle that subtraction is the opposite of addition, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard units of measurement.  And there are numerous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other deficits like that that are undisputed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what was the -- what is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

the problem with their analysis of that point? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

Honor. 

14 

            

MR. SLOAN:  So there are four problems, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

So one of them is that the court focuses on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

what it perceives as some strengths, which it says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outweighs the deficits and --

 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  On that one, is there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

a consensus in the medical community that that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

improper? 

20 

            

21 

            

22 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

And, in fact --

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, here is an article 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

written by a number of experts, recent article from the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Journal of American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Assessing Adaptive Functioning in Death Penalty Cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

after Hall and DSM-5.  One of these experts was cited in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- in -- in one of the supporting amicus briefs by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

professional organizations in Hall, which says that any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessment of adaptive functioning must give sufficient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration to assets and deficits alike. 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

So what -- what do you make of that?  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

these are just -- these are -- are these quacks? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Um --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  This is Dr. Hagan, Drogin, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

and Guilmette. 

 

11 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Well, Your Honor, the clinical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

guidance from both the AAIDD and the American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Psychiatric Association in their definitive clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance, which comes out about once every 10 years, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is very explicit that the adaptive-deficit inquiry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focuses on deficits and not on strengths, and for two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very, very important reasons. 

 

 

 

18 

            

And the first is that -- is the clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

inquiry is about the degree to which somebody is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impaired in their everyday life, and so it's focusing on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the impairments.  And the second reason is that there is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a very common stereotype and misunderstanding that if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody has strengths, they're not intellectually 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled.  And both of those authoritative sources of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinical guidance emphasize --

organizations by, I suppose, a majority vote or 

   

   

 

 

 

something like that conclude one thing, and but there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are respected experts who disagree, you're saying the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State is obligated --

 

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Well, I --

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- as a matter of 

   

  

 

 

 

constitutional law to follow the organizations? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  I'm not saying that, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

As I said to Justice Kennedy, I think Hall identifies 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

considerations if the court is going to disagree.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first one I mentioned was, is there a clinical 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

consensus on this point. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And can I ask whether you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

might be talking about two different things?  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be wrong about this, but as I understand adaptive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functioning, there are these particular areas of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functioning that have been set out.  And what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consensus is, is to say, well, if you have deficits in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four of these areas, it doesn't matter that you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a deficit in another area.  And that's what the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

consensus is. 

 

23 

24 

25 

            

Now, within each area, people/psychologists 

 

 

 

 

can look at, you know, within an area --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Sure. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

1 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- to determine whether you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

have a deficit.  Yeah, you have to look at what you can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do and what you can't do to decide whether there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deficit in that area.  So the two things might not be in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conflict at all. 

 

 

6 

            

MR. SLOAN:  That's exactly right, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

Honor.  Or if there is a dispute, for example, about a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular skill.  Somebody says he cannot drive.  There 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is proof on the other side that, yes, the person can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drive.  So those --

  

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I have one question, which 

    

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

I don't think you can answer orally.  But I think that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these cases -- you can point me to the answer.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

what I want. 

   

15 

            

Look.  There will be a bunch of easy cases. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

And then there are going to be cases like your client 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who has been on death row for 36 years.  And there will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be borderline cases.  And the reason they're borderline 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is because the testing is right at the border, like an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IQ test.  And then you'll put weight on what's called 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

related limitations in adaptive functioning, a matter 

   

 

 

 

 

that on its face sounds as if it's maybe easy in some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases and tough in another.  All right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

What is the Court supposed to do?  Are we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

supposed to have all those hearings here?  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

you've made very good arguments for your client.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are probably several others in the country in different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

states which may have different standards.  And if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have some view that the law in this area should be law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

i.e., that it should be uniform across the country, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point me to something that will tell me how a district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge should go about making this determination in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

borderline cases. 

 

9 

            

10 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  My suspicion is that there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

is no such thing, but that's why I asked the question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I want to be sure.  There might be. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Well, let me make two points, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

which is that, first of all, Your Honor says what --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what do courts do?  And I do think it's important that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the general principle this Court was clear about in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hall, which is being informed by the medical community 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about diagnostic --

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand.  But you are 

    

  

 

 

 

20 

21 

saying whatever they should do, it shouldn't be what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went on here.  Okay.  I got that point. 

    

  

 

 

 

 

22 

            

I'm asking a different point.  And if you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

want my true motive, I don't think there is a way to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply this kind of standard uniformly across the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country, and therefore, there will be disparities, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

uncertainties, and different people treated alike, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- and people who are alike treated differently.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

Now, that's my whole story.  And I want you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

to say, no, you're wrong, there is a way to do it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

What? 

6 

            

MR. SLOAN:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

actually the best places to look on this would be the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

AAIDD current manual, the 11th edition, as well as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages in the DSM-5 that -- that address it.  And it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually points up an important difference in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current standards because, for the first time, the 11th 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

edition, because of this problem about stereotypes, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if people have strengths, they can't be considered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

intellectually disabled. 

 

15 

            

For the first time, the current 11th 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

edition, the very one that the Court said was off limits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, has an entirely new chapter, chapter 12, about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues and problems of people who have high IQ -- who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are intellectually disabled, but they are at the high IQ 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end, exactly the group of people that Your Honor is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about.  And the user's guide accompanying that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

manual, for the first time, has a list of harmful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stereotypes which includes exactly that. 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

And the other thing, Your Honor, though, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

that I do have to emphasize, is that whatever one thinks 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

about the application across the country, there is no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that Texas is very extreme and stands alone in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its view that -- of basically disagreeing with the core 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premise of Atkins, and repeatedly in its decisions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawing distinctions between those who are severely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentally retarded in many of the decisions, and those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who are mildly, and saying that there is no bright line 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption for those who are mildly.

8 

9 

            

And also, in Briseno itself, the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

said -- the Court of Criminal Appeals said, our task is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide what a consensus of Texas citizens thinks the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line should be.  And of course, this Court in Atkins had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just decided for Eighth Amendment purposes the consensus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of United States citizens. 

 

 

 

15 

            

Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the balance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

of my time. 

 

 

17

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

Petitioner conceded that we could have used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

the DSM-IV instead of the current DSM-5 that answers the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question presented.  And Petitioner, in their reply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

brief, says there is no material difference between the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language in Texas's standard, which is based on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

AAMR 9th Clinical Framework, and current clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frameworks.  So, essentially, this case has shifted to a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion of the seven Briseno evidentiary factors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

And if I can put those into context, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

seven Briseno factors are all grounded in this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedents.  As we point out in our bullet-point list at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages 53 to 55 of our brief, what those go to are the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second prong of the clinical definition, the adaptive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

deficits inquiry. 

 

12 

            

All of those questions are asking, can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

someone function in the world?  And that's precisely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted when it also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

endorsed the Briseno factors. 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You describe these as 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

coming from some source, but Briseno itself listed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- these -- seven, was it? -- bullet points, did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not give a single citation of where any one came from. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. KELLER:  It did, however, and this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

Court -- in -- in pages 53 to 55 of our brief, we go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor by factor and quote this Court's precedence to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show how they're congruent with factors that this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself has considered. 

 

 

25 

            

And also, at Petition Appendix 162a, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

28 

trial court adopted Petitioner's proposed conclusions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  And that said that analyzing the facts under that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second prong, that adaptive deficit prong, even under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the current AAIDD 11th, quote, "answered many of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno factors," unquote. 

 

 

            

 

So the analysis that's done under the second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prong of the clinical framework, the adaptive deficits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prong, that is going to overlap with the Briseno 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors.  And so this is not a free floating test that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negates or obviates the three-prong established test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Texas uses, and it is part of the national

consensus --

 

13 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, would you agree 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

with this:  That the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno and other places, has made clear its view that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- that Texas can choose to execute people whom a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete consensus, a 100 percent consensus of 

   

 

 

 

 

clinicians, would find to be intellectually disabled? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

Would you agree with that? 

 

 

 

 

MR. KELLER:  I -- I don't believe that's 

    

   

 

 

 

21 

22 

what the Briseno opinion said.  What the Briseno opinion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said was it was going to adopt clinical standards. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm -- I'm asking about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

Briseno and other court of appeals' decisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

And I thought that you said this in your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

brief, that the -- that your view of the point of State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion is that a person who everybody -- every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinician would find to be intellectually disabled, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State does not have to find to be intellectually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled because a consensus of Texas citizens would not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

find that person to be intellectually disabled. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

Isn't that the premise of the court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

appeals' decisions? 

 

9 

            

MR. KELLER:  No.  Quite the contrary.  Let 

  

  

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

me very clearly state about the "Texas consensus" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language in the opinion. 

 

 

 

12 

            

The Briseno opinion flags the issue about, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

would a Texas consensus materialize on an issue.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Court then twice said it was not going to answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that question.  It was not going to do that.  That was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the legislature.  And instead what the Court did was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it adopted the AAMR 9th clinical standards and the Texas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Health Safety Code definition. 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess I just don't 

   

   

  

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

understand this.  And I really don't understand it in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

light of your brief, which I'm going to start to quote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from pretty soon.  But what the -- it seems to me what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Texas court did is to say, look, we're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept the three dimensions, the adaptive deficits and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the IQ and the age.  But with respect to the quality and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

5 

the degree of impairment -- I think that that's their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language -- we're not going to accept the clinicians' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view so that people with mild impairment can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executed, even though the clinicians would find those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people to be intellectually disabled. 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. KELLER:  Briseno very clearly adopted 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

the three-prong established test in cases since then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we've cited throughout our brief.  We also applied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

that --

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I know that they applied the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

three-prong test.  The question is the degree of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

impairment as to each of these -- those prongs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

And again, it seems to me pretty clear from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

your brief when you're talking about Atkins didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish a national standard, that you're saying too 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that the Texas -- and if you're not, I mean, I -- I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess I'm surprised by that -- that you're saying that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Texas courts do need to follow clinical assessments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of intellectual impairment?  Because that's -- it's just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not what you say on page 19 and 20 and 21 of your brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Justice Kagan, it's true this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court has recognized there is a different between a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal determination regarding Eighth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

culpability and a medical diagnosis.  But Briseno 

   

  

 

 

 

adopted the clinical standards in the AAMR 9th --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Go back to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

Justice Kagan's question. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, he was talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

my question. 

 

5 

            

So go on. 

 

 

6 

            

(Laughter.)

8

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. KELLER:  Thank you, Justice Kagan. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Also, even the DSM-5 itself, the current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framework the Petitioner points to, says there is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imperfect fit between those two concepts, and this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has cited that exact language in previous DSM versions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for that same proposition. 

 

 

 

            

And so, no, it is not the case that States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to categorically wholesale adopt the positions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current medical organizations, but what Briseno itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually did was, in fact, adopt the AAMR 9th, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precursor to the AAIDD 11th.  And Petitioner's reply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief now says there's really no material difference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the 11th and the ninth language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that's why we're not talking about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three-prong test, the facial text of the language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're talking about the Briseno factors. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I have a follow-up unless 

    

   

 

 

you want to go, Justice Sotomayor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Go ahead, and then I'll

--

follow-up. 

4 

            

5 

please. 

6 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, maybe I could ask a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kagan, 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let me just take one of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

Briseno factors, right?  And it's the idea that what lay 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people think about the person growing up is relevant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an assessment of adaptive function. 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Now, no clinician would ever say that.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

clinicians say, no, that's sort of like stereotypical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

layperson view of adaptive functioning, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from the -- the clinical view of adaptive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functioning.  But the Briseno factors made very clear, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of point one, that you're supposed to sort of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you're supposed to rely on -- on what the neighbor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said and what the teacher with absolutely no experience 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to intellectual disabilities said. 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

So that seems to me a very big difference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

between the Briseno factors and the clinical view of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

intellectual disability. 

 

22 

            

MR. KELLER:  This Court in Hall looked at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

what siblings and teachers from the developmental period 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also did.  And clinicians would also look to those.  In 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, here there's testimony at the penalty-phase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

retrial about people, lay witnesses that knew Petitioner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the time.  So it's not that this is irrelevant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that's not probative. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

Now, it's not going to be necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

dispositive.  That's going to depend on the totality of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the circumstances and the record on adaptive deficits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But this is actually probative evidence of whether --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because Briseno says 

  

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

essentially that this can trump everything, and it says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this can trump everything because of the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view of Briseno and other Texas Court of Appeals cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we don't have to look at the clinical standards and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we can execute people whom clinicians would find to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

be disabled. 

 

15 

            

MR. KELLER:  No, Briseno did not say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

the seven evidentiary factors can trump the established 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three-pronged definition that Texas has consistently 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

applied. 

19 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry, Mr. General 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Keller, because you keep on saying the three-prong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition, but the three-prong definition just tells 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you, you have to look to IQ, you have to look to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adaptive functioning, you have to look to youth.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't tell you anything about what qualities you look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to and the extent of impairment within those factors, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34

2 

and that's where the Texas court has insisted upon its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

freedom to go out on its own. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

4 

            

MR. KELLER:  Well, even in Briseno --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I note that, as a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

footnote only, you can continue, that in Ex parte Sosa, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the CCA sent back a case directing the lower court to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply the Briseno factors, even though that court had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analyzed the case under the clinical standards.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears to be acting as if those Briseno factors are the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinical factors and are controlling, even though there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are stereotypes built into them. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  There are not stereotypes built 

  

 

 

 

 

 

into them.  The standards --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the DMA and all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the other clinicians recognized that some mentally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled people can have some adaptive functioning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Idiot savants, for example.  Is it your position that if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone can calculate math in their head they can't be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

intellectually disabled? 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. KELLER:  No, the point of the Briseno --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about if that same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

person has a job in NASA calculating the air space 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shuttle launches?  Is that person not intellectually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

disabled simply because they can use that particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

skill in a way that gains them employment? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

            

MR. KELLER:  No.  And as what Texas standard 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

says, is it looks to actually the current frameworks and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says for adaptive deficits you look at conceptual, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

social, and practical skills. 

 

 

 

5 

            

But if I can address Sosa, the CCA there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

reversed the trial court, because what the trial court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had was that it categorically was prohibited from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at the facts of the crime.  It didn't say you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had to use the Briseno factors.  It said --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, General, we are not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

reviewing Sosa.  Could I ask a question about what the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

court did in this case? 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

Now, on pages 62a and 63a of the petition, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

the appendix to the petition, it sets out the three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors, and then it discusses those at length, and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on page 89, it says, in addition, our consideration of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Briseno evidentiary factors weighs heavily against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

the findings. 

 

19 

            

So is it clear that these evidentiary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

factors actually played an indispensable role in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision in this case, which is what we were reviewing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. KELLER:  No, they did not.  There were 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

only two pages to bolster a second alternative holding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on relatedness.  And that "weighs heavily" language? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's only talking about weighs heavily on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

36 

relatedness inquiry.  The court had already concluded in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages of its analysis that there was sufficient 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectual functioning under the first prong, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was sufficient adaptive deficits.  Compton's 

  

 

 

 

 

testimony said, I do not have the deficits to find a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diagnosis, and that was even before prison.  That is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient basis to affirm without getting into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relatedness inquiry or getting into the Briseno factors.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you saying that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

Briseno factors capture all individuals with 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

intellectual disability? 

 

12 

            

MR. KELLER:  No.  The Briseno factors --

  

  

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

there could be other circumstances or other facts in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record that would bear on the adaptive deficits prong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that's why the CCA said these are discretionary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These are different ways of phrasing how you do the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceptual, social, and practical --

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't making it

discretionary a huge problem in this area, because if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you let one trial court judge apply it and another one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does -- doesn't have to apply them, then you're opening 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the door to inconsistent results depending upon who is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sitting on the trial court bench, something that we try 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to prevent from happening in capital cases.

it's discretionary.  What the CCA said, and this is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cathey case, it said the trial and appellate courts may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignore some or all of them if they are not helpful in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular case.  In other words, this is just looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the record.  Is there evidence on any of these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors?  If there's not, that's not going to be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helpful factor on that case. 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

And, Justice Kennedy, as far as the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

universe of people that would be or would not be covered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the Briseno factors, the CCA has used the Briseno 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors to grant Atkins relief.  That's the Van Alstyne 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  And they have also affirmed trial court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions -- this is Valdez, Bell, Plata, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maldonado -- but the case now before you --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the theme is -- of --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

of the -- the Petitioner's brief, that the Briseno 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors are intended to really limit the classification 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of those persons with intellectual disability as defined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by an almost uniform medical consensus. 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. KELLER:  And the CCA has never said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

the purpose of these factors is to screen out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals and deny them relief. 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

24 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But isn't that the effect? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KELLER:  No.  Van Alstyne granted relief 

  

  

 

 

 

 

25 

by looking at the Briseno factors.  The four cases I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

just mentioned, these are cited at page 422. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course, General, 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

there are going to be cases in which the Briseno factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will show disabled, but that's not the question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

6 

list. 

7 

            

The question is can they be an exhaustive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KELLER:  The Briseno factors are not an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

exhaustive list, and the CCA has never treated them like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

that. 

10 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the -- but the genesis 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

of these factors was that the court said the clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards are just too subjective and they don't reflect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Texas citizens think, both of those things.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are too subjective, and they just reflect what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinicians think; they don't reflect what Texas citizens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think.  That was the genesis of the standards, which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests that Justice Kennedy is right about how they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operate and also how they were intended to operate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  The court did mention 

  

 

 

 

 

subjectivity.  The Texas consensus point though was not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the basis to do it.  What the CCA was really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to do here was take the adaptive-deficit prong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is phrased in the terms of related and significant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations in adaptive functioning, and put that into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more concrete terms where you could apply it to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

record. 

2 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Basically, there are two 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

things wrong, possibly, with the factors which we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heard.  One I can't deal with at this moment in oral 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  You could go through them -- they're in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs -- one by one, and say reading them, actually, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're not consistent with or they reflect an error 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when compared with what the psychiatrists and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

psychologists think.  Your answer is they don't.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

other side says they do.  Okay.  I can't go further with 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

that here. 

 

12 

            

The other is the question of, why did the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

Texas court write these standards?  I have to admit that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in reading through Briseno, I came to at least pause 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when I read the words that they are trying to figure out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what to do in borderline cases, and what they have done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not -- you know, I understand it, but they say we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to figure out the level at which a consensus of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas citizens would agree that a person should be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

exempted from the death penalty. 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

When I read that, and when I read, there are 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

some other words -- that's on page 6 of the -- of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

report, of the reported opinion -- when I read some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other things that they said, I thought they were trying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do this, which we do often in law.  But what's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

1 

2 

3 

purpose of this?  The whole purpose is to try to figure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out who not to execute because of their functioning, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way they function.  That's the purpose. 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

            

Let's look at what Texas citizens would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

think about this person, and let's try to get standards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that reflect that.  I really did think that's what they 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were trying to do in that opinion.  And they are arguing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that's the wrong thing to try to do in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

instance. 

10 

            

First, because it would produce 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

nonuniformity among 50 states or among the many states 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have the death penalty. 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

Second, because the question is not what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

citizens of the state think about who should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executed.  That has nothing to do with it.  Oddly 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough, in this case, what has to do with it is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

technical matter about this individual, that would free 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some while subjecting others to the death penalty, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrespective of what Texas citizens think. 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

So do you see my question?  What were they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

up to in this opinion?  Briseno.  I think they were up 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to going back to the citizens of Texas.  You saw what I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think they are up to.  And you tell me if I'm right, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong or why. 

 

 

25 

            

MR. KELLER:  Justice Breyer, I -- I believe 

   

   

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

that's mistaken, because there are two points after that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion in Texas consensus where the Court says, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is page 6 of Briseno, as a Court dealing with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual cases and litigants, we decline to answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that normative question about the Texas consensus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the significant greater assistance from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenry acting through its legislature.  And then two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages later, it's again assessing the difference between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal determination and the medical diagnosis, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court says that definitional question is not before us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case, because it goes on to adopt the AAMR 9th

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. General, going --

  

 

 

 

 

just -- is it your view that what Texas is trying to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is determine who is truly on the clinical borderline as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed to trying to determine the type of mentally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled people that it thinks should be executed --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- on the latter? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Yes.  Texas has adopted 

  

  

 

 

 

clinical definitions in the AAMR 9. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So is it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

fair to say that in Texas, a mildly disabled person is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlikely to be considered disabled by the CCA under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

Briseno factors? 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

1 

            

MR. KELLER:  No.  If there was a diagnosis 

   

  

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

of intellectual disability, even mild intellectual 

 

 

 

 

 

disability, that would satisfy the --

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you -- according to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

one of the cases that you've cited to me where someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was clinically diagnosed as mildly disabled, and the CCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said under the Briseno factors that they should not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executed.  A lot of the cases that you provided me with, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was clinical evidence of moderate -- and mostly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

severe -- but moderate to severe disability.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there -- was there anyone with mild disability that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno factors would find sufficiently disabled? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, the 

  

 

 

 

 

Van Alstyne case is the case that I can point to where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the CCA looked at the Briseno factors and granted her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

leave. 

17 

18 

            

If I can pull back up the question --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did they find him mildly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

disabled? 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. KELLER:  The testimony there was on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

adaptive deficits.  And I believe the mild -- whether 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's mild or moderate would go more towards IQ scores. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If I can pull back out:  So the question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

presented here is whether Texas has prohibited the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current standards from being used and is erring by using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

outdated standards.  Petitioners concede we couldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

have used an older version.  And Texas is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibiting the use of current standards.  In this case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the CCA repeatedly quoted -- it cited --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why did it go through 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

so much trouble in saying that it wasn't going to use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current standards, that it was only going to use the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

older standards and the Briseno factors? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Because the current standard 

  

 

 

 

 

used by AAIDD 11th does not have the relatedness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry.  And now, that is an extraneous part of this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  It was a second alternative holding.  But that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

was the main reason why the CCA said, trial court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're not following our precedence.  That's error. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, if we believe that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

its definition of relatedness has no support anywhere, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would that have been a valid reason for discounting the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

current clinical standards? 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Well, that was a second 

   

  

 

 

 

alternative holding.  Here, it's facially valid for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Texas and any other State to have a relatedness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement.  That's in the DSM-5.  The DSM-5 talks 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

about needing something to be directly related, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't flesh that out.  So what we were talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the application of that. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

1 

            

And this would be an odd case to decide that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

issue.  When it's a second alternative holding, there is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

no State consensus on this causation point.  That's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Coleman case from the Tennessee Supreme Court cited in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reply brief.  We are not aware of any case in which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the relatedness inquiry was the dispositive point on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which an Atkins claim was denied. 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I'm not sure how I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

can accept your characterization of the CCA decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when basically it's saying his poor intellectual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functioning on IQ tests, which happened when he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

younger, were not related to his intellectual abilities; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were related to his poverty, his -- his morbidity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

factors. 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

            

If they are saying that, how are you saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they weren't finding that he wasn't intellectually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled because of those other factors? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Well, it wasn't just --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's how I read their 

   

  

 

 

 

20 

decision. 

21 

22 

23 

            

MR. KELLER:  Well, it wasn't just the CCA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that.  It was relying on testimony.  Here, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner argued --

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, wait a minute. 

   

  

 

 

25 

 

The testimony of Compton was, having looked at all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

45 

the IQ tests, was:  I'm not sure.  It's probable that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's intellectually disabled by IQ, but he wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualify in my judgment because of his adaptive skills. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But even the State's own expert said that it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable that he was intellectually disabled. 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

MR. KELLER:  The State's expert said that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

would have been borderline on intellectual functioning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But the CCA on relatedness -- and, again, this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second alternative holding that the Court doesn't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reach -- it looked at testimony from Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrial in 2001 when Petitioner affirmatively argued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he was not intellectually disabled.  And the expert 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there that was Petitioner's own expert agreed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was a strategic 

   

  

 

 

15 

advantage to doing that back in those days; right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. KELLER:  Well, actually, at the time, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Penry would have been decided, and there would have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a valid basis to say, Petitioner, I'm intellectually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disabled; therefore, use it as mitigation evidence.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

strategy, which was a reasonable strategy from counsel, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

was to say that Petitioner would be able to grow in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison, and, therefore, that was mitigation evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he could be reformed. 

 

 

 

 

            

But, right, the Petitioner expert agreed 

 

 

 

 

 

with the prosecutor the Petitioner was, quote, nowhere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

near, unquote, intellectually disabled and that a lack 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of education was to blame.  That's at Joint Appendix 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

269. 

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that happened in 

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

Atkins, too.  Regrettably, until we decided that mental 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability was a ground to excuse execution, many 

   

 

 

 

 

 

mentally disabled defendants were represented by counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who thought that arguing differently was a better 

   

 

 

 

 

 

9 

strategy. 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. KELLER:  Of course, Penry would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been on the books, and so there would have been an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advantage to argue that.  And that's why that's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contradicting argument.  Regardless, even if that's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

controlling now here, the CCA credited Compton's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony as the most reliable expert who is the only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forensic psychologist who thoroughly reviewed the 

 

 

 

 

 

records and personally evaluated Petitioner for 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectual disability.  And Compton said, I don't have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the deficits for diagnosis. 

 

 

 

            

But this is a fact-bound question of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

application of the test.  The question presented here is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether Texas' well-established, three-prong test for 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectual disability violates the Eighth Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

And Texas is well within the national consensus.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are only four States that have categorically wholesale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

adopted one of the current frameworks.  Two of them did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so saying there's no material difference in the language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the current framework and that test.  And that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the precise position the Petitioner has taken in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

reply brief. 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain why Texas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

applies a different test to determine whether a school 

   

   

 

 

 

 

child is intellectually disabled, or a juvenile 

   

 

 

 

 

offender, to determine what to do with that offender, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas applies a different test when compatible with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

current medical standards in both of those categories? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why does it have a different standard for capital cases 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

only? 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. KELLER:  So first of all, the juvenile 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

offender discharge rule that Petitioner cites at page 7 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the reply brief, that actually adopts the three-prong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test that Briseno adopted.  That's 37 Texas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Administrative Code 380.8779(c)(1). 

 

 

            

Now, there are other provisions that 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporate by reference the latest manual of the DSM. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But as the DSM-5 itself noted, there is an imperfect fit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between a determination of legal -- a legal 

   

   

 

 

 

determination of culpability for Eighth Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes and a medical diagnosis.  And since you have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

those different purposes, it is valid for a State to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

have a different definition of when someone is morally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

culpable under the Eighth Amendment versus when someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be able to get social-services benefit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's the point. 

  

 

 

 

 

That's exactly the point.  That's the point that we've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been making, or at least I thought we were.  That the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole point of Briseno is really to answer the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you said -- probably should say, no, it isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really there -- it's to help determine which persons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffering borderline cases of mental disability ought to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be executed, or should not be because they are less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

morally culpable. 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

            

Now, I did think that's what they said. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

That does supply a reason for making differences, as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg just pointed out.  And then the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is, is it what the purpose of Atkins and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other case Hall was, was it to give each State the right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to decide in borderline cases whom or whom not to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

execute in light of their feelings about capital 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

punishment? 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

              

I thought it had a different purpose --

   

 

 

 

 

unusual in the law -- but which was to appeal to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

technical definitions of who and who is not mentally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retarded or intellectually disabled.  That's a real 

   

  

 

 

 

issue.  But I think that this case does present that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

1 

issue. 

2 

            

MR. KELLER:  And what Atkins and Hall said

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11

14 

was there's a critical role for the States.  And while 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

States don't have unfettered discretion, they do have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some discretion.  And every time the DSM-5 or the next 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

edition of the AAIDD 11th -- or 12th comes out, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States don't have to automatically wholesale about that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there is a well-established three-prong test. 

   

 

 

 

 

This test has existed for 50 years.  And the States --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a national consensus adopting that test. 

   

 

 

 

 

There's not a national consensus against the 

   

 

 

 

 

relatedness-inquiries causation.  There is not a 

  

 

 

 

 

national consensus that the various factors of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno factor-of-an-entry test can't be applied. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

And on adaptive strengths in particular, no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

State prohibits the use of adaptive strengths.  In fact, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three of the States that use the current frameworks, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have adopted wholesale the current frameworks, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still look at adaptive strengths.  The Hackett case from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pennsylvania is the best example of that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the problem is 

  

 

 

 

 

that, as I read the CCA opinion, it's looking at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adaptive strengths only and not at adaptive deficits and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at the depth of them or how they form the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectual disability component.  Even Dr. Compton, 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

1 

2 

the State's expert, testified that Mr. Moore could not, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from memory, recreate a clock. 

   

 

 

3 

            

Now, she says, I don't quite believe that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

but she doesn't quite believe that of a person who, at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13's, father threw him out because he was dumb and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illiterate:  Couldn't tell the days of the week; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't tell the months of the year; couldn't tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time; couldn't do anything that one would consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within an average, or even a low average, of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

intellectual functioning, who is eating out of garbage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cans repeatedly and getting sick after each time he did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, but not learning from his mistakes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

The -- the State's opinion does very little 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

except say those are products of his poor environment; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're not products of his intellectual disability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

MR. KELLER:  No.  Compton's testimony was 

  

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

she did not have the adaptive deficits.  In addition to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analyzing, she said, there are limitations I see, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's academic ability or social skills, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there has to be significant limitations, and she said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that wasn't there. 

 

 

            

She noted Petitioner testified four 

 

 

 

 

different times in the course of these proceedings, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a Faretta hearing, and filing pro se motions, and was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsive to questions and was understanding what was

going on.  He lived on the streets.  After the crime, he 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absconded to Louisiana.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem with Lennie, 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

who the Briseno factors were -- were fashioned after --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lennie was working on a farm.  How is that different 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from mowing a lawn? 

   

 

7 

            

And -- and the State had no problem in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

saying that Lennie, even though he could work, earn a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

living, plan his trying to hide the death of the rabbit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he killed, that he could do all of those things, and yet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he was not just mildly, but severely disabled. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

Why is the fact that he could mow lawns and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

play pool indicative of a strength that overcomes all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other deficits? 

 

 

15 

            

MR. KELLER:  Lennie, and the character from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

Of Mice and Men, was never part of the test.  It's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the test.  It was an aside in the opinion, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said it was not going to address that separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question and instead adopted the clinical standards. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it informed its view 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

of how to judge the lack or strength of adaptive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functions.  It used the Lennie standard. 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MR. KELLER:  No, it absolutely did not.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

we can see that, not only from the fact that what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened in Briseno was the Lennie paragraph was an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

52 

1 

aside, and then the Court adopted the clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

standards. 

3 

            

The CCA has only once since then ever cited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

Lennie, and it was in a footnote quoting a trial court, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the CCA granted Atkins relief in that case.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lennie standard has never been part of a standard. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's one of the most misunderstood aspects of the

briefing here.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, can I ask -- I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

sort of trying to reconcile the various statements you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made here, and in your briefs, and here's what I come up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with, and tell me if it's right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think what you're saying is the Texas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court of Appeals is complying with Atkins because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used a three-pronged test, focusing on IQ and adaptive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

function and age.  But within each of those prongs, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order to make this distinction between clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disability and moral culpability within each of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prongs, the Court can choose how to apply that prong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and particularly what levels of impairment to use. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is that a fair assessment? 

   

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, may I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

answer? 

24 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.  Sure. 

  

  

 

 

            

MR. KELLER:  I don't believe so, Justice 

    

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

53 

Kagan, because what the Court has done is it has adopted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the clinical prongs.  It has adopted the three-part 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

test. 

4 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  I -- yes, it has 

    

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

adopted the three-part test.  But within each of those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prongs, you get to apply it. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I thought that that was the entire point of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hall:  No, that's wrong.  You don't get to apply it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however you want. 

 

 

10 

            

MR. KELLER:  But on intellectual 

  

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

functioning, Texas has never had an IQ cutoff.  As Hall 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized, it applied the -- the error of measurement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And even on the adaptive prong analysis, that is going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to account for conceptual, social, and practical skills 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as Texas has actually adopted the current standards.

First, there was a lot of discussion about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

the role of Briseno and the relationship to clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

decisions. 

Alderson Reporting Company

20

22 

23 

24 

25 

the American Bar Association amicus brief because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes through three decisions of the Court of Criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appeals where in each of those three decisions, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinical testimony, the expert testimony, was unanimous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the individual was intellectually disabled, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas courts used the Briseno factors to conclude that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in fact, he was eligible for execution notwithstanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the unanimity of that expert testimony. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second, my friend said that I conceded that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

they could have just applied the DSM-IV and rejected the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DSM-5.  Just to -- to be clear, and just for the record, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I did not concede that. 

 

 

 

 

            

And in my response to Justice Kennedy, I was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that if a court -- if a State is going to reject 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinical consensus and in the current clinical standard, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as in that example, then there would be a number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors that the court would look at. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And what I didn't get to was, and very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

importantly, is the Eighth Amendment principles and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns that this Court outlined in Hall and in Atkins, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the absolute requirement to ensure that somebody who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is intellectually disabled is not going to be executed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Third, one point about Chief Justice's 

 

 

 

 

 

initial question that I never quite got to about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

55 

question presented, in addition to the fact that, as we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did discuss, its interwoven with the Briseno decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

In the cert papers themselves, in our cert

petition and our reply, we repeatedly used the phrases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like "nonclinical," "unscientific," "standards 

 

 

 

completely untethered to clinical consensus."  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

indeed, the State, in its opposition to the cert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition, rested heavily on the Briseno factors.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a few pages of their opposition that are specifically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directed to that.  So there -- that was very extensively 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussed in the cert papers at the time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you just clarify what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you said about DSM-IV and DSM-5, because I had a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different impression from your initial argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So if we were to say today every State must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt DSM-5, and then at some point in the future DSM-6 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes out, would it be your position that those States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would all have to go back and reconsider what they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

doing? 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. SLOAN:  They -- they would have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider them as part of the diagnostic framework. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And, again, these new editions come out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about once every 10 years.  But, yes, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because those editions represent the scientific method 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at work, people using their best clinical and medical

training to refine and to sharpen the tools, and with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regard to intellectual disability, to identify the

people --

 

4 

5 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it your view that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Briseno factors are all consistent with DSM-IV? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. SLOAN:  No, Your Honor.  They are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

completely inconsistent with clinical factors, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been from the day that they were announced.  But it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is even more clear that they are inconsistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinical factors in light of the current clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

standards. 

12 

13

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

And my friend also was suggesting that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is some question about -- based on Briseno -- may I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finish this sentence, your Honor? 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

            

MR. SLOAN:  -- based on Briseno about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether, in fact, there is a bright line exemption for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the intellectually disabled.  He was suggesting that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's clear there is.  And I just briefly wanted to call 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court's attention to what the Court of Criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appeals has said relying on Briseno. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In Ex parte Hearn, the Court said, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote:  "This Court has expressly declined to establish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a mental retardation bright line exemption from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

execution without significantly greater assistance from

the Legislature."  Briseno 135 Southwest 3d., et seq.

said, "Answering questions about whether the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is mentally retarded for a particular clinical purpose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is instructive but not conclusive." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank you, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted.
