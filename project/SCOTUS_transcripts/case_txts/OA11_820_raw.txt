 MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 Mr. Fisher. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

1
2
3
4  first this morning in Case 11-820, 
Roselva Chaidez v. United States. 
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12  decided Teague v. Lane, it's had more than a dozen cases 
13  in which people have sought habeas relief based on 
14  ineffective assistance of counsel, but this Court has 
never once held that applying Strickland in those 
15
16  divergent factual settings constituted a new rule. 
17
 For two reasons, this Court should reject 
18  the government's argument to do so for the first time 
19  here. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

First, Padilla was dictated by precedent; 
that is, like other Strickland cases that came before 
it, this Court in Padilla simply applied Strickland's 
formula of assessing attorney performance according to 
prevailing professional norms to a new set of facts. 

The second --

3
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FISHER:  No, I don't think so, 

Your Honor.  Two -- two things about the lower courts. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's a surprise to 
1
2  the, what, ten courts of appeals who came out the other 
3  way? 
4
5
6
 The first is, there are only three lower 
7  court decisions that postdate the 1996 act that the 
8  government can cite that came out the other way in terms 
9  of the question presented here. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21  the distinction was between acts and omissions. 
22
23
24  was -- maybe it was a surprise to the members of this 
25

And the second thing is, even within those 
cases and within those courts, they didn't distinguish 
between deportation advice and other kinds of advice. 
They distinguished between acts and omissions; that is 
to say, it was a uniform rule in the lower courts at the 
time this Court decided Padilla that misadvice 
concerning the right to -- I'm sorry, concerning 
deportation consequences of a plea did violate 
Strickland. 

 So the distinction in lower courts was not 
between deportation advice and other kinds of advice; 

 And in Padilla itself --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So maybe it 

Court that disagreed with that --

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FISHER:  No --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- with the ruling 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, obviously, there was a 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher --
 MR. FISHER:  In Williams --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- what -- what about the 

1
2
3  in Padilla. 
4
dissent in Padilla, but this Court has held before that 
5
6  new applications of Strickland did not constitute a new 
7  rule, even though there were dissents. 
8
9
10
11 
argument that Strickland doesn't come into play unless 
12 
the Sixth Amendment includes the collateral consequences 
13 
in counsel's obligation to defend a defendant in a 
14 
criminal case under the argument that up to -- up to 
Padilla, only advice relevant to guilt or innocence and 
15
16 
sentencing was required, not collateral consequences? 
17
 MR. FISHER:  Well, that was obviously the 
18  argument that the State of Kentucky made in that case, 
19  and this Court dealt with it in part two of Padilla. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

Now, remember, Justice Ginsburg, the Court 
did not extend Strickland to collateral consequences in 
Padilla.  It actually reserved that question.  What it 
held is that deportation consequences are not removed 
from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment. 
So, remember, Strickland --

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it's also a question 

 MR. FISHER:  I think -- I think that's an 

open question after Padilla. 

 What this Court held in Padilla -- and this 

1
2  if -- if conviction meant loss of a professional 
3  license, that would be an open question? 
4
5
6
7  is the second to last sentence in part two -- is that 
8  advice concerning deportation consequences of a guilty 
9  plea are not categorically removed from the Sixth 
10
11
 So what I understood the Court to do in 
12  Padilla was take the ordinary Strickland formula of 
13  prevailing professional norms and simply apply it to 
14  this criminal case.  Remember, Padilla itself was a 
15
16
17  I mean, we -- we never come out with a decision that 
18  doesn't rely upon some preexisting principle.  We always 
19  cite some preexisting principle.  Does that mean that 
20
21
 MR. FISHER:  Of course not.  The question 
22  this Court asked under Teague is whether it broke new 
23  ground.  And I think what this Court said in Padilla is, 
24  we reject the artificial restriction on Strickland that 
the lower courts have created; so, therefore, this Court 
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's always the case. 

every case of ours is -- is not new law? 

Amendment. 

criminal case. 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Wouldn't we think that that's a very easy 

case that the AEDPA standard had not been met? 

 MR. FISHER:  I think you -- you may well 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Fisher, think 

1  simply reaffirmed Strickland.  It didn't --
2
3  about this in an AEDPA context.  I mean, assume that you 
4  have these ten circuit courts all going in the way that 
the Chief Justice said, and then one court came along 
5
6  and said, you know, we think that they -- in an AEDPA 
7  context, a habeas consideration of a state conviction --
8  we think that this is all wrong, and, in fact, the law 
9  is exactly the opposite of what ten circuits have held. 
10
11 
12
13  find that, Justice Kagan, but the reason why is because 
14  you'd find that there was not an unreasonable 
15
16  is that the clearly established law is any different. 
17
 So, remember, this Court -- this case, 
18  because it's a Federal case, raises only the first 
19  question under AEDPA, in a sense, which is what's the 
clearly established law?  And this is the Chief -- I 
20
21  think this is responsive to the Chief Justice's question 
22  about the dissent. 
23
24  how to apply Strickland, but the question's whether a 
new legal rule was created, not whether there was an 
25

application of preexisting law.  What you would not say 

 There was a disagreement on this Court about 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1  unreasonable application --
2
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why pick on Strickland?  I 
3  mean, you could say that about any principle of law that 
4  we rely on:  The dissent thought that that principle 
5
6
 What is different about Strickland that it 
7  enables you to appeal to that, as opposed to appealing 
8  to any principle of law? 
 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think the best response 
9
is what this Court said in Williams, which is Strickland 
10
11  provides sufficient guidance to resolve virtually every 
12  ineffective assistance claim. 
13
14  not make new law when we apply Strickland. 
15
16
17  Fisher, is there any application, you call it application 
18  of Strickland, that would qualify as a new rule, any 
19  application at all, or is just Strickland never a new 
20
21
22  applied Strickland, you wouldn't create a new rule. 
23
24  claim does not need to have a prejudice showing, that 
25

I think Justice Kennedy --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any -- Mr. 

 So what this Court said in Williams is we do 

 MR. FISHER:  I think so long as you simply 

 If you for example, said, a certain kind of 

rule?

applied a different way here. 

would be a new rule. 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 Could -- if there was an evolution of the 


law of adequate assistance of counsel so that this Court 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose that a 
1
2  really skilled attorney, after negotiating a plea 
3  bargain, or even representing a client at trial but then 
4  losing, is very skilled in ensuring that the defendant 
can go into the general population, not into solitary 

5
6  confinement; but also a skilled trial attorney, he's 

7  just not very good at that, so the defendant goes to 

8  solitary. 

9
10
11  later held, oh, conditions of confinement have to be a 
12  part of the attorney's -- skill and competence in 
13  representation, that that would be retroactive? 
14
15
16  because Strickland is a backward-looking device. 
17
18  answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, some cases in 
19  which there could be a new rule of ineffective 
20
21
22  that question is yes, and, as I said, something like a 
23  scenario where this Court --
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So that there are then, in 

 MR. FISHER:  Justice Kennedy, it wouldn't be 

enough to have a later evolution of prevailing norms 

assistance of counsel under Strickland? 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think the answer to 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I don't understand 

how that works with my hypothetical. 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

It would be a new rule, I think, 

Justice Kennedy, to say that Strickland requires relief, 
even though at the time the advice was given the 
prevailing norm had not yet crystalized into the degree 
that this Court requires. 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, let me -- let me try to 
1
2  work with your hypothetical.  I think what I hear your 
3  hypothetical to say is that prevailing norms change, and 
4  they evolve to a certain point where certain kinds of 
advice is required, which is much what this Court said 
5
6  in Padilla about -- about deportation advice. 
7
 You would have -- you would not have a new 
8  rule to simply recognize that at the time that attorney 
9  gave advice, that -- that Strickland was violated. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15

18

20
21
22  said. 
 MR. FISHER:  -- Strickland -- Strickland 
23
24  sets up a two-part test, and we're only talking about 
25

the first part, which is attorney performance.  And 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I thought you 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The only new law is not a 

new pronouncement which nobody had ever thought of 
before, but only a pronouncement that rests upon an 
evolution of mores; is that it? 

 MR. FISHER:  No, I think what I'm trying to 

say is --

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, those prevailing professional norms 


are, in a sense, a factual question, an empirical 

1  that -- that question is keyed to attorney performance 

2  at the time judged by reasonableness according to 

3  prevailing professional norms. 

4
5
6  question that --
7
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fisher, it would seem to 
8  me that this case presents a kind of threshold question. 
9  Before you get to the question of what are prevailing 
professional norms and whether they have been complied 
10
11 
with, there is the question of whether the Sixth 
Amendment applies to collateral consequences at all and, 
12 
13 
if so, which collateral consequences. 
14
15
16  very different from anything that Strickland’s discussed, 
17  not just an application of Strickland. 
18
19  answers to that, because I think that's the government's 
20
21
22  simply saying that an exception that the lower courts 
23  created doesn't exist -- doesn't create a new rule. 
24  Imagine this Court said -- laid down a rule that covered 
25

 And that’s the question on which Padilla 
opines, and that's the question that seems, you know, 

all cars, and the lower courts devised an exception to 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, let me give you two 

main argument here. 

 First is, as I've tried to say before, 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 To me, that doesn't create a new rule.  And 

I think that's what this Court said in part two of 


1  that rule for convertibles.  And when the Court -- when 
2  the issue came to this Court, this Court said, well, no, 
3  when we said all cars, we meant all cars. 
4
5
6  Padilla, is that this artificial restriction that the 

7  lower courts have devised simply can't be grounded in 

8  Strickland --

9
 JUSTICE BREYER:  How many had? 

MR. FISHER:  Pardon me? 
10
11
 JUSTICE BREYER:  How many had?  I mean, I 
12  would have thought it was common sense that a lawyer 
13  should tell the client the terrible things that are 
14  going to happen to him if he pleads guilty, those things 
15
16  client may not.  Alright.  That's a very general rule 
17  at that level. 
 But some courts have said, no, that isn't 
18
19  true.  That isn't true unless -- if it's -- as Justice 
Kagan said, if it's a collateral exception, if it's a 
20
21  collateral consequence.  How many had?  Was it only 
22  Kentucky, or was it fairly widespread, this exception? 
23
24  had had a ruling like that after the 1996 act --
25

that the lawyer knows or should know about and the 

 MR. FISHER:  Only three federal circuits 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there aren't that 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, if I can finish my 

act, and all three of those relied on pre-'96 act 

 So while the government comes here today 

and suggests that ten circuits and all these state 

1  many.  There are eleven, and two of them are 
2  specialized. 
3
4  answer, only three had rulings like that after the 1996 
5
6  rulings.  And as court of appeals judges said, that's 
7  just not quite enough for us to be entitled to overturn 
8  our prior circuit precedent. 
9
10
11  courts had ruled, in a sense, in its favor, you know, 
12  it's almost more accurate to say none had had this issue 
13  cleanly presented to them after the 1996 act. 
14
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
 MR. FISHER:  That may well be true, Justice 
22
23  Kagan, but I'm saying in the '96 act, as this Court said 
24  in Padilla, whatever prevail -- whatever doubt there may 
25

1996 act, deportation -- there were deportation 
consequences.  Those consequences were enhanced by the 
1996 act; but, even before that, a reasonable lawyer, 
you might think, would have a conversation with his 
client about the deportation consequences of a 
conviction. 

 And, Justice Kagan, if I --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but even before the 

have been about prevailing professional norms 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  crystallized at that time because of the severity. 
2
 And I think that's the second answer I 
3  wanted to give to your question about this so-called 
4  threshold question in Padilla, is that even if there is 
some question as to whether the Sixth Amendment applies 
5
6  beyond, as the government puts it, criminal jeopardy, 
7  this Court had already answered that question in St. Cyr, 
8  where this Court said, in the text around footnotes 48 
9  and 50, that any competent lawyer would give his client 
advice and a warning about deportation consequences of a 
10
11 
plea. 
12
13  itself, St. Cyr gave that to you in 2001, which is 
14  enough to decide this case; it was enough to decide 
15
16
17  were to decide in a future case that effective 
18  assistance of counsel requires an attorney to advise the 
19  client of all collateral consequences, potential loss of 
a professional license, etc., would that be a rule that 
20
21  was dictated by precedent? 
22
23  Justice Alito.  I think it would depend on what the 
24  prevailing professional norms looked like. 
25

 MR. FISHER:  I think it would -- I doubt it, 

I take it what this Court said in Strickland 

 So even if you needed more than Strickland 

Padilla. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If a court -- if this Court 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

I seriously doubt that prevailing 

beyond that, you would have a new rule. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Fisher, I suppose you 

1  and what it reaffirmed in Padilla is, we're not going 
2  to -- we're not going to micromanage effective 
3  assistance of counsel.  We're going to leave it to 
4  prevailing professional norms. 
5
6  professional norms would require the holding that you 
7  described; but, to the extend they did, I don't think it 
8  would be a new rule.  To the extent they didn't and 
9  this Court said, we're going to push the Sixth Amendment 
10
11
12  are right, I'm sure you're right that the mere fact that 
13  there was a dissent in the case that adopted the rule 
14  does not necessarily make it a new rule.  But you, on 
the other hand, would agree, would you not, that those 
15
16  who dissented from that case would regard it as a new 
17  rule? 
18
19  answer, Justice Scalia. 
20
21 
 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think I could answer it 
22
23  one of two ways.  One is I could say yes, they did -- to 
24  the extent they did regard it as a new rule, I think the 
25

dissent was, with all due respect, slightly mistaken 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I think it's an easy 

 MR. FISHER:  That's a tricky question to 

question to answer. 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 The way that I think Padilla -- majority 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's fair.  That's fair. 

MR. FISHER:  Well, I think that the way the 

defendant in a criminal case entitled to advice from his 
criminal lawyer, and the most important piece of advice 
as to whether to take a plea or not involves deportation 
consequences. 

1  about what the holding in Padilla was, which was not 
2  to --
3
4  The dissenters ought to reconsider, you're saying. 
5
6  dissent put it was -- is that advice is now required 
7  beyond criminal cases and criminal jeopardy. 
8
9  described its holding was that this is a criminal 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
22  that, Justice Kennedy, because, of course, there is lots 
23  of --
24
25

 And, Justice Scalia, I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it just seems to me 
that the predicate question that we decided in Padilla 
was that Strickland applies to matters not within the 
control of the trial judge.  That it seems to me was a 
holding the Court had not addressed before and that 
other courts had not addressed before. 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, it had to be more than 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, this is --
MR. FISHER:  -- ineffective assistance 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  cases –-
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- a predicate question. 
2
 MR. FISHER:  Well, no, no.  But I'm saying 
3
4  there are lots of ineffective assistance cases before 
Padilla that involved matters beyond the judge, that 
5
6  turned on what the jury did, of course.  And I could --
7  I may be able to think of others beyond those two 
8  scenarios, but there's no language to that effect in 
9  Padilla. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  of the law you needed, certainly by 2001. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

What the Court said is that we have never 
created artificial distinctions about what an attorney 
has to do.  As this Court put it in Strickland, 
Strickland itself, the client is advised to his lawyer's 
advice about all important decisions.  And as this Court 
said in St. Cyr and other cases, the most important 
consideration as to whether to plead guilty is whether 
somebody will be deported. 

 And so you put that together and you had all 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think you've 

been -- you've been asked this, and I'm not sure I got 
your answer.  Give me an example of something that --
like the consequences in Padilla that would not be 
covered by your argument? 

MR. FISHER:  Well, some sort of consequences 

17

advice about future employment opportunities to a client 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You answered that 

would be at least an open question. 

 MR. FISHER:  It -- I think it would be an 

1  that -- that prevailing norms didn't require a lawyer to 
2  advise his client on. 
 So, for example, I would expect that a 
3
4  lawyer is not necessarily required to give detailed 
5
6  depending on whether he pleads guilty. 
7
8  question when I asked it, you said that removal of a 
9  professional license would not fall under -- wouldn't --
10
11
12  open question as to how Strickland would apply. 
13
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you had --
 MR. FISHER:  I simply don't know what the 
14
prevailing professional norms are in that situation. 
15
16
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you had that 
17  case, what would you rely on in arguing in favor of the 
18  habeas petition? 
19
20
21 
22
23  And I would look to prevailing professional norms. 
24
 And I think, if I could give a generic 
25

Strickland, and you would talk with -- Padilla, right? 
 MR. FISHER:  Yes, that's what I would do. 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I would start with --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You would start with 

answer, the question would be whether or not that kind

 MR. FISHER:  No, no, Justice Kennedy. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that 

 MR. FISHER:  No, I don't think it does, 

you're -- that the defense bar generally would want to 
say that prevailing professional norms change, but 
that -- that hurts you in this case. 

1  of advice is so important to the client's decision 
2  making -- and that's the word the Court used in 
3  Strickland -- that prevailing norms require the lawyer 
4  to give that kind of advice. 
If the answer to that was yes --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you want us to write

14
Justice Kennedy.  I agree with your premise, I think, 
15
16  that prevailing professional norms can and do evolve. 
17  And so the question this Court asked in Strickland is, 
18  as of the time the advice was given, did the prevailing 
19  norms require that?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think there may be 

1  standards, and that goes beyond the constitutional 
2  minimum.  So that doesn't seem to me to help you, 
3  either. 
4
 MR. FISHER:  Well, I'm not sure that's what 
the ABA said.  I believe the ABA, quite rightly, said, 
5
6  we don't make constitutional law in this body; we leave 
7  that to the courts. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It said, it should be 
8
9  stated that these standards do more than enforce the 
10
11
12  elements of the standards that did. 
13
 But, remember, we're not just talking about 
14  the ABA here.  As this Court noted in Padilla and as one 
15

19  give some other authority; but, I say that, it seems to

 MR. FISHER:  Well, then I'll rely on just

 We believe that under the system this Court

1  to talking about the -- the nature of the 
2  backward-looking effect of Strickland, I think there is 
3  an important second question in this case, that if this 
4  Court were inclined to hold that there was a new rule, 
you'd be forced to confront.  And it's a very serious 
5
6  question involving this Court's administration of 
7  criminal appellate procedure.  And that is whether 
8  Teague ought to apply at all in this context. 
9
10
11  simply doesn't make any sense to apply Teague here and, 
12  indeed, would throw a gigantic monkey wrench into the 
13  way things are -- have been done for the last decade 
14  after that decision.

24  presented.  We raised it at the first available 
25

 MR. FISHER:  Sure.  We didn't forfeit this 

 MR. FISHER:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- the government says that

And -- and for two reasons:  One, in 

theory --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fisher, before you get

So I think we gave fair notice to the Court. 

And if you have any doubt --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you haven't presented 

1  foreclosed by circuit precedent from raising it.  So we 
2  raised it before an en banc court. 
 And in our cert reply brief, lest there be 
3
4  any doubt, when the government suggested that we would 
be restricted to arguing the new rule question in this 
5
6  case, we put a footnote in our cert reply brief which 
7  expressly told the Court, no, we view this question 
8  presented as including this additional argument, whether 
9  Teague applies or not. 
10
11 
12
13  this argument to any court before; is that right? 
14
15
16  couldn't make it to a panel because Seventh Circuit law 
17  had already held that Teague applied in this context. 
18
19  a coram nobis proceeding, rather than a habeas 
20
21
22  government that it doesn't -- matter. 
 The way we see this is it's a first Federal 
23
24  filing.  It's a first post-conviction filing, and it's a 
25

timely filing.  The government is not challenging the

1  timeliness of this filing. 
2
 So the question you have to ask yourself is, 
3  under a system where this Court has said that IAC claims 
4  should not be brought on direct review, but rather 
5
6  apply Teague at the very first instance that somebody 
7  has to make a constitutional claim, and we think not. 
8  On theory --
9
you -- not in relation to the Massaro argument, but in 
10
11  relation to the Teague argument, you think the rule in 
12  coram nobis is the same, that the Teague rule applies 
13  fully in coram nobis in the same way that it applies in 
14  habeas? 
15
16 
17 
18
19  of --
20
21
22  want to be extra careful, you can -- you can say the 
23  parties haven't challenged that. 
24
25

 Remember, the reason that we're on coram 
nobis is Ms. Chaidez was not in custody.  And so if 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Have we ever held that? 
 MR. FISHER:  No, you haven't.  And so if you 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  On that question, before 

MR. FISHER:  Well, that's the way the whole 

case has been litigated, and I think that's a fair 
assumption. 

 The reason that we're on coram nobis instead

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, yes, I understand 

 MR. FISHER:  More severe in the sense -- I'm 

under the current Federal habeas statute, you have a 
rather short statute of limitations to file the habeas 
petition. 

1  somebody -- so it's, in a sense, interchangeable with a 
2  2255. 
3
4  that, but the consequences of a retroactive application 
in coram nobis are more severe than they are in habeas, 
5
6  aren't they, because of the lack of a statute of 
7  limitations?

9  not sure I understand in what sense.

17
 MR. FISHER:  I'm not sure they -- I'm not 
18  sure they could, Justice Alito.  At Pet. App. 38, you'll 
19  see the district court dealing with the timeliness of 
this petition.  And the district court finds that Ms. 
20
21  Chaidez could proceed because she used all reasonable 
22  diligence in bringing this claim. 
23
24  arguments, can make other arguments to defeat that.  The 
government has renounced those -- I mean, they let those

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if someone -- if there 

1  arguments go in the Seventh Circuit and don't raise them 
2  again here. 
 But I think that, at a minimum, it would be 
3
4  fair to say that somebody needs to bring a petition as 
5
6  seek deportation. 
7
8
9  is an attempt to -- a notice of removal for someone 
based on a conviction that occurred a long time ago, 
10
11 
then that would be --
12
 MR. FISHER:  You could -- you could have a 
13  time lag, but there is two things to remember.  First 
14  is, you might have a timely 2255 in that circumstance, 
too, because, remember, in Holland v. Florida, this 
15
16  Court held that equitable tolling is available for 
17  people with IA -- with ineffective assistance that leads 
18  to them not being able to make the claim earlier. 
19
20
21  Strickland would -- would require the party -- once you 
22  get more than a little while back, the prevailing norms 
23  may not -- may not be there for that kind of a claim. 
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher --
MR. FISHER:  And so that's --

 And the second thing is, as I was discussing 

with Justice Kennedy, the backward-looking aspect of 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, are 

As you said, this Court has said time and again that 
Teague relies on comity.  That's not present in this 
case. 

1
2  you -- you're not making any argument that Teague is 
3  inapplicable because this -- the underlying conviction 
4  here is a federal conviction, not a state conviction, 
and Teague emphasized comity to the states; you're not 
5
6  making that argument? 
7
 MR. FISHER:  No, I think you could hold 
8  that, and that is -- that is within our argument.  I 
9  don't think you need to go that far, Justice Ginsburg. 
10
11 
12 
13
14  case, and I think the appropriate way to decide this 
case, is to say, at least for ineffective assistance 
15
16  claims, when you're bringing -- with a Federal prisoner, 
17  or somebody who has been convicted of a Federal crime, 
18  that's bringing their first petition, that Teague can't 
19  apply. 
20
21 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, except -- except 
22
23  that -- and I'm interrupting, in a sense, but it's on 
24  the same track -- except that it seems to me that Teague 
25

does serve the interest of repose, quite apart from 

 But we think a narrower way to decide this 

And what I was just trying to say is 

Strickland itself --

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm glad 

you asked because that was what I was going to say. 

 In Strickland, this Court dealt with 

1  interference with a federal proceeding, and that 
2  interest is surely sacrificed by the holding you wish us 
3  to make here. 
4
5
6
7  finality very explicitly and said, we're creating this 
8  standard which is different than other constitutional 
9  standards because we're concerned about finality.  And, 
as this Court said at pages 697 and 98, so, therefore, 
10
11 
no different rules ought to apply in collateral 
proceedings as in direct review, because this Court 
12 
13 
assumed in Strickland itself and it assumed expressly 
again in Padilla that all of these claims would be on 
14 
collateral review. 
15
16
17  finality -- the concern -- the very concern you 
18  mentioned, Justice Kennedy, is already baked into the 
19  Strickland formula. 
20
21 
22 
23
24
25

concerned that creating exceptions to exceptions in 
Teague is just a throwback to Linkletter standard --

 MR. FISHER:  Well --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- where we're making 

choices among situations and saying, these will be 

 So in all these cases the Court has said 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fisher, I'm

 MR. FISHER:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Answer that concern on 

MR. FISHER:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And then answer -- the 

 MR. FISHER:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- which is what happens 

1  retroactive, these won't. 
2
3
4  my part. 
5
6
7  next step is the Martinez type case --
8
9
with state reviews that are -- that channel IAC claims 
10
11  to their habeas processes.  So what trumps what in that 
12  situation? 
13
14  things.  First, we’re not asking this Court to create 
an exception to Teague.  We’re simply asking this Court 
15
16  to say Teague doesn't apply when a claim is, quote, "on 
17  the equivalent of direct review," which is what this 
18  Court said in Martinez v. Ryan.  This Court has already 
19  held with respect to IAC that habeas rules, like the 
procedural default rule and like the Stone v. Powell bar 
20
21  against Fourth Amendment claims, don’t apply in the IAC 
22  context.  So this follows exactly from those previous 
23  holdings. 
24
25

 Now, let me say two other things and then I 
can hopefully reserve my time.  To answer your question 

 MR. FISHER:  Okay.  Let me answer both those 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, that's exactly what this Court rejected in 
Massaro, and the government asked this Court to reject 
that in Massaro; said we don't want that kind of a 
system.  I don't know why the government is asking for 
it for the first time today. 

1  about Martinez in state cases, it would depend on what 
2  the state system looked like, and I think states have 
3  their own decision to make as to whether they want a 
4  system like Arizona's, where these have to be brought in 
collateral proceedings, or whether, as I understand at 
5
6  least a couple of states do, say, we're going to stay 
7  and delay the entire direct review process, for years 
8  often, to allow the IAC claim to be brought then. 
9
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  finality concerns about the stay and remand procedures 
17  the government suggests; they also raise insoluble 
18  conflicts of interest problems for federal defender 
19  offices, who would have to bring IAC claims against 
20
21  ability to -- to get full relief for their client. 
22
23  recognize the white light's on -- you could address what 
24  is -- what is the standard you want me to apply to 
25

determine retroactivity?  The brief says, oh, well, it's 

 And finally remember, the last thing I would 

like to say is, all these problems raise not only 

themselves on direct review in order to preserve their

formulation as I think you yourself put it in Wright v. 
West, which is that a rule that is -- that is applied to 
a new set of facts does not create a new rule; but if 
you advance the law in some way you do create a new 
rule. 

The last thing I would like to say about 

1  just new facts applying to the same general rule.  Well, 
2  danger invites rescue; the assault on privity is 
3  proceeding to pace; MacPherson v. Buick and the Erie 
4  Railroad case -- it seems to me that those were probably 
new rules, but there -- it's because the facts told us 
5
6  what should be negligent.  If at some point you could 
7  address that, I don't --

consequences is:  Remember, the government doesn't even 
have any answer for what is going to be half or more of 
the situations where people have Padilla-type claims, 
which is when they have a guilty plea and waive their 
right to direct appeal.  So there the collateral filing 
like this is -- is absolutely the equivalent of direct 
review.  And so I think this Court ought to be very wary 
of going down that road. 

 If I could reserve the time I have left.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

1
2
3
4
5
6
7  a new rule within the meaning of Teague v. Lane. 
8  Because --
9
10
11  omission and commission?  I mean, it does appear that 
12  every court who dealt with the commission-type claim, 
13  the fraud, the misrepresentation of consequences, said 
14  it's clear you can't lie to your client.  Now, is Teague 
15
16  type of claim that's raised, with respect to IAC? 
17
18  Court in Padilla didn't distinguish between misadvice 
19  and omissions to give advice.  And it therefore 
20
21
22  concurrences did, or talked to.  So assuming --
23  assuming -- is your position that is on the 
24  retroactivity, that it applies to both kinds, omissions 
25

now going -- is our ruling here going to depend on the 

adopted --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  At least one of our 

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, this 

and commissions, and neither is retroactive? 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

violated a more basic duty of counsel that was well 
established, which is not to represent that you're 
competent on a matter that you are not competent. 

 And the second distinction between misadvice 

in Padilla.  It was addressed in Justice Alito's 


1
2  rationale, the answer is yes, but there is a rationale 
3  that governed, in our view, misadvice claims that 
4  existed before Padilla.  It wasn't addressed or embraced 
5
6  concurring opinion.  Justice Alito gave two reasons 

7  which essentially mirrored the reasons that had been 

8  given in the lower courts for treating misadvice 

9  differently.  And that is, affirmative misadvice 

10
11 
12 
13
14  and failure to give any advice is that a client has a 
constitutional right to make his or her own decision 
15
16  about whether to plead guilty; and a lawyer has a 
17  constitutional duty not to get in the way of that by 
18  affirmatively skewing the client's ability to make that 
19  choice. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

misadvice claim was not new before Padilla and it's not 
really addressed by Padilla's rationale.  It has its own 
independent sources, and the courts that had adopted 
that --

And so I would probably not disagree that 

Official 

 MR. DREEBEN:  As for -- as for Padilla's 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure.  Are those 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

right.  And all of the courts that had adopted 

 And they did this, I might add, despite the 

matter there is no obligation to give advice about 
collateral consequences. 

1  sources -- when you say sources, it's professional norm 
2  sources? 
 MR. DREEBEN:  It's a different professional 
3
4  norm and it's a different aspect of the Sixth Amendment 
5
6  misadvice -- there were three of them that had done it 
7  in the removal context; there were three more that had 
8  done it in the parole eligibility context -- they all 
9  simultaneously adhered to the view that as a general 
10
11 
12
13  fact that, as Justice Kennedy alluded, the ABA, which 
14  was cited as one of the key sources of prevailing 
professional norms, stated in Standard 14.3.2, in the 
15
16  criminal justice pleas of guilty standards:  "To the 
17  extent possible, defense counsel should determine and 
18  advise the defendant sufficiently in advance of any plea 
19  as to the possible collateral consequences that might 
20
21
22  norm that collateral consequences would be on the table, 
23  but all Federal courts that had looked at this question 
24  before Padilla had concluded that collateral 
25

consequences are outside of the duty of criminal defense 

ensue from entry of the contemplated plea." 

 So there was an aspirational professional 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me 


evolving professional norm, no matter how well 


 MR. DREEBEN:  No, Justice Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are we frozen in time to 
whatever the professional standards are that exist today 
that the Court has recognized so far? 

1  counsel. 

2
3  where -- my colleagues were asking about hypothetical 

4  future cases -- I'm asking, do you think that every 

5
6  established it becomes, would never be subject to the 

7  Teague rule because -- would always be a retroactive 

8  application or a new rule? 

9
10
11 
12 
13
14  think this is the key point about Strickland. 
Justice Kennedy made this point in a concurrence in 
15
16  Wright v. West, and it was later cited by the Court 
17  as -- as reflecting an accurate understanding of 
18  Strickland.  It is a basic norm of professional 
19  competence, and it does not turn on professional --
20
21  the ABA.  They are informative. 
 And those norms can evolve.  The Court can 
22
23  then announce Sixth Amendment applications of them that 
24  will be not -- not new rules.  This Court has decided 
close to 30 Strickland cases, according to our count 
25

norms can evolve, Strickland always looks to an actor at

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's -- what's the sense

the professional norm, and then later the professional 
5
6  norms change and he makes the argument that -- that he's 
7  entitled to relief, and you say yes, because --

fairly clear that professional norms at the time of the 
attorney's action are what governs. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that what your opponent

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the ABA doesn't state

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, first of all, 

Padilla.  What the Court did in Padilla, as Justice 
Kagan explained, in section two of its opinion was first 
to address the question whether a criminal defense 
lawyer had any obligation to give advice about a 
consequence that would not be administered in the 
criminal case itself. 

1  changing professional norms, and that -- you looked at 
2  30 cases and that's what you get out of them -- and then 
3  it turns out that at the time this case began, there was 
4  such a professional norm; and all that happened in 
Padilla is that the Court following its general practice 
5
6  said apply that professional norm; then why doesn't the 
7  other side win?

 What was unique in Padilla is that the Court

had to address something that it had never done before, 
10
11  whether the criminal defense lawyer had to give advice 
12  about a consequence that the sentencing court had no 
13  control over. 
14
 And in resolving that question, this Court 
did not cite professional norms.  It did not cite the

17  recommend that lawyers advise aliens about the

You probably would say the same thing to 
somebody who you knew was an avowed hunter and would 
lose the right to have firearms, or a politician that 
would lose the right to hold office, or a doctor who 
would lose a medical license, all of which can be 
automatic consequences of a conviction; actually, more 
automatic than deportation, because deportation is 
administered by a separate body, oftentimes by a 
separate sovereign that has discretion whether to even 
institute deportation proceedings. 

And so the fact that we might all share an

itself was a collateral proceeding.  And if the state 
can argue in Padilla itself that a new rule was being 
sought and that that was permissible only on direct 
review, should the state have prevailed? 

1  intuition that good lawyers should advise their clients 
2  about the panoply of consequences that they will 
3  experience by pleading guilty, the reality is that until 
4  Padilla, the Court had never veered from the track of 
saying the lawyer's duty is to help the client figure 
5
6  out what his odds are of prevailing at trial, what the 
7  sentencing consequences are, whether there are any

 The closest case was the Hill case,

at the Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, Padilla

Court announces would apply to cases on direct review. 
25

a collateral consequence, namely, parole eligibility 
dates, and it said:  We don't have to decide that issue 
on whether parole eligibility dates can be the subject 
of a Strickland claim, because Hill had failed to show 
prejudice.  And therefore, it was recognized as an open 
issue whether a consequence that's not administered by 
the sentencing court could be within Strickland. 

 So when you have the coalescence of all of

fundamental judgment that when a case is final on its 
direct review, society has a strong interest in 
protecting that judgment.  And the exception to that is 
when the state or the Federal government has not 
conformed to existing constitutional law. 

 Now, bringing that down to earth for

Immediately after Padilla came down 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was -- it was approved 

possibility of deportation consequences.  In other 
words --

1  possibility that a criminal defense lawyer would not 
2  have advised about deportation, because the unanimous 
3  view was that's not something that's the Sixth Amendment 
4  duty. 
5

19  Committee has taken steps to protect the integrity of 
federal judgments through a Rule 11 amendment.  It had 
20
21  no opportunity or reason to do that -- I can't say no

19  considerations that are at stake here, too.  First of 
20
21  preclude a defendant from raising a claim on direct 
22  review.  It says that it's not a procedural default if 
23  he does not do that.  A criminal defendant will probably

7
 MR. DREEBEN:  It's not a preferred process 
8  for ineffectiveness claims generally.  I think Massaro 
9  makes that clear.  But you have to understand how rare a 
10
11 
12
13  standard to particular sets of facts are not new rules. 
14  That's why in the 28 years since Strickland none of this 
Court's decisions, and there are about 30 of them, under 
15
16  Strickland added up to a new rule.  Padilla broke ground 
17  because it answered the question, not how does 
18  Strickland apply, but whether it applies at all to 
19  something outside the compass of the sentencing court. 
And so in that respect, there's no reason

why the standard practice under Massaro should change if

 MR. DREEBEN:  It could be something more 

than that, because if the Court announces a new rule and 

1  Justice Breyer were right, that there should be sort of 
2  one run -- run up the flagpole and that Teague doesn't 
3  kick in until that one run up the flagpole and here 
4  because of Massaro the one run should include collateral 
5
6  costs of that?  Is that an extra year to the statute of 
7  limitations for bringing a collateral claim or is it 
8  something more than that? 
9
10
11  makes it retroactive to a case on collateral review, 
12  (f)(3) of the statute of limitations provision gives the 
13  defendant another 1 year.  And I think this case 
14  actually illustrates the mischief of that.  This case 
15
16  nobis 5 years after the conviction became final. 
17
 Now, if Petitioner were really serious that 
18  this Court should carve out from Teague ineffectiveness 
19  claims and adopt a rule just like the one that it did in

 Instead, resolving the new rule question 
that has divided the circuits would provide an answer 

1  opportunity to counter any of those arguments, and the 
2  lower court never had the opportunity to consider them, 
3  it's not a wise use of the Court's resources. 
4
5
6  for us and the 28 states that filed an amicus brief that 
7  supported the United States on the new rule question, 
8  and would result, I think, appropriately, in concluding 
9  that Padilla was a new rule, unique among this Court's 
10
11  available to cases on collateral review.

20
21

23  interest in finality to have procedural default apply to 
24  federal post-conviction review.  Yet, in Massaro, this

 MR. FISHER:  Thank you. 
 I'd like to make two points. 
 The first is, picking up where Mr. Dreeben 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Mr. Fisher, you have two minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

difficult. 

 Mr. Dreeben referred to the Frady case, 

Court carved out IAC claims. 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

rest assured the Federal courthouses are going to be 

wait until collateral review, but it doesn't apply on 
direct review, any responsible lawyer seeking to protect 
his client has to bring it on direct review.  It's going 
to absolutely change the way criminal procedure and 
criminal appellate procedure happens in the Federal 
court system. 

1
2  I do think the Court really ought to answer that 
3  question in this case because, if you hold that Padilla 
4  is a new rule and that Teague now applies to IAC claims, 
5
6  flooded, flooded with Federal -- with Federal defenders 
7  and other criminal lawyers raising IAC claims on direct 
8  review.  There'd be nothing else a responsible lawyer 
9  could do, because if you say Teague applies on -- if you 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 The second point I wanted to make is back to 
17  the new rule question.  I think I heard Mr. Dreeben say 
18  that the lower courts that had said that misadvice about 
19  deportation consequences violated Strickland had said 
20
21  constitute a new rule.  So it can't be that Strickland 
22  broke new ground, if he's correct, by saying deportation 
23  advice falls within the ambit of the Sixth Amendment in 
24  a guilty plea context. 
25

something that was within Strickland that didn't

 Exactly the same analysis applies here, and 

The only thing he relies on in the end is

 And in Padilla itself, this Court used the 

word absurd.  And I think, Justice Kennedy, when you 

1  this distinction the lower courts had drawn between acts 
2  and omissions.  And that's exactly the distinction in 
3  Strickland that this Court rejected. 
4
5
6  mentioned commonsense, I think we could throw that in, 
7  too. 
 And so to the extent that the argument, at 
8
9  the end of the day when everything's stripped away, is 
10

that the lower courts were reasonable in saying that 
failing to advise about the most important thing a 
client would have been thinking as to whether to plead 
guilty is not ineffective assistance of counsel, whereas 
giving bad advice is, that's a line that Strickland 
itself rejected, that Flores-Ortega rejected when it 
came to the right to appeal and whether the lawyer ought 
to give advice; and, it's a line that this Court in 
Padilla had no difficulty whatsoever rejecting and 
called it absurd. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fisher, can I go 

back to one of your points?  Your red light is on, but 
it is important.  The floodgate issue. 

 MR. FISHER:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure about the 
floodgates for the following reason.  Once we announce 

57
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 Padilla, any pending direct claim and any pending 
 collateral claim that arises after Padilla for something 
 that happened after Padilla would be covered by the 
 rule, so there'd be no bar to those claims.  So the 
floodgate is temporary, if there is --
 MR. FISHER:  No, it's not, 

 Justice Sotomayor. 

 The issue arises because Teague ordinarily 

 comes into play when somebody asks the Court to create a 
new rule and apply it to him.  So all the hypotheticals 
 we've talked about today, about would Strickland apply 
 here, would Strickland apply there, to parole advice, to 
 professional license, all of those claims would be 
 asking, if the government's correct, for a new rule. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 MR. FISHER:  And so all of those claims 

 would have to be brought. 

 Thank you. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The case is 

submitted. 

 (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the 

 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
