CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 02-634, the Green Tree Financial Corporation


versus Lynn W. Bazzle.


Mr. Phillips.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


First in Volt and then again last term in Waffle


House this Court made clear that, quote, arbitration under


the Federal Arbitration Act is a matter of consent, not


coercion.  It is that core Federal principle that was


violated by the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case. 

QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Phillips, now, the contract


presumably can be interpreted in accordance with the law


of the State with jurisdiction.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, to be sure, Justice O'Connor,


but this contract was not interpreted in accordance with


the understanding of the parties, with -- with respect to


the parties.  Ultimately, you have to look for the


parties' consent to this kind of an agreement, and what


the South Carolina Supreme Court was quite clear about --


QUESTION:  Well, there was no express provision

in the arbitration agreement saying that you can't have


class-wide arbitration.


MR. PHILLIPS:  To be sure, there was no express


provision to that effect, but if you look at the South


Carolina Supreme Court's decision in this case what it


says is, first, the parties were absolutely silent with


respect to class arbitration.  That's not surprising. 


I've never read a class arbitration clause in any


contract, and I'm told that no one's ever even attempted


to draft a class arbitration clause.


But second of all, the -- the court went further


than that and said what was going to inform its judgment


about how to interpret or how to apply this particular


situation, it wasn't anything with respect to the language


or understanding of the parties. 


What it was was, without 

any contractual directive whatsoever, stated twice, the


court simply coerced Green Tree to defend a class


arbitration proceeding.


QUESTION:  Well, but the --


QUESTION:  Well, how does that -- how does


differ from Volt, Mr. Phillips?  There, the contract


didn't say anything about the court staying the


arbitration, and yet we said in our opinion that that was


a permissible thing for a -- that once the law of


California had been invoked, that was a permissible thing

to be done.


MR. PHILLIPS:  In -- the difference between this


case and Volt, Mr. Chief Justice, is there the parties


agreed that the arbitration itself would be controlled


solely by California law.  That was the consent of the


parties.


QUESTION:  Well, they said the place where the


construction was -- was taken.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, and that was understood by


this Court, and by the lower courts as a matter of State


law, to embrace California law.


QUESTION:  But didn't -- didn't the -- didn't


the agreement here say it would be governed by the law of


South Carolina?


MR. PHILLIPS: 


The -- the underlying contract is 

governed by South Carolina law, but the arbitration


provision itself is governed exclusively by the Federal


Arbitration Act.


QUESTION:  Well, is your -- your argument that


if the South Carolina court is unreasonable in


interpreting State law, then it comes up here?  I -- I


just don't understand how we get this -- this question.


MR. PHILLIPS:  It seems to me there are two ways


you can get to this question.  In this case, there was no


effort by South Carolina Supreme Court to apply South

Carolina law.  What they did -- they're not looking for


the consent of the parties.  They're looking to coerce a


result based on their view of efficiency and equity which


involves the interests of completely third parties to


this -- to this situation, not the parties to this


particular agreement.  If --


QUESTION:  Why do you -- I'm sorry, I thought


you were done.


MR. PHILLIPS:  If, in fact, South Carolina had


purported -- if the South Carolina Supreme Court had


purported to try to interpret this agreement as in some


sense reflecting a -- a consent by the parties to a


class-based arbitration it would be a much, much closer


case.


QUESTION:  Well, what --


MR. PHILLIPS:  That's not the standard that the


court applied here.


QUESTION:  What if the South Carolina court in a


somewhat different case had said this arbitration is going


to be governed by our State rules of discovery.  The


parties have said nothing about it, but they just say, if


you're going to be bound by the laws of South Carolina,


that's what you're going to do.  Is that bad?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, that's not bad at all,


Mr. Chief Justice.  The difference between that, of

course, is that is what you expect when you -- when you


consent to a bilateral arbitration arrangement.  When you


say, we're going to proceed to resolve this dispute in an


efficient and economical fashion, you understand that that


means arbitration, however the -- however that gets played


out and, indeed, generally speaking, you would expect that


to be a question for the arbitrator, more than you might


as a matter of State law.


The difference here, of course, is we're talking


about making a decision that's binding, or at least


purports to be binding on literally thousands of other


individuals who are not parties to this agreement, and


this goes --


QUESTION:  And who are not -- and who are not


objecting so far as I know.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --


QUESTION:  Green Tree is the one who's


objecting.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, we don't know whether they


objected or not.  All we know is that they received notice


and took no action as a consequence of it, but --


QUESTION:  Why -- please.


MR. PHILLIPS:  If you -- if you flip this case


around, in this situation, where the -- where the unnamed

members potentially are going to receive $5,000 to $7,500


of windfall recoveries, my guess is they're not going to


object, but what if the case had gone the other way.  What


if the arbitrator had issued a $1 nominal damage award for


each member of this class.  Does anyone seriously doubt


that the next day any of those unnamed class members could


show up and say, excuse me, I have a right under my


contract to choose my arbitrator in an agreement between


myself --


QUESTION:  Yes.  Yes, one might doubt it if


their claim was worth $2, and it would cost them more to


go into court to make the objection.  The -- the class


action vehicle in some cases will make an action possible


that wouldn't be brought before an arbitrator before.


The --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Can I -- can I respond to that,


Justice Ginsburg, because you see, it seems to me that


that simply reflects the manifest hostility to the


arbitration agreement as it's been -- as it's been written


by the parties here.


I mean, basically what we're talking about is,


we have a dispute.  It involves what will largely be a few


thousand dollars, potentially.  I mean, the entire


contract here involved $15,000 of -- in one case and


$7,500.  You expect the disputes are going to be

relatively small, and you expect that the parties are


going to choose an efficient method of trying to resolve


those cases and move on, and -- and they waive their right


to a public, or judicial review, because the theory is,


win or lose, it's worth taking the risk.


When you take that kind of a situation and you


convert it into a $27 million fine, nobody would agree to


that ab initio.


QUESTION:  Do you --


QUESTION:  That's true.  That's true, but what's


bothering me is exactly this point.  I can understand your


argument to this point.  A State, I don't think could


possibly, consistent with section 2, interpret the word


arbitration in a contract to contain all the bells and


whistles of a court proceeding, because that would 

transform the arbitration into a court proceeding, and


therefore they would have, in this subtle way, not only


have shown hostility to but destroyed the arbitration


contract, but what about this one.  Is this hostile to


arbitration?


I have no doubt that Green Tree wouldn't have


agreed, in all likelihood, had they known what was going


to happen, and to that extent it is hostile to


arbitration, but the consumers on the other side might


have said, oh, we rather like it, in which case from their

point of view it isn't hostile to arbitration, so sort of


from one side it is, and from the other side it isn't, and


how do we decide whether, overall, it is or it isn't?


MR. PHILLIPS:  It seems to me that the linchpin


theory of the case ought to be the -- the point I started


with, Justice Breyer, which is, you look to determine


whether there is the consent of the parties or whether --


QUESTION:  No, but what we don't know here is


whether there is or there isn't.  We have silence, and


like many contracts that are silent, you have to impute an


intent, and what South Carolina did is --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, what South Carolina did --


QUESTION:  -- is, they imputed an intent.


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- they imputed an intent.


QUESTION: 


And they did it by a rule that says 

that since the other parties in our minds would have


jumped for joy, and you, your client would have weeped in


dismay, we in that situation interpret the contract


against the drafter, which happened to be your client, so


they chose the other side and thereby concluded that it


was not hostile to arbitration, though it wasn't in the


interest of one of the parties.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it also doesn't reflect the


consent of both of the parties.


QUESTION:  Well --

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Both parties have to consent,


Justice Breyer.  That's the nature of consent.


QUESTION:  You -- you --


MR. PHILLIPS:  You simply can't have unilateral


consent.


QUESTION:  The reason, as I understand it -- the


reason, as I understand it, you say there isn't consent


was the reason you gave in your answer to the Chief


Justice, that, in fact, they had agreed to be bound by


South Carolina law with respect to the interpretation of


the contract, but not with respect to the arbitration


clause itself, and my question is, how do you draw that


line?  There's nothing, per se, inconsistent between


applying the FAA and applying some State law.  That has to


be done.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --


QUESTION:  So why do you draw --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- South Carolina Supreme Court


drew that line.  The South Carolina Supreme Court


specifically held that the parties agreed that the


arbitration clause would be governed exclusively by the


Federal Arbitration Act, and the --


QUESTION:  No, but I mean, you say governed


exclusively by the FAA, in the sense that the FAA


naturally is going to trump any inconsistency with State

law, but here, there isn't a clear inconsistency with


State law, and the FAA is always applied with some State


law in mind.  You have to have some procedure, and so on,


and -- and therefore I -- I don't know how you can draw


this nonporous line between the FAA and arbitration on one


hand and State law on the other.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there are two ways to get


there.  First of all, as a matter of just South Carolina


law we know that South Carolina's arbitration provisions


completely go by the wayside as a matter of State law. 


Munoz held that several years ago.  If the FAA applies,


there is no State law that is residual to it.  It is


determined by the Federal Arbitration Act, which means


that the arbitrator is going to make certain kinds of


decisions.


But the -- I think the key line here is that


arbitrators are absolutely free to fashion whatever rules


they think are appropriate for resolving disputes in a


bilateral situation.  The question is, where does the


arbitrator get the authority to reach out to literally


thousands of other parties in order to resolve their


rights?


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, first, you're not --


you're not urging that there's any inherent inconsistency


between the arbitration and class action.  You concede in

your brief, I think, that if the parties agreed, yes, you


could have a class action in arbitration.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, although, Justice Ginsburg,


there is not a single example that I could identify of any


parties ever agreeing to go into a class action through


arbitration.


QUESTION:  Have there been no class actions


in -- in arbitration?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry?


QUESTION:  Have there been no class actions


in --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Other than this one?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. PHILLIPS:  There are in California, but


that's -- that's it. 


California and South Carolina are 

the only places, and the reason is, is that what you


create is this extraordinarily hideous hybrid kind of a


proceeding.


QUESTION:  Does the AAA have no rules about --


MR. PHILLIPS:  No.


QUESTION:  -- class actions?  It's just


silent --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Not as far as I know.  I mean,


they didn't file a brief in this case, but as far as I


know AAA doesn't have rules specifically dealing with it.

They find it to be, as I understand it, quite burdensome


to try to figure out how to deal with it.  If you think


about it, this -- you're -- you're taking a dispute that


by its nature is supposed to involve a few thousand


dollars, converting it into $27 million.  The costs in


this case alone --


QUESTION:  Well, suppose --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- were $36,000.


QUESTION:  If the parties had chosen, say, a New


York forum -- I thought an arbitration agreement is


supposed to be a forum for action laws.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that's part of it.


QUESTION:  If they said nothing about class


action and they chose New York as a forum, New York has a


class action vehicle. 


They could get -- the plaintiffs 

could get a class action, is that not so?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, the difficulty with


that is that there's -- there's no State law in general --


I mean, there are no statutes out there that provide for


class actions with respect to arbitrations.  That's why


this is a hostile --


QUESTION:  But it -- it -- then arbitration is


something other than a mere choice of forum, because --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, absolutely.  The Federal


Arbitration Act creates a substantive law of

arbitrability.  To be sure, it incorporates and embraces


decisionmaking by the arbitrator.  It recognizes some


limited role in some circumstances for State law, although


again South Carolina doesn't do that, but there -- there


is nothing that provides a mechanism for converting your


ordinary bilateral --


QUESTION:  Can I -- can I interrupt with this


question, Mr. Phillips?  Supposing you had the -- Green


Tree had agreements with a large -- large number of


consumers, and suppose 15 of them filed separate


arbitrations, they all went before the same arbitrator. 


Could the arbitrator have entered an order saying, I think


it would be efficient to have all these cases tried


together, so I'm going to enter an order requiring you to


do so?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- I think if the parties all


agreed to have it resolved by the same arbitrator --


QUESTION:  Well, supposing the -- supposing


Green Tree objects.  Could he nevertheless do it?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  I think in that situation


what you're then doing is depriving us of our right under


those agreements to choose our own arbitrator.


QUESTION:  Oh, but here -- here the South


Carolina arbitrator, which you -- you certainly consented


to his appointment, went ahead and did pretty much this.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --


QUESTION:  Not -- not as sweeping --


MR. PHILLIPS:  This in a vengeance, I will say,


Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Well, but what is your -- what is


your principle objection to Justice Stevens' hypothetical


where the arbitrator simply says, I've got 15 of these and


I'm going to just try them together?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- I have a substantial --


substantially less of an objection to that kind of a


procedure because it doesn't adjudicate unnamed parties'


rights, or purport to adjudicate those rights.  At least


you have a real dispute that already exists --


QUESTION:  But --


MR. PHILLIPS: 


-- which can justify in some 

sense consolidation.  I still think you have to respect


Green Tree's right --


QUESTION:  But then -- but you say your -- your


objection would have been cured if the arbitrator had


written a letter to every plaintiff and gotten an -- a


written okay, that would have made it okay?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, because the -- the


arbitration process requires the filing of claims and


going through it.


QUESTION:  Well then, what's the difference

between that and my 15-individual case?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Because we don't know whether


there is, in fact, a dispute between the parties in the


absence of some effort by the plaintiffs to come forward.


QUESTION:  Well, they know there's a common


issue in all these cases -- I mean, they -- they all had


the same legal issue involved, didn't they?


MR. PHILLIPS:  But -- but it -- just because you


may have a right doesn't mean you necessarily care to


assert your right.  Again, it's -- it's easy to look at


this case and say, well, gee, there's an opportunity to


pick up $5,000 in windfall, or $7,500 in windfall, but you


know, an arbitrator could just as easily have rendered a


decision here that said, this is a pure technicality, it's


entitled to $1 in nominal damages, and the class-wide 

relief ought to be $1,900, and attorney's fees ought to be


a third of that, which is $600 --


QUESTION:  And -- and --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and I guarantee you they would


not be willing or prepared to -- I'm sorry, Justice


Kennedy.


QUESTION:  Please, finish your answer.


MR. PHILLIPS:  They would not be prepared to


abide by that.  Every one of the unnamed members would


say, I never had an opportunity to -- to participate in

the selection of the arbitrator who has resolved my


substantial rights.  There's no basis at all to bind me


under these circumstances, and I'm going to show up and


make a claim.


QUESTION:  Well, the obvious solution to that


would be to read into their contract the idea that they


had agreed to that situation provided they're fairly


represented, et cetera, and if they don't like the result,


they can arbitrate that, too.


MR. PHILLIPS:  But see, Justice Breyer, we -- we


keep making up more and more and more, and none of this


is -- is at all linked to any kind of consent among any of


these parties.


QUESTION:  I want to ask about consent.  At what


point and how did you first object to the class action? 

Did -- did you instruct the arbitrator that we consented


to your appointment for individuals A, B, and C, but not


for other --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  We -- we do not consent.


MR. PHILLIPS:  We do not consent to that.


QUESTION:  And when did you do that?

 QUESTION:  -- the idea of class action.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, and the South Carolina


Supreme Court specifically addressed the question of


waiver and found that we never waived our right with


respect to that.


QUESTION:  But you did select the arbitrator. 


It was your arbitrator.


MR. PHILLIPS:  It was our arbitrator with


respect to the dispute with the Bazzles and the Lackeys


and the Buggses, to be sure, but we did not agree to an


arbitrator to resolve any disputes involving unnamed third


parties --


QUESTION:  Well, it leaves this open, and I


mean, I agree with you that it is -- whether you did --


whether this or is not the proper interpretation of what 

the parties intended is certainly disputable, and if it's


disputable, why shouldn't the arbitrator decide that?


MR. PHILLIPS:  See, I don't think it is disputed


what the parties -- what the parties intended, Justice


Breyer.


QUESTION:  Well -- well, wait.  You -- I'm going


to hear in about 10 minutes or so a pretty good argument


the other side, too --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Except that --


QUESTION:  -- so that my question is, where you

have a contract that says, interpretations of the


contractor should be arbitrated, and where, in fact, what


we're arguing about today is how one part of the contract


should be interpreted, how did we get here?  Why wasn't


that referred to the arbitrator?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Because the question of whether


the arbitrator has the authority to resolve the rights of


unnamed third parties is not a question for the arbitrator


to decide.  That's a question for the court to decide.


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Because it goes --


QUESTION:  I would have thought the meaning of


a --


MR. PHILLIPS:  It goes to the core of the


arbitrator's jurisdiction and authority to decide. 

QUESTION:  No, but wait.  There is a case,


including one I just wrote, I think, for the Court which


makes very clear that what you send to the arbitrator -- I


mean, there are dozens of cases where you have a phrase in


a contract, and that's in dispute, and the parties have


agreed we send disputes about the meaning of the contract


to arbitration, you send that to the arbitrator.


I mean, the only things that you don't are


whether there's the arbitration contract is itself valid,


et cetera.

question of whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction --

MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and authority to decide the


rights of a party, that is a question for the court to


decide --


QUESTION:  Okay, is there any -- is there any --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- not for the arbitrator.


QUESTION:  Is there any case you could cite -- I


mean, I read most of them when I -- when I wrote the


opinion in the Howsam case.  I don't think you can think


of one.


MR. PHILLIPS:  But Howsam dealt with the


specific problem of the procedures to be followed with


respect to a bilateral --


QUESTION:  Oh, are we talking about that here?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, we're not talking about the


procedures to be followed in a bilateral agreement.  We're


talking about what you have to do --


QUESTION:  Well, I --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- to resolve the rights of third


parties who are not signatories --


QUESTION:  Why should --


QUESTION:  At least as to the other contracts --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.

QUESTION:  -- if not as to yours.  Yours, you --


you agree to the arbitrator and whatnot, but -- but

MR. PHILLIPS:  And anything the arbitrator did


to us --


QUESTION:  I'm sorry, I don't understand the


meaning of when you say it's a jurisdictional issue, when


you agree to somebody else's statement it's a


jurisdictional issue.  What I have in front of me is a


contract. 


It says, in this phrase, disputes will be 

arbitrated, there is a question, what does that mean, that


word arbitration in this contract, and then I know that


the parties have agreed to arbitrate the meaning of the


dispute, all right -- of any phrase --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but --


QUESTION:  -- including that one.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

court, was my question?

the contract says that -- that it binds us and you, and us


and you are defined as Green Tree and the -- and the


specific named participants in this proceeding.  It


doesn't say word one about the rights of all of the other


individuals in this --


QUESTION:  But the other individuals --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and the South Carolina -- I'm


sorry.


QUESTION:  The other individuals are not here


complaining.  I mean, they're probably glad they got


the 7,000 bucks --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, they're not here complaining


today, but Mr. Chief Justice, you're going to have to


resolve the question of whether or not you can interpret


an arbitration agreement in a way that allows these kinds 

of proceedings for the -- for the generality of cases, and


what do we --


QUESTION:  If you're concerned about the third


parties, how does it differ from a court-declared class


action where the safeguards are the class members have


notice, and there's a notice here that is clearer than


most notices, and if they're -- if they say that they were


inadequately represented, they could collateral attack on


that basis.  Why should those States' laws be any


different in an arbitral forum than in a court forum?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, if you were going to allow


a class action in an arbitral forum you would certainly


want those -- those protections to be built in.  My point


is, is that the way you get those kinds of protections to


exist in the ordinary class action is because the State


coerces the litigation.  The ordinary rule is that you


cannot represent third parties, and the court has


identified as a matter of its power situations in which


it's going to embrace that approach, but that doesn't get


you past the contract problem.


QUESTION:  But the court can't do it as it --


the Federal rules have a class action provision --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- and the Federal rules can't affect


substantive rights, only procedure, so the class action 

device, classes are certified every day in -- in Federal


court --


MR. PHILLIPS:  But --


QUESTION:  -- and they're not changing the


substance of any contract that they're declaring in a


contract setting, a class action.


MR. PHILLIPS:  The -- the difference there,


Justice Ginsburg, is that here we're talking about a


situation where the full authority of the arbitrator is


defined by the consent of the specific parties to the

I -- I'm still having trouble getting over this.  Isn't

ago is -- is really not accurate, I don't think.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I apologize --


QUESTION:  They don't consent to every jot and


tittle of the means by which the arbitration will be


conducted.


They consent in a gross kind of way to


arbitration or nonarbitration, and -- and that's -- that's


what their consent makes the difference between, but they


don't consent to every consequent detail that enters into

the actual conduct of the arbitration, so why should we


draw the line where you want us to draw the line as


opposed to drawing the line a little further and saying,


if you consent to arbitration and a State says, not


inconsistently with the FAA, arbitration can be done on a


class basis if there are common issues and so on?  Why


should we draw the line to exclude that?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there are two answers to


that.  The premise of it, which is that the FAA doesn't


have anything to say about this, but the core principle of


the FAA is that there is supposed to be consent of the


parties, so we ought to be looking to the expectations of


the parties to determine what rights you're going to


adjudicate as a matter of arbitration.


QUESTION: 


You're -- you're saying, this is so 

far from anything that would have been contemplated --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- as a detail to be filled in later,


and that's why you draw the line --


MR. PHILLIPS:  That's -- that is exactly right,


Justice Souter, and if you look at the South Carolina


Supreme Court's opinion it doesn't talk about anything


that has to do with consent.  It talks about equity and


fairness and judicial economy, all factors that influence


the rights of third parties who have nothing to do with

the arbitration agreement that's before the arbitrator.


QUESTION:  I thought the South Carolina Supreme


Court said there's a -- there's a silence in this contract


and we're going to construe it against the drafter.  You


concede that you could have arbitration in a class format,


and so that South Carolina said it doesn't -- this


contract doesn't say one way or the other and we'll


construe it against the drafter.


MR. PHILLIPS:  The -- but what the South


Carolina Supreme Court said was, we're going to promote


judicial economy and we're going to do it without a


contractual directive to do so.


To be sure, the court said we -- we do not find


language so clear here -- because you know, what they're


basically worried about is, does this absolutely prohibit 

the possibility of class arbitration.  Is there language


in there that says, under no circumstances will we ever


have class arbitration.  I would have read the -- this


agreement to have actually said that, but they didn't say


that.


What they said is, well, we think it's -- we


think it's ambiguous, and therefore we'll construe it


against you, but all that gets you to the point is that


the contract says nothing about this, and the problem with


trying to square that with the FAA is that the animus for,

to --


QUESTION:  But it -- but it is true, is it not,


that everybody in the class has consented to an


arbitration with Green Tree --


MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  No.


QUESTION:  Not to a class action arbitration, 


but to an arbitration.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, has -- well, has


consented -- yes, has signed an arbitration agreement --


QUESTION:  But not with these arbitrators.

that's correct.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T.L. PILLARD


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MS. PILLARD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Green Tree first protested by asking the


arbitrator to decide whether the case could go forward as


a class.  They did not object to his power to decide, but


they asked him to decide and I -- I think the relevant


document is on page 15 of the joint appendix, which is


Green Tree's memorandum to the arbitrator.


There is nothing in the FAA that preempts a


State court or arbitrator from applying ordinary State

contract law, the doctrine of construction against the


drafter, to read a contract to authorize class


arbitration.  As a legal matter, the consent of the


parties is determined under State contract law by applying


the doctrines of contract law to resolve ambiguities where


they exist.


QUESTION:  What doctrine of state contract law


led you -- led to this result, the doctrine of construe


the instrument against, contra proferentem against the


person who drafted it?


MS. PILLARD:  That's exactly right, Justice


Scalia.


QUESTION:  Now, can -- can that produce


anything?  I mean, suppose one side claims the contract


says nothing about it, but one side claims, you should pay 

all the costs of the arbitrator, all right.  Is -- is a


State court going to decide that question by simply


saying, well, the contract says nothing about it, but to


do it that way would be against the interests of the


drafter, so yes, it's in the contract?


MS. PILLARD:  The --


QUESTION:  And my next question is going to be,


what if the other side comes in and says, you ought to pay


me $10 million, and the other side says, gee, there's


nothing in the contract about that.

QUESTION:  Can the State court say, well, it's

so it must be there in the contract?


I mean, that seems -- this seems to me just as


weird --


MS. PILLARD:  You apply --


QUESTION:  -- to -- to pluck out a right to a


class action for no other reason than that it is against


the interests of the person who drafted the contract. 


It's weird.


MS. PILLARD:  Justice Scalia, the -- the


argument is that the arbitrator has the authority under


State law to interpret the ambiguity in the contract, and


it's not weird at all in this case, where, since 1979 in 

South Carolina, arbitrators have had the authority to


consolidate arbitrations, and the leading cases, Champ,


the case on which Green Tree relies, Episcopal Housing,


which is the First Circuit case, the -- the cases that


look at whether this is allowed, advert to -- I'm sorry,


Episcopal Housing was itself a consolidation case, but the


cases that allow class arbitration advert to the


underlying rule in the jurisdiction --


QUESTION:  There's a big difference --


QUESTION:  What are consolidation arbitration --

what do you mean by that?  You mean when the same


arbitrator has more than one case involving the same


issue?


MS. PILLARD:  The same arbitrator can take


different disputes under arbitration clauses and bring


them together where --


QUESTION:  When he's been selected for the


various issues.  I mean he -- he's been selected in -- in


all of the various cases.  The parties have agreed to this


arbitrator.  They just haven't agreed to have them all


decided in one proceeding, is that right?


MS. PILLARD:  That's right.  They're all -- but,


that's one of the versions --


QUESTION:  But that -- that's a long -- that's a


long way off from compelling somebody who hasn't agreed to 

this arbitration.


MS. PILLARD:  It -- it's not at all.  First of


all, I disagree with the premise of your question, Justice


Scalia, that they haven't agreed to this.  Where the


contract permits it, what Green Tree and the -- the class


members, absent and named class members agreed to was a


contract with the potential for a class proceeding, with


the potential for a class proceeding.


This -- under the Southland cases, since --


since 20 years ago cases have been going forward --

 QUESTION:  That begs the question.  I mean, that

MS. PILLARD:  They --


QUESTION:  -- that's what we're debating,


whether they -- whether they agreed to that or not, and to


say that they agreed to it because they agreed to it


doesn't get us very far.


MS. PILLARD:  This is an FAA preemption case,


but the FAA has nothing to say here.  The act doesn't say


anything about class arbitration, and the FAA ousts only


State law that is hostile to arbitration.


QUESTION:  All right, well, why isn't this


hostile?  It seems to me that is the question.


MS. PILLARD:  It's not hostile --


QUESTION: 


Well, wait, let me give you an 

example.  You would agree that the State couldn't


interpret silence as follows.  The word arbitration in


this contract, since it's silent, means that the


arbitration will take place at the bottom of a coal mine


with no air, okay.  We agree, right?


MS. PILLARD:  Right.


QUESTION:  All right, and what the other side


has said is, you know, in respect to one of the parties,


this is the same thing.  Of course my client would never


have agreed to arbitration if he knew that a class action

lawyer could find a provision in the contract that nobody


thinks really hurt them but, in fact, we didn't live up


to, and then obtain $10 million in a judgment before an


arbitrator, of which he gets three and the rest is


distributed.


Now, look, that's what we were trying to get


away from.  That's why we went to arbitration and not the


court.  Of course we wouldn't agree to such a thing, and


of course reading such a thing into the silence is the


same as putting us at the bottom of that coal mine, or at


least close enough so you cannot say that it is neutral as


to whether or not arbitration is good or bad or likely to


occur, or Volt was neutral or pro-arbitration.  This State


rule is not neutral, it is hostile to it.


Now, that's basically their argument, as I 

understand it, and I'd like to hear the reply.


MS. PILLARD:  I think, Justice Breyer, that


misapprehends what we mean by hostile to arbitration. 


Hostility to arbitration refers to State rules that are


suspicious of or undermine the ability of an arbitral


forum to resolve a dispute, and saying that a case is


going to proceed on a class basis is a far cry from saying


this case is going to proceed at the bottom of a coal


mine, where parties' rights would actually be -- would not


be able to be fulfilled.  That's the outside edge.  This

Court has -- has always said, well, arbitration can't go


forward if the parties can't get meaningful relief, and --


and I think your coal mine case would be such a case.


But what we mean by hostile to arbitration is


not whether one or the other party to the arbitration


wishes that they, in the end, once the dispute arises,


that they weren't before an arbitrator.  No.  What we mean


is, whether State law reflects a suspicion about the


capacity of arbitration to resolve a dispute, and if


anybody --


QUESTION:  Could they -- could they then have a


State law that says, and the party that invokes the


arbitration in the contract will receive from the other


party a bonus of about $100,000 for having done a good


thing? 


See, that's equally ridiculous as to my example in 

the coal mine, and all I've done is make sure that the


arbitration -- it's not -- it's not -- you see, it


satisfies your test.


MS. PILLARD:  I -- I don't think it does,


because it's -- well, because it's -- it's targeted at the


arbitration, and if the State had such a rule one could


look at, what's the purpose, what's the legitimate purpose


of that rule --


QUESTION:  They love arbitration.  Oh, but


forget my ridiculous example.  Go ahead with your -- with

your -- with your explanation.


MS. PILLARD:  It seems the -- well, that is --


is the focus.  The focus has to be whether the State law,


not looking at ex post, once the parties are -- are


unhappy with the broadly worded contract --


QUESTION:  Okay, I've got that.  Then do you


think -- the other question that's bothering me -- that


was one, and there's one other, is that we have the words


in the contract here, and the words are, the dispute, any


claim, including what the contract means, or the validity


of the arbitration clause, et cetera, shall be resolved by


binding arbitration, by one arbitrator, selected by us,


with consent of you, okay.


MS. PILLARD:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That's the phrase.


MS. PILLARD:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Now, there obviously is a


disagreement as to the meaning of that phrase.  Well, why


shouldn't that be arbitrated?


MS. PILLARD:  Exactly, and it was.


QUESTION:  All right.  Then what we should do in


this case is say, forget what the North Carolina Supreme


Court says --


QUESTION:  South Carolina.


QUESTION:  South Carolina, sorry.  I got it

right the first time -- South Carolina Supreme Court. 


Forget what they say.  The question is, what did the


parties mean, and therefore send it back to the arbitrator


for that determination, not influenced by the South


Carolina opinion in front of us.  Now, is that the correct


resolution, then?


MS. PILLARD:  No, Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  Because?


MS. PILLARD:  Because the arbitrator already did


look at this clause and decided that the -- that the


language of the arbitration agreement allowed him to


decide.


QUESTION:  I thought the first case was a case


where the South Carolina Supreme Court, Bazzle or one of


them was -- the South Carolina Supreme Court said what it 

meant, not the arbitrator.  The second case, which was in


front of the arbitrator, was the arbitrator being


influenced by what the South Carolina Supreme Court had


said.


MS. PILLARD:  The -- the Bazzle case did not go


up to the South Carolina Supreme Court before --


QUESTION:  Then it's the other, it's Lackey the


Supreme Court --


MS. PILLARD:  The cases came up to the Supreme


Court together --

 QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. PILLARD:  -- after both decisions were made,


and as an initial matter the Bazzle case went to the trial


court, which decided as an initial matter that the -- in


the Lackey case the -- the arbitrator made the decision as


an initial matter, looking at the language of the contract


and determining, without any prior judicial instruction on


the matter --


QUESTION:  Not an instruction, but -- but was he


not guided or influenced in some way by the Supreme Court


decision?


MS. PILLARD:  Green Tree tries for the first


time in this Court to dispute that the arbitrator in


Lackey made an independent decision --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. PILLARD:  -- that the contract authorized


class arbitration.  That argument is a complete red


herring.  Their own brief to the South Carolina Supreme


Court repeatedly asserted that in Lackey the arbitrator,


quote, took it upon himself to determine the propriety of


a class-wide arbitration and certify a class.  That's at


page 29 of their South Carolina Supreme Court brief.  They


say again and again -- their question presented refers to


the arbitrator deciding the class action issue himself. 


That's question presented 2 --

 QUESTION:  That was in -- that was in Lackey. 


In Bazzle, did the arbitrator, after the, what I'll call


referral from the State trial court, did the arbitrator


then say, as an -- as an independent matter, I ratify, I


confirm, I -- I agree that the contract should be


interpreted this way, or does it -- or did he just say, I


am following the order of the court?


MS. PILLARD:  We don't have either precisely,


but let me tell you what I think is relevant to that.  The


arbitrator in Bazzle did also consider the issue.  The


issue was placed squarely before the arbitrator when Green


Tree moved him to decertify the class to grant that Green


Tree did fight this, a --


QUESTION:  Wait, wait, wait.  Why -- why -- what


issue was placed before him when they moved to decertify 

him?


MS. PILLARD:  They moved to decertify --


QUESTION:  The issue of whether he would be


in -- in violation of the order of the South Carolina


Supreme Court?


MS. PILLARD:  There was no order of the South


Carolina Supreme Court at that time.


QUESTION:  No.


MS. PILLARD:  There was only the order of the


trial court, which read the contract to allow class

arbitration.  Then it -- the class was certified and sent


to the arbitrator, and then the issue was before the


arbitrator should he decertify the class, and Green Tree


argued that -- that they should.


Moreover, in Green Tree's motion to vacate the


award, after the arbitrator in Bazzle made the arbitration


award, they characterized the arbitrator as having made


the decision that the class could proceed in arbitration.


QUESTION:  I'm sure they did, so -- but my


impression is they appointed in Bazzle, the district court


appointed a class, or certified it.


MS. PILLARD:  Certified a class.


QUESTION:  All right, it was after that that


they go to the arbitrator in Lackey, and now what they're


telling us is, the arbitrator in Lackey, knowing that the 

district court had appointed the class in Bazzle, then


appointed the class in Lackey, and what they say, I take


it, is well, that's not independent, he just thought


that's what he's supposed to do.


MS. PILLARD:  Right, and -- and I very much


disagree with that characterization of the record, and


I'll try to help to make it clearer.


First, as I pointed out, in their own briefs in


the South Carolina Supreme Court, they characterized the


Lackey arbitrator as having acted independently.  There is

no -- no record support for Green Tree's current


assertions that the arbitrator did not make an independent


decision.  There is nothing in the record that supports


it, and it is not the case.


The arbitrator said that he determined that a


class action should proceed based on his careful review of


the broadly drafted arbitration clause prepared by Green


Tree.  That's --


QUESTION:  Is there any history, Ms. Pillard, of


this in South Carolina, or is this the first time?  Have


there been class proceedings before arbitrators in the


past?


MS. PILLARD:  I'm not aware that there are,


Justice Ginsburg.  I'm not aware of any reported decisions


on that. 


There have been class arbitrations in -- in 

the -- one of the largest economies in the world for --


for 20 years, and there have been a smattering of class


arbitrations in other places, and I -- I --


QUESTION:  Ms. Pillard, when -- when a class


action is instituted, it seems to me it amounts to an


interpretation not just of -- of these contracts that were


in front of this arbitrator, but also of the other


contracts that have been brought into this arbitration,


and what I find it difficult to see is how any


interpretation of one of those other contracts would --

would allow them to be brought into this from the


standpoint not of this company -- this company at least


selected this arbitrator for these cases, and you could


say, well, they didn't select him for the other cases,


which may be a good point, but let's talk about the


customers, the plaintiffs.


They didn't select this arbitrator for any case,


not even -- not even for their own case.  They have had


foisted upon them not some Federal district judge who has,


you know, the -- the army behind him, but -- but some


arbitrator that, you know -- who knows who, that they --


they never selected at all.  How can you possibly draw


them into this -- how can you possibly say that that


contract is reasonably interpreted to allow them to be


brought into this -- into this arbitration?


MS. PILLARD:  I have two answers to that,


Justice Scalia.  First, there's no question that if, under


a contract that had a forum selection clause that said,


any disputes under this contract will be resolved in a


forum chosen by us with the consent of you, and a


plaintiff chose a forum and filed a class action and


offered opt-out rights to every absent class member who


wanted to opt out, and those absent class members were


bound by the same contract, their right to consent to the


forum would be protected.

 QUESTION:  But that's deceptive.  They -- they


are summoned in by the power of the Government, not by --


not by their -- their contractual commitment to be


summoned in.  Even if there were no contract they could be


made part of a class action, so to say that you can do it


when the Government is coercing it, and therefore it's a


perfectly reasonable interpretation of a contract, doesn't


make sense to me.


MS. PILLARD:  I --


QUESTION:  Here, the only basis for getting --


for getting these plaintiffs into this court, or into this


arbitral court is their voluntary agreement, and their


voluntary agreement gave them the right to select an


arbitrator, and they have been deprived of that right


entirely.


MS. PILLARD:  I agree with you, Justice Scalia,


up to your last sentence.  They have not been deprived of


that right.  It is exactly true that the authority of the


arbitrator over the absent class members derives from


contract, and every single absent class member was a -- a


signatory to the -- to the same arbitration clause.  They


were all governed by the same clause, and once --


QUESTION:  But -- but Green Tree didn't appoint


the arbitrator for that purpose.  Green Tree appointed the


arbitrator for X, Y, and Z.

 MS. PILLARD:  Green Tree wrote a clause that --


it swept everything within it.  They said, we trust


everything to the arbitrator.  This clause is extremely


broad.  Once they did that -- they drafted a clause which


the arbitrator and every South Carolina judge to look at


it believed was susceptible of a reading that had


authorized class action.  In that case, you read this


contract as if it had provided for class arbitration, and


when they select --


QUESTION:  Wait, wait --


QUESTION:  Could the -- could the arbitrator


have said, I'm -- I'm going to include in -- in this class


some people who don't have an arbitration contract at all?


MS. PILLARD:  I would think not, no, and indeed,


those people were excluded in this case.


QUESTION:  And -- and why is that?


MS. PILLARD:  Because they have --


QUESTION:  Because the -- Green Tree did not


consent to that.


MS. PILLARD:  Because they have no -- the


arbitrator has no authority over them, because neither


they nor Green Tree consented to that, but by hypothesis,


if you had a clause --


QUESTION:  The hypothesis is, the consent must


be bilateral, and here it wasn't.

 MS. PILLARD:  Oh, I disagree.  The consent was


bilateral.  Green Tree chose an arbitrator, and when it


chose an arbitrator for a case under a contract broad


enough to authorize class action, legally it has chosen an


arbitrator with the possibility that the class could


proceed.  Indeed, when they chose --


QUESTION:  All right, but what --


MS. PILLARD:  -- the arbitrator, the case had


already been filed as a class action.  It was -- they were


on notice --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. PILLARD:  -- of the possibility that this


issue would be litigated on a class basis.


QUESTION:  Well, they were on notice that


somebody wanted a class action, but it seems to me, 

number 1, they were not on notice that South Carolina law


would provide a -- a class arbitration because, as you


said, it hadn't occurred before, and the only thing that


they definitely consented to was an arbitrator for this


case, and in a situation in which there was no existing


State law that put them on notice that they were in


jeopardy of this result, they're saying there are some


things we -- I think they're saying there are some things


we -- we agree that have to be filled in later about the


terms of the arbitration.

 But with no history to indicate that the request


for class -- or class treatment would be granted and would


be possible under South Carolina law, we surely did not


consent, we certainly did not take the risk that we


consented, that we were consenting to arbitration for all


of these other people, and if you doubt that, Mr. Phillips


says, just step back and -- and bear this in mind. 


Without judicial review, would we have rolled the dice for


$27 million on one arbitrator?  What is -- what is your


answer to that, that it, in effect, it is just too


implausible to draw this conclusion out of the limited


consent that they gave?


MS. PILLARD:  I have several answers to that,


Justice Souter.  First of all, this Court has never said


that a case with a large amount of money at stake, indeed 

in Mitsubishi Motors with antitrust cases, in McMahon with


RICOs -- RICO and securities cases, large amounts of money


at stake, arbitration is permitted.  They --


QUESTION:  Oh, no question about it.  It's a


question of what they plausibly consented to.


MS. PILLARD:  Right.


QUESTION:  That's the point of his argument.


MS. PILLARD:  Right.  They were -- they were on


notice.  If they had good lawyers doing this, they would


have a long time before 1998 put in the simple one phrase

that they put into their contract as of 1998 which says,


nobody who signs this can be a class member or a class


representative.


QUESTION:  Well, if they had been in California


they would have done that, but were -- were, you know,


were they on notice that they had better guard against


that jeopardy in South Carolina?


MS. PILLARD:  Yes.  I think in -- in particular,


the Episcopal Housing case put them on notice as of 1979


there were consolidations being permitted, and the courts


who were looking at the class question, the Champ court --


QUESTION:  Consolidations aren't class actions. 


I mean, those are quite different.


MS. PILLARD:  I agree with you, Justice Scalia,


but the fact of the matter is, the courts that have 

decided whether or not to authorize class arbitration in


an appropriate case have looked as an analogy to the


consolidation precedent, so you have a jurisdiction in


which there is consolidation precedent, and parties, when


they agree to contracts in ambiguous terms, agree to


submit to the natural evolution of State law, and that


is -- that does on occasion present risks.  That does


present risks, but they chose both to draft a clause very


broadly and to submit everything to the arbitrator.


QUESTION:  Well, they're saying this isn't

natural evolution, this is creationism, and --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- don't -- don't they have a --


don't they have a point that there is a distinction when


the difference gets to be that great?


MS. PILLARD:  No, and I -- and I certainly don't


think that is a preemption question for this Court.  I


certainly don't think so.


QUESTION:  No, no, but it says the terms have to


be -- I mean, it doesn't -- it says in the statute you


have to enforce the arbitration that they wrote, and


here -- now, it is -- this point is bothering me, because


I'm not sure what your answer to this was.  I do see the


phrase, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, by one


arbitrator selected by us, with consent of you. 

Now, the opt-out can be, consent of you.  I get


that.  If they don't opt out, they consent, but what about


the phrase, by one arbitrator selected by us?  We've come


around, we've been talking about that nonstop, but I -- I


don't have a clear answer to that, because what seems


absolutely clear in the case of Justice Scalia and me, and


he's never been in this courtroom, or in the arbitrator


room or anywhere, you know, I didn't select that


arbitrator.  I selected you for a different case.


Now -- now, how do we -- how do we square that

with the words, an arbitrator selected by me, if I'm Green


Tree?


MS. PILLARD:  Because -- two reasons.  One is


that this was filed as a class action, so when they


selected the arbitrator they were on notice that at least


the plaintiffs were trying to do this.  The second --


QUESTION:  So if they said right at that point


we don't want this as a class action, then they win?


MS. PILLARD:  No.


QUESTION:  No, okay.


MS. PILLARD:  The second answer is that the


contract was written in such a way as to be susceptible of


permitting class arbitration, so when they select an


arbitrator under this contract, they take into account,


this could be an arbitrator that could award punitive 

damages.  This could be an arbitrator that could proceed


on a class basis.  This could be an arbitrator who could


order --


QUESTION:  All right, I see, but --


MS. PILLARD:  -- broad discovery.


QUESTION:  If they had had a --


MS. PILLARD:  This could be an arbitrator who


could do any of the things the contract permits.


QUESTION:  If they had had enough foresight,


could they have told the arbitrator, we are selecting you,

but for this suit only.  You may not have a class action. 


We are not consenting.  Could they have said that up


front?


MS. PILLARD:  I don't think so.  I don't think


so, because the -- the language of the contract and the


authority that they have given to arbitrators is


determined from the contract language, not from the


parties' choices at the threshold where a particular


dispute has already arisen.


QUESTION:  I -- I notice the -- none -- none of


your answers to these questions, including -- you had


several answers for Justice Souter.  None of your answers


said, well, you know, that's a very interesting theory,


Mr. Justice, but this is a State law matter, it's not for


you.  I -- I haven't heard that.


MS. PILLARD:  Well, I -- I intended to give --


to give that answer when I said this is not a preemption


question.  It is not an FAA question.  It is a State law


question, and I think that's exactly right, Justice


Kennedy, the narrow scope of FAA preemption focuses on


whether State law is hostile to the arbitration forum, to


the choice of arbitral forum to resolve ambiguities like


these.  There is --


QUESTION:  Suppose a -- suppose the State law


said, not only do we interpret silence to mean you can

have it in a class format, but that if any arbitration


clause -- any arbitration contract excludes class action


we will hold that against our public policy and


unenforceable?


MS. PILLARD:  One would have to look at the


reasoning of the State court in so holding.  If the


reasoning was hostility to arbitration, trying to trade it


up --


QUESTION:  Well, the -- the Supreme Court would


explain, we love arbitration, that's why we're not going


to let anybody make it a smaller arbitration, so that's --


so we're not being hostile to arbitration.


MS. PILLARD:  That is, as the South Carolina


Supreme Court made clear, not the issue in this case.  If


it were an application of general contract principles of 

unconscionability in a particular case with no suspicion


of arbitration as such, then I think a State could do that


under State law.


If the State had a general law that applied to


litigation and arbitration against class action waivers,


or against waivers of class actions in adhesive contracts


that applied to both fora, to the litigation and to the


arbitration, I think under that circumstance also it would


not be hostile to arbitration for the State law to


override the parties' choice --

 QUESTION:  What's your authority that -- that it


has to be -- you -- you seem to -- to be positing some


kind of a -- of an intent requirement on the part of the


State.  It has to really have it in for arbitration.


Why isn't the Federal Arbitration Act more


reasonably interpreted as directed at those State laws


that -- that are destructive of arbitration, that -- that


are -- are hostile not in the sense of any -- of any


mental intent, but that in their operation make it


difficult for parties to enter into arbitration


agreements, and if that's what it means, a law that


interprets a -- an arbitration agreement fantastically,


you know, down at the bottom of the coal mine, or, you


know, you -- you have to pay so many million dollars win


or lose, or, I think, you -- you have to subject yourself 

to -- to class actions, is a law that is hostile to


arbitration, that is -- it is -- it is antagonistic to the


ability of parties to decide between themselves how, when,


and where and to what extent they will have an arbitrator


decide matters for them?


MS. PILLARD:  Justice Scalia, parties have an


ability to do that, and anyone who wants to put in a


clause saying, no class arbitration, is invited to do


that.  This Court has never interpreted hostility to


arbitration that broadly, as you just described.  What

this Court has said again and again is that the FAA


preempts only State laws that single out arbitration


provisions for suspect status that undercut the


enforceability of arbitration agreements.


Here, the arbitration agreement was enforced,


and there is no FAA rule, contrary to Green Tree's


contentions, that all arbitration agreements should be


enforced according to their written terms without the


benefit of State rules for resolving contract ambiguity.


Rather, as the Court reiterated in Waffle House,


absent some ambiguity in the agreement, it is the language


of the contract that defines the scope of disputes subject


to arbitration.  This Court has repeatedly made clear that


it is State contract law that applies, and it is State


contract law that resolves any contract ambiguity. 

Green Tree is seeking a radical expansion of FAA


preemption.  Their rule would federalize countless


disputes over the meaning of arbitration clauses.  Parties


to arbitration will come and say, we never intended to --


to permit discovery, protective orders, various types of


motions, types of damages and the like that would invite


any party unhappy with the results of an arbitration,


saying we're getting into more than we thought, this is


hostile to arbitration as we prefer, to come to this Court


and ask it to second-guess ordinary State law

interpretation of an arbitration agreement.


This Court should not expand the scope of FAA


preemption in this case.  There's no warrant for it here.


QUESTION:  May I ask this, if you have another


moment:  Does this case have any real future significance,


because isn't it fairly clear that all the arbitration


agreements in the future will prohibit class actions?


MS. PILLARD:  It's really very limited, Justice


Stevens, I agree.  This case deals with whether this


particular agreement foreclosed class arbitration.  Green


Tree agrees that where an agreement authorizes it, class


arbitration can be done, and so all they're asking you to


do is to second-guess the State court's interpretation


applying the rule of construction against the drafter, and


I would very much dispute their characterization of what 

the South Carolina Supreme Court did of applying a -- a


rule without any contractual or statutory directive to do


so.


The court was there quoting from a different


case, and this case is a fortiori.  Clearly, the court


looked and said, there's no specific directive.  As a


preliminary matter, the court said, the contract is


silent.  Then they looked at the more general language the


trial court had relied on and said, there's affirmative


authorization here under the general language, and they

looked at Green Tree's argument that the reference to this


contract foreclosed it, and the South Carolina Supreme


Court said, I find it ambiguous, and I'm going to apply


the ordinary rule of --


QUESTION:  Is there a risk that if we just did


what you said, they write in no class actions, a court


says this is a contract of adhesion, and that provision's


oppressive, and so we strike it?


MS. PILLARD:  It depends on why they think it's


oppressive.  If they think that waivers generally in


contracts, pre-dispute agreements to waive the right to


proceed as a class, whether the contract is an arbitration


agreement or not are oppressive, then I think it might not


be hostile to arbitration.


If they say, a waiver of a class action in an 

arbitration setting is oppressive and unconstitutional,


that might run afoul of this Court's precedence in -- in


Casarotto.


QUESTION:  You really think that they could


allow a waiver of judicial review and disallow a waiver of


class actions?  That would -- that would boggle my mind. 


And you think that wouldn't display hostility?


MS. PILLARD:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Pillard.


Mr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


Justice Kennedy, in response to your question, I


don't know precisely the first time that we raised this


issue, but I know that if you look at the record on


decision at pages 152 and again at 1539, in both Bazzle


and in Lackey, we say point blank the arbitrator exceeded


his authority to proceed as a class action, and that


neither Green Tree nor any of the unnamed class members


consented to have the arbitrator arbitrate their claims,


so we said it as plainly as we could with respect to


the -- with respect to the notion of consent.


The specific -- aside from that, the South


Carolina Supreme Court said we didn't waive our rights, 

and it's quite clear that if we fight over these issues in


front of the arbitrator, we don't waive our rights.  That


was the holding of this Court in First Chicago.


Justice Breyer, with respect to whether or not


the arbitrator thought he exercised independent authority,


I think it's pretty clear that both parties in this case


have taken inconsistent positions.  If you read the


respondent's briefs below, they say that the arbitrator


had no authority to go beyond the class certification of


the decision that had already been made by the State

court.  Whether he did or not I say at the end of the day


doesn't matter, because I don't think it's a question for


the arbitrator, but if it is, he exceeded his authority,


because he clearly doesn't have the authority under this


contract to make a decision with respect to the third


parties.


That takes us to the question Justice Scalia


raised, which is, you know, what -- what do you do with


the fact that the South Carolina Supreme Court has said


not word one about arbitrator selected by me?  There's


nothing that interprets that language of this agreement,


and if the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't have at least


some component here to say, look, the terms of the


contract cannot be categorically ignored or disregarded by


the State court, those are rights that are there.  We said


as plainly as we could we would not consent to this, and


the court rejected it.


And the final point I would make with respect to


hostility, while it is true that this Court has


consistently struck down efforts to be hostile to


arbitration, it has never said that that's the only basis


on which preemption will arise.  Preemption in this


context exists in the same way it does in every other


context, does it interfere with the full achievement of


Congress' objections.  That's Hines v. Davidowitz, and the


58 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

answer to that here, and it's the same answer that would


arise if they were to -- if we had an agreement that said


class action has, that of course this is manifest


hostility to this arbitration agreement as written.  It's


a bilateral agreement, and all the South Carolina Supreme


Court had to say about that bilateral agreement is, it


would be judicially inefficient for us to have to go


through each one of these individually.


Well, that's all well and good, but that's


coercion, that's not consent, and if the Federal


Arbitration Act has any meaning, it means that you apply


the consent of the parties here, and if you do that, the


South Carolina Supreme Court has to be overturned.


Thank you, Your Honors.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: 


Thank you, 

Mr. Phillips.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
