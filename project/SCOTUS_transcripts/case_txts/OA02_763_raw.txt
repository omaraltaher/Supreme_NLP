CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-763, Jo Anne Barnhart v. Pauline Thomas.


Mr. Lamken.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. LAMKEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


As the Commissioner of Social Security has long


construed the disability insurance program, there can be


no finding of disability unless at least two conditions


are met.  First, the claimant's impairment must be of such


severity that she cannot -- she is unable to do her 

previous work.  Second, the impairments must be of such


severity that the claimant cannot, considering her age,


education, and experience, engage in any other kind of


substantial, gainful work which exists in the national


economy.


Construing and applying those provisions for


more than 3 decades, the commissioner has consistently


concluded that if a claimant continues to function at a


level sufficient to meet the demands of past work, then


the claimant is not disabled without the necessity of


inquiring into whether that particular past job exists in

significant numbers.  That's the most natural reading of


the statutory text.


QUESTION:  Mr. Lamken, this case, I think,


involves provisions of both title II and title XVI of the


act, and there are regulations under each.


MR. LAMKEN:  That is correct.  It is --


QUESTION:  Now, are there any relevant


differences in the text of the two statutes or the regs on


this issue?


MR. LAMKEN:  No, Your Honor.  We don't believe


that there are any relevant differences, that the


commissioner's regulations and the statutes themselves are


all phrased in parallel if not identical language


throughout.


There is one difference in that for a disability


insurance, these title II provisions, you have to be


someone who has paid into the program in order to be


eligible for benefits on the way out; whereas, title XVI


is more of a welfare program where whether you've paid in


in the past doesn't matter.  But that simply means that


one who has paid into the title II program would get


considerably more benefits than one who has not.


QUESTION:  But on the test.


MR. LAMKEN:  On the test, it is an identical


test.

 QUESTION:  There's no difference. 


MR. LAMKEN:  There is no test, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MR. LAMKEN:  That construction preserves the


distinction long recognized in the commissioner's


regulations, in fact, recognizing the commissioner's


regulations from the earliest days of administering this


statute.  Between disability insurance, on the one hand,


and insurance against other causes of unemployment, such


as technological and economic change, on the other, an


individual who's doing a job who remains fully capable of


doing that job, but then loses the job because of economic


change or perhaps the job never existed in significant


numbers and the individual chooses to leave, is not unable 

to engage in that activity by reason of an impairment,


which is the test under the statute for being entitled to


benefits. 


And it made sense for Congress to draw that line


because if someone continues to function at a level


sufficient to meet the demands of their previous work,


it's virtually certain that they're capable of doing some


work whether or not that particular past job exists in


significant numbers in the national economy.  The point


isn't that the person is expected to return to that


particular past job.  Rather, it is their continued

functioning at a level sufficient to meet the demands of


that job provides a highly accurate and administrable test


of the fact that they continue to function at a level


sufficient to meet the demands of work generally. 


In a program that must resolve more than 2


million claims a year, the need for that type of a highly


administrable test, that type of highly accurate test is


particularly acute.  And this is precisely the type of


test one would have expected Congress to provide.


A potentially large number of Americans today do


not work in jobs that exist in significant numbers in the


national economy.  When those workers leave their jobs,


whether they quit, are fired for misconduct, or leave for


other reasons which are good and sufficient, the court of 

appeals would preclude the commissioner from denying them


benefits based on their continued capacity to do that past


job even if that job is still available to them, even if


the employer is on the phone begging them to return to the


job.  The commissioner reasonably construed the statute as


not compelling that result.


If there are no questions, I will reserve the


remainder of my time for rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  I have a -- a question about the


consistency of the argument you're now making with the --


with the commissioner's regulation concerning you don't go

back more than 15 years.  That seems to be a recognition


that even if a person can do the job that he or she did 15


years ago, yet there's a likelihood that maybe that kind


of work isn't in abundant supply anymore.


MR. LAMKEN:  Justice O'Connor, the concern of


that 15-year --


QUESTION:  I'm Justice Ginsburg. 


MR. LAMKEN:  Oh, Justice Ginsburg. 


The concern of that regulation isn't whether or


not that particular past job exists in significant


numbers.  It provides an administrable and in fact


prophylactic test to make sure that the demands of that


job are demands that are ones that are likely to be


relevant in the national economy. 


It's unlikely that a 

set of demands of a job would completely disappear from


the economy entirely during any one person's lifetime.


But to make assurance doubly sure, to make


absolutely certain, the commissioner has set forth an


administrable bright line, 15-year rule that says if the


job is more than -- if you did the job more than 15 years


ago, we won't consider it out of that concern.  But it is


not a consideration of whether the particular past job


exists.  It's a consideration to make sure that your


continued ability to the demands of that job is an


appropriate and accurate measure of your ability -- your

level of functioning, and that your level of functioning


is consistent with work generally. 


If there are no further --


QUESTION:  May I ask this question just about


the facts of this case, Mr. Lamken?  When this applicant


suffered her physical impairment -- I forget just what it


was now -- she was able to go out and find a job as a -- a


-- an elevator operator.  Right?


MR. LAMKEN:  That's correct.  From -- if I


remember correctly, from 1988 to 1995, she worked as an


elevator operator.


QUESTION:  If the absence of elevator jobs had


occurred earlier and she hadn't been able to find this


job, she would clearly be disabled, wouldn't she? 

MR. LAMKEN:  No, Justice Stevens, I'm not sure


that she would be found disabled.  The commissioner would


have gone through the steps and -- and determined whether


or not she had a severe --


QUESTION:  She would have made the fifth step.


MR. LAMKEN:  If you were not to consider the --


the previous work of an elevator operator and you only


applied the fifth step, which is the other work step, in


isolation, that's correct, that she would have been found


not able to do other work in the national economy.  But


the fifth step is designed to work in conjunction with all

the other previous steps and, standing alone, does not


necessarily represent an accurate determination.


Congress provided two conditions that must be


met, previous work and other work, precisely because the


somewhat abstract inquiry into other work that plaintiff


has -- the claimant has never done may not be a fully


accurate or necessarily an easily administered mechanism


for determining the level of work that the claimant can


do.


QUESTION:  See, the thought that was running


through my mind, just to put it on the table, is that in a


sense perhaps the Government's position creates a


disincentive to look for other marginal jobs when you're


in this position. 


You might be better off just not to 

look.


MR. LAMKEN:  Justice Stevens, the commissioner's


rules actually take into account incentives to look for


work through the unsuccessful work attempt regulations. 


And so that is something that has been dealt with.  And


the same -- the same problem existed in the Walton case,


for example.  It is unfortunate that sometimes people, by


engaging in socially desirable conduct, going out and


working, will actually provide the evidence that shows


that they're capable of working, but that is just a


necessary consequence of a program that --

 QUESTION:  Capable of working in a disappearing


species of jobs.


MR. LAMKEN:  Well, Justice Stevens, the key


point about the court of appeals decision is not limited


to cases of job obsolescence.  It's any time somebody is


working in a job that may never have existed in


substantial numbers.  If they leave that job for whatever


reason, if they quit or are fired for misconduct, under


the court of appeals rule, the commissioner cannot deny


them benefits based on their demonstrated ability to do


that job.


QUESTION:  Suppose in Justice Stevens'


hypothetical the employer said, you know, you can operate


the elevator but it's just going to be going for 6 months. 

We're rehabbing the building and after that -- it's just a


6-month job.


MR. LAMKEN:  Right.


QUESTION:  Then -- then is she again barred


under step four?


MR. LAMKEN:  Justice Kennedy, that would -- it


would depend on whether or not that sort of a temporary


position would qualify as substantial, gainful work under


the commissioner's regulations.  If it is a make-work


position or it's a position that does not represent


functioning at a level -- it's a sheltered position or it

is some other -- some other reason that it is not evidence


of functioning --


QUESTION:  No, no.  She can -- she can perform


the elevator job completely well.


MR. LAMKEN:  If this is something --


QUESTION:  Everybody knows it's a -- it's a job


that's soon to be obsolete, and she's told that.


MR. LAMKEN:  Justice Kennedy, I think --


QUESTION:  She'd be better off not taking that


job.


MR. LAMKEN:  In terms of getting --


QUESTION:  Or suppose -- or -- or suppose she


didn't take that job.  Would she then still be barred?


MR. LAMKEN: 


If the -- if she did take the job, 

Justice Kennedy, and the job represented functioning at a


level that's consistent with work generally that is


substantial, gainful work, she would be barred.  And she


perhaps might be better off not taking the -- taking a job


like that under the commissioner's regulations. 


However, the mere fact that somebody taking a


job provides evidence that they function at a level that


is consistent with past work doesn't mean that we should


come up with less accurate determinations by ignoring


their demonstrated capacity to engage in their -- in their


past work.

 If there are no further questions. 


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. --


QUESTION:  One -- one -- just one further


question.  In -- in this case if she made it to step five,


it wouldn't be just a question that the burden would be


switched to the Government, she would automatically


prevail.  Isn't that the case?  Because of her age?


MR. LAMKEN:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 


The -- the way the commissioner's grids are set up, they


make various assumptions regarding the effects of age, the


exertion levels demanded by particular jobs, and other


matters.  And because it is a somewhat hypothetical


inquiry to look into the many jobs somebody hasn't done in 

the past, the step five inquiry sometimes will render --


will deem somebody not -- will deem somebody disabled even


though they actually can work.


It is precisely because of that reason that


Congress provided two measures of capacity to work:  a


highly empirical one, can the person do the jobs they


actually have previously done in the past; and second,


whether or not the person can engage in the other jobs


that they haven't actually done in the past.  And because


the two steps work more accurately together, that's why we


-- one of the reasons we believe that Congress provided

those two steps. 


In addition, it also preserves the line between


people who become unemployed because of their impairment,


and ones who happen to be fully capable of doing their


past jobs but lose those jobs for whatever reason, such as


either technological obsolescence or they simply choose to


leave those jobs voluntarily. 


If there are no further questions. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Lamken.


Mr. Alter, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAHAM S. ALTER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. ALTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Today the commissioner argues against its own


theme of providing a remedy when someone is disabled.


Congress did, indeed, intend to make a


difference, to separate step four, previous work, from


step five, or other work, but Congress told us what that


separation is.


At the fourth step, previous work, age is not a


factor, education is not a factor, and prior work


experience is not a factor.  This is simply because if a


person wasn't too old to do his job or her job in 1995, we


assume they weren't too old to do it in 1996.  If a person

had the requisite education and skill level to perform the


past job in 1995, then they have the same skill level and


education level in 1996.  And of course, prior work


experience is irrelevant at step four because we're


talking about the actual job that she did.


What Congress didn't intend was to pretend that


a job that doesn't exist can still be used to deny


benefits.  Work has to be substantial.  The commissioner


concedes that.  It has to be gainful.  The commissioner


concedes that.  And it has to exist.


QUESTION:  But your -- no.  It has to exist in


substantial numbers in the national economy.  What you're


-- you're arguing that a job that does exist and that this


particular supposedly disabled person used to perform and 

which is offered to that supposedly disabled person but


which that person turns down can, nonetheless, not count


against the person's disability.


MR. ALTER:  That is correct, Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  So it seems to me it's your position


that -- that presents a really extraordinary situation. 


Let's say I'm a juggler, and I become disabled.  And --


and the circus I was a juggler at comes and says, you


know, we -- we want you back.  We can't find another


juggler.  There aren't that many because there are not


that many juggler jobs in the national economy.  Okay?

And I turn them down.  I say, I'm tired of juggling.  And


you say that I'm handicapped even though my -- my prior


job is -- is right there waiting for me.  That seems to me


an extraordinary result.


MR. ALTER:  That is exactly what I'm saying,


Judge Scalia -- Justice Scalia.  I'm sorry.  And the


reason I say that is because a person is not disabled or


not disabled at any one step of the sequential evaluation. 


Your Honor's question focuses on the immediate reason for


the disengagement of the person from the workforce. 


That's not the commissioner's position.  That hasn't been


the commissioner's position.  A person is not disabled or


not disabled because of Ringling Brothers calls them on


the phone and says, please, come back. 


They are disabled 

by operation of the sequential evaluation.


And the commissioner is the one who promulgated


the sequential evaluation.  And the sequential evaluation


is a recipe with alternating steps regarding medical and


vocational factors.  And --


QUESTION:  The commissioner has explained that


it's -- using this test, can you perform your most recent


job, as a proxy for instead of testing people to see the


range of light work that exists in the economy.  They say,


we're just using this as a shorthand because it's


administratively convenient.  And it's not using it to

say, this person can do this job that's obsolescing,


therefore she is not disabled.  This particular job is a


proxy for other jobs that require the same skill level.


Now, what's wrong with taking that position


instead of subjecting people to a whole battery of tests?


MR. ALTER:  Justice Ginsburg, your rendition of


the commissioner's argument is exactly correct.  If I were


permitted to ask a question, I would ask myself a proxy


for what.  It is a -- the job doesn't exist.  So,


therefore, her ability to do the job --


QUESTION:  In substantial numbers in the


national economy.


MR. ALTER:  National economy.


QUESTION: 


The very job may exist and be open 

for her to take.


MR. ALTER:  Correct, but in most cases it


wouldn't be open for her to take.  That's the extreme


position where -- and that's our position that happened in


this case.  And that's a very extreme position.  And it


would be an unintended consequence of the statute.


But Your Honor is absolutely correct that that


is their position, that past work, even if it doesn't


exist in substantial numbers, is a proxy for her ability


to do other work.  What other work?


At the fifth step, she's disabled because she

would not be able to make an adjustment to other work


which exists in substantial numbers in the national


economy, according to the commissioner's statistics.


QUESTION:  Well, it's not according to the


commissioner.  It's according to the statute.


Can -- can we focus on the -- on the words of


the statute?  It says that the mental impairments --


physical or mental impairments are of such severity that


he is not only unable to do -- not only unable to do his


previous work, but cannot, considering his age, education,


and work experience, engage in any other kind of


substantial, gainful work which exists in the national


economy. 


Now, you want to take that last phrase, which 

exists in the national economy, and attribute it to the


earlier phrase, previous work.  But if that's what


Congress meant, why wouldn't they just have said that he


is unable, considering his age, education, and work


experience, to engage in any substantial, gainful work


which exists in the national economy?


You -- you want to effectively read the first


phrase, is not only unable to do his previous work, right


out of the statute.  They may just as well have dropped


it.  We don't read statutes to contain words that are


totally superfluous, and you have made them totally

superfluous.


MR. ALTER:  On the contrary, Your Honor.  The


words, any other kind, would be superfluous.  Congress,


indeed, intended to make a difference between previous


work and any other kind of work, and that difference is,


besides age, education, and prior work experience, which


are irrelevant at step five -- they wanted to have the


burden on the claimant for disability to show at the first


four steps that she is disabled.


At the fifth step, it is the commissioner who


must show that she isn't disabled.  And that's why the


words, which exist in the national economy, are in there


to begin with because what they wanted to preclude was the


commissioner saying, well, you can't do your prior job, 

but you can be a juggler.


QUESTION:  Well, you see -- can we go back for a


second to Justice Ginsburg's question?  Does this -- I


mean, your reading of it is a possible reading, I -- I


agree.  But they're saying their reading makes


administrative sense.


Now, this is my understanding of it.  A person


has a bad back.  Now, there are bad backs and bad backs,


but it's not a good thing to have.  So she has a bad back,


and we want to know how bad it is.  And they're saying if


it's very bad, she automatically is going to get the money

because at step three they'll look and see and say, look,


this is a pretty bad back.  It meets our criteria.  That's


the end of it.


But if it's medium bad, then what they're going


to say is, well, first question is can she still do her


last job as an elevator operator.  And if the answer to


that question is yes, that's the end of it.


And, therefore, if the answer, however, is no,


then we've to go and gear up our vocational experts.  Are


there dolls' eyes' sewers?  You know, they have a few odd


jobs they usually bring in here --


MR. ALTER:  I know. 


QUESTION:  -- to show they exist in the national


economy. 


And -- and we get -- we don't want to go through 

that rigmarole.


So for a medium bad back, if you can still do


your previous work as an elevator operator, you're not


that handicapped.  That's the end of it.  Go to the


unemployment office.  Don't go to the -- the health


office. 


Now, what -- that to me makes sense.  Now, what


to you doesn't make sense?


MR. ALTER:  Oh, it doesn't make sense at all


Your Honor, to me, obviously.

 QUESTION:  No, no.  Well, go ahead. 


MR. ALTER:  Your Honor's question seems to make


step four, previous work, a gauge as to how severe the


severe impairment is.


QUESTION:  Exactly, and I think they suggest


that might be so. 


MR. ALTER:  And -- but step four, previous work,


is a remedy that the commissioner can use for their


convenience.  Why look at every job in the national


economy?  Let's start here and see if that medium bad back


would preclude her from her past job.  But to what end? 


So that she can resume that job.  It seems to me, Your


Honor, that once --


QUESTION: 


So you're not saying it is to that 

end because it's the unemployment office that's concerned


about people who are out of work because you don't have


elevator operators in the economy anymore.  That -- it's


not the Social Security office, they say, which is


concerned about people who are physically hurt or mentally


hurt.


MR. ALTER:  Number one, Your Honor, Pauline


Thomas could never collect unemployment insurance because


the first thing they would ask her, are you ready,


willing, and able to work?  Do you have any medical


problems?  Once she has a severe impairment, at step two

the unemployment argument, issue, or -- or controversy is


over.  Once she shows -- because that's the threshold. 


When the -- when the statute says, by reason of a


medically determinable impairment, it doesn't mean


exclusively for medical reasons.  But once she shows that


medical impairment, to who?  To the satisfaction of the


commissioner.  Once the commissioner says, yes, you have a


severe impairment, then vocational issues, such as, okay,


you can do a job, but does the job exist, become paramount


because the -- the purpose of the statute, it seems to me,


is to provide a remedy. 


Now, there are two remedies that are possible


after this sequential evaluation process.  Remedy one,


there are no jobs existing in significant numbers in the 

national economy that you can do.  So here's your


benefits.  Remedy two, you know what?  There are jobs


existing, whether it's your job, whether it's another job. 


And therefore, we've done you a favor.  We've told you


that the economy can accommodate you after your injury. 


Therefore, go get that job.


QUESTION:  Mr. Alter, if --if we think the


statute may have certain ambiguities in it, why don't we


owe deference to the Secretary's regulations and


interpretation, which has been pretty consistent through


the years?

 MR. ALTER:  There are three answers to that


question, Your Honor.  First of all, I'm -- I'm


crestfallen that -- that the Court would find that there's


ambiguity.  But given that -- that they would --


QUESTION:  If we think there is. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  And if we're not crestfallen.


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Pick up your crest and go on, Mr.


Alter. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. ALTER:  If the statute is ambiguous, the


commissioner's construction must still be reasonable. 


Here, I would say it is not reasonable.  That's the first. 


Because it -- it begs reality.  The reality is this job


doesn't exist in substantial numbers.  Or at least, we


want to be able to show that at an administrative hearing.


QUESTION:  Mr. Alter, how do you deal with the


fact that a number of circuits and, indeed, three judges


on this en banc court thought exactly that, that this was


an ambiguous regulation, that it had been applied


consistently by the Secretary, and that it was entirely


reasonable, the -- the notion that your current work is a


proxy for can you do light work, that that's a -- not a


necessary or inevitable one, but a reasonable one?

 MR. ALTER:  Justice Ginsburg, first, let me take


the -- the last part of your sentence.  Proxy to do light


work.  She wins at light work at step five.  So again,


it's a proxy to do light work.


QUESTION:  No.  Step five in her case we've


established is an automatic.  It's not that she's shown


that she can't do light work.  The commissioner says,


look, when you get to be 55 years old, we're not going to


mess with that.  If you can't do your prior job, that's


it.


MR. ALTER:  But it's the reason why, Your Honor,


because she can't make an adjustment to any jobs.  If a


person can do light work, that proxy issue, she can do her


past job which is light, then she can do other light jobs. 

But the commissioner tells us that she won't be able to


adjust to other light jobs.  And will she be able to


adjust to her current job?  There is no adjustment to a


current job, unless the job doesn't exist. 


But to answer your question about the other


circuits, the other circuits -- circuits focused on the


regulation, focused on the ruling, 82-61.  That says,


well, it doesn't make a difference whether the job exists. 


It's whether you can do that job.  And most of the other


circuits said, well, the regulation says do your past job


-- a strict reading of do your past job means the capacity

rather than a reality standard.  But they didn't focus on


the statute. 


And if I might answer Judge -- Justice


O'Connor's question about ambiguity, if I haven't answered


your question. 


QUESTION:  No, you haven't because there's


another piece of it.  For the future, regulation that


doesn't apply in your case, the -- the commissioner has


clarified that what we mean is can you do the physical


aspects of this job and we don't look to see whether it's


an obsolescing job, a brand new regulation that doesn't


apply to your case. 


On your argument, I take it -- you're going now


back to the statute -- that new regulation is an 

impermissible construction of the statute.


MR. ALTER:  That is exactly correct, Your Honor.


May I, Justice O'Connor, answer your question? 


The deference owed to their -- the commissioner's


construction of the statute is not much.  It's Skidmore


deference. 


QUESTION:  What?


MR. ALTER:  Skidmore deference, Skidmore v.


Swift.


QUESTION:  Oh, I thought you said Skinmore.

 MR. ALTER:  Chevron, the -- the great case, the


elephant in this room -- Chevron has a two-step policy. 


The first one has been precluded by Your Honor's question,


whether the statute is ambiguous.  The second part says,


well, it owes great deference to the commissioner's


position, but not, Your Honor, in a construction of a


statute.  It is this Court's role to tell us what the law


is and what the law means. 


QUESTION:  Now, what does Chevron amount to?  I


mean, if -- if you're -- it struck me always that the --


the first step is is the statute ambiguous, and second, if


it is, is -- is the construction reasonable.  It is by


definition a construction of the statute you're talking


about in the second step.


MR. ALTER:  Yes, Your Honor, but I believe under


U.S. v. Mead the Court did make a distinction between a --


an administrative policy --


QUESTION:  But Mead was -- but Mead was not a


Chevron case.


MR. ALTER:  Mead was a construction by an agency


case, and Mead says, I think -- my -- my reading is that


if a -- an administrative policy is at issue, great


deference has to be given.  But a construction of a


statute -- an agency does not have deference, great


deference, because of administrative --

 QUESTION:  I -- I rather thought that's what


Chevron was all about.  I'm interested that you don't


think so.


MR. ALTER:  Well, my reading, Your Honor, is


that Chevron deference will only apply to an agency's


statutory interpretation if it emerged from a formal


adjudication.


QUESTION:  I certainly don't see that in Mead. 


I -- I mean, I understand that there have been views


around taken from the dissent I think, that maybe that's


what it says, but when I read it about 17 times now --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  -- it didn't seem to say that.  I


mean, it said that -- that certainly if they have formal 

proceedings, that would be a strong ground for thinking


that we would apply Chevron.  And if they didn't, it


doesn't mean we won't.  Did you get all the double


negatives? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. ALTER:  I understand.  All I can do is


assert that if Chevron means that if we find some sort of


ambiguity in a Federal statute, we give pretty much carte


blanche to the agency.  That was my reading of Chevron. 


That would be a disappointing reading of Chevron because I


think --

 QUESTION:  If it's reasonable.  If the agency


has given it a reasonable construction.  And from former


questions this morning, the suggestion is that the


regulatory approach is kind of an administrative shortcut


for finding out whether this employee is basically able to


do certain types of light work.


MR. ALTER:  I would argue, Your Honor, that it


is not reasonable in any -- by any stretch of the word


because may I remind, Your Honor, that we're talking about


a job which may not exist at all, and a finding that a


person is not disabled because they're capable of doing a


job that doesn't exist can't be reasonable.  If we take --


I -- I say that --


QUESTION:  Why is that?  What does -- what does


disabled have to do with doing a job?  I mean, disabled is


a -- is a physical condition, and they say if you can do


the job you used to do, you're not disabled.


MR. ALTER:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  The word is disabled, not unemployed. 


Unemployment insurance is something different.  It's a


different program.  This program is not meant to provide


for unemployment.  It's meant to provide for disability.


MR. ALTER:  But what I meant --


QUESTION:  And all the -- all the Secretary is


saying is if you can do your prior job, you're not

disabled.  That seems quite logical to me.  I --


MR. ALTER:  Let me try to highlight the


illogical parts of that then, Your Honor. 


Unemployment has nothing to do with this


litigation.  The person has a severe impairment.  As a


matter of fact, let's be precise.  The person has cardiac


arrhythmias.  The person had a heart attack and returned


to work.  The person had a -- a herniated disc and


cervical radiculopathy.  According to the commissioner's


construction here, the only job in the world that she


could adjust to is a job which may not exist.


Once she has a severe impairment, Your Honor can


bring up unemployment for the rest of the session, but


unemployment is a red herring in this case because once 

you have a severe impairment, we're not talking about


unemployment anymore.  We're talking about --


QUESTION:  Then she should -- we should have


ended it at step three, but the commissioner makes a


distinction.  And her impairment, because it wasn't on the


chart, doesn't make it.  She is not at that point


disabled.  You have to go on to the next step.  If she


were disabled, that would be the end of it and we wouldn't


-- but she isn't disabled under this formulation because


she's not within the conditions that that's the end of the


examination.

 MR. ALTER:  Justice Ginsburg, your question and


Justice Scalia's question seem to me to define disability


in a vacuum.  She is disabled -- she isn't disabled


because she can do a job.  Suppose she can be -- she be --


she can deliver ice.  That job doesn't exist anymore


either.  Suppose she could be a court jester.  Disability


has --


QUESTION:  You're the one that -- that is tying


disability to employment, not -- not Justice Ginsburg and


I.  And -- and yet, you keep saying that -- that


unemployment insurance is a red herring.  You're the one


that keeps bringing it in.  You -- you say we can't tell


whether the person is disabled unless the person can get a


job, but that's not the statutory requirement for 

disability.


MR. ALTER:  Your Honor, I am not saying that a


person is disabled unless they can go get a job.  What I'm


saying is that disability means that a medical impairment


prevents you from adjusting to work which exists in the


national economy.


QUESTION:  And they are saying, to take your


example, if you're a former iceman and you're still strong


enough to deliver ice, you're probably able to do other


jobs.  What is unreasonable about that, even if there's no


ice delivery anymore?

 MR. ALTER:  Because at step five, when the


commissioner says that you cannot adjust to other jobs, I


take them at their word.  Statistically, according to the


commissioner's sequential evaluation, according to the


commissioner's vocational rules, there will not be an


ability to adjust to any other job which exists in the


national economy.


QUESTION:  And -- and at the point at which you


get to step five, you've already found that the person


can't deliver ice anymore.  So there has already been a


finding of some disability to some degree irrespective of


the capacity to go to a nonexistent job.  I mean, the --


the proxy determination has already been made before you


get to step five.  Isn't that right?


MR. ALTER:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  That's what step four is there for.


MR. ALTER:  That -- that is correct, Your Honor,


but we keep getting back to that proxy, that word proxy. 


Well, even if your job doesn't exist, it's a proxy for


your ability to do other jobs.  But what other jobs?


QUESTION:  Well, if you're an -- first of all, I


don't know why it doesn't exist.  We have elevator


operators in this building.


MR. ALTER:  Yes, Your Honor.  I gave her my


card.

 QUESTION:  All right.  So -- so, I mean --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  It points out a certain unrealism.  A


person who works in an elevator is a pleasant person, and


they sit down for some of the day and they're up --


standing up for some of the day.  And they have to see


that people get on and off properly.  It requires a degree


of intelligence.  It requires a degree of personality.  It


requires a certain degree of skill.  And so there -- you


would have thought there would have been a lot of other


jobs like that in the economy.  And, I mean, even if there


aren't too many elevator operators, there are some.


I mean, I'm trying to point out the realism that


they say exists behind their -- their assumption there. 

And it's pretty hard.  We're talking about -- it's really


hard to find an example that fits the category you want to


say this is in. 


MR. ALTER:  Your Honor's question about the


elevator operator is a -- a serious one because an


elevator operator we have in this Court pushes buttons. 


Yes, there's personality involved, but I -- I don't think


that one of these individuals would be denied this job if


she didn't have a sterling or -- or a wonderful


personality.  She pushes buttons.  That's not what my


client did.  My client operated an elevator.

 The reason we have elevator operators in this


building, I'm assuming, is to add to the majesty of the


building, for security purposes so I don't wander up and


down the halls where I'm not supposed to go.  There are


elevator operators in luxury buildings which really act as


security or helping people with parcels.


This person pushes a button, and she's here for


a reason, which really has nothing to do with what my


client was doing.  She was opening a gate and opening a


door, et cetera, and pushing the actual buttons, and


operating -- well, you've -- everyone has seen an elevator


operator from the old days. 


The point is -- the point is that all we want to


do is show -- an opportunity to show what every SSI 

claimant can show.  I believe it was Justice O'Connor who


-- who asked is there a difference between the regulations


in title II and title XVI, and my colleagues said


correctly, no, there aren't.


How about this?  How about Pauline Thomas never


worked a day in her life?  She was on welfare her whole


life.  She doesn't have a step four.  We treat people


under this construction who have worked, as Pauline Thomas


does -- and I promised her I would say this, so I'm going


to say it -- for 27-and-a-half years, 110 quarters of


coverage.  And she paid in all that time, sweeping and

cleaning, and mopping bathrooms in a nursing home, and had


a heart attack and went back to work.  We don't treat her,


under this construction, as well as we treat a person who


never worked a day in her life because then she


automatically goes to step five where she's disabled. 


That's the first prong. 


The second thing -- I don't know if the Court


has an actual transcript, but how do we treat this person


differently?  Pauline Thomas will get -- this controversy


is about $672 a month in disability benefits after 27-and-


a-half years.  If she had not worked a day in her life --


QUESTION:  Mr. Alter, can we go back to one


thing that you said I don't think was quite right?  You


said all we want is an opportunity to show.  That's not


so.  If you get to step five, you win, and the Government


has conceded that.  You don't have to show anything.  So


you're looking for -- you say if -- step four, if she


prevails on that, that is the end of the inquiry.  You


will not -- it's not incumbent on you to show anything.


MR. ALTER:  In this particular case, if we get


to step five, we will win.  But what we want to show is


not -- obviously, Ms. Thomas wants the benefits and I want


to win the case.  But what we would be showing is that


past work is not a proxy for another kind of work if the


past work doesn't exist because we want to be able to show

-- it's what we already know -- that the commissioner says


that there is no ability to adjust to another job.  Here,


if her job doesn't exist, she will have to adjust to


another job whether we call it her past job or not.


What I want to --


QUESTION:  She did work at this job for -- well,


7 years, did she not?


MR. ALTER:  Correct.


QUESTION:  Because she -- at one point in your


brief, you said that she had been an elevator operator. 


At page 42, you said for a few months.  That was wrong.


MR. ALTER:  A few years, Your Honor.  I'm -- my


mistake.


As I was saying, if she went and applied for SSI 

in New Jersey, she would get $583.25 as we sit here right


now.  So the difference between the 27 years of work and


no work is, number one, she has a better chance, because


she doesn't have to go through step four; and number two,


she gets another $80.  That construction leads to a


disengagement between the worker who's paying the freight


so that the commissioner can have their convenience and


their construction and the actual program.  The program


must reflect reality.  Disability is a word, but it's a


concept that comes after the commissioner has put in place


a sequential evaluation.  And that sequential evaluation

is based on the realities of the workplace.  It has always


been.


As a matter of fact, may I point one thing out


-- two things actually.  Number one, the commissioner


doesn't call it past work.  The statute calls it previous


work.  The commissioner calls it past relevant work.  What


is more irrelevant than a job that doesn't exist?  Number


one. 


Number two, the commissioner says that there are


no vocational considerations at step four.  We don't care


about whether the job exists or not.  But that's not the


case because the commissioner's own ruling states for a


fact that if you can't do your past job as you performed


it, we can still deny you benefits at step four by saying 

that we -- you can do your past job as it's performed in


the national economy.  That's a vocational consideration. 


I never performed that job that way.  My job is much


harder.  Yes, but when we look into the dictionary of


occupational titles, we find your job and many jobs are


done in a lighter version.  You can do that job.  But I


never did it before.  Vocational considerations.


SSI claimants have more rights and make the same


money as disability claimants.  There's something wrong


with that in terms of public policy. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Alter.

 MR. ALTER:  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Lamken, you have 19 minutes


remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. LAMKEN:  Thank you. 


First, I wanted to point out that step four in


fact is a measure of severity.  The question is how severe


does the impairment have to be, and the statute tells you


exactly how far -- how severe it has to be.  It has to be


so severe that the claimant is unable to do his previous


work.  So the step four inquiry of previous work is a


measure of severity, and the commissioner has consistently


used that measure of severity to determine whether the 

individual is functioning at a level that is consistent


with work generally. 


Second, in terms of the deference to which the


commissioner's construction is entitled, this has been the


commissioner's current construction from the outset of the


program, both from before this -- the particular


provisions we've been discussing were adopted in 1967 and


after.  We believe that they're clearly reflected in the


commissioner's regulations from 1978, and any -- any


ambiguity in those regulations was cleared up in 1982 with


respect -- by the issuance of SSR 82-40.

 The commissioner's current regulations, which


became effective September 25th, now make it abundantly


clear and explain in absolutely certain terms that the


commissioner does not consider whether or not the previous


work exists in significant numbers in the national


economy.  Because that is the result of a rulemaking,


because it is clearly the commissioner's well-considered


and longstanding interpretation of the statute, it is


entitled to deference.


QUESTION:  Those regulations were subject to


notice and comment rulemaking? 


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes.  In fact, there was a very --


there was a lengthy comment period, and then they went


through the entire process and were issued quite a few 

years actually after the comment period was completed. 


But yes, those were not -- notice and comment rulemaking,


Justice Ginsburg.


In fact, the clarification came in in response


to a public comment that particular issue wasn't -- was


germane to the rulemaking, but it wasn't one the


commissioner had initially planned to address.  But a


commenter said, please clarify that in fact you do


consider whether previous work exists in the national


economy.  And the commissioner said, no, no, you've got it


wrong.  We do not consider it.  Our longstanding view has

always been we do not consider whether previous work exits


in substantial numbers in the national economy.


QUESTION:  Mr. Lamken --


MR. LAMKEN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- could you clarify something?  I


asked this of -- of Mr. Alter, and I -- I didn't quite


understand his -- his answer.  Do you understand the


respondent's position in this case to be anything other


than saying that the statute means it could be abbreviated


to read this way, that he is unable, considering his age,


education, and work experience, to engage in any kind of


substantial, gainful work which subsists in the national


economy? 


MR. LAMKEN: 


I -- the respondent's position does 

have the effect of completing the two separate inquiries.


QUESTION:  Well, eliminating the first entirely,


does it not eliminate the first entirely?


MR. LAMKEN:  The one thing that -- that it


wouldn't take into account is that in the first inquiry,


the commissioner does not take into -- in the previous


work inquiry, the commissioner does not take into account


age, education, and work experience.  And your formulation


would make age, education, and work experience relevant to


all work, previous work and past work.  However, we


believe that if Congress had intended --

 QUESTION:  Well, but -- but if he was doing his


previous work, it is impossible to find that considering


his age, education, and work experience, he couldn't do


it.  I mean, it's --


MR. LAMKEN:  I -- I think that's precisely


right.  It makes it -- as a --


QUESTION:  It's an impossibility anyway.


MR. LAMKEN:  Right.  As a structural matter, it


would make it relevant, but in fact it would be rarely, if


ever, a factor the commissioner would use in terms of


denying disability benefits.  So it does definitely have


the effect of taking what Congress set out as two separate


conditions precedent and merging them to a degree which


Congress probably did not intend.


Finally, for 45 years in adjudicating more than


40 million claims -- and that includes approximately


200,000 step four, that is, previous work denials a year. 


That's 500 denials a day for every day of every year --


the commissioner has consistently applied this


construction.  That construction has functioned well


throughout all these years.  Accordingly, we ask the Court


to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and to


reinstate the commissioner's construction.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Lamken.


The case is submitted.
