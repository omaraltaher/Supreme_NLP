CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 129 Original, Virginia v. Maryland.


Mr. Baida.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW H. BAIDA


ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF


MR. BAIDA:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


There are two reasons why the State of Maryland


has the authority to regulate Virginia and its citizens


when they seek to place structures in and withdraw water


from the Potomac River. 


First, as confirmed by the Black-Jenkins Award 

of 1877 and this Court's decision in Morris v. United


States, the State of Maryland is and has been the owner of


the Potomac River since 1632, and Maryland has never --


QUESTION:  Mr. Baida, before you get into your


argument, can I just ask you a preliminary question?  I


made the mistake of reading the Master's report before I


read the briefs.  There's an awful lot of discussion of


the entire river issue in there.  Is that -- you're no


longer making that point?


MR. BAIDA:  Correct, we are not.


Maryland is and has been the owner of the river,

and it has never relinquished the sovereign authority that


its title to the river gives it to regulate what takes


place on and over the bed. 


And the second reason --


QUESTION:  Do you think the compact covers


withdrawals of water by Virginia?  I mean, does it


directly cover that at all?


MR. BAIDA:  It's not the privilege of making and


carrying out orders, Justice O'Connor, although that


privilege would seem to apply to building something into


the river to exercise a riparian right, and there is a


riparian right to withdraw water.


QUESTION:  Well, do you -- do you take the


position that Maryland could reject every effort by 

Virginia to withdraw water from the river?


MR. BAIDA:  No, Justice O'Connor.  We -- we have


never taken that position.


QUESTION:  What is your position then?


MR. BAIDA:  That Virginia has riparian rights


with respect to the Potomac River.


QUESTION:  Which includes the right to use some


of the water.


MR. BAIDA:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  And take it out of the river.


MR. BAIDA:  Correct.

 QUESTION:  With your permission.


MR. BAIDA:  Correct.


QUESTION:  But only with your permission.


QUESTION:  It's only the last step that's the


problem. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Is that right?  Only with Maryland's


permission --


MR. BAIDA:  Subject to a standard of


reasonableness, Justice O'Connor. 


QUESTION:  Is that reasonableness in part


assessed by the fact that Maryland is a sovereign?


MR. BAIDA:  It's --


QUESTION:  Pardon me. 


That Virginia is a 

sovereign?


MR. BAIDA:  No.  It's assessed by the fact that


Maryland owns the river, but that Virginia, as -- as a


riparian owner, has rights with respect to the river that


Maryland must be reasonable with respect to which in its


regulations. 


QUESTION:  Virginia rights are -- Virginia


rights are no greater than any private landowner?


MR. BAIDA:  That's precisely correct.


QUESTION:  Even -- even assuming that's true, I


-- I thought a right is a right.  I -- I thought we have a

right to something.  It doesn't mean somebody can turn it


down.


MR. BAIDA:  And -- and --


QUESTION:  And riparian rights include the right


to take the water.  That's clear.


MR. BAIDA:  And --


QUESTION:  And that's the right to take water,


not -- not the right to come and beg Maryland to take


water.


MR. BAIDA:  The river, Justice Scalia, is


entirely within the State of Maryland, and that is


undisputed from the -- the language of the Maryland


charter back from 1632.  The entire river is in Maryland.


QUESTION: 


But the compact reserves to the State 

of Virginia and its citizens riparian rights.  If riparian


rights include, as I think they do, the right to take


water, it seems to me that aspect of the case is -- is


quite easy to decide.


MR. BAIDA:  Maryland's ownership of the Potomac


gives it to right -- gives it the right to regulate what


takes place on and over the bed.  There are riparian


rights, but as this Court has recognized, those riparian


rights have always been subject to government regulation. 


QUESTION:  I'm mixed up.  I'm sorry.  Maybe -- I


didn't think the case was basically about taking water out

of the river.  I thought it was about building something


for the purpose of taking water out.


MR. BAIDA:  There --


QUESTION:  Is -- is it actually that you're


saying -- I may have misread this and so is it actually --


you're saying if -- if somebody -- if the Governor of


Virginia goes to the river with a bucket and takes water,


a little bit of water, to wash some pans that he has, that


they have to get Maryland's permission?  Is it about


taking the water out of the river?  Is it about building


something, or both?


MR. BAIDA:  It's about both.


QUESTION:  All right.  So now you're just


addressing the problem of taking water out of the river. 

So can a person who lives next to a river under the common


law from 1302 or whatever -- now, can he go to the river


and just take some water when he's thirsty?


MR. BAIDA:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  All right.  So Virginia is just


taking water when they happen to have a lot of people who


are thirsty. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  So what's the -- what's the special


thing about the water?  I thought it was building a water


intake system.

 MR. BAIDA:  It's -- it's about both.  The right


to build into the Potomac which the compact --


QUESTION:  All right.  Let's imagine there were


no building.  Then would you have an objection?


MR. BAIDA:  Yes, because --


QUESTION:  Because you can't take water out when


you're thirsty.


QUESTION:  There are too many thirsty people is


what your objection is.  Right?


MR. BAIDA:  The -- the objection is simply that


Maryland has the right to regulate what takes place in its


territory, and what takes place --


QUESTION:  It doesn't.  What they do is they --


they build a -- a hole which fills up with the water from 

the Potomac and that hole, which happens to be in


Virginia, is filled up with water and they drink it.  Now,


is there any objection?  They haven't built a thing.


MR. BAIDA:  I think that's a different question. 


That's --


QUESTION:  No.  I'm asking you, are you


objecting to the building or are you objecting separately


-- because I hadn't focused on that -- to just taking


water without building anything?


MR. BAIDA:  If they're taking -- if they are --


the low-water mark on the Virginia side --

 QUESTION:  No.  They have nothing built over


there.  What happens is water comes up out of the Potomac


into Virginia and they drink it.


MR. BAIDA:  But I'm trying to understand the


nature of your question, Justice Breyer.  When they build


a hole, are they building the hole in Virginia? 


QUESTION:  In Virginia. 


MR. BAIDA:  So they're building a trench in


Virginia. 


QUESTION:  Yes, that's right.


MR. BAIDA:  Maryland may have some objections to


that at some future point in time, but that's activity


that's taking place in Virginia. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


That's what I thought the case 

was about. 


QUESTION:  Unless the trench creates a new low-


water mark for the Potomac.  I mean, I think that's what


Maryland's argument would be, that when you make an inlet


into Virginia, that's -- that's the low-water mark of the


Potomac.


MR. BAIDA:  Well, that may -- that -- I don't


know whether that would actually change the --


QUESTION:  I didn't want to get it mixed up. 


All I wanted to do is I focused on this case as a matter


of building something.  I didn't focus on it as a matter

of taking water out.  And I'm -- and that's -- that was my


problem.  Now, maybe just forget my problem.  Maybe I'm


the only one who had it.  So skip --


QUESTION:  Let -- let me ask you this.  There's


a Potomac River Flow Allocation Agreement of 1978.  Does


it deal with the right of Virginia to use water or take it


out?


MR. BAIDA:  That imposes restrictions on the


three major users of the Potomac River, the Washington


Aqueduct, the Army Corps of Engineers, the -- the Fairfax


County Water Authority and the Washington Sanitary --


Suburban Sanitary Commission, and imposes limitations on


the amount of water that they can take --


QUESTION: 


On the amount, but it acknowledges --

MR. BAIDA:  -- in periods of low flow.


QUESTION:  -- that water can and will be removed


by Fairfax County?


MR. BAIDA:  Subject to a permitting system that


was in place at the time and still is in place.  And the


only permitting system that's ever been in place with


respect to the Potomac River has been the permitting


system established by the State of Maryland. 


And I think I'd like to just go back to the


initial point I tried to make at the beginning, which is


why Maryland has the right to do what it's doing here.

 QUESTION:  Before you do that, can I ask a


practical question?  How is Maryland, if it is, adversely


affected by this pipe and the water intake?  Is there any


adverse impact on Maryland or is Maryland just trying to


say, we are the sovereign?  So even though our people are


not being adversely affected, you need to get a permit


from us.  Is there any adverse impact on Maryland or its


residents?


MR. BAIDA:  Well, the Maryland administrative


and judicial review proceedings answered that question


"no."


But the reason why Maryland took the -- the


action that it did was because Fairfax County already had


an existing waterway intake pipe in the -- in the river. 

They wanted to build another intake pipe 725 feet into the


river, and the edge of it would be 30 inches above water


with a 5-foot walkway.  Maryland took the position let's


see if there are less intrusive alternatives that are


available. 


Virginia wanted to do this.  Fairfax County


wanted to do this because it was concerned about the


effect of the -- the water on the shoreline which is where


the existing intake pipe was and wanted to get cleaner


water from the -- from the middle of the river.  And so


Maryland took the view, well, let's see if there are less

intrusive alternatives available, and --


QUESTION:  Why?


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Because -- because there wasn't


enough water for the people in -- in Maryland?  That's --


it -- one thing is, well, we're sovereign and you -- we


have to give our permission.  Another is our people are


not going to have enough water if Virginia does this.  I


think you're saying Maryland had no such objection.


MR. BAIDA:  Maryland had no objection to the


Fairfax County Water Authority withdrawing water. 


Maryland's objection was to minimize the impact on the


Potomac River.


QUESTION: 


What authority did you have to 

minimize the impact?  The compact between the States gives


the State and its citizens riparian rights, including the


right to build structures into the river so long as they


do not impede navigation.  Was Maryland's objection that


-- that this new structure would impede navigation of the


river?  It's a -- it's above the navigable portion anyway,


isn't it? 


MR. BAIDA:  Yes, it is.


QUESTION:  So.  So what was your objection?


MR. BAIDA:  Because the riparian rights that --


QUESTION:  It was ugly?

 MR. BAIDA:  Well, there was -- that was part of


it because it -- it was in the scenic portion of the


Potomac River.


QUESTION:  Well, you should have reserved that


right in the -- in the compact.  The compact could have


said, you know, provided it does not impede navigation or


be ugly. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BAIDA:  What the -- what the compact does,


Justice Scalia, is it provides that the Potomac River


could be used as a common highway by the citizens of both


States, and it also secures important private property


rights.  Private property rights, again for the citizens


of both States.


QUESTION:  All right.  Let -- if I may, let me


interrupt you there.  Do you concede that the State has


any rights under article VII of the compact?


MR. BAIDA:  That the States?


QUESTION:  The State, the State of Virginia, the


Commonwealth of Virginia.  Article -- article VII talks


about citizens.


MR. BAIDA:  That --


QUESTION:  It doesn't talk about the


commonwealth.


MR. BAIDA:  That's exactly what this Court has

said in --


QUESTION:  Well, is that -- I mean, is that a


premise of your argument? 


MR. BAIDA:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Do you -- do you also deny that the


State with respect to withdrawal of water for its citizens


that the -- do you deny that the State stands in the shoes


of its citizens?


MR. BAIDA:  The -- the State -- the Commonwealth


of Virginia brought this action on behalf of its citizens


to seek --


QUESTION:  No.  I realize that, but are you


denying that it may properly do that?


MR. BAIDA:  No.  No, we are not.


QUESTION:  So, in effect, are you saying the


State -- it -- it is just as though the State had express


rights under article VII because in making the claim that


it's making, it stands in the shoes of its citizens, and


its citizens do have rights.  Is -- is that -- do you


concede that?


MR. BAIDA:  Yes.  The -- we've never denied that


the --


QUESTION:  Then it's irrelevant that the -- that


article VII speaks only of citizens and not of the State. 


Is that correct?

 MR. BAIDA:  No, it's not irrelevant, Justice --


QUESTION:  Then what -- what difference does it


make?


MR. BAIDA:  Because all that the compact does,


it secures -- it -- it makes a -- there is -- the compact


drafters recognized the difference between jurisdiction


and sovereignty and private property rights, and when they


wanted to, they knew exactly how to go about addressing


issues of sovereignty.


QUESTION:  Now, one of my questions in this case


is this.  You've answered Justice Souter and he posed his


questions this way based on article VII or paragraph --


clause VII of -- of the compact.  But must we not


interpret that too according to the Black-Jenkins Award, 

particularly paragraph 4 at page C-4 of -- of the -- of


the Special Master's appendices?  That uses the -- that


says Virginia -- not citizens.  That says Virginia has


riparian rights, and both of those two phrases are not


used in the compact.  The phrase, riparian rights, I don't


think is used in the compact, and the compact talks about


citizens.


But the Black-Jenkins Award goes -- it seems to


me, interprets authoritatively -- and you correct me if


I'm wrong -- what the compact means.  And I read the Black


-- at least I think it's a permissible reading -- to say

that Virginia -- and we'll argue about as a sovereign. 


That -- that's -- that's a phrase I add -- has riparian


rights.  So we really do have to focus not just on section


VII, but on part 4 of the Black-Jenkins Award, do we not?


MR. BAIDA:  Yes.  And we -- Maryland's view is


that that part of the award confirms Maryland's rights


over the river.  And I'd like to explain this a little bit


more fully. 


What the Black-Jenkins arbitrators did was they


rejected Virginia's claim to any right in the soil -- any


right in the soil -- beyond the water mark, any right to


any of the islands in the river, and any right to any part


of the bed of the river.  Now --


QUESTION: 


Yes, but it said, as has been pointed 

out, that Virginia was given a proprietary right and a


privilege to erect any structures necessary to the full


enjoyment of Virginia's riparian ownership, which


presumably encompasses taking out water.


MR. BAIDA:  And the presumption, Justice


O'Connor, is overcome by looking at the rest of the award,


and what the -- the arbitrators did, they did give


Virginia title to the middle of other bodies of water,


namely the -- the Tangier Sound, the Pocomoke Sound, and


the Pocomoke River.  But they specifically rejected --


QUESTION:  Yes, but do you deny that Virginia

has riparian ownership up to the low-water mark of the


Potomac?


MR. BAIDA:  The arbitrators said that Virginia


has full dominion over this right in the soil up to low-


water mark, but beyond that point, Virginia only has a


right to use the river.  A right of use is not dominion,


it's not title, it's not sovereignty.


QUESTION:  But it says --


QUESTION:  Why?  But it is a right of use, and


that's what you're -- and that's what you're contradicting


here.  That's all they want.  They're not trying to govern


the river.  They just want to use it.


MR. BAIDA:  A right of use, Justice Scalia, is


subject to governmental authority and regulation, and 

that's exactly what this Court said --


QUESTION:  Well, but it says here in the Black-


Jenkins Award and in the earlier compact, the privilege to


erect structures necessary to the full enjoyment of the


riparian ownership.  That might mean a pipe to take water


out.


MR. BAIDA:  This Court has said in, for example,


Massachusetts v. New York that Massachusetts' right to use


Lake Ontario was still subject to the regulatory authority


of New York because New York had title to the bed of Lake


Ontario.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Baida, can I ask you sort of a


basic question?  In your view is there any difference


between the right that Virginia has, the riparian rights


of Virginia, on the one hand, and the riparian rights of


Maryland's citizens who -- who own the property on the


Maryland shore of the river?  Do -- are they equivalent? 


Or what is the difference between the riparian rights of


the people on the opposite sides of the river?


MR. BAIDA:  The -- Maryland is to treat them


identically, and that's set forth clearly in article VII


of the compact.


QUESTION:  So that either -- on either side of


the river, a property owner could stick a pipe in and


drain the river.


MR. BAIDA:  Not -- not if it has any kind of


adverse impact from Maryland's perspective, whether it's


in Maryland -- if -- if the City of Rockville wanted to do


this, it would encounter presumably exactly the same kind


of reaction that Fairfax County initially did.


QUESTION:  You say the riparian rights on either


side of the river are subject to the paramount authority


of the Maryland -- the State of Maryland to -- to govern


what happens to the water.


MR. BAIDA:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And -- and in the exercise of that

authority, could Maryland give a higher priority to the


citizens of Rockville than to the citizens of Vienna,


Virginia? 


MR. BAIDA:  No, and this Court said in Yates v.


Milwaukee that -- that the riparian right cannot be


arbitrarily and capriciously denied.  And that --


QUESTION:  No.  It's not arbitrary and


capricious.  They make a lot of findings and they said


there's too much traffic in Virginia.  Virginia would be


better off if it's rural.


(Laughter.) 


MR. BAIDA:  Well, Your Honor, I think --


QUESTION:  And -- and what is -- what is the


source for your statement that Maryland has to be non-

arbitrary?  Is this riparian water law or is this some


constitutional obligation that one State owes to another?


MR. BAIDA:  I -- I think it's again set forth in


Yates v. Milwaukee where the Court said that a State


cannot -- or a government -- municipality cannot


arbitrarily and capriciously deny someone the exercise of


a riparian right.


QUESTION:  So in your opinion --


QUESTION:  But -- but that's based on -- on --


that's a statement of riparian law?


MR. BAIDA:  Yes.  I think -- I mean, it's a

property right.  It is a property right, and it can't be


arbitrarily --


QUESTION:  So we're talking about -- all we're


talking about is property rights here.  We're just talking


about the definition of what a riparian right is.


MR. BAIDA:  Yes.


And just so I'm clear, Justice Kennedy, the rule


of law, not administrative hyperbole, is what governed the


judicial and the administrative review proceedings that


led to Fairfax County getting this waterway intake pipe


permit.  I mean, it -- there was -- it went through the


process.  Maryland thought it had valid reasons for


restricting the -- the permit, and Maryland was -- was


overruled, and the permit has since issued.  And so this


is not a case of Maryland just arbitrarily deciding, well,


we don't like what's happening over there, and -- and


then --


QUESTION:  So your opinion is --


QUESTION:  You -- you used the word arbitrary. 


I didn't.  I just want to know the source of law which


governs Maryland's obligation under your point of -- under


your submission to make these determinations.  And you


said it has to just be fair among riparian owners because


this is what riparian law requires it to do.


MR. BAIDA:  And I think it's also required by

the Constitution. 


QUESTION:  Your -- your point --


QUESTION:  What provision of the Constitution? 


MR. BAIDA:  I think the Due Process Clause. 


Maryland just can't arbitrarily and -- and capriciously


deprive someone of a property right.


QUESTION:  Oh, but that's just an obligation it


has as to all of its citizens.  Virginia doesn't have any


special standing as a State.


MR. BAIDA:  No.  And -- and again, it's because


of what Maryland gave up in this compact and -- and what


the Black-Jenkins Award provided.


And again, we have to go back -- and the -- the


problem with -- with the Special Master's recommendation 

from Maryland's perspective is that he began at the wrong


place in history.  He began with the compact.  He should


have begun with the charter because the plain language of


the charter gives Maryland this river, and -- and so the


question at that point, since Maryland owns this river,


Maryland does have sovereign authority over it.  So --


QUESTION:  What was wrong with the Special


Master saying, yes, Maryland has this 1632 decree.  It


looks -- this grant.  It looks pretty good.  But Virginia


has these other grants.  And I think that they're both


arguable.  So the States sensibly twice dealt with it.

 But your argument seems to hang on that 1632


document indisputably was it, and that everything else


flows from there.  The Special Master said, not


necessarily so.  They couldn't even resolve it in 1785. 


They finally resolved it in 1877, but it wasn't an


inevitable truth that it was 1632 rather than the Virginia


grants.


MR. BAIDA:  Justice Ginsburg, the -- the flaw in


the reasoning is that it ignores the plain language of the


charter which this Court said includes the Potomac River


in unmistakable terms to the further bank.  It doesn't


matter what kind of competing claims existed as of 1785


when the compact was written.


What matters is who had title, and under 

Virginia's view, Maryland was a -- this -- Maryland was


basically a deed holder.  This was a royal deed, and under


Virginia's view, this royal deed could not create rights


until it was interpreted by either the arbitrators or this


Court.


QUESTION:  But there were other royal deeds too,


different kings, but there were royal decrees that -- that


Virginia had.


MR. BAIDA:  Which this Court noted did not do


anything to divest Maryland of the authority it had under


the -- Maryland was first in time.  First in line, first

in time.  And so it had it in 1632.  There was a


subsequent deed that was given by --


QUESTION:  I thought there was -- the earliest


in time was in, wasn't it, 1609 or something?  The --


MR. BAIDA:  But in -- yes, in 1609 Virginia was


initially set up but then its charter was annulled in


1624.  It converted to a royal colony which meant that


King Charles I in 1632 had the right to carve Maryland out


of Virginia, which is what he did.  He created Maryland as


a proprietorial colony.  At that point, the only way that


Maryland could lose any rights it had under its charter


was through a quo warranto proceeding.  It was initiated


in 1685.  It never resulted in anything, as the


arbitrators in 1877 noted. 
 And so Maryland --

QUESTION:  But -- but are you saying that the


compact in 1785 and the Black-Jenkins Award in 18 -- were


-- were simply wrong because they didn't follow that


interpretation that you're giving now?


MR. BAIDA:  No, I'm not saying the compact was


wrong at all, Mr. Chief --


QUESTION:  Are you saying the Black-Jenkins


Award was wrong?


MR. BAIDA:  No.  The -- I think -- all -- all


I'm saying is that Maryland had this authority as a result


of the plain language in the charter.

 QUESTION:  Well, are you saying that the


implicit assumption at least of both the 1877 Black-


Jenkins Award and the 1785 compact -- the implicit, if not


explicit, assumption was that Maryland owned the river?


MR. BAIDA:  No.  I think a fair reading of that


document -- of -- of the -- the 1785 compact and the 1877


award was that reasonable minds may have differed.  And so


the States decided this is how we're going to address


issues of navigation.


QUESTION:  Well, but I thought I was arguing --


making your argument for you.  So -- so you -- but then,


it seems to me, that justifies the Special Master's


approach.  You -- I thought you were saying, oh, now, he


proceeded on the wrong premise.  This -- the -- the


boundary line was settled.  All -- all we're talking about


is -- is the rights -- or -- or ownership and stuff.  But


you're saying no.  If it's everything is up for grabs,


then the 1785 compact and the Black-Jenkins Award, what do


we look to?


MR. BAIDA:  If I said that, let me retrieve it


immediately because that was not what I meant to say. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BAIDA:  What I -- what I meant to say was


that Maryland's title has not changed one iota in almost


400 years.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Baida, maybe I'm missing


something here, but I did not understand that the State of


Virginia is contesting the ownership of Maryland of the


bed of the river.  Is -- is that -- is that contested by


Virginia?  I thought that they concede that the river


right up to the low-water mark on the southern shore of


the Virginia shore belongs to Maryland.  But that -- but


that does not answer the question of whether the riparian


rights given to the citizens of Virginia and to the State


of Virginia requires that -- that they obtain permission


from Maryland before withdrawing water or creating a


structure to withdraw water.


MR. BAIDA:  I agree, Justice Scalia, but it goes


a long way in resolving that question because by 

acknowledging that -- that the boundary is not in dispute,


by acknowledging that Maryland does, indeed, have title to


this river, Virginia has acknowledged Maryland's


regulatory authority --


QUESTION:  No, it hasn't because it --


QUESTION:  No, it hasn't. 


QUESTION:  But it's all -- it's all subject to


the fact that the owners on both sides of the river have


riparian rights.  Right?


MR. BAIDA:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Now, my question -- Justice Kennedy

asked it earlier, and I'm not sure you got an answer.  Who


defines the riparian rights?  I guess on Maryland's side


of the river Maryland can define the riparian rights.  Who


defines the riparian rights on the Virginia side of the


river?  Do you think Maryland has the authority to do


that, or is there a common law that's binding on us or


some kind of overriding Federal constitutional principle


at stake?


MR. BAIDA:  I think a fair reading of the


compact is that both States agreed that they couldn't


agree on where the boundary was, and so they decided --


QUESTION:  I think the fair reading is that


everybody thought there would be plenty of water, so we


didn't have to decide this.  All we're worried about is


transportation down the river, and it's not -- and now


we've got a -- a possible problem on what is enough water


to go around.


MR. BAIDA:  And -- and --


QUESTION:  And I don't know that the compact


addresses the question of who defines the riparian rights


on the Virginia side of the river.


MR. BAIDA:  And I think that both States agreed


that wherever the boundary was, the citizens of both


States would have the same rights of access to the river.


And -- and for that reason, they -- they --

 QUESTION:  Does that mean that because Maryland

QUESTION:  But is it your contention that that's

boundary is on Virginia's side, yes, Maryland gets to


decide because it's activity occurring in Maryland.  This


is Maryland --


QUESTION:  What if -- what if the Virginia


legislature passed a statute governing riparian rights on

QUESTION:  May I ask just one quick question


before you sit down?


QUESTION:  I just think it's not --


QUESTION:  Does -- does Maryland require


Virginia's citizens to have a Maryland fishing license to


fish in the Potomac?

 MR. BAIDA:  No, because that's settled by

rights to take water can, nonetheless, require prior


permission, you could also take the -- you ought to also


take the position that the right to fish requires prior


permission.  So you ought to get a Maryland fish -- I'm

fishing license --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. RAPHAEL


ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT


MR. RAPHAEL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Special Master correctly decided the


regulation issue for two reasons.  First, the language of


the compacts in question is plain and unambiguous, and


second, for more than 180 years, Maryland never disputed


that it was entirely --

 QUESTION:  Does that plain language tell us what


riparian rights are?


MR. RAPHAEL:  The plain language of article IV


of the Black-Jenkins Award uses the term riparian


ownership.


QUESTION:  But you said plain language of the


compact, and now you're all of a sudden talking about


Black-Jenkins. 


MR. RAPHAEL:  It's both. 


QUESTION:  The compact does not use the word


riparian.


MR. RAPHAEL:  That -- That's correct.  But we


think that the plain language --


QUESTION: 


So you say it's the plain language of 

the compact with the gloss of the Black-Jenkins Award.


MR. RAPHAEL:  We think it's both.


QUESTION:  What do you make -- and I don't have


this in front of me, so maybe I -- I'm missing something. 


But I thought the Black-Jenkins Award also put a --


included a disclaimer that it wasn't, in fact, modifying


anything in the 1785 compact.  Am I right?


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's -- that's correct because


the enabling legislation for the Black-Jenkins Award


provided that neither of the States would be deprived of


any of the rights or privileges, nor would the citizens be

deprived of rights or privileges that they had under the


Compact of 1785.


QUESTION:  How -- I'm sorry.


Assuming that then, how do we get from the


language of article VII in the compact that refers to


citizens to the language in Black-Jenkins that talks about


the States?


MR. RAPHAEL:  Your Honor, the citizens in


Virginia only had those rights under the compact because


Virginia as a sovereign entered into an interstate compact


with Maryland.


Secondly, Maryland recognized in the enabling


legislation that provided for the Black-Jenkins Award that


the rights were the rights not only of citizens, but of 

the States.  That language is used in the enabling act.


QUESTION:  So you -- you say that in


interpreting the Black-Jenkins Award, Virginia's riparian


ownership is -- is defined by its -- in part by its


sovereign status?


MR. RAPHAEL:  Yes, that's correct.


QUESTION:  So that sovereignty is inherent in


ownership?


MR. RAPHAEL:  I think that's correct.  If -- if


you look at the opinion that accompanied the Black-Jenkins


Award, the arbitrators said that Virginia had proven her

use of the Potomac River since her earliest days and that


her rights were, therefore, indisputable and that Maryland


assented to Virginia's use when she signed the Compact of


1785.


Now, that compact, Your Honor, was entered into


at a time when the boundary was disputed, and regardless


of where the boundary was set -- I think Mr. Baida admits


this -- it was recognized that that compact did not set


the boundary, but each State agreed that wherever the


boundary ultimately would be set, the citizens of each


State and the States themselves would have certain rights,


and those rights included the right to property in the


shores, and all advantages and emoluments thereunto


belonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out 

wharfs and other improvements. 


QUESTION:  Except for the sense of the document,


at least of the compact, as I read it, is that the State


is treated just like any other owner.


MR. RAPHAEL:  I don't think that that's correct,


Your Honor, because article --


QUESTION:  Well, can you point me to


something --


MR. RAPHAEL:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- in the compacts or the -- or the


Black-Jenkins Award to the contrary?

 MR. RAPHAEL:  Well, the Black-Jenkins Award


clearly deals with Virginia as a State.  The compact deals


with Virginia as a State in article VIII, for example,


where it requires that neither State could regulate


fishing or navigation without the concurrence of the other


State.  Articles X and XI and XII also deal with the


rights of the citizens.  Wherever the compact involved a


matter in which a State would touch the activities of the


citizens of the other State, it said so expressly.


And it's inconceivable to think that the -- the


drafters of the compact would have agreed that concurrent


legislation would be required for fishing and navigation,


but Maryland could somehow regulate Virginia's right to


build improvements from the shore.  It's inconceivable


that they would have ratified the compact if that had been


required.


QUESTION:  Why -- why is it concurrent for


fishing?  Article seventh says that the -- that the


citizens of both States -- the right of fishing in the


river shall be common to and equally enjoyed by the


citizens of both States. 


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


Article VIII requires concurrent legislation for fishing


and navigation rules in the Potomac River.


QUESTION:  For the preservation of fish or for

the performance -- for preserving and keeping open the


channel?


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Has -- has Virginia issued -- is a


Virginia fishing license valid in the -- in the Potomac?


MR. RAPHAEL:  Your Honor, until 1957, the States


had concurrent legislation governing fishing in the


Potomac River.  In 1957 -- and that was based on article


VIII of the compact.  In 1957, Maryland attempted to


abrogate that requirement and to assume unilateral


authority over the Potomac River.  Virginia filed suit


here.  This Court appointed a special master to hear the


case.  The States resolved their dispute as to the tidal


Potomac with the creation of the Potomac River Fisheries


Commission, which is a bi-State agency that now regulates


fishing in the -- in the tidal Potomac. 


As to the non-tidal Potomac, since 1957 each


State has had laws on the books that recognize permits


issued or licenses issued to citizens of the other State


as valid licenses for fishing in the non-tidal Potomac.


QUESTION:  What's left of the dispute now?  Is


-- does Virginia now have a permit to withdraw the water?


MR. RAPHAEL:  The -- the permit, Justice


O'Connor, was issued to the Fairfax County Water


Authority.

 QUESTION:  Yes.  Is that all you're arguing


about?


MR. RAPHAEL:  No, Your Honor, because we contend


that no permit was required in the first instance, and we


also challenged that specific permit because the Maryland


legislature required that it contain a condition requiring


the water authority to put a flow restrictor into the


pipeline for the sole purpose, the Maryland legislature


said, of allowing Maryland to control growth and


development in northern Virginia.  We object to that.  The


authority objected to that subject to the outcome in this


case.  We object to any --


QUESTION:  So we're -- we're talking now about a


flow restrictor in the pipe?


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  I mean, that's what it comes down to.


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's correct.  And --


QUESTION:  Well, but Virginia objects on general


principle, I take it, to the idea that Maryland can


restrict the amount of water it takes out of -- of the


Potomac.


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's exactly right, and I don't


mean to say my answer is limited to just the Fairfax


County Water Authority.  We object to the continuation by


Maryland of a permit system that requires Virginia to get

Maryland's permission anytime we want to withdraw water


from the Potomac River or build improvements appurtenant


to the shore.


QUESTION:  But do you -- what about the general


right of a riparian owner on a river to withdraw water? 


Would you say that right includes the right to withdraw an


unlimited quantity of water?


MR. RAPHAEL:  I don't believe that that would be


a riparian right, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, then who decides what limit can


be -- can be imposed on the riparian owner's right to


withdraw water?


MR. RAPHAEL:  With respect to the Potomac River,


there's a low flow allocation agreement in place that 

Congress required which allocates the flows during periods


of low flow.  There is a water coordination agreement of


1982 in place by which the three main utilities in the


District of Columbia have agreed to provide for a future


water supply. 


This Court said in Colorado --


QUESTION:  But assume there are no agreements.


QUESTION:  -- riparian question that's not


controlled by those documents. 


QUESTION:  Assume there are no agreements at


all.  Would Maryland have the right to say no more than X

amount of water may be withdrawn by any riparian owner in


Maryland or Virginia? 


MR. RAPHAEL:  No.  We don't believe they do have


that right.


QUESTION:  Could you drain the river?


MR. RAPHAEL:  Not under the low flow agreement


and not under the water supply coordination agreement,


absolutely not.


QUESTION:  No.  But let's assume there were


none.


QUESTION:  We've -- in some original


jurisdiction cases, we have decided on amounts of water. 


In fact, in the Texas against New Mexico case, there's a


-- there's a river master on the Pecos River operating 

under one of our decrees.


MR. RAPHAEL:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  This


Court said in Colorado v. New Mexico that before this


Court will enjoin any State from diverting water from the


Potomac River, the State --


QUESTION:  Well, they weren't talking about the


Potomac River.


MR. RAPHAEL:  I'm sorry.  That was the Vermejo


River.  This Court requires a showing that the diversion


would cause clear -- by clear and convincing evidence that


the diversion would cause injury to the State seeking to

prevent the diversion.


In this case, Maryland has circumvented that


requirement by controlling the tap.  Maryland doesn't


contend that anything Virginia has done to date injures


the river.


QUESTION:  No, but I mean, your -- your --


QUESTION:  If they did so contend, could they


enforce that contention?


MR. RAPHAEL:  There -- there would be many


places where they can raise that issue if Virginia


prevails in this case.  They can raise it in the context


of the Federal and Virginia permitting requirements, the


404 and section 10 permitting requirements. 


QUESTION: 


I'm just trying to -- trying to -- we 

have an original jurisdiction case involving a fight


between two States.  And assume nobody had made any


agreements other than those determining the ownership of


this river.  Would then Maryland have no right to -- to


limit the amount that Virginia could withdraw?


MR. RAPHAEL:  If -- if Maryland has a claim that


Virginia's withdrawals injure it, it has a place where it


can raise that claim.


QUESTION:  And that's here.


QUESTION:  That's --


MR. RAPHAEL:  It could be here.

QUESTION:  Assuming that the one --


QUESTION:  -- one side all the agreements and


just have a brand new problem.  Maryland or Virginia are


fighting about who can control withdrawals of water from


this river.  And is there any principle that -- that says


that someone other than the owner of the river can make


that decision? 


MR. RAPHAEL: 


Federal common law would govern 

that, as this Court said in Colorado v. New Mexico.  The


fact that that the river was in Colorado didn't give


Colorado a right to withdraw water from that river.


QUESTION:  Well, Virginia would have the same


claim against Maryland if Maryland took out too much


water.


MR. RAPHAEL:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And that's Federal common law because


two States are involved?


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's correct.  They're co-equal


sovereigns contending about an interstate river that

QUESTION:  What about a citizen of Virginia who


owns property on the -- up to the low-water mark of the


river and wants to build a dock and a pier out, that


extends out into the river?  Does that citizen have to get


permission from Maryland to do that? 


MR. RAPHAEL:  Under -- under our view of the


case, no, because the compact gave that citizen the right


to do it, subject to Federal regulations, subject to


Virginia regulation.  And Maryland can contend either in


the permitting process or independently that any action by


a Virginia citizen that -- that it can show causes injury


to Maryland shouldn't be allowed.  But --


QUESTION:  Is that what the Special Master


specifically held in your view?


MR. RAPHAEL:  The Master ruled that under the


compact and the award, Virginia and its citizens have the


right to withdraw water and to construct improvements


appurtenant to the shore without having to get permission


from Maryland.  Yes.


QUESTION:  What if Maryland takes the position


that it obstructs navigation?  Who's going to decide that? 


Virginia? 


MR. RAPHAEL:  No, Your Honor.  The primary place

process.  It's very much like then-Associate Justice


Rehnquist wrote for the Court in Milwaukee v. Illinois,


that the Federal permitting process -- that was a -- a


Federal water pollution control act case -- that the


Federal permitting process provides an adequate forum for


the State to raise concerns that it has about --


QUESTION:  Because this is a navigable river,


the Federal Government has such a scheme in place.


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's exactly right.


QUESTION:  But if -- if it did not, I -- I take


it the answer would be in -- in a Federal question suit


brought by Maryland against the Virginia citizen? 

MR. RAPHAEL:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. RAPHAEL:  I think the key evidence of -- let


me move beyond what we think is -- is the plain language


and -- and discuss also what the Master looked at with


respect to Maryland's practice historically.


The -- the key evidence here comes from 1873. 


This is at a time when Maryland and Virginia were trying


to settle their boundary dispute.  In the boundary


arbitration, Maryland contended that the boundary line


should be on the Virginia side at the low-water mark and

go around any improvements then existing or which, quote,


may hereafter be extended by authority of Virginia,


unquote.  That's at page 130 of the Virginia lodging.


In the Maryland view in 1873 and in the view


they maintained in the arbitration, it was entirely up to


Virginia to decide when, whether, and where to build


improvements from the shore.  And they actually thought


that would alter the boundary line.


QUESTION:  Could you answer this question for


me?  And in part, I'm going back on the ground that we've


been traversing already.


What is there in -- in the documents before us


-- by that, I mean the compact and the Black-Jenkins


agreement, number one, or in the law generally, number two 

-- that gives Virginia special rights as a sovereign to


withdraw water for its people as opposed to the right it


would have simply as an owner of -- of property to


withdrawal rights for that property that it owns?


MR. RAPHAEL:  I think, Your Honor, all of the


Court's equitable apportionment cases recognize that the


State has a sovereign interest in protecting the water


supply of its citizens where that water supply is served


by an interstate river.


QUESTION:  But -- but those are cases -- correct


me if I'm wrong -- in which the State owns out to the --

MR. RAPHAEL:  Justice Kennedy, most of the cases


involve a river which goes from one State into another


State, and we don't --


QUESTION:  Yes, in which each State has an


interest in the river.  But here --


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's right. 


QUESTION:  -- Virginia owns only to the -- to


the low-water mark.  And I want you to show -- tell me


something in these documents which says that Virginia has


a special right -- special rights as a sovereign --


MR. RAPHAEL:  Article IV of the Black-Jenkins --


QUESTION:  -- other than what I just -- other


than we know that Virginia is a party.


MR. RAPHAEL:  Your Honor, article IV of the


Black-Jenkins Award says Virginia has a right to the use


of the river beyond the line of low-water mark as being --


as may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her riparian


ownership.  And Maryland stipulated --


QUESTION:  But her -- but does her riparian


ownership give it any rights that are different and


greater than a private owner of land?


MR. RAPHAEL:  Absolutely.  It absolutely does.

 QUESTION:  And what is the source?


QUESTION:  And -- and what is your support for


that proposition?


MR. RAPHAEL:  This Court's Federal common law


cases that distinguish between the rights of States with


respect to a water supply and the rights of individual


citizens.


QUESTION:  But those are cases in which the


States have an ownership interest -- an equal ownership


interest in the river.


MR. RAPHAEL:  I don't think that --


QUESTION:  And is just riparian ownership.


MR. RAPHAEL:  Colorado v. New Mexico is a good


example. 


The Pecos River -- 75 percent of it came from 

Colorado, and it then flowed into New Mexico.  But this


Court effectively denied Colorado any use of that river


regardless of the fact that she owned the river. 


Ownership is not dispositive in -- in a dispute between


States over a -- a water supply that supplies the citizens


of both States.


Now, the Potomac River is an interstate river. 


The Congress recognized that in 1976 when it required the


waters to be allocated.  A drop of water that begins in


the Shenandoah is not a Virginia drop of water anymore


than it's a Maryland drop of water when it's in the main

QUESTION:  I think at the -- I think at the


least, would you concede or would you -- that the Black-


Jenkins agreement goes a step beyond the -- the compact in


this regard?


MR. RAPHAEL:  We think it's at least coextensive


with the compact, but I -- I don't -- I think that that


position would be defensible but it does go beyond --


QUESTION:  Well, isn't it --


QUESTION:  But you --


QUESTION:  -- isn't it limiting in this extent? 


There is something in this fourth article of the Black --


of the 1877 arbitration award that refers to without --


without impeding navigation -- that's been there 

throughout -- or otherwise interfering with the proper use


of it by Maryland.  What would those words suggest other


than Maryland can permit the use to assure that its proper


use is not interfered with?


MR. RAPHAEL:  Your Honor, those words give


Maryland a right of action and a cause of action against


Virginia or the user if it -- if the use interferes with


Maryland's use of the river.  That doesn't mean Maryland


gets to decide.  No State can control another State's


access to the water supply and no State can be a party to


a dispute and -- and then fairly decide that dispute.

 QUESTION:  But you are depending then on what

the compact and not the words of -- of the -- the Black-


Jenkins.


MR. RAPHAEL:  No.  Your Honor, we rely on -- on


the -- the plain language of the compact and the Black-


Jenkins Award which clearly give Virginia the right to the


use of the --


QUESTION:  But I -- I thought when Justice


Kennedy pressed you, your -- you ultimately rested on


Federal common law.


MR. RAPHAEL:  My understanding of Justice


Kennedy's question was whether there's a distinction


between riparian -- the rights of -- of riparian users as 

private users and the rights of States as riparians.  And


I was answering that question that yes, there is a


difference, as this Court has repeatedly said.  The civil


law as between riparian users does not bind States with


respect to their use of an interstate stream.  That was


the question I -- I was answering.


QUESTION:  Mr. Raphael, what -- it's your


position that if -- I believe, that if a private


landowner, riparian owner on the Virginia side, the


southern shore, wants to build a pier out into the river,


that pier would be permitted by Virginia?

QUESTION:  You see, I can understand the


authority for Maryland to permit it since Maryland owns


the river bed.  What -- what is the authority for Virginia


to demand a permit from its riparian owners?


MR. RAPHAEL:  Virginia has the right to regulate


its citizens' use of the river, and it -- it has been


doing that for many years through the local building


permit requirement that you can't build a -- a pier or a


wharf on the Virginia side, even though it goes beyond


low-water mark, without getting a -- a building permit


from the -- from the county. 
 Virginia has enacted --

QUESTION:  Because of its State riparian


sovereignty over -- because of its State sovereignty over


the bank.


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's correct.  And Virginia has


enacted, subject to the resolution of this case, a -- the


Virginia water permit protection requirement applicable to


Virginia users of the river.  So if -- if Virginia


prevails in this case, Maryland will regulate its users of


the river and Virginia will regulate its users of the


river.


QUESTION:  But what if there's a -- a pier going

between uses that are riparian and uses that are not


riparian.  99 percent of everything that's ever been built


there --


QUESTION:  Well, repairing the end of a pier, is


that a riparian use or a non-riparian?


MR. RAPHAEL:  That would be a riparian use. 


Operating a casino on the pier would not be a riparian


use, and that's why Virginia has not objected to a wide


variety of activities by Maryland on its side of the line


that don't go to whether Virginia has the right to build


the riparian structure in the first place.


QUESTION:  And for that answer, I take it, you


-- you do rest on article VII of the 1785 compact.


MR. RAPHAEL:  Article VII and article IV of the


Black-Jenkins Award. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  What about operating a fishing pier,


charging for -- who -- who would have the authority to tax


the fishing pier?  Is that a riparian use or not riparian?


MR. RAPHAEL:  Well, there may be uses that are


in between in gray as to whether it's a riparian use --


QUESTION:  Yes.  I tried to pick one.


MR. RAPHAEL:  Let me -- here's -- I'm not sure


how the question would be answered, but let me tell you

what the guiding principles would be.  Most of the uses,


the States are going to agree, are riparian uses,


traditional things, bulkheads, piers, wharfs, docks, water


intakes, as the Master found.  There are a number of uses


that, we'll agree, are non-riparian.  Building a casino in


the middle of the river.  If there's a gray area in


between and -- and we've got an argument that it's


riparian and Maryland has an argument it's not, that issue


may have to be litigated if we can't resolve it.  But


that's the framework I think that answers these questions.


Now --


QUESTION:  Is that why the Special Master said


gambling, safety rules, health, tax, licensing, all of


that is irrelevant to this case? 


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's -- that's exactly right,


Justice Ginsburg, because after Maryland -- after the


boundary was set on the -- on the Virginia side at low-


water mark in 1877, Virginia doesn't dispute that Maryland


acquired a wide range of police powers on its side of the


boundary, but that specifically did not apply to those


rights that Virginia and its citizens enjoyed under the


Compact of 1785 and which were preserved as a condition of


the Black-Jenkins Award and which Maryland historically,


at least until 1957, recognized was entirely up to


Virginia to decide what to do on Virginia's shore.

 QUESTION:  Does Maryland or Virginia tax the --


the value of a -- of a major pier that goes out into the


river?  I mean, it's worth something, and I assume there's


a tax on it.  Anything that's worth anything is taxed.


MR. RAPHAEL:  Your Honor, there are something


like 340 piers extending from the Virginia side of the


Potomac River.  All -- all of them are taxed by the -- by


Virginia.  Only -- there are only three properties that


are taxed by Maryland and those are unique.  They're


restaurant properties that are sited on property that's --


the fee simple title to which is recorded in Maryland. 


Those are on the Maryland side of the line.  So Virginia


taxes 99 percent of those improvements. 


Maryland argued that -- that you should -- the 

Court should look at its taxation of those three


restaurant properties.  We think that that is the


exception the proves the rule.  Maryland doesn't tax 99


percent of everything that Virginia has ever built.


The Maryland construction in 1873 that it was


entirely up to Virginia to decide when and whether and


where to build improvements remained their construction


until at the earliest 1957.  And it was in 1957 when the


first permit was issued to a Virginia user that was


Fairfax County, but the record is undisputed that that


permit was not known to Virginia State officials.

 QUESTION:  In the -- in the compact beginning


with article or clause VIII, there's some very particular


assignments of sovereign powers, abrogation of sovereign


power, but that doesn't apply in VII.  And it seems to me


that that helps Maryland in this case.  When the compact


wanted to provide Virginia would have very specific police


powers, it provided it, but it didn't provide that with


respect to riparian rights.  In fact, it doesn't even


mention riparian rights.  It just talks about wharfs.


MR. RAPHAEL:  It refers to the advantages and


emoluments.


QUESTION:  Referring to the compact.


MR. RAPHAEL:  Right.  The article VII refers to


the advantages and emoluments of the ownership of land. 

QUESTION:  But that -- it doesn't use the word


riparian.


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's -- that's exactly right.


But the answer to your question, Your Honor, is that there


was no need in article VII to address that specific


question because it was -- everybody would have assumed


that each State retained the authority to regulate its own


citizens.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm -- I'm not so sure.  If --


if three or four provisions of the contract -- of the


compact have very specific abrogations or assignment of

sovereignty and the other one doesn't, I -- I would assume


that there is -- that that provision has not been made.


MR. RAPHAEL:  But, Your Honor, it's -- to our


thinking it would be inconceivable that George Mason who


-- who negotiated that compact on behalf of Virginia, who


opposed the Federal Constitution because it gave Congress


too much authority over -- over commerce, that he would


have signed an agreement with the understanding that


Maryland had the authority to decide when and where


Virginia could make use of the river.


QUESTION:  Well, other than he's operating from


the baseline where Maryland owns the river.


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's -- but history is the other


way. 


That's Maryland's argument, is that it always had 

every stick in the bundle of sticks, but historically


that's not the case because there were prior and


subsequent grants to Virginia which included the Potomac


River.  Five monarchs disputed Maryland's claim.  And the


issue was in controverse, as this Court has twice said in


Morris v. United States and Marine Railway, and they


agreed in 1785 that the bundle of sticks was over here and


the two States agreed that regardless of where the


boundary would be set, each State would have equal sticks


from that bundle representing the right of equal access to


the river, and they further agreed that as a condition of

the award, those sticks in that bundle would never be


deprived of either State.  And if Maryland didn't have the


authority to take away or regulate Virginia's rights prior


to 1877, they could not have gained that authority by the


Black-Jenkins Award.


QUESTION:  Yes, but it seems to me that as a


matter of sort of looking at history and all, at the time


these documents were negotiated and prepared, I don't


think anyone contemplated the possibility that a diversion


of water from the river would be so great that it might


lower the low-water mark.  And is it your view that --


that Virginia could syphon off enough water to reduce the


-- move the low-water mark about, say, a foot, but not


obstruct navigation? 


Clearly, they couldn't take that 

much out.  But could they change the State -- the boundary


of the State by doing that?


MR. RAPHAEL:  Part of that question, Your Honor,


goes to the -- goes to whether the boundary is at the


historic low-water mark or at the mean low-water mark.


QUESTION:  I see. 


MR. RAPHAEL:  And I don't think the Court has


answered that question, and that may require resolution in


the future.  But --


QUESTION:  I don't know how you'd know what the


historic low-water mark was if you --

 MR. RAPHAEL:  This Court determined in Ohio v.


Kentucky what the low-water mark was as of 1792.


QUESTION:  We can do that kind of stuff. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  You -- you would say -- but assuming


-- assume there is a -- a -- now an understanding of what


the border is and it's a fixed border.  Could Virginia


change that by drawing -- withdrawing water in your view?


MR. RAPHAEL:  Again, I think it's going to


depend on whether it's the historic low or the mean low,


and if -- you have to answer that question before I think


you can answer the question. 


QUESTION:  But you do say that even if it might


not change the boundary of the State, they could withdraw 

as much water as they want as long as it doesn't interfere


with the transportation on the river.


MR. RAPHAEL:  And as long as it doesn't


interfere with Maryland's use, and once it does, Maryland


has a remedy.  It can object in the permitting process. 


It can file an original action.  It could sue the Virginia


user making use of that water. 


The issue, though, is whether Maryland gets to


decide in the first instance what Virginia's rights are,


and this Court has never given one State the authority to


control another State's water supply.

 QUESTION:  Well, generally riparian owners are


own -- have the -- the right to withdraw water subject to


the overriding control of the governmental body that


controls the -- the lake or the river, whatever it is.


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's right.


QUESTION:  But you're saying that's not true


here.


MR. RAPHAEL:  It is true here.  Virginians can


withdraw water subject to paramount Federal control and


subject to Virginia's control.


QUESTION:  But not subject to the control of the


owner of the river.


MR. RAPHAEL:  They can withdraw water subject to


Virginia's control.


QUESTION:  But riparian ownership usually


contemplates beneficial use of the waters on the riparian


land, not just general withdrawal for inland uses.


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's correct, Your Honor.  But


this Court has said in a number of cases, including New


York -- New Jersey v. New York, Connecticut v.


Massachusetts, that a common law limitation that may limit


it to the shoreline use of the riparian use would not


apply as between States.  And article VII of the --


article IV of the Black-Jenkins Award refers to Virginia's


rights as a sovereign to the use of the Potomac.

 QUESTION:  Strictly speaking --


QUESTION:  No, it doesn't say as a sovereign. 


It -- it says Virginia.  It does not say as a sovereign. 


This is very important. 


MR. RAPHAEL:  Well --


QUESTION:  I'm right. 


MR. RAPHAEL:  It doesn't use the word sovereign,


but I don't -- I fail to see the distinction --


QUESTION:  Of course, it does not use the word.


MR. RAPHAEL:  -- because both in the award and


in the -- in the opinion, the arbitrators were talking


about Virginia as a commonwealth, as a State, not -- not


Virginia as -- as a mere property owner.


QUESTION: 


Well, they were talking about 

Virginia as a sovereign when it has a right to regulate,


but the question is whether they were talking about


Virginia as a sovereign when it withdraws water.


MR. RAPHAEL:  Well, the issue of withdrawing


water, whether that's a riparian use, has been -- has been


stipulated.  The Master said at page 12 of his report that


Maryland never disputed that this was a riparian use or a


use covered by the compact.  So that's not an issue.


QUESTION:  I think it's fair to say that article


fourth acknowledges that Virginia is what you might call a


riparian sovereign.  It has sovereign rights over -- over

the bank of the river.  It says is entitled not only to


full dominion over the soil to low-water mark, blah, blah,


blah, blah, but such use of the river beyond the line of


low -- as may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her


riparian ownership.


MR. RAPHAEL:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And I think that's referring to


sovereign ownership.


MR. RAPHAEL:  I -- I agree with that, Justice


Scalia. 


I'd like to correct one misstatement I think my


friend, Mr. Baida, made with respect to the Low Flow


Allocation Agreement.  That agreement and the -- the


enabling legislation that provided for it was amended to 

make clear that Maryland did not have the authority to


control Virginia's withdrawals.  That issue was put aside


to another day, and the Low Flow Allocation Agreement, for


example, says that no party can withdraw water from the


Potomac River without being subject to a permit which


imposes the low flow conditions or becoming a member party


to the agreement.  And we point out in our papers the


numerous instances in the 1970's where Virginia went on


record saying Maryland did not have the authority to


regulate Virginia's water withdrawals.


Whether you look at this case under the -- under

the compacts in question or under the -- under Federal


common law, you cannot give one State the authority to


control another State's water supply.  This case is


important not only because of Virginia's rights to build


wharfs and improvements.  It's important because if


Maryland prevails, they can control growth and development


in -- in Virginia.  Under Mr. Baida's theory, as long as


they treat everybody equally, they can do anything they


want, and that would include things like in 2001 when


there was legislation before the Maryland General Assembly


that would have made users of the -- of the waters pay for


water withdrawal.  Maryland could decide that it doesn't


like growth and development on either side of the river,


and therefore it's treating each State equally by not 

allowing any use.  It's impossible to square that type of


position with the plain language of article IV of the


award or article VII of the compact.


And if there are no further questions, thank you


very much. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Raphael.


Mr. Baida, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW H. BAIDA


ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF


MR. BAIDA:  Prior to this case, Virginia has


never taken the position that it has any authority to take

any kind of regulatory action at all with respect to piers


and wharfs beyond the water mark.  And in fact, what


Virginia has done is it has sent hundreds of its citizens


to Maryland and it has told its citizens that their


construction projects from the Virginia side of the


Potomac River fall outside of Virginia's jurisdiction but


fall within Maryland's because Maryland owns the bed of


the river.  That ownership gives Maryland the right,


putting aside just for the moment any agreements -- it


gives Maryland the right to regulate withdrawals of water


from Maryland.


And so what we're left with at this moment is


article VI, the fourth paragraph, of the Black-Jenkins


Award, and it says it does give Virginia full dominion 

over the right in the soil, but Justice Scalia, I would


disagree it gives Virginia any sovereign rights to use the


river beyond that point because if it gave Virginia the


unrestricted right to use the Potomac River beyond that


point, that's called quiet title.  That means Virginia


gets to do what it wants.  Maryland can't regulate it, and


this Court said in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe that that


kind of regulatory action, if unrestricted, is the


equivalent of a quiet title action.


The Black-Jenkins arbitrators rejected


Virginia's claim to any title to the middle of the river.

They set Virginia's boundary at low-water mark on the


Virginia side.  They could have done the boundary line. 


They could have drawn it around the piers and wharfs. 


They showed an unbelievable dexterity in drawing the


boundary through Smith Island.  They went from the bottom


of the Chesapeake Bay up through the bottom third of Smith


Island and back down again.  They didn't do that on the


Virginia side of the Potomac.  They set low-water mark on


Virginia's side.


Title to -- Virginia has title to low-water


mark, but only a right of use beyond that point.  It has


not an unrestricted right of use.  The right of us is


subject to governmental authority.  The government that


gets to regulate it is the government that owns it. 

Thank you. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Baida.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
