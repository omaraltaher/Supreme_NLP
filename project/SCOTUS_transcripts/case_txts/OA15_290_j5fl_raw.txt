CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  this  morning  in  Case  15­290,  the  United  States  Army 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corps  of  Engineers  v.  Hawkes  Company. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Stewart. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MALCOLM  L.  STEWART 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

              

A  jurisdictional  determination  issued  by  the 

 

 

 

 

Army  Corps  of  Engineers  is  not  final  agency  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  does  not  order  any  person  to  do  or  refrain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  doing  anything  and  does  not  alter  anyone's  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  and  obligations.  The  jurisdictional 

  

 

 

 

determination,  or  JD,  expresses  the  Corps'  opinion  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  a  particular  tract  contains  waters  protected  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  Clean  Water  Act.  That  stated  opinion  may  affect  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipient's  assessment  of  the  options  available  to  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it  does  not  affect  the  actual  legal  status  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

options. 

            

This  Court's  precedents  made  clear  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  effects  on  which  Respondents  rely  are  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  ground  for  treating  an  agency  communication 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  final  agency  action.

Now,  the  Respondents  primarily  emphasize  the 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  impact  that  the  Corps'  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  would  have  upon  themselves,  the  recipients 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  intended  audience.  And  they  say  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  determination  indicating  that  the  Corps 

 

 

 

 

 

believes  there  are  waters  of  the  United  States  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Property  will  force  them  to  choose  among  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unattractive  options:  One,  would  be  seeking  a  permit 

   

  

 

 

 

 

which  could  be  an  expensive  process  and  wouldn't  be  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  means  certain  to  succeed;  the  second  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharging  pollutants,  discharging  fill  onto  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Property  and  taking  their  chances  in  a  future 

   

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  action;  and  the  third  would  be  playing  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

safe,  forgoing  development  entirely. 

 

 

 

            

And  the  problem  with  Respondents'  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  that  choice  would  have  existed  before  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  determination  was  issued.  It  would  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

existed  if  the  Corps  had  never  adopted  its  practice  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issuing  jurisdictional  determinations  upon  request. 

 

 

 

 

It's  simply  a  choice  that  is  posed  by  the  Clean  Water 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  If  there  were  a  provision  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

law  saying  that  a  jurisdictional  determination  by  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Corps  or  by  the  EPA  is  binding  on  the  federal  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  future  litigation,  would  that  be  reviewable?

MR.  STEWART:  I  think  if  the  ­­ if  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  said  that,  we  would  have  a  very  different  case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  in  that  case  we  would  have  something  much  closer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Bennett  v.  Spear. 

 

 

 

            

In  Bennett  v.  Spear,  the  Corps  ­­ the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  dealing  with  a  biological  opinion  issued  by  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  agency,  the  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  to  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  agency,  the  Bureau  of  Reclamation,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included  an  incidental  take  statement.  And  the  terms 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  conditions  of  the  incidental  take  statement  affected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legal  options  that  were  available  to  the  Bureau  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reclamation. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  it  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different  case,  but  are  you  able  to  say  whether  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  reviewable  under  the  EPA? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Yes.  I  think  if  the  ­­ if  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corps'  jurisdictional  determination  were  legally  binding 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  the  EPA,  if  it  foreclosed  the  possibility  of  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  ­­ of  an  EPA  enforcement  action  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  with  the  terms  of  the  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination,  yes,  we  think  that  the  JD  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicially  reviewable. 

 

            

But  I  think  it's  important  to  ­­ to  point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  how  far  removed  that  is  from  the  actual  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  us.  That  is  ­­

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  let  me  just  ask  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  far  removed  it  is.  There  is  no  such  statute,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  is  true,  but  there  is  a  Memorandum  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Understanding  between  the  Army  and  the  EPA,  and  it  says, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote,  "case­specific  determinations"  ­­ and  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

that  includes  jurisdictional  determinations  ­­ "made 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this  Memorandum  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Understanding  will  be  binding  on  the  government  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represent  the  government's  position  and  any  subsequent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  action  or  litigation  regarding  the  case." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  is  your  ­­ would  your  argument  be  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  this  is  in  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed  to  a  statute  or  a  regulation,  the  situation  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

different,  and  that  is  insufficient  to  make  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  determination  reviewable? 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  That  would  be  one  argument, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  other  argument,  and  I  think  we've  made  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  in  the  reply  brief,  that  particular  Memorandum  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Understanding  was  dealing  with  what  are  referred  to  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"special  case  determinations." 

 

 

            

There  are  ­­ situations  occasionally  arise 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  agencies  perceive  at  the  outset  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  dicey  questions.  There  could  be  questions  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coverage  on  which  the  Corps  and  EPA  might  disagree.  And

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  don't  ­­ I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

sorry  to  stop  you  right  there,  but  I  don't  think  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  I'm  looking  at  the  Memorandum  as  well,  and  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  in  Section  2  ­­ no,  I'm  sorry,  (4)(C)(ii),  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describes  nonspecial  cases.  It  says,  "For  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

projects  not  involving  a  special  case,  the  DE"  ­­ in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  the  district  engineer,  the  Army  Corps,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

EPA  ­­ "the  DE  shall  make  final  determinations  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicate  those  determinations  without  a  requirement 

   

 

 

 

for  prior  consultation  with  EPA." 

 

 

 

 

            

So  while  it  talks  about  the  division  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  between  special  cases  and  the  mine­run  cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  certainly  says  something  about  nonspecial  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  what  Section  2  is  titled  "Nonspecial  Cases." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  But  ­­ but  we  understand  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  about  the  ultimate  determination  being  binding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  government  in  subsequent  litigation  as  referring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  special  case  determinations. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

see  how  you  can  do  that.  I'm  looking,  you  know,  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6(a).  It  says  all  final  determinations  must  be  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

writing  and  signed  by  either  the  DA  ­­ either  the  Army 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corps  person  ­­ or  the  regional  administrator  ­­ the  EPA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person. 

            

And  it  says  that  those  will  be  binding  on

MR.  STEWART:  I  ­­ I  take  it  we're  looking 

    

   

 

 

 

 

at  the  1989  memorandum,  Memorandum  of  Agreement? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It's  the  one  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

yeah,  the  one  you  cite  in  footnote  3  of  the  reply  brief, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  say  that  it  does  not  address  mine­run  core 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  determinations. 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  I  ­­ I  think  we  would  still 

    

   

 

 

 

 

think  of  the  ­­ the  general  ­­ the  final  determinations

How  can  you  read  that  as  applying  only  to  the  special

that  is  referring  specifically  to  special  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determinations. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes,  this  MOA 

  

 

 

 

 

decides  what's  a  special  case  and  what's  not,  and  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells  you  what  happens  when  it's  not.  So  I  just  don't

and  practice  you've  never  done  it?  You  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  within  Bennett's  second  prong. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  It's  not  within  Bennett's 

  

 

 

 

 

second  prong  in  the  same  way  that  in  Franklin  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  that  ­­ the  practice  of  the  President  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  been  to  transmit  the  figures  and  do  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apportionment  in  accordance  with  the  figures  that  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepared  by  the  Secretary  of  Commerce.  But  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  what  mattered  was  there  ­­ there  was  no  legal  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legally  binding  obligation  on  the  President  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  also  say  that  independent  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility  of  an  EPA  enforcement  action,  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  realistic  possibility  of  a  private  citizen  suit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

The  fact  that  the  Corps  concludes  that  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters  are  not  present  wouldn't  preclude  a  citizen  suit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  being  filed  challenging  that  premise  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge  activity  ­­

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  the  question 

  

 

 

 

 

is,  I  think,  whether  it's  final  with  respect  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corps'  determination,  not  with  respect  to  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  else  might  be  able  to  bring  a  suit,  and  ­­ and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  what  Justice  Sotomayor  is  suggesting  is  that  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  and,  what  I  was  suggesting,  in  law  is  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  with  respect  to  the  Corps.

presents  new  information,  if  the  ­­ if  in  the  course  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  permitting  process  the  applicant  asks  the  Court  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconsider  its  prior  jurisdictional  determination,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Corps  is  not  going  to  reconsider  it  sua  sponte  during 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  five­year  period  while  it  remains  in  effect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  you  are  arguing,  then,  is  that  there  are  exceptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  what  is  otherwise  a  safe  harbor. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  It's  ­­ it's  not  intended  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  ­­ first  of  all,  the  jurisdictional  determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we're  talking  about  here,  the  one  that's  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  challenged,  was  one  that  concluded  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  waters  were  present.  And  it's  clear  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  sort  of  jurisdictional  determination  has  no  binding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  on  anyone.  The  landowner  is  still  legally  free 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  disagree  and  to  discharge  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  a  great  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

great  practical  risk.  I  mean,  the  ­­ the  Corps  comes  in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  says  these  are  jurisdictional  waters.  And  you  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yeah,  well,  you  can  go  ahead.  You  can  still  dump  and  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  you  want  and  take  your  chances  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  a  different  ruling  later  on  down  the  road.

The  other  alternative  that  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Property  owner  has  is  to  seek  a  permit  to  discharge  fill

the  mechanism  that  Congress  designed  to  allow  people  to

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well  ­­ well,  it's  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arduous  and  very  expensive.  So  for  a  landowner  who 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

thinks,  I  shouldn't  be  under  this  Clean  Water  Act  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all,  and  now  they  have  to  go  through  this  whole  process, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  going  to  take  years  and  cost  me  a  lot  of  money. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  And  ­­ and  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

legal  ­­ our  legal  system  confronts  that  type  of  problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  type  of  tradeoff  in  a  lot  of  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contexts.  For  example,  that  was  exactly  the  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Standard  Oil  made  in  FTC  v.  Standard  Oil. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  FTC  has  commenced  an  administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding  in  which  Standard  Oil  was  charged  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violating  the  law.  And  there  was  ­­ I  believe  the

a  statutory  threshold  that  the  FTC  had  to  surmount

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Sometimes  it  doesn't.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

I  joined  Bennett,  and  the  reason  I  joined  it  is  it  says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  second  prong,  "Or  from  which  legal  consequences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flow."  So  I  would  assume  that  nothing  in  Bennett  ­­ or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  would  have  dissented  ­­ is  intended  to  overrule  what  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  the  great  case  on  the  matter,  which  is  Abbott 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Labs. 

            

And  Harlan,  in  Abbott  Labs,  explains 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  and  thoroughly  what  this  Court  has  done  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Frozen  Food  Express,  what  the  Court  did  in  Storer.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  point  you're  now  making,  what  he  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  is  the  ICC  order  is  right  for  review,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  it  would  have  no  effect  until  later.  Someone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  to  bring  a  particular  action. 

   

 

 

 

            

He  says  that  in  Storer,  the  Commission, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  determination  is  ripe,  even  though  it  would  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  a  television  license  ­­ that's  what  the  policy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  ­­ even  though  no  specific  application  was  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court.  So  it  wouldn't  take  effect  until  later. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  same  thing  is  true  precisely  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  in  Abbott  Labs  itself.  It  was  a  statement  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting  what  the  Commission  would  do,  and  nothing

was  going  to  happen.  Nothing  happened,  unless  later  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  decided  to  violate  it.  Much  like  this.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  they  violated  it,  nothing  would  happen,  unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Commission  decided  to  prosecute. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  Justice  Ginsburg  said  was,  once  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  in  effect,  okay,  now  what  happens?  The  person  who  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  it  has  to  take  certain  steps  because  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  One,  spend  $150,000  to  try  to  get  an  exception  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fail,  or  two,  do  nothing,  violate  it,  and  possibly  go  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prison.  Those  sound  like  important  legal  consequences 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  flow  from  an  order  that,  in  respect  to  the  Agency, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  final,  for  it  has  nothing  left  to  do  about  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation. 

            

courts. 

            

And  B,  is  perfectly  suited  for  review  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  we  have  harm  flowing  from  a  change  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  relations,  we  have  an  agency  that  has  nothing  left 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  on  this  particular  matter,  and  we  have  a  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  perfectly  suited  to  review  it.  I  would  say  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flows  from  Abbott  Labs,  almost  QED.  So  what  is  your  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  your  response  to  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Well,  with  respect  to  Abbott 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Labs  specifically  ­­ excuse  me  ­­ Abbott  Labs  dealt  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  regulation  that  essentially  required  that  on  each

appeared,  including  it  on  the  labeling,  the  generic  name 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  drug  had  to  appear  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  regulation,  as  rules  typically  do, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  phrased  as  a  ­­ as  a  directive.  It  said 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

manufacturers  shall  do  this.  It  was  a  legal  ­­ legal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

command. 

            

 

In  Standard  Oil,  the  court  dealt  with  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  various  contexts,  we  have  held  that  regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  immediately  reviewable  as  final  agency  action, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

although  the  court  engages  in  a  separate  ripeness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

discussion. 

            

The  second  thing  I  would  say  about  Bennett 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  Bennett  court,  I  think,  was  quite  careful  not  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest  its  decision  on  the  practical  impact  that  the  order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  on  the  recipient.  It  rested  its  decision  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  the  biological  opinion  constrained  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  obligation  options  available  to  the  Bureau  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reclamation,  because  only  by  complying  with  the  FWS's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms  and  conditions  could  the  Bureau  of  Reclamation  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  immunity  from  Endangered  Species  Act  liability  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  wanted. 

 

            

The  third  thing  I  would  say,  and  to  return 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  my  prior  point  about  FTC  v.  Standard  Oil,  it  happens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  lot  in  the  law  that  we  are  confronted  with  a  situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  this,  where  a  particular  government  decision  is

of  the  day,  I  will  be  put  to  substantial  burden  and

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Stewart,  may  I  ask 

   

  

 

 

 

you,  please  don't  panic  by  asking  this  question.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  don't  resist  it,  because  I  know  all  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  resisting  it.  But  assuming  we  disagree  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  that  that  should  be  appealable,  what's  the  narrowest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  right  this  that  the  government  would  like? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  I  guess  if  the  ­­ if  the  Court

agreement,  such  that  the  EPA  would  be  foreclosed  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking  action  based  on  its  disagreement  with  the  Corps'

Federal  government  there  are  compliance  offices  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various  kinds  whose  function  is  to  give  advice  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  And  often  that  advice  comes  with  very  specific 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recommendations.  It  says  we  will  not  take  enforcement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  if,  or,  we  do  not  consider  it  a  violation  of  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  following  facts. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  guess  what  I  want  to  know  is  your  view 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  how  this  program  compares  to  various  other  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

programs  like  this,  whether  it's  the  ­­ whether  it's  tax 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  letters,  or  SEC  opinion  letters,  or  FCC  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever,  how  this  program  compares  to  those  and  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  could  draw  sensible  lines,  because  mostly  we  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  agencies  to  do  these  things.  We  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  helps  people,  to  actually  know  what  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinks  about  particular  factual  situations.  So  how  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  draw  lines  in  this  area,  in  your  view? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Well,  I  mean,  it  ­­ I  guess 

   

   

  

 

 

 

part  of  the  ­­ the  difficulty  I  have  with  your  question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ or  I  should  say  I  think  if  you  were  drawing  lines, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jurisdictional  determination  at  issue  here  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairly  far  removed  from  anything  that  ought  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicially  reviewable,  because  in  many  of  the  instances,

the  informal  advice  that  agencies  are  giving,  it  is

Somebody  may  come  to  the  Agency  and  say  I'm

or  the  other.  We  ­­ the  likelihood  that  an  agency  would

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

underlying  Justice  Kagan's  question  is  that  the  Clean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Water  Act  is  unique  in  both  being  quite  vague  in  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach,  arguably  unconstitutionally  vague,  and  certainly 

 

 

 

 

 

harsh  in  the  civil  and  criminal  sanctions  it  puts  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice. 

            

What's  the  closest  analogous  statute  that 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  the  affected  party  so  little  guidance  at  the  front 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end? 

            

MR.  STEWART:  Well,  I  think  with  respect  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  vast  majority  of  sites  in  this  country,  it's  readily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparent  whether  the  Clean  Water  Act  applies;  that  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  point  is  somewhat  removed  from  the  actual  facts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  this  case,  but  it  happens  all  the  time  that  at

parties  will  dig  up  a  lot  of  dirt  and  deposit  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhere  else.  And  they're  doing  something  that  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  illegal  if  it  occurred  in  waters  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,  but  nobody  thinks  there's  a  problem, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

because  in  the  vast  bulk  of  its  ­­ in  the  vast  bulk  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

locations,  there  really  isn't  a  quandary. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  imagine  a  statute  that  said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

before  you  can  do  anything  like  that,  you  have  to  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Corps  and  get  advance  assurance  that  these  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  waters  of  the  United  States,  it  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exponentially  more  burdensome. 

 

 

              

I  take  your  point  that  there  are  certainly  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  range  of  tracks  where  the  application  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  is  authentically  ambiguous.  But  the  ­­ the  thing  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say  about  that  is  Congress  has  designed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitting  process.  There  are  other  statutes  in  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulated  parties  have  no  statutory  mechanism  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  an  advance  ruling  as  to  the  legality  of  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct.  They  have  to  either  do  it  and  take  their

as  ­­ as  I  understand  it,  would  be  a  jurisdictional 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

determination;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  STEWART:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Okay.  And  at  the  end  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that,  can  the  landowner  get  judicial  review  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  is  that  it  ­­ it  is  subject  to  the  Clean

administrative  appeal  and  judicial  review? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  I  think  it  would  still  have  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  through  the  rest  of  the  permitting  process.  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  part  of  the  point  for  that  is  it  ­­ it  may  be  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during  the  rest  of  the  permitting  process,  the  landowner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  have  no  prospect,  except,  perhaps,  of  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  appeal,  of  persuading  the  court  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reexamine  its  jurisdictional  determination.  That

mean,  you  put  in  your  brief  he  risks  it.  In  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  ­­ and  I  think  the  point  raised,  of  course,  you  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  good  idea  to  give  people  advice.  Abbott  Labs 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

takes  care  of  that.  One  of  the  three  important  features 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Abbott  Labs  is  you  look  at  it  from  the  point  of  view 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Agency.  And  you  say,  how  formal  is  it?  What  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  left  to  be  done? 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  this  case,  we  have  a  whole  set,  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  part  of  the  CFR  which  is  devoted  this,  which  goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  varied  ­­ it's  called  "Jurisdictional  Determination 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Instructional  Guidebook."  The  Army  Corps  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Engineers  is  brought  in.  Once  they  make  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination,  it's  called  the  Agency's  official  view. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  stated  it  remains  in  effect  for  five  years,  unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions  change. 

 

            

And  you,  in  your  brief,  say  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issuance  of  an  approved  jurisdictional  determination 

 

 

 

 

 

marks  the  culmination  of  the  distinct  process  by  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Corps  informs  a  landowner  whether  the  Corps  believes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  covered  waters  are  present. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  that  doesn't  sound  like  someone  giving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informal  advice,  and  there's  an  appeal  process.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sounds  like  a  formal  system  of  answering  a  question, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

which  question  is:  Are  these  lands  wetlands,  Federal  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not?

Now,  if  you  give  some  kind  of  informal 

 

 

 

 

 

advice,  fine.  You'd  come  to  a  different  result.  But 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

I've  just  listed  the  things  here  that  suggest  it  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  all  formal.  It's  a  five  ­­ informal.  It's  a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

five­year  formal,  definite  procedurally  guided  CFR 

 

 

 

 

 

determination. 

            

MR.  STEWART:  I  would  agree  that  the  process 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  culminates  in  the  approved  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  is  much  more  formal  and  ­­ and  elaborate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  the  process  that  would  usually  culminate  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  advice  letters  that  Justice  Kagan  is  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  Well,  if  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

so,  we  have  the  other  part  of  the  problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  But  I  ­­ I  don't  think  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

formality  of  the  process  really  has  much  to  do  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  on  ­­ the  practical  basis  on  which  Respondent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  get  into  court;  that  is,  if  this  had  been  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  less  formal  document,  but  it  had  still  manifested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Corps'  view  that  jurisdictional  waters  were  present, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  Respondents  would  say  they  would  be  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  same  practical  pressure  either  to  go  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  isn't  just  the  pressure.

Federal  government.  And  this  vast  Federal  government

think,  is  also  a  public  policy  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  I  agree  that  it's  a  public 

    

   

 

 

 

policy  question,  but  as  I  was  saying  about  Standard  Oil

MR.  STEWART:  I  don't  know  why  the  ­­ the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

formality  including  the  administrative  appeal  was 

 

 

 

 

 

provided.  I  think  it  was  intended  as  a  service  to  ­­ to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landowners,  that  the  Corps  wanted  to  give  the  best 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advice.  The  only  other  thing  I  would  say  about  ­­

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Was  there  ­­ was  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything  in  it  for  the  EPA  or  the  Corps?  I  mean,  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  we  ­­ we  want  to  inform  the  public  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Agency's  position.  But  is  it  all  altruism,  or  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­ was  there  a  reason  that  ­­ that  the  EPA  or  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Corps  wanted  it  done  this  way? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STEWART:  It  certainly  has  benefits  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  enforcement  agency  in  the  sense  that  if  landowners 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive  what  the  Corps  believes  to  be  accurate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  about  their  property,  the  likelihood  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  complying  will  be  greater. 

 

 

 

 

            

As  Justice  Kennedy,  I  believe,  was  pointing 

   

 

 

 

 

out,  the  preparation  of  a  jurisdictional  determination 

   

 

 

 

 

would  be  the  first  step  in  the  ­­ the  permitting  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  one  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Stewart,  in  regular 

  

 

 

 

 

litigation,  there  is  an  inducement,  potentially,  for  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  other  party  to  appeal  to  delay  the  resolution  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

In  this  situation,  I  don't  see  that 

   

 

 

 

 

inducement  as  existing,  meaning  I  doubt  very  much  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

landowners  are  ­­ who  wanted  to  use  their  property  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  purpose  are  going  to  appeal  just  for  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  to  delay  the  government's  adjudication  of  an  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  going  to  either  permit  them  or  not  permit  them  to

MR.  STEWART:  I  would  agree  there  is  less 

    

 

 

 

 

 

danger  of  manipulative  appeals.  There  is  still  a  real 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

danger  of  duplicative  appeals,  because  you  could  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal  on  the  jurisdictional  question.  The  court  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court's  jurisdictional  determination  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrary  and  capricious.  Now  you  go  through  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitting  process.  And  there's  a  separate  suit  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

whether  the  terms  and  conditions  were  too  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  I  ­­

   

  

 

MR.  STEWART:  If  I  may,  I'd  like  to  reserve 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  balance  of  my  time. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.  Go  ahead.

MR.  HOPPER:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  read  the  MOA  to  be  binding  in  every  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  have  found  not  a  single  word  ­­

for  very  long,  because  he  just  said  they'll  change  it.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  He  just  said  before  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  we  rule  that  way,  they  could  change  it.  They'll  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eliminate  the  MOA. 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Well,  it's  ­­ it's  existing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

today.  And  in  addition  to  the  MOA,  the  fact  that  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  site­specific  adjudication  suggests  that  this  isn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

binding  ­­ that  this  is  a  binding  determination.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  that's  the  very  purpose  of  an  adjudication.  Also, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  has  already  been  mentioned,  it  represents  itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  ­­ as  being  the  official  view  of  the  Agency,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  agency  action  of  the  Agency,  and  will  be  relied  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  five  years.  Even  during  the  permitting  process, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  will  not  be  revisited.  All  of  those  things  suggest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  a  binding  adjudication  and  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Hopper,  can  I  ask,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

know,  I  was  just  looking  through  some  other  agency's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  and  practices.  And  I'll  just  give  you  a  couple  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples. 

            

The  FCC  put  out  rules  just  this  past  year, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  says  ­­ with  respect  to  some  particular  matters, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  FCC  rules  say,  the  bureau  will  not  bring  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  action  against  a  requesting  party,  a 

   

 

 

 

 

requesting  party  meaning  somebody  who  requested  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion,  with  respect  to  any  action  taken  in  good  faith 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliance  upon  an  advisory  opinion  if  all  of  the  relevant

facts  were  fully,  completely,  and  accurately  presented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  bureau. 

 

 

            

Now,  there's  another  that  I  just  came 

   

 

 

 

 

across.  It's  in  just  a  standard  SEC,  Securities  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange  Commission,  opinion  letter.  And  it  says,  based 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  facts  presented,  the  division  will  not  recommend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  action  to  the  Commission. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  guess  my  question  is,  this  appears  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen  all  over  the  place  around  the  Federal  government, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  setting  up  offices  whose  specific  purpose  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  come  to  us,  tell  us  our  problem,  and  we  are  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  you  a  view,  and  not  just  a  view;  we're  going  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  commit  that  if  you  have  told  us  the  truth, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  your  answer,  and  you  can  take  it  to  the  bank. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  guess  I  want  to  know  what's  different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

about  this  than  any  of  the  other  cases  in  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  does  that.  For  good  reason.  Because 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

people  want  to  know  these  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  What  you're  describing,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

Honor,  is  what  is  ­­ what  we  ­­ would  be  referred  to  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  as  a  preliminary  jurisdictional  determination. 

   

 

 

 

 

The  regulatory  process  has  built  into  it  the  option  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  advisory,  informational,  preliminary  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

determination  to  be  issued  to  the  applicant  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  more  than  advisory.  It's  not  binding  and  can't

be  appealed. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  these  are  ­­ this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  strong  language  that  are  in  these  letters.  We  will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  recommend  action.  We  ­­ we  will  not  bring  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  action. 

 

            

 

 

So,  you  know,  just  as  you  say,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

basically  says  to  us  we  were  in  the  clear  if  we  passed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  So  do  these  letters. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  That  is  strong  language,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  but  not  as  strong  as  an  adjudicative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination,  where  rights  and  obligations  are  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided. 

            

In  ­­ in  this  particular  case,  the  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  so  formalized,  and  ­­ and  purports  to  be  final,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purports  to  be  binding,  that  it  ­­ that's  ­­ that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  distinguishable  from  the  situation  that  you  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describing. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Let  me  ask  you  about  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that's  certainly  ­­ this  ­­ this  process  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  a  long  time,  and  it's  ­­ even  Mr.  Stewart,  I  think, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say  this  is  a  more  formal  process  than  many  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ that  exist  around  the  Federal  government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  guess  I'm  wondering  about  the 

   

 

 

 

 

incentives  of  the  kind  of  distinction  that  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make.  Because  it  would  suggest,  you  know,  that  agencies

should  not  ­­ should  draw  back,  should  not  give  a  fully 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informed  view,  should  not  do  the  fact­finding  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board  ­­ that  that  ­­ the  Corps  does  here.  You  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  ­­ should  just  make  their  processes  less  formal, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  in  ­­ in  making  their  processes  less  formal,  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  accurate  and  less  helpful. 

 

 

 

 

            

the  end. 

 

            

And  I  guess  I  wonder  who  that  benefits  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

MR.  HOPPER:  Well,  I  think  that  the  Agency 

   

  

 

 

 

 

has  more  to  lose  than  the  landowner  has  to  gain  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refraining  from  issuing  these  kind  of  formal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudications.  They  indicate  that  they  issue  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

54,000  permits.  And  most  of  ­­ and  they  ­­ 54,000 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nationwide  permits  and  about  3,100  individual  permits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  of  those,  only  eight  have  ever  been  appealed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administratively. 

            

So  there's  really  no  incentive  for  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  government  here  to  draw  back  on  this  formal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicative  process,  because  in  almost  all  cases,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landowner  is  simply  going  to  defer  to  the  Agency  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  And  that  ­­ that  would  be  my  response  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  I  guess  I  don't  quite 

   

   

  

 

 

understand  that,  because  it  seems  as  though  they  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  it  less  formal,  and  they  could  provide  less

assurance,  and  ­­ and  still,  there  would  be  very  few 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  would  want  to  run  the  gauntlet. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  you  wouldn't  gain  anything.  All  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  do  was  to  lose  something,  and  what  you  lose  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accurate,  reliable  information  provided  to  people  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether,  in  fact,  these  waters  are  ­­ fall  within  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clean  Water  Act. 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Well  ­­ well,  that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problem,  because  until  there  has  been  ­­ because  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Clean  Water  Act  is  so  difficult  to  ­­ because  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Clean  Water  Act,  it  is  so  difficult  to  determine, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reach  of  the  Act,  and  it  can  only  be  done  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert  analysis,  you  would  never  get  the  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detailed,  reliable  information  that  would  define  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope  of  jurisdiction  if  you  didn't  have  such  a  formal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process,  which  would  never  occur  in  the  type  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generalized  ruling  that  you've  suggested,  like  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  preliminary  JD. 

 

 

            

The  preliminary  JD  says  we  think  you  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  waters  of  the  United  States  on  your  property.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approved  jurisdictional  JD  says  just  the  opposite: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We've  made  a  definitive  determination;  you  can  rely  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that;  you're  obligated  to  get  a  permit,  and  you  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  use  property  that  is  not  subject  to  the  waters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  United  States.

regulatory  guideline,  the  Agency  is  required  to  respond. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  language  says  the  Corps  will  give  a  formal  approved 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  determination  if  one  is  requested,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  don't  request  it  in  that  specific  language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Did  Mr.  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  point  was  made 

  

 

 

 

 

earlier  that  in  ­­ that  in  court  proceedings  you  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  question;  you  may  think  that  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  very  wrong,  but  apart  from  1292(b),  you  ­­ you  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stuck  there.  You  may  have  to  go  through  a  lengthy 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial,  and  that's  just  too  bad.  It  is  a  complete 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication  of  the  jurisdictional  question.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

Court's  not  going  to  return  to  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Even  so,  you  don't  get  any  kind  of  appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review  until  there's  a  final  judgment  in  the  whole  case.

Why  should  this  be  any  different? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  I'm  not  sure  that  I  follow  your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question,  Your  Honor.  Would  you  please  repeat  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  you  ­­ you  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

urging  that  you  should  have  ­­ you  should  be  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  in  court  this  jurisdictional  determination, 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Immediate  judicial  review. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  ­­ and  if  you  were  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  district  court,  you  would  have  no  immediate  right  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  a  jurisdictional  determination. 

   

 

            

So  why  should  this  ­­ this  situation  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  in  an  agency  setting  and  in  a  court  setting? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  That's  ­­ that's  the  whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  at  issue,  Your  Honor,  is  whether  we  can  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  or  ­­ or  judicial  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  if  you  were  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  and  the  district  court  made  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  determination,  you  are  in  our  power,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  disagree,  and  you  think  the  case  should  be  ­­ you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  allowed  to  be  free  to  do  what  you  will,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  you've  lost  on  the  jurisdictional  issue,  you  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stay  there.  The  ­­ the  equivalent  would  be  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  permitting  process. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  We  don't  know  why  we  would  not

be  able  to  appeal  that,  Your  Honor.  That  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purely  legal  question  on  summary  judgment.  We  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal  it  as  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  A  summary  judgment,  you'd 

    

 

 

 

have  to  take  a  judgment  on  the  whole  case.  You  can't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal  an  adverse  ruling  on  jurisdiction.  You  want  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  out  of  the  case? 

 

 

 

 

            

 

MR.  HOPPER:  We  don't  believe  that  ­­ we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  believe  that  we  need  to  go  through  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit  process  ­­

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  question  is  why. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  The  difference  between  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why.  I  think  ­­ I  think, 

    

   

  

 

 

if  I  understand  the  question,  you  go  into  district  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  say  we're  from  Alaska,  and  here  we  are  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Florida  and  we  don't  belong  here,  there's  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  And  the  court  says  you're  wrong.  Now, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  means  you  have  to  stay  there.  You  have  to  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  whole  proceeding.  It's  going  to  cost  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  million  dollars.  It's  going  to  take  a  long  time, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  you  don't  get  independent  review  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  question. 

 

            

it  ­­

 

            

So  I  think  the  question  is,  if  I  may  say 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Please.

nothing's  going  to  happen  to  you  until  they  decide  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  not  going  to  give  you  a  permit,  which  is  part  of

of  Hobson's  choice  is  sufficient  to  get  you  judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Do  you  see  any  distinction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

between  a  jurisdictional  determination  by  an  Article  III 

   

 

 

 

 

 

district  judge  and  a  jurisdictional  determination  by  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  Agency? 

 

            

Do  you  think  there  might  be  an  argument  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  tolerable  to  wait  until  the  end  of  the  case  when  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neutral  Article  III  judge  makes  an  adverse  judicial  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  adverse  jurisdictional  determination,  but  perhaps 

 

 

 

 

 

less  appealing  to  wait  till  the  end  of  the  adjudication 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  jurisdictional  determination  is  made  by  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  Agency? 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Well,  there  ­­ when  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication  has  already  been  made,  there's  no  further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication  to  be  made  unless  you're  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring  a  permit  prior  to  judicial  review,  and  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  find  objectionable,  Your  Honor.

MR.  HOPPER:  It's  not  an  adequate  remedy  in

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  A  more  general  way  to  ask 

    

 

 

 

 

 

this  question.  I  mean,  there's  no  doubt  that  some

they're  looking  at  the  ­­ when  they're  trying  to  figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  what  to  do  under  the  Clean  Water  Act.  But  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  you  know,  that's  true  with  respect  to  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulatory  statutes. 

 

            

And  I  think  what  Mr.  Stewart's  point  was, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

was  that  the  predicament  is  the  same  regardless  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JD  process.  If  the  JD  process  didn't  exist,  your  client 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  facing  the  exact  same  predicament.  And  indeed, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  JD's  ­­ the  JD  process's  reason  for  being  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  supposed  to  help  people  in  dealing  with  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicament  because  it's  supposed  to  provide  them  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  that  they  otherwise  wouldn't  have. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  that  seems  to  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  reason  for  Mr.  Stewart  to  prevail  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  the  predicament  is  the  predicament,  and  it's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicament  that  comes  from  the  Clean  Water  Act.  The  JD 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  is  ­­ the  only  thing  it's  supposed  to  do  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  you  more  information  so  that  you  can  make  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choices  that  the  statute  puts  to  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  It  does  more  than  that.  Under 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

­­ under  Bennett,  Your  Honor,  the  second  prong  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finality  is  satisfied  if  any  of  three  requirements  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

met.

an  obligation  is  determined,  or  legal  consequences  flow. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

By  virtue  of  the  adjudicative  determination  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  an  obligation  has  been  established  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Hawkes  cannot  use  150  acres  of  their  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  being  obliged  to  get  a  permit. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

They  also  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  that's  the  question, 

  

 

 

 

 

is  whether  there's  any  obligation  or  whether  there's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  simply  information  about  what  will  happen  given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  courses  of  action. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  The  Clean  Water  Act  itself 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  say  anything  about  this  particular  property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  ­­ the  Clean  Water  Act  doesn't  cover  all  waters. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  only  way  to  find  out  if  there  are  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters  which  will  trigger  the  requirement  for  a  permit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  go  through  this  laborious  site­specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  seems  right.  But  it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

also  why  people  go  to  the  Treasury  Department  for  tax

MR.  HOPPER:  I'm  not  aware  of  them,  all  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  examples  having  an  appeals  process  that  results  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  final  Agency  action,  that  by  treatment  and  regulation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  practice  constitute  a  binding  conclusion. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  the  premise  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  that  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  is  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  just  out  of  the  goodness  of  its  heart;  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  lot  of  work  for  them  but  they  just  want  to  be  nice  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landowners  and  that's  why  they've  set  up  this  ­­ this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process. 

            

And  maybe  that's  correct,  although  I 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  what  you  were  saying  earlier  to  suggest  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  quite  how  you  see  the  process;  that  they  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  for  their  own  purposes  because  they  ­­ it  expands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  enforcement  power,  because  landowners  who  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  the  status  of  their  land  have  strong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive  to  ask  for  a  jurisdictional  determination. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  ­­ so  that  alerts  the  Corps  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  this  is  a  property  that  might  be  subject  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  jurisdiction.  And  if  they  issue  a  negative  ­­ I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry  ­­ an  affirmative  jurisdictional  determination  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  practical  matter,  that's  going  to  mean  in  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances  that  the  project  is  shut  down.  Is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Well,  if  ­­

that,  this  is  really  a  ­­ a  problem  of  the  Agency's  own 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making.  When  Congress  passed  the  Clean  Water  Act,  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  prohibited  discharges  to  navigable  waters.  And  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  addressed  in  Rapanos,  that  ­­ that's  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadly  interpreted  now  that  it  covers  virtually  any  wet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spot  in  the  country. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  isn't  just  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  ­­ the  issue,  I  think,  is  this  ­­ what  I  thought 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  answer  would  be  is  that  informal  advice  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  Agency  action  normally. 

 

 

 

            

There  is  a  statute.  It  was  passed  in  1946. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

It's  called  the  Administrative  Procedures  Act.  It  tries 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  divide  such  things  with  that  word,  "final,"  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulemaking  by  the  Agency,  from  accomplishing  roughly  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  result  by  never  having  a  rule  but  just  telling 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody  informally  what  the  Agency  will  do  in  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  It  might  be  that  the  formal  is,  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  being  equal,  final  Agency  action  in  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  matter.  It  might  be  that  the  latter  is  not. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  what  you're  telling  me  is  what  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  do  next  is  go  read  those  Federal  rules  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  and  see,  is  this  more  like  informal  advice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  is  it  more  like  formal  rulemaking?  And  you  have  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

latter,  and  they  have  the  former,  I  guess.  I  don't

job  in  this  instance. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Well,  to  help  you  make  up  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind,  we  would  refer  you  to  Frozen  Food,  which  you've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah,  yeah.  I  mean,  if 

    

  

 

 

 

Frozen  Food,  Storer  and  Abbott  Labs,  and  Bennett  too, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  examples  of  what  falls  on  the  formal  final  side  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  line. 

 

            

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  A  few  other  things  will  be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  other  side  of  the  line. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  And  in  fact,  if  Frozen  Food  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

virtually  indistinguishable  from  this  case,  Frozen  Food 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  essentially  a  jurisdictional  determination  case. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  Mr.  Hopper,  can  I  ask, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

do  you  think  that  this  would  count  as  a  formal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication  under  the  APA? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  A  formal  adjudication  under

MR.  HOPPER:  Yes.  There  was  a  ­­ the  Agency

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yeah.  Not  in  ­­ not  in  that

And  you  know,  there's  a  very  fine  opinion  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge  Sutton  on  this  question,  and  he  basically  says  the

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  ­­ what's  the  best 

  

 

 

 

 

 

example  of  a  legal  effect  that  follows  from  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  determination  as  opposed  to  a  practical 

   

 

 

 

 

effect?  It  seems  to  me  that  the  practical  effects  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  ­­ what's  the  legal  impact? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Increased  risk  of  enforcement, 

  

 

 

 

 

because  the  very  existence  of  the  JD  constitutes  prima 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facie  evidence  of  a  violation  if  one  were  to  discharge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  a  permit. 

   

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That  sounds  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

practical,  not  legal. 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  I  ­­ I  think  that  is  legal, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  Also  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Also,  I  would  suggest,  as  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court  recognized  in  ­­ in  Sackett  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  determination  increases  the  risk  of  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  criminal  liability. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Does  it  affect  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

determination  of  willfulness  on  the  part  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landowner? 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  It  does,  in  two  ­­ in  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respects,  Your  Honor.  When  the  ­­ when  the  court  is

Act  requires  that  the  court  look  at  the  good  faith

And  now  that  we  have  a  ­­ a  formal  determination  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  are  waters  of  the  United  States,  there's  a  knowing

Please. 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Hopper  ­­ I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  HOPPER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Isn't  that  true  in  every

party,  that,  you  know,  there's  always  cases  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  say  you  had  an  opinion  letter;  it  said  X;  you  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Y.  Or,  conversely,  I  had  an  opinion  letter;  it  said  X, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  did  X.  I  mean,  that  happens  all  over  the  place  in

MR.  HOPPER:  Yes,  with  the  ­­ with  the  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  that  ­­ that  the  weight  that  the  ­­ that  the

give  to  a  final  determination  as  to  jurisdiction  after 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  gone  through  a  formal  appeals  process.  So  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

weight  is  quite  different.

And  let  me  also  make  a  comparison  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this  and  ­­ and  Sackett,  when  this  Court  considered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  double  penalties  would  apply  in  that  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  might  recall  that  during  oral  argument, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Stewart  said  that  with  respect  to  double  penalties, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is,  there  ­­ there  will  be  $37,500  a  day  assessed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  ­­ of  violation  of  the  statute,  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$37,500  a  day  because  of  a  violation  of  the  compliance 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

order.  He  said  that  ­­ that  that  reading  of  the  law  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely  theoretical,  and  didn't  even  know  if  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ would  even  fly. 

 

 

 

 

            

Here,  we  ­­ we  don't  have  a  ­­ a  theoretical 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

risk.  We  have  an  actual  risk.  The  ­­ the  Clean  Water 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  says  a  knowing  violation  shall  result  in  a  ­­ in  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil  fine  of  no  less  ­­ or  a  criminal  fine  of  no  less 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  $5,000  and  no  more  than  $50,000  a  day,  and  will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase  the  ­­ the  prison  time  from  one  to  three  years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  even  though  you're  right,  a  simple  letter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

may  put  one  on  notice,  it  certainly  doesn't  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  weight  as  a  final  binding  determination. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The  main  problems  we  have  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  of  going  through  a  permit  process  before  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  seek  judicial  review  under  the  APA  are  fourfold. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  the  permit  process  adds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  to  the  jurisdictional  question.  It  doesn't  add

any  facts  which  are  relevant,  and  it  doesn't  clarify  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  It  is  simply  an  idle  act  which  the  law  abhors. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Secondly,  it  puts  the  ­­ the  timing  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial  review  entirely  in  the  hands  of  the  Agency.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  open­ended  invitation  to  the  Agency  to  delay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forever  the  ­­ the  final  permit  issuance,  denying  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landowner  a  right  to  ever  have  judicial  review.  That 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

was  important  to  this  Court  in  ­­ in  Sackett,  when  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  was  looking  at  whether  an  enforcement  action  ­­ if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  could  instigate  an  enforcement  action  ­­ whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  an  appropriate  remedy.  And  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  it  wasn't  because  the  ­­ the  ­­ even  though  you  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  landowner  may  be  able  to  commit  a  ­­ a  violation, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  no  control  over  when  the  enforcement  action  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow. 

            

So  the  fact  that  there's  no  control  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

landowner  to  ­­ as  to  when  the  ­­ the  judicial  review 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  occur,  we  think  is  violative  of  the  APA.  The  APA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests  immediate  judicial  review  is  required. 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  ­­ falls  under  the  presumption  of  reviewability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  ­­ that's  the  intent  of  Congress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Once  finality  has  been  established,  it  seems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me  that  ­­ that  the  Court  should  be  looking  at  ways 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  facilitate  judicial  review  and  not  find  ways  to  deter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  or  delay  it  or  obviate  it.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Suppose  the  response  to

well,  we  didn't  have  to  get  into  this  in  the  first

because  the  Agency  has  provided  something  that  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  some  benefit  to  the  public  it  served,  it  becomes

asserted  in  the  ­­ in  the  complaint  as  ­­ as  correct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  complaint  suggests  that  this  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  should  never  have  been  issued;  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  waters  on  this  particular  property  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waters  of  the  United  States,  and  a  negative 

   

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  determination  should  have  been  issued. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  thought  your  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

MR.  HOPPER:  So  that  ­­ that's  a  unique 

   

  

 

 

 

 

result  of  the  ­­ of  the  jurisdictional  determination, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  does  not  follow  from  the  ­­ from  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under  the  statute,  we  should  be  exempt.

Under  the  jurisdictional  determination,  we  have  to  get  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  thought  your 

    

 

 

 

answer  might  focus  on  the  fact  that  this  is  of  great 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  to  the  Agency,  because  by  issuing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determinations,  they  are  able  to  exercise  extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leverage  without  going  through  the  formal  enforcement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process.  So  it  ­­ it  does  give  them  ­­ it  is  a  way  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  to  exercise  their  authority  without  effective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial  review.  And  that's  a  significant  enforcement 

   

  

 

 

 

tool  for  them.  So  they  might  be  unwilling  to  give  it  up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  they  had  the  option. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  I  think  there's  no  question 

    

 

 

 

 

they're  not  going  to  give  it  up.  They  have  ­­ they  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  to  lose.  The  ­­ in  almost  all  cases,  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipient  of  the  jurisdictional  determination  defers  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judgment  of  the  Agency.  And  as  you  say,  it  is  used 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  leverage.  In  fact,  I  would  even  say  it  ­­ to  extort 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigation  from  a  ­­ from  an  individual  that  they  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  do  if  ­­ if  they  could  establish,  through  judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review,  whether  there  are  jurisdictional  waters  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

site.  So  I  agree  with  you.  I  think  that  that's  one  of 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  problems. 

 

            

We  also  think  one  of  the  difficulties  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  through  the  permit  process  is  the  cost;  not  that

the  cost  is  definitive,  but  if  the  cost  is  prohibitive, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  it  ­­ then  it  raises  a  ­­ a  problem  because  you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  ­­ it  raises,  I  think,  a  potential  due  process 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  I  think  it  raises  another  problem  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

practicality. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  do  I  determine  how 

   

  

 

 

 

much  is  too  much?  I  mean,  for  some  people,  given  their 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  situation,  $3,000  is  too  much.  And  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

others  ­­ I  don't  know  your  client's  financial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

wherewithal,  but  10,000  would  be  reasonable.  So  when  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  decide  how  much  is  too  much? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  HOPPER:  Well,  I  ­­ I  don't  think  it's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

a  ­­ a  question  that  needs  to  be  answered  generally, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  can  be  answered  specifically  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  this  particular  case,  the  landowner  has  been  asked  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  over  a  hundred  thousand  dollars  in  ­­ in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  studies.  You  might  recall  that  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant  actually  started  the  permit  process  and  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willing  to  go  through  the  permit  process  until  it  became 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable  and  too  cost  prohibitive  to  proceed.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  when  they  asked  for  the  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination. 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  STEWART:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

First,  with  respect  to  the  costs  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitting  process,  there  ­­ there's  no  basis  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming  that  the  permit  process  is  systemically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unavailable.  As  Mr.  Hopper  was  referring  to,  the  Corps' 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statistics  indicate  that  a  little  over  50,000  general 

   

 

 

 

 

 

permit  authorizations  and  a  little  over  3,000  individual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

permits  are  granted  each  year. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  process  may  be  expensive  in  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  but  it  is  a  process  that  is  regularly  invoked, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  regularly  invoked  successfully.  And  in  many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instances,  if  the  Corps  and  the  landowner  come  to  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement,  the  Corps  offers  to  permit  the  activity  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms  and  conditions  that  the  landowner  regards  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acceptable,  that  may  obviate  the  need  for  a  court  ever 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  resolve  the  question  of  whether  these  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  waters.  And  that's  the  kind  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

consideration  that  is  often  invoked  as  a  justification 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for  not  submitting  interlocutory  review,  that  the  issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  which  a  person  seeks  immediate  review  may  turn  out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  to  ­­ to  be  necessary  to  resolve  after  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  the  analogy  to  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  litigation,  I  think  in  Standard  Oil,  this  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  already  taken  the  step  of  saying  the  same  principle

applies  to  administrative  adjudication. 

 

 

 

            

My  ­­ my  point  in  analogizing  to  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  litigation  is  simply  that  this  is  not  a  quirk  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  law.  This  is  a  fundamental  precept  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

our  legal  system:  That  on  the  whole,  we  are  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worried  about  piecemeal  litigation  than  about  deferred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation. 

            

Finally,  formality  is  not  the  key.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Franklin  and  in  Dalton,  the. 

 

 

 

 

            

Agency  process  at  issue  were  intensely 

 

 

 

 

 

formal,  intensely  structured,  and  they  were  designed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  an  effect  on  the  President's  decision­making.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  held  not  to  be  final  Agency  action  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  not  legally  binding  on  the  President. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  same  thing  is  true  here  with  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  binding  effect  of  the  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  on  the  recipient. 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon,  at  12:08  p.m.,  the  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
