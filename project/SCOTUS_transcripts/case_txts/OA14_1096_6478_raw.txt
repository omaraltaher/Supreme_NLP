CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  this  morning  in  Case  14­1096,  Torres  v.  Lynch. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Guadagno. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MATTHEW  L.  GUADAGNO 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Congress  made  a  choice.  Congress  did  not 

   

  

 

 

 

choose  to  make  generic  arson  an  aggravated  felony. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instead,  Congress  chose  to  make  Federal  arson  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  felony. 

 

            

And  that  makes  sense.  The  Federal  arson 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute  has  a  minimum  sentence  of  five  years.  There  are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  least  18  States  with  arson  offenses  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classified  as  misdemeanors.  Arizona  and  Colorado  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanor  arson  offenses  involving  damage  to  property 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worth  less  than  a  hundred  dollars. 

   

 

 

 

            

Congress  would  not  have  wanted  to  make  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor  offenses  aggravated  felonies.  We  know  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  the  statutory  scheme. 

 

 

 

 

            

Within  the  aggravated  felony  statute,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

have  generic  offenses,  very  serious  ones  like  murder  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rape.  There  are  no  ­­ there  are  no  sentence

requirements  for  those  very  serious  generic  offenses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

However,  for  the  remaining  generic  offenses 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  ­­ that  are  listed  in  ­­ in  ­­ in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  felony  statute,  they  ­­ they  are  associated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  a  sentence  of  a  year  or  more.  Theft  offenses, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

obstruction  of  justice,  burglary,  they  all  require  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  of  a  year  or  more. 

   

 

 

 

            

Also  listed  with  ­­ among  the  generic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses  is  crime  of  violence.  There  is  a  requirement 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  sentence  of  a  year  or  more. 

   

   

 

 

 

            

Arson  is  a  crime  of  violence,  and  so  ­­ so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  would  have  realized  that  ­­ that  arson  offenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ would  fall  under  the  crime­of­violence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision,  and  ­­ and  for  more  serious  State  arson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses,  they  would  fall  under  this  ­­ this  ­­ this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  so  that,  for  the  minor  arson  offenses,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  sentence  of  less  than  a  year,  the  individual 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ would  not  be  an  aggravated  felon  and  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  for  discretionary  relief. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  your  reading  leaves 

  

 

 

 

 

out  some  very  serious  arson  offenses.  Say  under  foreign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  or  under  State  law  it  could  be  the  worst  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arson,  but  there's  no  commerce  hooker  and  so  it  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left  out,  on  your  reading.

like  my  client,  Mr.  Luna,  who  only  received  a  sentence

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Do  you  think  that's  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

clear  after  our  decision  in  Johnson? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  Johnson,  if  I  ­­ if  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

remember  correctly,  dealt  ­­ dealt  with  ­­ with  ­­ with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  ­­ 16(b).  You  could  still  ­­ you  ­­ one  could  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  an  aggravated  felon  under  ­­ under  16(a).  But  ­­ but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regardless,  what  I'm  talking  about  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  what  you're  relying 

  

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ you're  relying  on  language  that  is  similar  to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe,  and  ­­ and  maybe  different  in  an  ­­ in  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  respect;  but  nevertheless  bears  some 

 

 

 

 

 

similarity  to  the  residual  clause  in  the  ­­ in  the  armed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  ­­ Armed  Career  Criminal  Act,  does  it  not?

MR.  GUADAGNO:  Yes.  But  I'm  talking  about 

  

  

 

 

 

 

what  Congress  intended.  When  Congress  write  ­­ writes  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  it  doesn't  intend  for  ­­ for  the  ­­ for  the  Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  to  find  the  language  ambiguous  and  ­­ and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strike  it  down.  So  ­­ so  that  ­­ we  should  be  looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  what  Congress's  intent  was,  not  ­­ not  ­­ not  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not  the  crime  of  violence  will  still  be  an  aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony  after  Johnson.  If  ­­ if  ­­ if  there  are  problems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  this,  that  will  be  ­­ that  will  be  for  Congress  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fix. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  May  I  ask  you  about  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

statutory  language  that  seems  to  me  to  present  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greatest  problem  for  your  position.  Maybe  it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fatal,  but  what  I'm  referring  to  is  the  provision  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  the  term  applies  ­­ so  we're  looking  at  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  State  offense  here  is  described  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  arson  statute.  And  then  there's  language  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  the  term  applies  to  an  offense  described  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph  whether  in  violation  of  Federal  or  State  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  do  you  make  of  that?  It  can  be  argued 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  what  that  means  is  that,  when  you  have  a  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense  with  a  jurisdictional  provision,  you  disregard 

   

 

 

 

 

the  jurisdictional  provision  because  you're  never  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  find  that  in  a  State  provision. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  The  ­­ the  language  you're  ­­

you're  referring  to  is  ­­ is  referred  to  normally  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penultimate  sentence.  And  ­­ and  the  penultimate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  merely  tells  us  that  ­­ that  State  offenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  described  in  the  aggravated  felony  provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  aggravated  felonies.  In  the  ­­ in  the  board's  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  Vasquez­Muniz  decision,  the  board  looked  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  language  and  concluded  that  ­­ that  ­­ that  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  means  is  that  sometimes  State  offenses  could  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  aggravated  felonies,  but  it  didn't  require 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  State  offenses  always  be  ­­ be  aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felonies. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right.  But,  I  mean, 

   

  

  

 

 

the  point  is  usually  when  you  see  language,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  interstate  commerce,  your  immediate  reaction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  oh,  that's  Federal  jurisdiction  as  opposed  to  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  here  the  one  thing  we  know  is  they  didn't  want  it  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter.  They  said  in  violation  of  Federal  or  State  law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  as  I  look  at  it,  the  ­­ your  instinctive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaction  is  to  say,  well,  then,  of  course  you  don't  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  worry  about  the  provisions  that's  in  there  to  limit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  offense  to  Federal  ­­ Federal  offenses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  This  ­­ this  ­­ this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

language,  it  ­­ it  ­­ it  doesn't  ­­ it  doesn't  directly

MR.  GUADAGNO:  That  is  correct,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  so  for  most  of  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  there  is  no  jurisdictional  element  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

yes. 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  That  ­­ that  is  also  correct,

MR.  GUADAGNO:  Yeah. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  doing  a  lot  of  work

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  suppose  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  What  your  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Go  ahead. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  What  your  theory  does  is  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  create  a  world  in  which  some  things  are  included 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  some  things  are  excluded  in  a  way  that  appears  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  much  sense.  Now,  you've  said  no,  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  for  doing  this  with  arson  to  limit  it  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  offense.  But  I  mean,  there  are  a  lot  of  things, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  lot  of  things  on  that  list  that  have  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hooks  in  them. 

 

 

            

So  you  would  be  excluding  ­­ in  addition  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arson,  you  would  be  excluding  the  child  pornography 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime.  You  would  be  excluding  a  kidnapping  crime, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

excluding  felon  and  possession,  excluding  receiving

explosives  for  the  purpose  of  killing  somebody.  So  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  excluding  all  of  those. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  on  the  other  hand,  you  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including  some  things  that  seem  a  lot  more  minor  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  happen  not  to  have  jurisdictional  hooks,  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operating  a  gambling  establishment. 

   

 

            

So  you  create  a  world  in  which  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

exclusions  and  the  inclusions  seem  not  to  match  up  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody's  view  of  ­­ of  a  sensible  categorization. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  Well,  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  that  ­­ that  ­­ that  there's  ­­ there's  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  felony  provision  for  arson  in  the  generics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  all  those  things  that  Your  Honor  mentioned,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  other  categories  of  aggravated  felony  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  cover  State  offenses  for  those  things:  Sexual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse  of  a  minor,  crime  of  violence.  And  ­­ and  even 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  the  aggravated  felony  scope,  we  have  crimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  moral  turpitude.  So  individuals  who  commit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

those  crimes  on  ­­ within  a  State,  they  would  still  be

aggravated  felonies  ­­

commerce.  The  second  defendant  is  convicted  under  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical  State  statute,  but  of  course,  there's  no  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  prove  an  interstate  commerce  element.  And  under  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  the  first  would  be  included  and  the  second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not. 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  The  person  ­­ the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

individual  would  still  be  removable  under  the  firearm's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removability  ground. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  but  that  may  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary  as  mandatory.  That  ­­ that  does  avoid  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  somewhat  when  you  say,  oh  well,  there's  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section.  Don't  worry.  That's  your  answer. 

  

  

 

 

 

            

But  that  doesn't  seem  to  me  a  complete 

   

 

 

 

 

 

answer  to  the  statutory  question  that  Justice  Alito's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  poses.  You're  making  the  statute  a  nullity  as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  States. 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  Well,  you  know,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

interstate­commerce  provision,  it's  ­­ it's  an  element 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  the  statute  that  ­­ that's  required  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  does  it  have  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressed  in  the  statute?  Is  it  not  always  a  required 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  a  Federal  crime?  There  has  to  be  Federal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction,  so  as  ­­ as  a  matter  of  fact,  every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  crime  has  some  jurisdictional  element  in  it.

Right? 

            

            

the  ­­ in  the  text  of  the  statute  or  not,  the  statute's

Federal  criminal  law  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  ­­ but  you're  ­­ you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  ­­ you're  just  limiting  it  to  the  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  recited  in  the  statute,  right?  That  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  little  illogical. 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  But  in  this  ­­ this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  requires  the  jurisdictional  element  for  ­­ for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  conviction.  Jones  v.  United  States,  there  was  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  a  conviction  under  18  U.S.  844(i),  and  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  overturned  that  ­­ that  conviction  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interstate­commerce  element  wasn't  met.  So  you  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  ­­ you  can't  have  the  Federal  conviction  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  interstate­commerce  element. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  No,  but  ­­ but  it  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  be  recited  in  the  statute.  And  I  mean,  if  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  could  come  in  and  challenge  his  conviction  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ground  that  there  ­­ there  was  no  basis  on  which  the

We  ­­ we  just  didn't  make  it  in  our  brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  ­­ but  it  does  support  our  ­­ our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position,  and  as  ­­ as  I  was  saying  earlier  that  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ you  know,  the  statute  says  "described  in,"  okay? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  government  is  saying  "described  in"  tells  us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  ­­ we  ­­ we  can  eliminate  elements.  But  what's

could  just  as  easily  be  the  arson  element. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  sole  purpose  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sole  purpose  of  it  is  to  enable  Federal  authority  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  to  bear  on  the  problem.  It  has  no  relationship 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  conduct.  The  arson  is  the  same.  The  only  reason 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  jurisdictional  provision  is  to  authorize  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  and  nothing  to  do  with  the  conduct  involved  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  crime  itself. 

 

 

            

So  I  think  a  jurisdictional  provision  is  not 

   

   

 

 

 

like  any  other  element.  It's  there  for  one  purpose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only,  which  is  to  authorize  Federal  action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  On  Page  24  of  our  brief,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite  three  provisions  from  Title  18,  two  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  U.S.C.  Section  3142,  and  the  third  one  is  18  U.S.C. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  5032.  And  these  three  provisions  have  language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

referring  to  State  offenses  if  circumstances  giving  rise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Federal  jurisdiction  had  existed.  That  ­­ that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  clear  language  removing  the  jurisdictional  element 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  ­­ or  applying  a  State  offense  with  ­­ to  a  Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  I  agree  ­­ yes,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

agree  with  you,  that's  clearer.  But  it  still  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  if  ­­ if  the  jurisdictional  element,  why  not  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  element?  Because  jurisdictional  elements  are 

  

 

 

 

 

unique.

about  ­­ about  those  three  Federal  statutes  is  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  is  saying  that  if  they  want  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements  to  be  ignored,  they're  going  to  say  so,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  going  to  say  so  with  clear  language,  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearer  language  than  ­­ than  ­­ than  the  penultimate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  or  described  in,  and  Congress  didn't  ­­ didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  that  here. 

 

 

              

I  mean,  basically  we're  ­­ we're  asking  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  the  full  language  of  ­­ of  ­­ of  the  statute,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  is  saying  omit  things.  And  ­­ and  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

omit  things,  you  need  clear  language. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  but  your 

  

 

 

 

 

assumption  is  that  there  ­­ an  element  is  an  element  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  element,  whether  it's  substantive  or  jurisdictional. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  not  the  way  our  ­­ our  cases  have  treated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them,  or  ­­ or  the  general.  I  mean,  you  don't  need  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely  on  it  for  ­­ for  everything,  but  the  Model  Penal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code  draws  a  precise  distinction  between  matters 

   

 

 

 

 

relating  to  the  harm  or  evil  sought  to  be  prevented  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  that  relate  to  jurisdiction,  venue,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations. 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  But  ­­ but  still,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  element  is  required  for  the  conviction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  ­­ you  cannot  have  the  ­­ the  conviction.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Oh,  I  know.  But  my 

   

  

  

 

 

 

point  is  it's  required  for  a  conviction.  But  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  necessarily  mean  that  you  would  include  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  element  when  you're  saying,  well,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  the  crime  ­­ what  is  the  ­­ what  is  the  harm  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evil  sought  to  be  prevented?  And  in  a  statute  like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  it  seems  to  me  that  that's  what  Congress  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned  about,  not  the  technical  elements  like,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  venue.  I  mean,  is  venue  an  element  if  it's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

listed  under  the  ­­ the  criminal  provision?  Well,  sure. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  an  element  that  could  have  to  be  proved  depending 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  terms  of  the  statute.  But  that  has  nothing  to  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  harm  or  evil  sought  to  be  prevented. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  Okay.  You  know,  going  back 

  

  

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  the  United  States  v.  Jones  again,  I  mean,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  this  ­­ this  Court  said  that  Congress  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend  to  make  all  arson  ­­ all  ­­ all  arsons  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses.  And  ­­ and  by  ­­ by  the  same  token,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  if  Congress  didn't  intend  to  ­­ to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  ­­ all  State  arsons  Federal  offenses.  They  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ they  shouldn't  have  intended  to  make  all  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arsons  rulable  offenses  or  aggravated  felonies. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  but  they  wanted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  arsons  offenses,  whether  in  violation  of  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  State  law.

utilizes  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  categorical  approach, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  would  have  used  strong  language  or  clearer

a  ­­ a  major  deviation  from  the  way  that  the  categorical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  is  applied.  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Guadagno,  this  is  along 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  lines  as  the  Chief  Justice's  question.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  me  if  I'm  wrong,  but  jurisdictional  elements  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  in  one  important  way,  which  is  that  we  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  mens  rea  as  to  jurisdictional  elements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  that's  a  pretty  critical  distinction  that 

   

 

 

 

 

we've  made.  Are  you  suggesting  that  jurisdictional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

elements  are  different?  You  know,  you  have  to  prove 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them,  but  you  don't  have  to  ­­ the  ­­ the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  to  have  mens  rea  with  respect  to  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why  doesn't  that  suggest  that  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  distinction  here  between  jurisdictional  elements 

 

 

 

 

 

and  substantive  elements  that  can  come  into  play  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  as  well? 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  This  is  the  ­­ what  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

showed.  Congress  shows  a  statutory  provision  with  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

with  ­­ with  jurisdictional  elements  I  think  should  be

rea  example  is  also  an  example  where  ­­ where  basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  and  what  we  think  Congress  meant.  And  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  you  know,  Congress  could  not  have  meant  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  mens  rea  for  a  jurisdictional  element. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Notwithstanding  that  there's  not  language  in 

 

 

 

 

 

a  statute  that  says,  and  there  shall  be  no  mens  rea  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  jurisdictional  element.  So  why  not  the  same  here? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  Well,  even  ­­ even  if  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different,  okay,  even  if  you're  going  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  is  different,  it  ­­ it  doesn't  stop  it  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  a  requirement.  Okay?  It  ­­ it  may  ­­ it  may  be  a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  element,  it  may  a  different  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  but  it's  still  a  requirement.  And  ­­

rise  to  Federal  jurisdiction  had  existed.  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  put  the  language  in  the  statute  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  to  ignore  the  plain  language  of  the  statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  ­­ which  is  that  Congress  wanted  convictions

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Right.  And  ­­ and  say, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

yes,  Congress  did  mean  to  pick  up  this  definition,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  part. 

 

            

But  since  no  State  explosives  law  will  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  the  language,  you  can  ­­ the  government  could,

MR.  GUADAGNO:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  reason  really  is  pretty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

similar  here.  The  ­­ the  reason  is  there  isn't  a  ­­ you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  there  isn't  a  theft  statute  in  the  States  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  $10,000  thing  in  it,  and  so  it  didn't  make  really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  to  think  Congress  wanted  to  exclude  all  those. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  ­­ and  so  here  this  is  a  big  thing, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explosives.  I  mean,  that's  quite  ­­ quite  a  major 

    

   

 

 

 

 

problem  trying  to  have  an  explosive  to  blow  up  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

building.  And  I  think  if  anything  counts  as  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  Felony,  it's  that. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

But  there  is  this  jurisdictional  problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

What  do  you  think  about  that?  I  just  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GUADAGNO:  I  think  ­­ the  Ashwan,  I

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  about  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

respect  that  we  owe  to  the  BIA  for  their  interpretation?

One  is  that  the  criminal  lenity  rule  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply.  The  second  is  that  the  long­standing  principle

not  a  rubber  stamp.  Chevron  tells  us  that  there  are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  circumstances  when  ­­ when  deference  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  to  boards'  decisions  and,  if  those  circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  met,  then  the  board  is  ­­ is  not  supposed  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  deference. 

 

            

And  in  ­­ in  this  particular  situation,  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  these  principles  that  I've  just  mentioned,  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  tools  of  construction.  And  statutory  tools  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction  are  supposed  to  be  applied  at  ­­ at  Chevron 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

step  one.  And  therefore,  the  agency  should  not  be  owed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference. 

            

Unless  there  are  any  further  questions,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserve  rebuttal  time. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

Ms.  Goldenberg. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ELAINE  J.  GOLDENBERG 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  court: 

 

 

 

            

Section  1101(a)(43)  indicates  that 

 

 

 

violations  of  State  and  foreign  law  should  be  considered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  felonies  along  with  violations  of  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  It  was  enacted  against  the  backdrop  of  multiple 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrines  across  multiple  areas  of  the  law  in  which  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  element  drops  away  when  a  Federal  crime 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  being  compared  to  a  State  support  crime. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  these  examples  you 

  

 

 

 

 

gave  me  in  your  brief,  either  it's  clear  explicitly  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  was  excluded  by  the  statute  or  the  nature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  offense  gives  jurisdiction  or  the  Assimilated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Crimes  Act,  it  makes  sense,  because  the  whole  purpose  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  ­­ that  Federal  ­­ that  a  State  law  is  going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  apply  when  there  isn't  a  Federal  law.  So  applying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  makes  no  sense. 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Our  point  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  ­­ so  I  don't  take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

much  from  your  arguments,  which  is  the  fact  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drops  away  in  other  sections.  Congress  didn't  just  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  dropped  away  here.

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well,  our  point  isn't  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

each  one  of  those  is  exactly  analogous.  It's  that  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  so  many  different  places  where  it  drops  away  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  very  telling.  And  of  course,  the  purpose  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute  is  to  capture  people  who  are  particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dangerous  who  shouldn't  be  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  I  ­­ I  thought  ­­ I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

agreed  with  that  when  I  came  in.  And  ­­ and  then  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought,  my  goodness.  Of  course.  It's  an  explosives 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

crime.  My  God.  Blowing  up  a  building  or  a  person,  if 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

anything's  an  aggravated  felony,  that  must  be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then  the  first  words  out  of  his  mouth,  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend's  mouth,  were,  have  no  fear,  read  on,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  section  that  makes  it  an  aggravated  felony  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commit  a  crime  of  violence.  And  "a  crime  of  violence" 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  very  broadly  defined.  So  any  human  being  who  commits 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  explosives  violation  where  that's  a  State  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

violation  will  fall  within  the  definition  of  aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony  because  they  will  have  committed  a  crime  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence. 

            

So  now,  if  that's  right,  I'm  left  with  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  the  problem  I  thought  I  was  left  with.  And  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

half  I'm  still  left  with  is,  if  we  follow  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation,  what  we  will  suddenly  do  is  put  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category  "aggravated  felony,"  which  forbids  the  attorney

general  to  exercise  her  discretion  and  keep  the  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  even  when  she  wants  to,  though  the  Mor  case  isn't  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem,  because  after  all,  she  doesn't  have  to  keep  him

racketeering,  gambling.  I  mean,  you  know  the  list.  And 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  includes  an  awful  lot  of  trivial  stuff.  So  now  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  removing  the  attorney  general's  discretion  when  she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  keep  the  thing  here  ­­ keep  the  person  here  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  whole  lot  of  trivial  stuff,  if  I  accept  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition. 

            

And  if  I  accept  theirs,  I  don't  have  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

problem  I  thought  I  had,  which  was  that  people  who 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

commit  very  serious  explosive  crimes  are  not  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category  "aggravated." 

 

            

            

            

So  what  is  the  answer  to  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  ­­

    

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  didn't  think  of  it  until 

    

 

 

 

 

 

I  heard  his  first  argument. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  disagree  with,  I  think, 

    

   

 

 

both  halves  of  that. 

 

 

 

            

And  let  me  start  by  talking  about  why  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  remains  true,  despite  the  crime  of  violence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  and  other  parts  of  the  aggravated  felony 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision,  that  Petitioner's  approach  is  radically

underinclusive. 

            

First  of  all,  it's  important  that  we're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  talking  about  arson  here.  We're  talking  about  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  different  described­in  provisions  where  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  Federal  jurisdictional  element.  And  so  there  are  many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  that  it  is  clear  would  never  be  picked  up  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  parts  of  the  aggravated  felony  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  have  the  list  in  front  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

me,  thanks  to  my  law  clerk.  And  I  couldn't  find 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  on  that  list  which  either  wouldn't  fit  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime  of  violence  or  would  be  so  terrible  to  leave  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well,  there  are  a  couple  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

different  examples.  And  I  also  think  it's  true  ­­ and  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  want  to  leave  this  on  the  table  ­­ that  not  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arsons  would  qualify  as  crimes  of  violence.  So  I  want 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  to  that  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  things  that  would  be  left  out  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  not  be  picked  up  by  other  parts  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  felony  provision  under  Petitioner's  view 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  number  of  really  serious  child  pornography 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses  if  they  were  prosecuted  by  a  State  or  by  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  sovereign,  including  possessing  child 

 

 

 

 

pornography,  transporting  child  pornography,  putting  out 

 

 

 

 

 

a  notice  saying  that  you  want  to  receive  or  exchange 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child  pornography.  None  of  that  would  be  picked  up  by

anything  else  in  the  provision. 

 

 

 

 

            

Petitioner  says  in  his  brief  that  the  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse  of  a  minor,  generic  offense,  would  pick  that  up. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  it  wouldn't  pick  up  any  of  those  things  that  I  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described,  although,  it  might  pick  up  some  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child  pornography  offenses:  Gun  possession  offenses, 

  

 

 

 

 

being  a  felon  in  possession  of  a  firearm,  being  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

fugitive  from  justice  in  possession  of  a  firearm.  A  lot 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

of  really  serious  gun  possession  offenses  also,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecuted  by  a  State  or  prosecuted  by  a  foreign 

   

   

 

 

 

 

sovereign,  would  not  be  picked  up.  And  Petitioner 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  doesn't  contend  otherwise. 

 

 

 

            

So  it  is  an  underinclusive  approach.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  true  even  with  respect  to  arson,  because  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  crime  of  violence  provision,  that  has  to  involve  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  force  against  the  person  or  property  of  another.  A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  State  arson  offenses  would  cover  arson  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  own  property.  And  this  is  a  categorical  approach. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

So  if  a  ­­

   

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  ­­ I  don't 

    

   

 

 

understand.  Your  argument  is  we  have  to  interpret  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  to  be  as  expansive  as  possible? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  No.  It's  ­­

of  a  Federal  building  a  crime? 

   

   

 

            

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well,  in  that  case  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Does  ­­ does  that  mean  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  state  arson  statutes  are  picked  up,  whether  it's  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  Federal  building  or  of  ­­ of  the  corner  grocery  store? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  No.  I  think  you'd  have  to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

engage  in  an  analysis  at  that  point  about  whether  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  was  a  purely  jurisdictional  element  or  whether

to  anything 

 

besides  interstate­commerce  jurisdictional 
 

 

 

which  are  classic  jurisdictional  elements. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  the  board  were  going  to

code  definition  that  the  Chief  Justice  pointed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier.  And  that  is  the  distinction  between  the  harm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  evil  sought  to  be  prevented  and  the  legislature's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power,  jurisdictional  power,  to  regulate  that  harm  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evil. 

            

And  in  the  case  that  you  mentioned,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  might  very  well  be  a  substantive  element,  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  could  be  making  a  determination  that  if  there

the  analysis  in  Jones  was  against  the  backdrop  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional­avoidance  principle.  And  the  Court  said 

  

 

 

 

 

there  might  very  well  have  been  constitutional  problems 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  interpreting  the  statute  more  broadly.  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  best  comparison  is  between  Jones  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Russell.  And  you  can  see  there  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interstate­commerce  element  is  not  doing  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

work.  If  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  I  ­­ I  don't  know 

   

   

  

 

 

why  you  say  that,  if  it  has  to  have  substantive  work, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise  it  wouldn't  be  in  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  ­­ it  is  picking  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime  that  only  Congress  would  prosecute,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  up  on  Justice  Alito's  point,  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it's  more  serious.  It  has  ­­ we  have  to  protect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  are  affected  from  interstate  travel,  or  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affects  interstate  travel.  You  could  ­­ even  following

substantive. 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  don't  think  so.  And 

    

  

 

 

 

again,  I  think  the  comparison  between  Jones  and  Russell 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  this  point.  In  Russell,  the  Court  said  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense  was  something  that  could  be  prosecuted  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  because  it  was  arson  of  a  rental 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

property  which  was  used  in  interstate  commerce.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jones,  it  was  arson  against  a  private  nonrental 

   

 

 

 

 

 

property.  And  that  was  said  to  fall  outside  the  scope 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Section  844(i). 

 

 

            

But  I  don't  think  you  can  say  that  there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  particularly  pernicious  or  culpable  about 

 

 

 

 

 

arson  against  a  rental  property  versus  arson  of  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonrental  property.  I  think  ­­

    

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Why  ­­ why  have  to  subject 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  courts  to  ­­ to  this  ­­ this  new  distinction

why  should  I  do  that?  I  mean,  if  it's  an  element,  it's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  element.  And  if  Congress  really  wants  to  eliminate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jurisdictional  element,  it  can  ­­ it  can  say  so,  the

sensible  way  to  handle  this? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  don't  think  so,  Your 

    

 

 

 

 

Honor.  I  don't  think  it's  possible  to  draw  a  negative 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

inference  from  those  other  statutes.  Congress  obviously 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  get  at  the  same  meaning  using  different  forms  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  in  different  statutes  in  the  U.S.  Code. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  what's  very  important  about  the  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Petitioner  has  pointed  to  that  expressly  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jurisdictional  element  should  be  taken  out  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  don't  have  an  analogue  to  the  penultimate  sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case,  which  shows  Congress's  intent  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  felony  provision,  that  State  offenses  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  offenses  count,  along  with  Federal  offenses,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  felonies. 

 

            

And  so  I  think  once  you  got  that  penultimate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  in  there,  it  may  very  well  be  that  Congress  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer  feels  any  need  to  put  in  language  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equivalent  to  the  language  of  those  other  statutes.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Is  that  really, 

  

 

 

 

Ms.  Goldenberg,  the  only  textual  basis  for  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position?  You  know,  your  brief  does  a  good  deal  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  difference  between  "described"  and  "defined,"  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Petitioner  has  suggested  is  ­­ is  ­­ is  not  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  distinction,  because  the  "defined"  only  refers  to

actual  statutory  definitions. 

 

 

            

So  are  you  still  relying  on  that?  Are  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relying  on  anything  else  in  the  statutory  text  beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  penultimate  sentence,  or  is  the  penultimate  sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  the  statutory  basis  for  your  argument? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  No.  We're  certainly  still 

  

  

 

 

 

relying  on  the  "described­in"  language  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  between  that  language  and  other  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  chose  to  use  elsewhere  in  the  aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony  provision.  It's  just  that  we  think  that  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  that  when  you  look  at  the  meaning  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"described  in,"  it  be  read  in  light  of  the  penultimate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence,  in  light  of  the  purpose  of  this  provision,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light  of  the  irrational  patchwork  that  would  be  created 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  Petitioner's  view.  So  I  think  all  those  things 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

inform  how  you  would  understand  "described  in"  but  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  question  of  whether  "defined  in"  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  was  just  used  to  refer  to  dictionary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition­type  statutory  provisions.  I  think  that  that 

    

 

 

 

 

is  true.  As  a  descriptive  matter,  there  are  only  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple  of  "defined  in"  provisions  of  the  aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony  statute,  and  they  do  refer  to  other  statutes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  the  word  X  means  Y. 

   

 

 

 

            

But  that's  not  true  throughout  the  U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Code,  which  was  Petitioner's  original  submission.  There

are  lots  of  places  where  Congress  has  used  "defined  in" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  refer  to  offenses  and  to  mean  exactly  what  follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  nothing  else.  And  one  very  telling  example  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  844(n)  which  actually  refers  to  Section  844(i), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  provision  at  issue  in  this  case,  by  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses  defined  in  this  chapter. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  Congress  had  at  its  fingertips  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  could  have  used  to  refer  to  these  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  provisions  if  all  it  had  meant  to  do  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  look,  we  want  you  to  use  exactly  what  comes  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  and  nothing  else.  And  there's  actually  another 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  as  well  as  the  "defined  in"  language  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  and  that's  in  Subsection  (p),  which  is  found  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4A  ­­ page  4A  of  the  appendix  to  the  government's  brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There,  Congress  uses  the  words  "in  violation  of,"  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense  which  is  in  violation  of  a  particular  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

The  upshot  of  Petitioner's  position  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  time  there's  an  interstate­commerce  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

element  in  any  of  the  Federal  provisions  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred  to,  only  a  violation  of  the  Federal  statute, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  a  Federal  criminal  prosecution  and  conviction  will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

count  as  an  aggravated  felony,  because  no  State  crime, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  foreign  crime  is  ever  going  to  have  interstate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce  as  an  element.

If  that's  what  Congress  had  meant,  if  it  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant  to  restrict  it  to  violations  of  that  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  then,  again,  it  had  language  at  its  fingertips 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  has  used  elsewhere  in  this  provision  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  allowed  it  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  there's  one  other  aspect  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  text  that  I'd  like  to  mention,  and  that's  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  particular  example  of  a  place  where  Petitioner's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reading  doesn't  make  sense  in  a  ­­ in  a  particular 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

context,  in  the  statute.  And  that's  Subsection  (j) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  on  page  2A  of  the  appendix  to  our  brief,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  offenses  described  in  several  Federal  provisions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  which  is  RICO.  RICO  has  in  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interstate­commerce  elements.  And  then  at  the  end  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  provision,  there  is  one  of  the  limitations  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  puts  in  sometimes,  and  the  limitation  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  offense  has  to  be  punishable  by  more  than  one  year. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Again,  under  Petitioner's  view,  only  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

violations  of  the  Federal  ­­ the  Federal  RICO  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  an  actual  Federal  prosecution  and  conviction  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  RICO  statute  would  ever  count  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  (j)  as  an  aggravated  felony. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  that  were  true,  there  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  reason  for  Congress  to  have  included  that  last  clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  because  Federal  RICO  convictions  are  always

it  must  be  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  understand  what  you 

    

 

 

 

 

­­ say  it  again. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Okay.  I'll  try. 

  

  

 

 

So  it's  Subsection  (j). 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Got  it. 

  

 

 

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  And  it  is  an  offense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

described  in  ­­ and  I'm  just  referring  to  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  statute  that's  listed  there. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  Can  you  give 

  

  

 

 

 

 

me  the  number  again? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  It's  page  2A  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

appendix  to  the  government's  brief.  And  I  should  say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

when  this  provision  went  into  the  aggravated  felony 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  it  was  only  RICO  and  not  these  other  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  follow  in  Subsection  (j)  that  were  listed.  So  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  an  offense  described  in  Section  1962  of  Title  18, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  RICO,  for  which  a  sentence  of  one­year 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprisonment  or  more  may  be  imposed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  what  I'm  saying  is  you  can  always  impose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  sentence  of  one  year  or  more  as  an  abstract  matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  have  convicted  somebody  of  a  Federal  RICO 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense.  And  so  it  can't  be  that  just  because  there's

an  interstate­commerce  element  in  the  Federal  RICO 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  that,  therefore,  State  and  foreign  convictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  drop  away  and  the  only  time  someone  is  an  aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felon  under  (j)  is  if  they  have  been  convicted  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  RICO  crime. 

 

 

            

If  that  were  right,  then  there  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  no  need  for  Congress  to  include  that  language  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  end. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  see. 

    

 

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  That's  there  clearly 

  

 

 

 

because  Congress  wanted  to  pick  up  State  and  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

versions  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Right,  right,  right.

more  minor  versions  of  those  crimes  where  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  sentencing  and  penalty  schemes  in  place.

the  jurisdictional  element.  Does  RICO  do  that?  What 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

does  RICO  say? 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Yes.  RICO  does  recite  an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

interstate­commerce  element.  It  does.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  basic  point  is  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

made  an  effort  to  count  these.  I  accept 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

counted  ­­

 

  

your  argument  there  are  about  ten  of  these  sections 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ you  know,  you  ­­ you  couldn't  use  that  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitation.  But  if  I  look  at  those  ten  individually,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  discover  that  I  ­­ Congress  did  want  to  pick  up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  crimes  there  or  they  don't  use  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  language  like  evade  a  tax  imposed  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this  title. 

 

            

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  it  isn't  really  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  the  anomaly  I  thought  it  was.  That's  your  point. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Yes,  that's  one  of  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

points,  certainly.  There  are,  I  think,  17  different 

   

  

 

 

 

 

places  in  the  aggravated  felony  provision,  if  you  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  actually  each  of  its  little  subsections,  and  some  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  have  two  or  three  subsections.  And  by  my  count, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  nine  of  them  have  an  interstate­commerce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  element.  And  so  it's  not  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

penultimate  sentence  would  be  superfluous  in 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  view,  but  it  would  start  doing  work  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  odd  way  for  only  about  half  of  the  aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony  provision,  and  that  would  just  be  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

strange  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  tax  one,  for  example, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  fraud  ­­ tax  fraud,  but  he  uses  different  language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Yes.  No,  I  think  as  to 

   

  

  

 

 

 

many  of  them,  as  with  respect  to  the  arson  offense  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  here,  it  would  make  sense  to  pick  up  State  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  particularly  foreign  crimes.  I  don't  want  foreign 

    

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  to  get  left  out  of  this  discussion  because  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  very  important  and  very  important  to  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  dealing  with  the  kinds  of  people  who  are  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  covered  by  the  aggravated  felony  provision  that  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  committed  a  sufficiently  serious  foreign  crime, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  would  get  picked  up.  And,  of  course,  foreign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  are  never  going  to  have  an  interstate­commerce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  element  in  them. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  How  do  you  deal  with  his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lack  of  uniformity  argument?  That  is,  some  crimes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  ­­ under  State  law,  the  same  conduct  will  be

labeled  by  some  States  a  felony,  other  States  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

misdemeanor,  and  you  get  a  lot  of  these  lesser­type 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses  swept  up  into  the  provision  that  doesn't  allow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  cancelation  of  removal? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  That's  not  a  feature  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

board's  interpretation  in  this  case.  That's  just  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

feature  of  the  aggravated  felony  provision  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  sweeps  in  things  that  the  States  characterize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  misdemeanors.  And  that's  very  well­recognized  both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  board  and  by  the  courts  of  appeals.  This  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  term  of  art,  aggravated  felony,  which  is  used  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  certain  immigration  consequences  should  attach 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  someone. 

 

            

And  so  the  fact  that  a  State 

   

 

 

 

 

idiosyncratically  or  for  its  own  reasons  attaches  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  low  penalty  to  something  that's  set  forth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  well­recognized  not  to  be  a  reason  to  keep  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  the  aggravated  felony  provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  I  believe  that 

   

  

 

 

Mr.  Guadagno's  point  was  that  this  is  ­­ it's  a  reason 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  Congress  may  have  used  the  language  that  it  did, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than,  say,  just  arson.  Right?  That  it  wanted  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  understood  that  there  was  a  wealth  of  very  minor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arson  crimes  out  there  in  the  States,  that  it  wanted  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclude  those.  And  the  way  it  excluded  those  was

essentially  by  saying,  no,  it's  got  to  be  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense. 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  think  that  would  be, 

    

 

 

 

 

again,  a  sort  of  strange  roundabout  way  to  exclude  them, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  to  move  it  back  through  the  crime  of  violence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision,  it  would  be  a  lot  of  work.  What  Congress 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  much  more  easily  have  done  is  just  to  put  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitation  right  there  in  (e)(1)  as  it  did  in  many  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  that  said  you  have  to  have  a  crime  that  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  which  you're  imprisoned  for  at  least  a  year,  or  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  value  of  property  has  to  be  affected. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  Congress  did  that,  not  only  when  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describing  ­­ I'm  sorry,  generic  aggravated  felonies, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  also  it  did  it  in  some  of  the  "described­in" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sections  like  Subsection  (j)  that  I  was  talking  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier.  So  that,  I  think,  would  be  the  way  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  would  have  approached  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

At  the  same  time,  I  don't  think  there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

anything  at  all  strange  in  thinking  that  Congress  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  exclude  even  things  that  are  more  minor  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arsons  go  on  a  scale  of  arsons  on  the  view  that  arson  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  really  serious  crime.  It  is  aggravated  in  every  sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  that  word. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  this  one  ­­ this  one

time  and  five  years  of  probation.  So  it  falls  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lesser  side.  Given  your  argument,  is  there  any  way  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  person  in  his  situation  could  get  a  cancelation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal? 

            

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  he's  just  stuck  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  absolute?  Even  when  it's  a  one­day  jail  time,  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lesser  crime,  there's  no  ­­ you're  really  locked  into  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  to  obtain  cancelation  of  removal. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  That's  right  that  he  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

obtain  cancelation  of  removal,  and  that's  consistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  Congress's  intent  in  putting  the  aggravated  felony 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  into  place,  which  was  to  constrain  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  general's  discretion  and  to  make  it  so  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney  general  was  locked  into  certain  conclusions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  was  because  Congress  thought  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  that  the  whole  cancelation  of  removal  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  working  before  the  aggravated  felony  provision  went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  place  was  it  wasn't  working  well.  Too  many  people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  being  allowed  to  stay,  and  too  many  people  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  their  removal  canceled.  And  Congress  expressed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

very  clearly  in  the  legislative  history  that  it  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  that,  and  it  wanted  to  constrain  the  attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general's  discretion.

say,  of  course,  the  attorney  general  may  decide  not  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  the  alien  to  removal  in  the  first  place,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  That's  true,  yes. 

  

 

 

 

Although,  aggravated  felony  is  a  ground  for  removal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  also,  I  don't  want  to  lose  sight  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  just  because  this  Petitioner's  sentence  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  day  and  five  years  of  probation  does  not  mean  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  committed  a  minor  crime  of  some  kind.  We  actually 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  what  the  conduct  was.  It's  not  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  the  only  thing  you've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been  able  to  think  of,  my  guess  is,  that  gets  around  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  arson  and  explosives  will  be  covered  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  crime  of  violence  is  that:  What  if  a  person  sets 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fire  to  his  own  property? 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  when  would  a  person  set  fire  to  his  own 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property?  When  he  wants  to  commit  fraud.  And  here  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  provision  that  puts  fraud  within  it.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

moreover,  it  has  the  limitation  of  $10,000.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  serious  fraud  crimes  will  fall  within  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  section. 

 

            

So  not  even  the  case  that  you've  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  up  is  ­­ actually  needs  this  provision  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecute  State  explosives  crimes,  because  either 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  against  other  people's  property,  in  which  case

they  fall  within  crime  of  violence,  or  they're  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  own  property,  in  which  case  they  are  a  specie  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud  over  $10,000. 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I'm  not  sure  that 

  

 

 

 

 

necessarily  works  under  the  categorical  approach  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  depend  what  the  person  was  actually  prosecuted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  in  State  court,  and  if  they  were  prosecuted  not  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud,  but  simply  for  arson,  and  it  was  a  provision  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  ­­ that  included  arson  against  your  own  property, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  I  think  you  wouldn't  fall  into  either  one. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  there's  actually  another  reason  that  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  get  to  before  why  I  think  some  arsons  might  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  crimes  of  violence.  And  there's  actually  just  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertainty  around  this,  but  after  this  Court's  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Leocal,  people  are  continuing  to  wrestle  with  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness  would  count  as  a  crime  of  violence.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  are  some,  at  least,  forms  of  recklessness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  picked  up  by  the  substantive  elements  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  844.  Malicious  arson  would  include  deliberate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

indifference  to  the  possibility  that  there  is  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  damage,  so  there  might  be  some  slippage  there  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well.  Although,  as  I  say,  I  ­­

   

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  what  do  you  think  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this?  I  mean,  I  ­­ I  think  I  dread  the  suggestion,  but

avoid  just  doing  this  section  by  section  and  saying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  did  Congress  want,  section  by  section.  And  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometime  ­­ you  know,  and  then  if  we  did  that  section  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section,  maybe  it  would  be  satisfactory  to  say,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  let  them  prove  the  jurisdictional  hook  in  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  deportation  proceeding. 

 

 

 

            

That  gives  the  attorney  general  considerably 

 

 

 

 

 

more  discretion.  She  can  do  it  if  she  wants;  she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  to  do  it  if  she  doesn't  want  to.

provision  entirely  and  not  to  do  that  for  a  couple 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  reasons. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  we  ­­

it  works  for  foreign  crimes.  So  in  a  foreign  crime 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation,  you  can't  come  in  and  provide  proof  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  an  interstate  commerce  element  because  there's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  an  equivalent  to  that  on  the  foreign  side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  I  just  think  there  is  a  whole  serious 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

set  of  crimes  that  Congress  wanted  to  include  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  that  approach  wouldn't  function. 

 

 

 

 

            

It  would  also  really  multiply  the  difficulty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  proceedings  and  make  them  much  longer  and  harder.

And  I  do  think  the  language  here  is  a  little 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

different  here  than  the  language  that  the  Court  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  in  Nijhawan,  where  this  $10,000  limitation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  in  the  aggravated  felony  provision  itself  and  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worded  in  a  particular  way  that  the  Court  seized  on. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  ­­ I  ­­ so  I  just  don't  think  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

analysis  necessarily  carries  over  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  again,  I  think  that  all  of  the  various 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

signs  that  you  would  use  to  interpret  the  statute  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  by  the  way,  four  of  the  courts  of  appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  have  addressed  this  have  said  the  statute  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unambiguously  clear.  It  means  what  the  board  said  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant.  I  think  that  ­­ that  all  of  those  signs  are  in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  and  so  you  should  be  talking  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Can  I  ­­ can  I  go  back  to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

your  ­­ to  your  argument  about  Subsection  (j)? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Are  there  State  RICO 

  

 

 

 

 

offenses  for  which  a  maximum  ­­ the  maximum  term  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imprisonment  is  less  than  a  year? 

   

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  don't  know  the  answer  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that,  but  I  think  there  might  be  ­­ there  might  be  such 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses  and  there  might  be  foreign  offenses  like  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  well.  And  I  haven't  been  able  to  canvas  that  whole 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area,  obviously.

And  I  still  think  that's  the  only 

   

 

 

 

 

explanation  for  that  limiting  language  at  the  end  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Are  there  State  or  foreign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

RICO  offenses  at  all? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  ­­ honestly,  I 

    

   

   

 

 

 

don't  know  the  answer  to  that,  but  I  think  there  might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well  be. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  There  are  State  ­­ there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  RICO  statutes,  but  RICO  is  a  ­­ is  a  ­­ is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarded  as  a  very  serious  crime.  It  seems  strange  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  ­­ a  RICO  misdemeanor.  I've  never  heard  of  such 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  thing. 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  mean,  I  seized  on  the 

    

   

 

 

 

RICO  statute,  but  actually  the  very  next  provision  in  J, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  Section  1084,  the  same  analysis  would  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  1084  is  a  statute  that  has  an  interstate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

commerce  element  in  it.  It  has  to  do  with  gambling  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transmitting  information  for  gambling  interstate 

 

 

 

 

commerce.  And  it  is  punishable  by  up  to  two  years  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  prosecuted  federally  and  there  is  a  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction. 

            

So  the  same  analysis  would  work  there  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  and  that's  something  where  I  think  it's  pretty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  there  would  be  State  analogues  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  elements  of  that  crime.  There  would  be

foreign  analogues  to  the  substantive  elements  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime  as  well. 

 

 

              

 

 

I  did  want  to  pick  up  on  one  other  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Petitioner  said  in  his  presentation,  which  is,  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  Congress  just  use  the  generic  definition  of  arson 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here? 

            

for  that. 

 

            

And  I  think  there  are  a  number  of  reasons 

   

   

 

 

 

 

For  one  thing,  I  think  it  would  have  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

underinclusive  because  it  wouldn't  have  included  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explosive  offenses  that  are  set  forth  in  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  very  likely.  Or  it's  possible  that  courts  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  reached  that  conclusion. 

 

 

 

            

For  another,  I  think  it  would  have 

   

 

 

 

 

entailed  ­­ and  I  know  this  Court  is  familiar  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  ­­ it  would  have  entailed  coming  up  with  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  elements  of  that  generic  offense  are,  and  that  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  difficult.  I  think  it  could  be  especially  difficult 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  arson  context  where  there  are  states  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  all  over  the  place  and  that  has  moved  away  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  classic  common  law  definition  of  burning  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dwelling  place. 

 

            

And  so  I  think  there  are  very  good  reasons 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  had  when  it  found  a  Federal  criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  that  had  the  substantive  elements  that  it

wanted  to  simply  refer  to  that  Federal  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  using  the  looser  language  of  described  in,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light  of  the  penultimate  sentence,  and  that's  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  can't  square  this  with 

    

 

 

 

 

the  categorical  approach.  I  ­­ I  ­­ you  know,  we've 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

been  very  clear.  The  categorical  approach  says,  every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  of  a  crime  that  has  to  be  proven  to  a  jury  has 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  included  in  the  State  offense.  But  now  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  it's  every  categorical  element  that's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional. 

            

Where  do  you  get  that  from? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well,  I  think  the  thrust  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  categorical  approach  is  that  you  don't  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  conduct  that  the  person  engaged  in.  You  look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  elements  of  the  crime  that  they  were  convicted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of.  And  then  you  compare  it  to  something  that  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  tells  you  to  compare  it  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  that  is  a  question  of  statutory 

   

   

 

 

 

 

interpretation,  what  it  is  that  you're  supposed  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comparing  it  to,  that  the  Federal  law  is  telling  you  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  proper  comparator. 

 

 

            

And  here,  that's  the  question  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

answering.  I  mean,  that's  the  question  about  what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

described  in  means.  About  what  it  means  in  light  of  the

penultimate  sentence. 

 

              

 

I  don't  think  there's  anything  in  this 

 

 

 

 

Court's  categorical­approach  cases  that  would  preclude 

 

 

 

 

 

the  interpretation  that  we're  putting  forth  here  today. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  just  think  it  hasn't  a  risen  in  exactly  this  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before. 

            

But  again,  this  ­­ the  important  thing  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  categorical  approach  is  that  you  don't  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  particular  conduct  here.  As  I  say,  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

not  even  in  the  record  what  his  conduct  is.  All  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  is  that  he  committed  a  felony  under  New  York  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  that  was  punishable,  my  understanding  is,  by  up  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seven  years  in  prison. 

 

 

 

            

            

And  that's  the  only  information  we  have. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  then  we  have  to  look  at  the  elements  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  New  York  statute  that  he  was  convicted  under  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compare  them  to  the  offense  described  in  Section  844(i). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To  the  extent  that  the  Court  thought  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  ambiguities,  we  would  ask  for  deference  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

board  here.  But  we  don't  think  there  is  ambiguity.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that,  as  the  courts  of  appeals  have  said,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  one  reading  of  the  statute  to  which  all  signs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  and  that's  the  reading  the  Court  should  adopt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions  ­­

decision  was  the  other  way,  and  it  wasn't  till  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit  came  ­­ came  out,  and  then  the  board  went  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  with  the  circuit  so  that  the  board  read  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  that  dilute  the  strength  of  the  board's  current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position,  that  it  was  not  its  original  position? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  I  don't  think  so.  I  mean, 

    

    

 

 

 

it  is  true  that  the  board  changed  positions,  but  it  knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  doing  it  and  it  gave  reasons  for  doing  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  gave  a  lot  of  reasons  in  its  ultimate  decision  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2002  that  are  not  reflected  in  the  original  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  board  doesn't  seem  to  have  considered  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original  decision. 

 

            

So  I  just  think  it's  the  ­­ the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Vasquez­Muniz  decision  from  2002  that  has  an  analysis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  similar  to  the  analysis  of  the  courts  of  appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  have  found  the  statute  unambiguous,  have  walked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  here  in  looking  at,  not  only  at  the  described­in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  itself,  but  at  all  the  other  signs  about  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  means.  And  I  don't  think  it  should  be  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negative  that  the  board  revisited  it  and  came  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  conclusion. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Am  I  not  remembering

the  Federal  "Three  Strikes"  law.  Within  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Three  Strikes"  law  is  actually  a  definition  of  arson. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  could  have  ­­ could  ­­ could  have  referred  to

provision,  it  ­­ it  discusses,  first  generically,

With  regards  to  the  comments  about  ­­ about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"defined  in"  with  regards  to  the  INA,  "defined  in"  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  consistently  to  ­­ to  refer  to  a  definition,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  congressional  drafting  manuals  all  indicate  that

And  my  final  point  is  that  what  we're

MR.  GUADAGNO:  As  I  said  before,  there  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

there  is  overlap  and  ­­ and  that  they're  very  likely  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  I  want  to  know  where 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  overlap  is  for  the  child  pornography. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GUADAGNO:  There  ­­ there  is  ­­ on  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one,  I  don't  think  there  is  ­­ there  is  any  question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  that  because  there  is  a  Second  Circuit  case  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  it's  called  Ouch  v.  Holder,  where  ­­ where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  did  not  pursue  the  child  pornography  under  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  provision  my  friend  is  referring  to.  It  was
