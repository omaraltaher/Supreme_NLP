CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  15­109,  Simmons  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Himmelreich. 

            

Mr.  Martinez. 

 

             

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ROMAN  MARTINEZ 

 

 

 

 

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

When  an  FTCA  action  is  dismissed  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2680,  the  resulting  judgment  of  dismissal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

triggers  the  judgment  bar  for  two  basic  reasons.  First, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  bar  applies  to  any  FTCA  judgment,  and  a  2680 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal  counts  as  a  judgment  under  any  sensible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  that  term. 

 

 

 

            

Second,  2680  dismissals  implicate  the  bar's 

 

 

 

 

 

core  purpose,  which  is  to  protect  the  government,  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functions,  and  its  employees  from  the  burdens  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disruptions  associated  with  multiple  lawsuits  over  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  subject  matter  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  I  ask  you  a 

   

  

 

 

 

question?  And  that  is  ­­ meaning  ­­ the  only  claims 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  exempted  under  the  Act  are  Bivens  claims,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  constitutional  violations.  Why  is  it  that  an

employee  who  has  committed  a  constitutional  violation  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

now  immune  from  suit  merely  because  the  plaintiff's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer  made  a  mistake  and  didn't  file  a  Bivens  claim 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

first? 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Your  Honor,  the  core  purpose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  judgment  bar,  as  this  Court  recognized  in  Will  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hallock,  is  to  protect  the  government  from  having  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigate  multiple  times  over  the  same  claim.  And  so  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  don't  blame  you  for 

    

 

 

 

 

that,  but  you  didn't  litigate  multiple  times  here.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  applied  immediately,  and  the  case  was  over. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Oh,  with  respect,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we  did  litigate  multiple  times.  The  FTCA  case  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought;  it  was  pending  for  over  three  years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  plaintiff  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  Bivens  claim  was 

  

 

 

 

 

brought  shortly  thereafter.  They  were  both 

  

 

 

 

 

simultaneously  pending  before  the  court. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  if  the  court  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

elected  to  address  the  Bivens  claim  first,  the  bar  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  avoided. 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  think  the  two  cases 

   

  

 

 

 

 

were  brought  in  two  different  actions.  One  was  brought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several  months  after  the  other.  And  the  FTCA  action,

which  is  the  one  that  obviously  Congress  was  considering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  enacted  the  judgment  bar,  was  one  that  took  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  years  to  conclude,  counting  the  three  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  that  the  plaintiff  took  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That  still  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

answer  my  point,  which  is,  if  the  district  court  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chosen  to  answer  the  Bivens  claim  first,  there  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  bar  in  place. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Your  Honor,  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  that  case,  it's  true  that  the  ­­ if  the  Bivens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim,  in  theory,  that  the  court  could  have  addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  But  in  most  Bivens  cases,  and  in  this  Bivens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  although  it  hasn't  yet  been  litigated,  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  is  going  to  raise  defenses  like  qualified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  and  other  defenses  on  the  merits.  They're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  take  a  long  time  for  that  claim  to  get  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That  just  means  that 

  

 

 

 

 

we're  ­­ we're  giving  district  courts  the  option  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreclose  or  close  the  courtroom  door,  because  the  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  too  hard  to  get  to? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  No,  not  at  all,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  ­­ the  ­­ the  courtroom  door  is  never  closed  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens  claim,  and  the  plaintiff  could  have  brought  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens  claim  at  the  outset.  He  could  have  litigated  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens  claim  without  bringing  the  FTCA  claim.

I  think  what's  important  to  realize  here  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  what  Congress  did  when  it  enacted  the  FTCA  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  create  a  new  remedy  and  offer  a  bargain 

   

   

 

 

 

 

to  ­­ to  tort  victims,  and  it  said,  look,  we're  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create  a  brand  new  remedy  directly  against  the  United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  for  money  damages.  It's  a  great  deal  for  you, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  if  you  accept  the  deal,  if  you  accept  the  bargain, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  choose  to  bring  an  FTCA  case,  and  then  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose  to  litigate  that  case  all  the  way  to  judgment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  turn  around  and  seek  relief  under  a  totally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  claim  involving  the  same  facts.  That's  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sensible  and  fair  bargain. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  a  claim  that  could 

   

  

 

 

 

not  be  brought  against  the  government. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  the  Bivens  claim  was  specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

saved  out  of  the  Westfall  Act,  so  that  the  employee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  a  Bivens  claim.  The  Bivens  claim  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively  against  the  employee.  There's  no  Bivens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

liability  on  the  part  of  the  government.  So  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow  the  ordinary  rules  of  claim  preclusion,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  no  preclusion  here,  because  there  was  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility  of  bringing  the  Bivens  claim  against  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  and  claim  preclusion  would  apply  only  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  that  could  have  been  brought.  So  you  couldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  brought  the  Bivens  claim  against  the  government.

It  would  have  to  be  a  separate  claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Your  Honor,  I  think  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

judgment  bar  doesn't  merely  embrace  a  rule  of  res 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicata,  it  embraces  a  different  rule  that  turns  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application  of  a  judgment.  Now,  with  respect  to  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  did  in  the  Westfall  Act,  there's  no  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  wanted  to  preserve  the  option  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  to  bring  a  Bivens  claim,  and  there's  nothing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  theory  of  this  case  that  precludes  ­­ that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  precluded  the  plaintiff  from  bringing  that  Bivens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  at  the  outset. 

 

 

 

            

But  it's  very  interesting,  and  I  think  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

very  telling  what  Congress  did  in  the  Westfall  Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  ­­ as  you  adverted  to.  In  Section  2679(b)(2)  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Westfall  Act,  Congress  specifically  said  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusivity  provision  that  it  had  enacted  in  2679(b)(1) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  apply  to  Bivens  claims.  And  so  it  expressly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carved  out  an  exception  for  such  claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  when  it  did  that,  it  did  not  carve  out  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar  exception  for  Bivens  claims  to  the  judgment  bar, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  the  separate  provision  in  section  2676  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  issue  in  this  case.  And  so  Congress  created  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  to  essentially  say  to  plaintiffs,  you  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  bring  your  Bivens  claim  at  the  outset,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  disrupt  the  original  bargain  at  the  heart  of  the

FTCA,  which  is  that  once  you  bring  an  FTCA  claim,  once 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  litigate  that  claim  all  the  way  to  judgment,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  try  to  take  a  second  bite  of  the  apple  by  having  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  claim  pending  at  the  same  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  would  have  a  nice,  clean 

   

  

 

 

 

 

textual  argument  if  you  were  willing  to  argue  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"judgment"  means  "judgment";  it  means  any  judgment.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  your  reply  brief,  you  say  that  perhaps  a  technical  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  procedural  judgment  is  not  a  judgment  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  bar  provision.  So  what  does  that  mean?  What 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  technical  or  procedural  judgment? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  So  I  think,  first  of  all,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  our  primary  position  is  that  judgment  does  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  in  the  sense  that  it's  defined.  I  think  we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  nine  different  dictionary  definitions  at  pages  19 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  20  of  our  brief,  and  I  think  it  ­­ it's  ­­ we  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  most  sensible  reading  of  judgment  is  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  ordinarily  used  in  legal  parlance. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that  said,  we  do  acknowledge  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reply  brief  that  a  couple  of  those  definitions, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

including  the  ones  that  we  ­­ we  reproduced,  we  weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  cherry  pick  definitions.  We  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reproduced  ­­ I  think  there  were  six  of  them  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Black's  Law  Dictionary  from  1933  that  we  reproduced. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  three  of  those  definitions  seem  to  say  that

a  judgment  has  to  resolve  issues  of  the  parties'  rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  issues  of  liabilities.  So  it's  possible  ­­ again,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  this  is  the  best  reading,  but  it's  possible, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  only  applied  one  of  those  three  definitions,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  certain  kinds  of  dismissals  that  are  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curable  procedural  defects  that  really  don't  get  to  the

don't  think  this  case  presents  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  wouldn't  a  dismissal  for 

   

  

 

 

 

lack  of  jurisdiction  be  a  procedural  judgment? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  in  ­­ in  many  cases  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissal  for  lack  of  jurisdiction  could  well  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  judgment,  but  not  in  this  case,  because  2680 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissals  are  special  and  unique  insofar  as  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional,  as  both  parties  agree.  But  they're  also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive,  as  this  Court  has  said  many,  many  times 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  and  over  again,  in  cases  like  Indian  Towing  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  like  Levin,  most  recently,  just  a  few  terms  ago. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  when  ­­ when  the  Court  says  ­­ looks  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  FTCA  case,  and  the  Court  says  there  is  no  ­­ there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  liability  here  for  the  United  States  government  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets  rid  of  the  case,  even  if  it  puts  the  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

label  on  the  dismissal,  if  it  adjudicates  the  case  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2680,  it's  making  a  substantive  determination  that

there's  no  liability.  And  I  actually  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  my  ­­ my  friend  on  the  other  side  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagree  with  that. 

 

 

              

I  think  in  his  own  brief  at  pages  11  and  12, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  makes  clear  that  a  2680  dismissal  means  that  there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  liability  for  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  No  liability  on  the  part 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Federal  government  under  the  FTCA,  but  it's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  no  judgment  at  all  with  respect  to  the  Bivens  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  depends  on  the  employee's  conduct.  There's  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  adjudication  at  all  of  the  employee's  conduct  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  action. 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Right.  The  first  action 

  

  

 

 

 

often  will  not  even  often  involve  a  Bivens  claim,  but  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  question  ­­ the  reason  we're  discussing  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  point  is  because  we're  trying  to  figure  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  meaning  of  the  word  "judgment"  is  in  Section  26 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  FTCA.  So  we're  trying  to  figure  out  whether  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudication  of  a  particular  FTCA  case  would  qualify  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  judgment,  and  I  think  there's  no  question  that  when  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FTCA  case  is  adjudicated  and  is  conclusively  resolved  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor  of  the  government  on  the  basis  of  one  of  the  2680 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions,  it's  true  that  that's  jurisdictional,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  also  a  substantive  adjudication  of  the  claim.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Martinez  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Go  ahead. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  I  could  ask  you  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ what  I  take  to  be  the  Respondent's  primary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  in  the  case  now,  which  is  the  meaning  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase  "the  provisions  of  this  chapter  in  Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1346(b)  shall  not  apply"  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ and  of  course,  that  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  the  judgment  bar.  So  if  you  take  that  provision 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  all  it's  worth,  it  says  that  the  judgment  bar  shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  apply.  So  what  is  your  response  to  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  think  we  have  two  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

two  responses.  Our  main  response  ­­ and  this  is  the  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  developed  the  most  fully  in  our  reply  brief  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  that  language  does  not  mean  what  he  say  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  he  says  it  means.  We  think  that  that  language 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  what  this  Court  has  essentially  said  in  a  number 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  cases,  most  clearly  in  the  Dolan  case  involving  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Postal  Service  about  ten  years  ago,  and  what  ­­ what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  there  was  that  the  2680  exceptions,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  provision,  set  forth  exceptions  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  ­­ to  the  United  States  waiver  of  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity.  And  it  identified  that  waiver  of  sovereign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunity  as  being  effected  in  two  different  provisions

of  the  FTCA.  That's  1346(b),  the  jurisdictional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provision,  and  2674,  the  liability  provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  interpret  that  introductory  language, 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  this  Court  has  interpreted  it  in  cases  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dolan,  and  said  the  same  thing  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  really  does  make  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  language  something  it's  not.  Instead  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  of  this  chapter  in  1346(b),  that's  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  says,  you're  essentially  reading  it  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2674  of  this  chapter  and  Section  1346(b).  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  real  shift  in  what  the  language  actually  says. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  think  I  would  say  two 

   

   

  

 

 

 

things  to  that,  Your  Honor.  First  of  all,  we  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  consistent  with  the  way  that  the  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted  2680  in  the  prior  cases  like  Dolan  and  Levin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  just  mentioned.  But  more  fundamentally,  I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

the  Court  already  considered  and  rejected  this  exact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  about  the  introductory  language,  the  "shall  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply"  language,  and  it  rejected  that  argument  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Smith  case,  United  States  v.  Smith.  Now,  that  case  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  point  out 

  

 

 

 

 

where,  in  that  case,  we  explicitly  addressed  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  and  rejected  it? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  You  didn't  explicitly  discuss 

  

 

 

 

 

that  language,  but  the  holding  of  the  case  was  that  one

of  the  provisions  of  this  Chapter  2679(b)  did  apply  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2680  claim.  And  so  that's  ­­ that's  obviously 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  with  the  idea  ­­ the  argument  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent  makes,  which  is  that  none  of  the  other

today. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  no,  no. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  just  wanted  to  emphasize. 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  We're  all  being  so  polite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  MARTINEZ:  In  response  to  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor's  point,  Justice  Sotomayor  suggested  that 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  the  Court  didn't  address  it  explicitly,  and  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true,  but  I  want  to  emphasize  that  the  parties  did  raise 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  argument,  and  we  briefed  this  argument  at  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

length  in  our  merits  brief,  so  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  2679  is  different,  though, 

  

 

 

 

 

right?  Because  2679,  the  text  of  it,  says  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions  shall  be  applicable  to  FTCA  actions.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

although  the  Court  didn't  directly  confront  this  issue, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  might  have  said,  if  it  had  confronted  the  issue,

was  something  like,  well,  2679,  which  comes  along  later, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  says  all  the  exceptions  are  applicable  to  FTCA

general  rule  of  inapplicability. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  ­­ I  ­­ I  think  that 

    

   

   

 

 

 

that  would  not  be  the  best  reading  of  Smith,  because  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  would  suggest  that  the  Court  saw  some  sort  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conflict  between  the  umbrella  language,  the  introductory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause,  and  Section  2679(b)(4),  which  is  what  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about. 

 

              

I  actually  think  2679(b)(4)  helps  us, 

 

 

 

 

because  what  it  shows  is  that  Congress  shared  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  of  what  the  "shall  not  apply"  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means.  Congress  enacted  Section  2679(b)(4),  which  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  one  that  says  the  exceptions  do  apply  to  Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2679(b)  cases.

extensively  in  Smith,  and  the  Court  said  nothing  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  No,  the  ­­ the  Court  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  holding  was  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Oh,  no.  I  know  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

Court's  holding.  But  in  terms  of  the  analysis  of  it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  Court  did  nothing  along  those  lines. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Right.  Just  to  step  back  and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

let  me  set  the  stage. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

So  in  ­­ in  Smith,  the  plaintiff  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  had  made  the  "shall  not  apply"  language  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Respondent  makes  here.  It  made  it  in  its  brief  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposition  to  certiorari.  It  was  made  at  page  21. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  government  then  devoted  a  significant 

   

 

 

 

chunk  of  its  brief  at  pages  19  to  24  to  refute  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  and  I  think  probably  because  the  argument  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  made  a  fairly  compelling  case,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  then  asserted  that  argument  only  in  one  page 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  his  response  brief  at  page  44,  and  then  he  raised  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  oral  argument  on  page  35.  And  if  Respondent's  theory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  correct,  that  would  have  meant  that  Smith  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  had  had  to  come  out  the  other  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why?  I  thought  ­­ I  don't 

    

   

  

 

 

understand  that.  I  thought  the  question  in  Smith,  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  suit  against  something  happened  abroad;  isn't  that

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  employee  could  not

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  ­­ I  don't  recall  exactly 

    

   

 

 

 

whether  it  was  a  Bivens  claim.  I  don't  believe  it  was  a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bivens  claim.  I  think  essentially  what  happened  was  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  was  a  case  under  2680,  because  it  ­­ it  involved  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tort  that  happened  overseas.  And  the  question  in  the

case  was  whether  the  substitution  provisions  ­­ I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  a  State  tort  or  some  other  cause  of  action.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  was  whether  2679(b),  (c),  and  (d)  substitutions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  would  apply  to  that  claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  I'll  do  is  I'll  read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  five  times.  I  mean,  this  is  a  very  complicated  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  like  Abbott  and  Costello  and  so  forth  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ but  by  the  time  you  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  these  statutes  ­­ okay.  I  read  it.  I'll  read 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  several  times.  I  will  absolutely  take  it  in. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Suppose  I  come  to  the  conclusion  that  Smith, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

like  so  many  of  our  cases,  deals  with  a  certain  number 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  issues,  and  maybe  there  were  alternative  grounds  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  didn't  get  to  them,  and  I  conclude  that  Smith,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  is  not  a  bar  to  the  argument  that  the  other  side

alternative  grounds.  This  was  the  ­­ the  square  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  case.  The  case  could  not  have  come  out  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  understand  you  think 

    

 

 

 

Smith  is  the  end  of  it,  and  all  I  am  saying  is  one  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  things  I'm  paid  to  do  it  is  read  those  cases,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  I  have  to  reach  a  conclusion  of  whether  Smith  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  end  of  it.  If  it's  the  end  of  it,  you  win. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  if  it's  not  the  end  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  do  you  lose? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  No.  We  don't  lose  for  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  reasons.  First  of  all,  the  arguments  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  in  Smith  ­­ so  even  if  Smith  were  not  on  the  table, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  hypothesis.  I  think  the  arguments  about 

    

 

 

 

 

 

2679(b)(1)  that  were  at  issue  in  Smith,  I  think  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  briefs  in  Smith  was  absolutely  correct,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2679(b)(1)  clearly  applies  to  cases  involving  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  fall  into  the  2680  exceptions.  We  think  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  as  a  matter  of  the  text  of  the  FTCA.  But  even 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaving  2679(b)  aside  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  This  is  the  language  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  hanging  me  up.  "The  provisions  of  this  chapter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall  not  apply  to  cases  that  are  based  on  the  exercise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  performance  of  the  failure  to  exercise  and  perform  a

Looks  pretty  good  for  you. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

But  over  here  it  says,  "The  judgment  bar 

 

 

 

 

 

shall  constitute  a  complete  bar."  That's  very  good  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you,  but  just  said  it  didn't  apply.  It  says  this  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  chapter  does  not  apply. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  it  says  the  chapter 

    

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  apply  ­­

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  in  the  chapter. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  MARTINEZ:  A  couple  of  responses,  Your 

    

 

 

 

 

Honor.  First  of  all,  just  as  a  textual  matter,  we  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ what  ­­ what  2680,  what  that  language  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  provisions  of  the  chapter  don't  apply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories  of  potential  claims.  So  the  word  is  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  apply  to  claims. 

 

 

 

            

The  judgment  bar  doesn't  operate  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  of  claims;  it  operates  on  the  basis  of  judgments. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  talks  about  an  FTCA  judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A  judgment  and  a  claim  are  obviously 

   

 

 

 

different.  A  claim  is  an  assertion  of  a  legal  right 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

before  it's  been  adjudicated  or  while  it's  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicated  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That's  slicing  the  bologna 

  

 

 

 

 

pretty  thin. 

 

            

(Laughter.)

trying  to  set  up  language  that  applies  to  a  whole  bunch 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  different  provisions  and  saying,  you  know,  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  provisions  don't  apply  in  the  context  of  lawsuits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically. 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  that  ­­ I  think  that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ even  if  you  think  that  that's  slicing  the  bologna 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too  thin,  I  don't  think  you  need  to  resolve  the  case  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  basis  of  that  argument  because  I  think  there  are  two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  very  strong  reasons  to  reject  their  reading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  introductory  clause  in  addition  to  Smith,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  already  talked  about. 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ the  next  reason  is  that  it's  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  reading  of  Smith  is  inconsistent  with  numerous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  provisions  of  the  original  FTCA. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  Kagan,  you  just  said  that,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plain  text  seems  to  say  that  they  wanted  to  exempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2680  claims  from  all  of  the  provisions  of  the  FTCA,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguably,  that's  what  the  literal  language  seems  to  say. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  if  you  look  at  the  original  FTCA,  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  possibly  be  what  ­­ what  that  language  means. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  let  me  point  you  just  to  four  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  of  the  original  FTCA  that  don't  seem  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  under  that  reading. 

 

 

 

            

The  first  of  those  provisions  is  Section  402 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  original  FTCA,  and  we've  reproduced  that  at

page  10a  of  the  appendix  to  our  brief.  Section  402  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definitional  provision  which  defines  certain  key 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms  for  use  throughout  in  the  ­­ throughout  the  FTCA, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  defines  several  terms  that  are  used  in  multiple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places  within  2680. 

 

 

            

So  if  Respondent's  theory  were  correct  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  provisions  of  ­­ every  other  provision  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FTCA  doesn't  apply  to  2680  claims,  those  definitions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  apply  to  2680  claims  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Now  that's  where  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Respondents  use  an  argument  very  much  like  the  one  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  used.  They  say  definitions  don't  apply  to  claims; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  that  right? 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  if  it's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

slicing  the  bologna  thin  for  us,  it's  slicing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bologna  thin  for  them.  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It's  a  wash. 

   

  

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  The  good  news  for  us  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  three  other  provisions  that  I  think  also  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  any  sense  based  on  their  reading.  And  so  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  Section  411  of  the  original  FTCA,  and  that's  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  12a  of  our  brief,  Section  411  is  the  one  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  obviously,  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Procedure  are  supposed  to  be  used  to  adjudicate  claims

that  fall  within  2680.  But  in  their  reading  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appear  not  to  apply. 

 

 

 

            

If  you  look  to  the  very  next  page  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  next  provision  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Wouldn't  they  apply  anyway? 

  

 

 

 

 

Do  you  need  a  provision? 

   

 

 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Congress  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Specifically  saying  that 

  

 

 

 

they  would  apply? 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  you  probably  didn't, 

    

 

 

 

 

but  Congress  seemed  to  think  that  you  did.  And  in  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  statutes,  like  the  Tucker  Act  and  like  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Suits  and  Admiralty  Act  where  the  ­­ where  Congress  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waiving  the  sovereign  immunity  of  the  United  States,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  it  needed  to  set  forth  a  specific  provision  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  waiving  sovereign  immunity  applying  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil  rules. 

 

            

And  in  fact,  the  Fifth  Circuit  in  the  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  five  ­­ five  or  six  years  before  the  FTCA  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed,  had  said  that  the  rules  would  not  apply  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tucker  Act  claim.  So  I  think  Congress  was  ­­ clearly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  this  problem  in  mind  and  was  trying  to  address  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  is  that  bad?  So  ­­ I

the  top  of  2680,  "The  provisions  of  this  chapter  shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  apply  to."  And  then  we  have  a  long  list.  One  of 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  is  an  action  rising  a  claim  based  on  a  foreign 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

country. 

            

So  I  bring  a  lawsuit.  I  was  hurt  in  Mexico. 

    

   

   

 

 

 

This  says  the  FTCA  doesn't  apply.  And  so  you  say,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  if  it  doesn't  apply,  that  means  the  definitions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  apply.  So  I  say  fine.  It  doesn't  apply.

Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  don't  apply.  Fine.  Nothing 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

applies. 

            

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  don't  have  an  action. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  MARTINEZ:  But  if  you  file  the  action 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyway,  and  then  the  Court  is  adjudicating  the  action, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  at  issue  in  the  action  is  whether,  for  example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  action  involves  a  Federal  agency,  which  is  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined  term,  or  an  employee  of  the  government,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  defined  term,  then  you  would  have  to  ­­ ordinarily  you

provisions  would  shed  light  on  that  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  if  you  are  correct,  though,  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  definitional  provision  doesn't  apply,  then  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  know  where  to  look  for  the  definitions.  And  if

you  were  to  lose  that  case,  and  ­­ and  if  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  to  win  and  you  wanted  to  take  an  appeal,  your  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  appeal  is  also  one  of  the  provisions  of  this  chapter, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that's  Section  412(a)  of  the  original  FTCA,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  reproduced  at  page  13a  of  our  brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  there's  a  ­­ the  FTCA  created  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  appellate  review  provision  that  essentially  gave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  an  option  to  take  an  appeal  either  to  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit  courts  or  to  the  court  of  claims.  So  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  FTCA­specific  provision. 

 

 

            

But  under  Respondent's  theory,  that  appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  wouldn't  apply  because  it's  one  of  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  of  this  ­­ of  this  chapter. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  the  final  provision  I  want  to  point 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  presumably  just  then  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

normal  appeals  provisions  would  apply.  You  would  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  able  to  appeal  a  case;  you  just  wouldn't  have  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  court  of  claims  option. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Right.  But  ­­ but  that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

what  Respondent  says.  And  he  says  that  ­­ that  this,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  makes  perfect  sense  because  Congress  didn't  want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  of  claims  to  be  adjudicating  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicability  of  the  2680  exceptions. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  that  argument  doesn't  make  sense  for  two

reasons.  First  of  all,  if  the  government  were  to  lose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  2680,  the  case  would  go  forward  and  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved  on  the  merits,  and  maybe  government  loses  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too.  It  could  then  take  an  appeal  to  the  court  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims,  at  which  point  the  court  of  claims  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confronted  if  the  government  appealed  the  2680 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  with  exactly  the  kind  of  2680  issue  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent  says  the  court  of  claims  wasn't  supposed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  considering. 

 

            

Moreover,  when  ­­ when  Congress  recodified 

 

 

 

 

 

the  FTCA's  appellate  review  provisions  in  1948,  just  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  later,  it  sent  the  provision  allowing  appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  the  court  of  claims  to  28  U.S.C.  1504,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  different  provision.  It's  ­­ it's  not  a  provision 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

within  Chapter  171.  But  there,  when  it  said  the  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  of  claims'  jurisdiction  was,  it  said  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  had  jurisdiction  over  any  action  brought  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FTCA;  in  other  words,  actions  that  were  ­­ that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially  implicated  2680. 

 

 

            

Now,  we  agree  with  Respondents  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recodification  didn't  change  the  meaning  of  the  original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FTCA,  but  what  that  means  is  that  Congress  ­­ Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplated  both  before  and  after  the  recodification, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  all  of  these  issues  would  be  able  to  go  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  of  claims  if  the  parties  agreed.

before  you  ­­ I'm  sorry. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Yes.  I  ­­

    

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Because  I  broke  into  what 

   

  

 

 

 

you  were  saying  before. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  So  ­­ so  just  to  ­­ just  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recap:  The  definitional  provision,  Section  402,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  provision,  Section  411,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate  review  provision,  Section  412(a),  and  then  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  one  ­­ and  this  is  the  one  that  is  both  true  ­­ a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  as  of  the  original  FTCA,  and  it  creates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

massively  disruptive  consequences  with  respect  to,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  terms  today,  that  Section  423  of  the  original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FTCA,  and  it's  the  provision  that's  now  codified  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2679(a)  of  the  current  FTCA. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  let  me  say  a  word  about  this  provision.

the  current  version.  And  I  apologize  for  the  confusion, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  know.  There  are  a  lot  of  statutory  provisions  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case.  The  current  version  of  2679(a)  is  at  page

Now,  this  is  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Before  ­­ if  I  could  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

interrupt  very  quickly. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Of  the  other  three,  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ones  are  still  current  today? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  So  the  definitional  provision 

  

 

 

 

 

is  still  there.  The  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  is  not  there.  The  appellate  review  provision, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interestingly,  has  been  ­­ or  has  been  sent  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  provision  ­­ has  been  sent  outside  ­­ outside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Chapter  171. 

 

 

            

The  one  that  matters  the  most  is  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2679(a),  and  that's  the  provision  that  says  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  FTCA  is  the  exclusive  remedy  and  precludes  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tort  suits  against  agencies  that  would  otherwise  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  suable  understand  there  sue­and­be­sued  authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  idea  behind  that  provision  is  to  put, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially,  all  Federal  agencies  on  the  same  footing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  they  have  independent  authority  to  sue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  be  sued  when  it  comes  to  tort  claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  ­­ if  ­­ under  Respondent's  theory, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2679(a)'s  protections  did  not  apply  to  2680 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims.  And  what  that  means  is  that  agencies  that  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue­and­be­sued  authority  are  now  subject  to  such

claims. 

            

Now,  that  ­­ that  would,  in  very  practical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms,  would  massively  expand  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  direct  liability  for  ­­ for  ­­ in  tort.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  the  biggest  problem,  and  the  most  concrete 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  I  can  give  you  is  with  respect  to  the  Postal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service. 

            

Now,  we  know  from  Section  2680(b)  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FTCA  that  Congress  wanted  to  eliminate  the  possibility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  government  would  be  liable  for  the  loss  of  mail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  for  the  negligent  transmission  of  ­­ of  mail.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Postal  Service  has  independent  sue­and­be­sued 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  So  if  2679(a),  as  Respondent  says,  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply,  then  what  that  means,  essentially,  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Postal  Service  can  now  be  sued  under  his  theory  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negligently  transmitting  the  mail. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  How  does  any 

  

  

 

 

 

 

of  this  save  you  from  an  individual  suit?  Meaning  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  reading  you  give  this  provision,  an  individual  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chooses  not  to  go  under  1346  and  simply  sue  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  involved  could  do  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ either  under  a  Bivens 

   

  

 

 

 

claim  or  under  the  Administrative  Act,  et  cetera.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  you're  saying  is, 

  

 

 

 

 

you  have  the  opportunity,  as  the  United  States,  to  step 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  if  you  choose.  Is  that  it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  If  ­­ if  ­­ if  a  Bivens  claim 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  brought,  then  the  judgment  bar  would  have  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operation.  But  that  is  consistent  with  the  purpose  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judgment  bar,  which  ­­ which  is  to  ensure  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  suit  is  only  brought  once.  And  I  think  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Putting  that  aside,  how 

  

 

 

 

 

does  your  reading  save  you  from  all  of  this  definitional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion  we've  had  for  the  last  five  minutes?  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  going  to  happen,  or  can  happen.  Why  does  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  being  proposed  by  the  other  side  create  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficulty? 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Well,  I  think  if  the  Bivens 

   

  

 

 

 

 

claim  can  be  brought,  then  the  Bivens  claim  is  brought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  individual  employee,  so  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  is  not  liable  for  ­­ you  know,  to  take  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  we  said,  for  the  negligent  transmission  of  mail. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  the  Court's  ­­ unless  the  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions,  I'll  reserve  my  time  for  rebuttal.

MR.  VERGONIS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Through  Section  2680  and  the  judgment  bar, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  established  a  fair  and  sensible  statutory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

scheme  where  the  government  accepts  derivative  superior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability  for  the  torts  of  its  employees,  a  plaintiff 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  tries  his  claim  against  the  government  may  not  seek 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  second  bite  at  the  apple  or  duplicative  recovery  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suing  the  employee  personally.  That's  the  fair  bargain. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  where  the  United  States  has  not  waived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

derivative  liability,  the  judgment  bar  is  not  a  gotcha 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  that  prevents  a  plaintiff  who  sued  the  wrong 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  from  thereafter  suing  the  correct  defendant, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  primarily  liable  employee.  Those  claims  are  outside 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  bargain.  And  the  "shall  not  apply"  directive  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2680  makes  this  perfectly  clear. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  some  of  the  Justices  recognized  during 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel's  presentation,  that  language  says  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  provisions  of  the  Act  shall  not  apply.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unambiguously  includes  the  judgment  bar. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  there's  no  inconsistency  between  that 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  of  the  "shall  not  apply"  language  and  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  other  clauses  or  any  of  this  Court's  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It  can't  be  read  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

strictly  literal  sense  because  then  2680  itself  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official ­ Subject to Final Review 

31 

apply. 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  Well,  that's  somewhat 

  

 

 

 

circular,  Justice  Alito. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  All  right.  That's  one  way 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  we're  out  of  a  purely  literal  reading  of  this. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  I  think  it  says  the  FTCA 

    

 

 

 

 

 

shall  not  apply  to  these  provisions.  It  has  to  apply  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself.  No  other  ­­ it's  ­­ the  literal  interpretation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  inconsistent  with  any  of  the  other  provisions  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying,  and  it's  not  inconsistent  with  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  in  Smith.  In  Smith,  this  Court  focused  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  of  2679(b),  which  said  Westfall  Act  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall  be  subject  to  the  exceptions.  That  language, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

combined  with  legislative  history  that  Smith  examined, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  Congress  said  if  a  claim  is  barred  against  the  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  government,  it's  also  barred  against  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee,  was  sufficient  to  resolve  Smith. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  about  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Smith  ­­ Smith  could  be

Westfall  Act  was  to  allow  substitution,  so  if  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  apply,  then  there  wouldn't  be  substitution  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  would  be  no  point  in  having  the  Westfall  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Correct? 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  Well,  certainly  you  could 

  

 

 

 

 

look  at  it  that  way,  so  yes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  for  a  provision  to  overcome  the 

   

 

 

 

 

literal  language  of  the  "shall  not  apply"  directive,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  need  an  absurd  result  from  following  it  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overcome  the  language.  And  maybe  you  had  that  absurd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result  in  Westfall  or  any  of  these  other  provisions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  justify  it,  but  there's  no  ­­ they  point  to  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absurd  result  that  can  overcome  the  import  of  the  plain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  if  you  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definitional  provisions?  Okay,  2680  has  a  lot  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

terms  that  would  be  subject  to  some  litigation  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing  ­­ who's  ­­ who's  ­­ confusion.  Who's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  of  the  government?  Is  the  provision  construed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  include  a  contractor?  Those  are  all  spelled  out  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definitional  provision. 

 

 

            

Now,  under  your  argument,  those  definitions 

 

 

 

 

 

are  off  the  table  and  you  can  litigate  for  days  on  end 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about,  does  this  cover  a  contractor  of  the  United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

States?  And  you're  saying,  well,  normally,  you'd  say

let's  look  at  the  definition,  and  it  says  ­­ well,  yeah, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  says  that  right  there.  But  under  your  argument,  no, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definitions  are  not  included. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  No,  we  think  the  definitions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  included,  because  definitions  govern  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

terms,  they  don't  govern  claims.  And  I  don't  think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  all  due  respect,  that  that's  slicing  the  bologna 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thin  at  all.  The  definitions  apply  to  the  terms,  and

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it's  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  ­­ excepts  claims. 

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It's  a  provision  of 

   

  

 

 

 

the  chapter  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  And  it  doesn't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ under  your 

  

 

 

 

 

reading,  which  is  a  strict  literal  one,  that  it  shall 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  apply.  Those  provisions  shall  not  apply  to  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims.  Okay.  Well,  somebody  brings  a  claim  against  a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

contractor  of  the  United  States,  and  again,  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  well,  we  don't  look  to  the  definitions  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  to  determine  who's  a  contractor  of  the  United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

States,  because  that  provision  doesn't  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  Well,  you  can  look  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitions  to  understand  what  2680  says.  And  then  once

substantive  provisions  don't  apply.  And  I'll  give  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example.  Federal  Rule  of  Evidences  1101  states  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  rules  do  not  apply  to  a  certain  category  of  cases, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including  preliminary  proceedings  in  a  criminal  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

Federal  Rule  of  Evidence  101  defines  what  a  criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  is. 

 

            

Nobody  would  say  it's  inconsistent  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"do  not  apply"  directive  of  Federal  Rule  1101  to  read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definition  of  a  criminal  case  to  figure  out  when  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  don't  apply,  or  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow  gives  license  to  courts  to  then  decide  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  rules  do  and  do  not  apply.  None  of  the  rules 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  to  certain  aspects  of  a  criminal  case,  but  you  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refer  to  the  definitional  rule  to  understand  what  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  case  is. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

review  provisions?  Those  seem  to  be  a  particular  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  problematic  aspect.  The  review  provisions, 

  

 

 

 

 

I  take  it,  don't  apply  either. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  They  don't.  And  are  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

talking  about  the  appellate  review  provisions? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  13(a),  Section  412. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  Yeah,  412  is  the  appellate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

review  provisions.  The  decisions  were  appealable  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuit  courts  through  the  predecessor  to  28  USC  1291,

Judicial  Code  128.  So  parties  could  rely  on  that  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal  to  the  circuit  court.  So  the  special  review 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  to  the  court  of  claims  did  not  apply  to  2680 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissals.  And  we  suggest  that  that  was  sensible 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Congress  could  have  wanted  judgments  against  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,  money  judgments  against  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primarily  to  be  reviewed  by  the  specialized  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims,  but  to  have  ordinary  dismissals  under  2680, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  dismissals,  reviewed  in  the  ordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

course  by  the  circuit. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  can  see  that,  but  ­­ that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  imagine  a  plaintiff  and  the  plaintiff  brings  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit  against  the  Post  Office  for  negligence.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  defense  is  that  this  is  a  discretionary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

function,  a  particular  thing.  And  the  plaintiff  says, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you're  right,  it's  a  discretionary  function.  And  now 

   

  

 

 

 

 

it's  dismissed.  All  right. 

  

 

 

            

 

 

 

Now,  if  that  last  thing  he  read  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

apply  because  it  was  discretionary  function  and  fell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  2680,  they  then  could  see  the  Post  Office  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  that  the  Post  Office  has  independent  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue  or  be  sued.  And  it's  hard  to  believe,  he  says,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  somehow,  when  they  passed  these  words,  "does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  apply",  suddenly  wanted  to  revive  all  kinds  of  suits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against,  for  example,  the  Post  Office,  which  otherwise

would  have  been  barred  by  that  last  provision  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read. 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  And  the  Post  Office  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

great  example,  Your  Honor,  because  when  Congress  enacted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sue­and­be­sued  clause  for  the  Post  Office,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inserted  another  provision  now  at  39  U.S.C., 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  409,  which  said  that  tort  claims  against  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Post  Office  shall  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Tort  Claims  Act. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  we  don't  have  to  worry 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  Post  Office,  the  example  that  he  gave.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  may  be  others.  Sue  and  be  sued  is  a  fairly  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  do  we  know  what  we're  talking  about?  I  like  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  know  what  I'm  talking  about.  And  do  we  know  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  reach  of  exempting  that  last  provision  from  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  erasing  it  in  a  discretionary  action  suit  will  be? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  Two  answers  to  that.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

discretionary  function  exception  is  a  common­law 

   

 

 

 

exception,  so  it  may  be  that  suable  agencies  have  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  available  to  them  anyway.  It  existed  before  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FTCA  was  created  as  a  common­law  defense. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  suable  agencies  who  could  be  sued 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again  can  raise  other  defenses,  as  this  Court  held  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FDIC  v.  Meyer,  just  because  a  suable  agency  can  be  sued 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  a  claim  doesn't  mean  that  the  claim  exists  against

the  suable  agency.  And  three  of  the  exceptions  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2680  are  suable  agencies  themselves. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

So  if  you  read  2679  as  applying  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions,  their  reading  of  the  statute,  you  create  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  where,  say,  the  Panama  Canal  Company  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued  ­­ well,  2679  on  their  reading  bars  that  suit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  Panama  Canal  Company  and  makes  the  FTCA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive,  but  then  2680  under  the  FTCA  bars  the  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  ­­ arising  out  of  the  activities  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Panama  Canal  Company. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  ­­ so  you're  ­­ can  I  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  you  saying  this,  in  essence?  Even  if  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  provisions  that  aren't  erased,  even  if  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't,  this  particular  erasure  means  that  in  an  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  dismissed  ­­ an  action  against  the  government  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  reasons  listed  in  those  exceptions  ­­ for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  a  foreign  country,  a  discretionary  exception  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

in  such  an  action,  you  can  sue  the  employee  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  principals  of  res  judicata  wouldn't  bar  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  suing  the  employee  after  all.  It's  a  different 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

party. 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  That's  our  position,  and  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  can  only  sue  the  employee  today  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  tort  claims  under  Bivens.

claim,  if  it  falls  within  ­­ if  the  reason  for  the  bar, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  reason  for  the  dismissal  falls  within  the

judgments  of  the  merits,  or  is  that  somewhat  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  your  argument? 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  That's  one  of  our  arguments, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  We  get  to  the  same  result  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Isn't  that  the  same  as  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  you  just  made?  Because  I'm  curious  to  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  we  think  Smith  was  an  interpretation  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2680,  and  you  had  to  get  around  Smith  and  it's  awkward 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  it,  what's  your  second  argument?  Is  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  you're  now  making  to  Justice  Breyer,  or  is  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  saying  that  what  we're  talking  about  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  on  the  merits? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  Well,  as  I  ­­ as  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

understood,  Justice  Breyer's  question  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences  of  our  argument,  and  our  three  arguments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lead  to  the  same  consequences.  But,  yes,  Your  Honor,  we

apply"  language,  which  we  think  is  the  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straightforward  way  of  resolving  this  case,  and  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  of  the  judgment  bar  itself,  we  have  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguments  under  the  judgment  bar. 

 

 

 

 

            

One  is  that  the  judgment  bar  is  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

triggered  by  an  action  under  Section  1346(b).  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  the  "shall  not  apply"  language  says  1346(b)  shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  apply  to  the  excepted  claims.  Therefore,  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  judgment  ­­ a  2680  dismissal  is  not  a  judgment 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

under  the  FTCA. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  of  the  government's 

  

 

 

 

 

argument  that  once  you  get  wind  that  a  2680  exception  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  get  the  government  off  the  hook,  before  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  is  entered,  which  might  raise  the  judgment  bar, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  voluntarily  ­­ voluntarily  dismiss  your  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  government  so  you  won't  face  a  judgment? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  can  amend  your  complaint,  if  ­­ if  you  sued  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  originally,  to  drop  the  government,  or  you  can  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  voluntary  dismissal. 

 

 

            

What  ­­ how  do  you  answer  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  I  think  once  you've  ­­ once 

    

 

 

 

 

 

they've  answered  the  complaint,  Your  Honor,  I  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  plaintiff  can  just  dismiss  or  amend  the

complaint  without  seeking  leave  from  the  Court,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  result  in  a  judgment  of  dismissal.  Even  a  judgment 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  voluntary  dismissal,  as  I  understand  their  view,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"judgment"  means  any  judgment  would  trigger  the  judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bar,  under  that  reading. 

 

 

 

            

So  to  return  to  Justice  Kennedy's  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  judgment  in  particular,  we  think  it  incorporates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  of  res  judicata.  And  the  Court  has  looked  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  of  res  judicata  to  inform  the  word  "judgment" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  other  contexts. 

 

 

            

In  the  relitigation  exception  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Anti­Injunction  Act,  the  Federal  courts  are  empowered  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enjoin  State  court  proceedings  to  protect  or  effectuate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgments  of  the  Federal  courts,  and  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewed  that  as  ­­ viewed  judgment  errors  incorporating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  of  res  judicata,  and  only  judgments  with  res 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicata  effect  can  be  enjoined  under  that  relitigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision.  I  think  that's  a  great  analogy  to  this  case. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Could  I  take  you  back  to  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

"shall  not  apply"  language  for  a  second?  When  ­­ when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  were  speaking  to  the  Chief  Justice,  you  said,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definitional  section  will  continue  to  apply  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitions  apply  to  terms  and  not  to  claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  then  Mr.  Martinez  said  something  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar  to  that.  He  said  the  judgment  bar  applies  to

judgments,  not  claims.  So  if  you're  right  as  to  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  isn't  he  right  as  well?  And  the  consequence  of  his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  right  was  ­­ is  that  he  would  have  taken  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  bar  out  of  that  sweeping  "shall  not  apply" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  as  well. 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  The  judgment  bar  actually 

  

 

 

 

 

uses  the  language  of  claims.  It  says,  "The  judgment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall  constitute  a  complete  bar  to  any  action  by  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claimant  by  reason  of  the  same  subject  matter  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employee  whose  act  or  omission  gave  rise  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim." 

            

So  the  judgment  bar  is  talking  about  barring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  claim.  A  claim  ­­ a  claim  under  the  FTCA  can  be 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  vicariously  against  the  government  as  employer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  agreed  to  subject  itself  to  respondeat  superior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability  on  the  claim.  Where  these  claims  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted,  you  know,  the  ­­ you  know,  ordinarily  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  bar  would  then  say  if  you  have  a  judgment,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  can't  be  brought  against  the  employee. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

2680  says  it  shall  not  apply  to  these  sorts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  claims.  So  when  you  have  an  intentional  tort  claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  which  the  government  has  not  accepted  respondeat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

superior  liability,  the  bar  on  bringing  that  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  employee  does  not  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it's  ­­ it's  not  the  context  of  where  you

need  to  read  a  definition  in  order  to  sensibly  apply  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  of  the  provision.  It's  ­­ it's  actually  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operative  provision  that  operates  on  a  claim.  And  it's, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  context,  purporting  to  operate  on  a  claim  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  excluded  by  the  "shall  not  apply"  language. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  To  go  back  to  the  point  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  making  before,  under  your  interpretation,  does  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  bar  add  anything  to  principles  of  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclusion? 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  We  think  so,  Your  Honor.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  ­­ understanding  the  principles  of  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preclusion  that  were  in  existence  in  1946  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It  was  in  existence  in  1946, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  today  would  ­­ it  would  be  superfluous. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  Today  it  may  be  superfluous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  modern  principles  of  res  judicata,  where  we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed  nonmutality  and  defendants  are  able  to  assert 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  uses  of  res  judicata.  But  at  the  time  ­­ and  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  this  is  a  strong  contextual  clue  of  what  Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  trying  to  accomplish  with  this  provision  ­­ a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  against  an  employee  would  be  preclusive  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  claim  against  the  employer  on  the  same  subject  matter. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  because  of  reasons  of  potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indemnification  by  the  employee  owed  to  the  employer  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  employee  could  potentially  be  sued  twice  on  the

same  claim,  once  by  the  plaintiff  and  once  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  seeking  indemnification.  But  it  did  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

operate  the  other  way. 

 

 

 

              

A  judgment  in  ­­ in  1946,  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restatement  against  the  employer,  didn't  bar  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  from  then  suing  the  employee.  So  the  judgment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bar  fills  this  gap  and  explains  that  you  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directionality  of  the  statute,  explains  why  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted  a  bar  that  bars  suits  against  the  employee,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  enact  a  bar  the  other  way  that  bars  suits  against 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  it  is  obsolete  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  that  modern  res  judicata  law  would  take  care  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ it  wouldn't  matter  whether  you  sued  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  first  or  the  employee  case  first.  It  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  preclusive,  because  you've  adjudicated  the  grounds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability. 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  That's  right.  A  ­­ a  case 

    

   

  

 

 

that's  tried  on  the  merits  would  be  preclusive  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either,  under  my  understanding  of  modern  preclusion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles.  It  would  not  have  then. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  this  case,  this  type  of  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  a  claim  is  dismissed  on  a  jurisdictional  ground 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that  the  government  hasn't  accepted  respondeat  superior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability,  doesn't  involve  any  adjudication  of  the

substantive  merits  of  the  singular  tort  claim  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  ­­ you  know,  the  injury  the  plaintiffs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffered. 

            

He  tried  to  bring  the  case  against  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  but  it  fell  outside  of  the  bargain.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  at  the  threshold,  has  found  not  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepted  respondeat  superior  liability  on  this  claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  you  want  us  to  decide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  based  on  a  literal  reading  of  2680.  But  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Circuit  did  not  decide  the  case  on  that  ground, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we  don't  have  to  address  that,  do  we? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  why  should  we  not  decide  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Circuit  was  correct  in  its  reasoning  and  apply  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  literal  reading  approach  that  you  recommend  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  2680  to  the  judgment  bar,  and  hold  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  judgment  is  a  judgment,  and  not  necessarily  a  judgment 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  merits?  And  then  ­­ because  the  issue  under  2680 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  as  I  think  the  argument  has  shown,  is  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated. 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  Two  points,  Your  Honor: 

  

 

 

 

 

First,  I  don't  think  the  argument  was  waived.  This  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  separate  ground  for  relief.  It's  a  separate 

   

   

  

 

 

 

argument. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It's  a  separate  ­­ it's  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

it's  another  ground  for  affirmance,  correct?  It's  an

alternative  grounds  for  affirmance,  which  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion  to  decide  whether  we  want  to  reach  or  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  VERGONIS:  I  think  it's  an  alternative 

    

 

 

 

 

argument  for  the  same  ground  for  affirmance.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  presented  was  whether  a  2680  dismissal  triggers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  judgment  bar.  This  case  is  about  the  interaction  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  provisions,  and  it  would  be  very  artificial  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  to  ignore  the  text  of  one  of  those  provisions  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focus  solely  on  the  text  of  the  other  provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Substantively,  I  think  the  term  "judgment" 

   

 

 

 

is  an  ambiguous  term  whereas  the  term  "shall  not  apply" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  an  ambiguous  term.  "Judgment"  can  mean  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  in  different  contexts.  It  can  mean  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  within  the  different  provisions  of  the  Act.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  of  the  provisions  of  the  Act,  it  seems  to  me,  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ward  against  the  government.  They  talk  about  the  fee 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  percent  of  the  judgment.  They  talk  about  how  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  is  to  be  paid.  That's  2672. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  "judgment"  is  an  inherently  ambiguous 

 

 

 

 

 

word,  and  the  Court  would  need  to  grapple  with  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity  if  it  tries  to  resolve  the  case  that  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  again,  I  think  the  issue  was  raised  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  bio.  It's  logically  intertwined  with  the  question, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  I  think  the  Court  really,  in  order  to  answer  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  part  of  the  question  intelligently,  the  Court

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ROMAN  MARTINEZ 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  RAMIREZ:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  have  two  main  points  that  I'd  like  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make. 

            

First,  with  respect  to  the  Postal  Service, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  true  that  the  Postal  Reorganization  Act  says  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  FTCA  applies  to  torts  that  involve  the  Postal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service.  But  Respondent's  whole  argument  is  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

FTCA's  protections  of  sue­and­be­sued  agencies  doesn't

the  negligent  transmission  of  mail,  the  Postal  Service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  2679(a)'s 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protections. 

              

I  think  the  Court  might  want  to  look  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First  Circuit's  decision  in  the  Davric  case,  where  it

addressed  this  issue.  It  rejected  Respondent's 

  

 

 

 

 

"shall  not  apply"  argument,  and  it  said  that  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lead  to  results  that  Congress  could  not  have  conceivably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended,  and  we  agree  with  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

The  second  point  I'd  like  to  make  is  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  ­­ the  purpose  of  the  FTCA.  We  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  very  clearly  wanted  to  give  victims  a  choice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  suing  the  government  and  suing  the  responsible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  directly,  but  it  didn't  want  to  force  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  to  litigate  over  the  same  facts  twice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  purpose  is  squarely  implicated.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

not  superfluous.  The  judgment  bar  is  not  superfluous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  modern  rules  because,  even  today,  if  the  ­­ if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  has  to  defend  indirectly  against  a  Bivens 

   

 

 

 

 

 

action  and  also  has  to  defend  against  an  FTCA  action, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  concerns  about  alleviating  the  burdens  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disruptions  appear  today  as  ­­ just  as  they  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  1946. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That's  the  government's 

  

 

 

 

choice.  They're  not  obliged  to  defend  the  Bivens 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

action. 

            

MR.  RAMIREZ:  That's  true.  But  I  think  when 

   

  

  

 

 

 

Congress  enacted  the  FTCA,  it  recognized,  as  a  practical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter,  that  the  government,  when  ­­ when  ­­ was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typically  stepping  into  conduct  the  defense  of  employees
