ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


            8                    

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


            9              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


           10    

may it please the Court:


           11              

The issue in this case is whether an action for


           12    

damages under Bivens should be applied to a private


           13    

corporation acting under color of Federal law. 


           14              

Like many cases, where you come out on a case


           15    

like this, I think in many ways depends on where you


           16    

begin, and the parties have put forward to this Court


           17    

fundamentally conflicting paradigms with respect to the


           18    

best way to analyze Bivens based on this Court's prior


           19    

decisions. 


           20              

The respondent and the court below essentially


           21    

concluded that Bivens is a ubiquitous remedy that ought,


           22    

generally, to be available in order to maximize recoveries


           23    

and to maximize, or at least optimize, deterrent values,


           24    

and that it is our burden essentially to try to ascertain


           25    

whether there might be some conflicting or some exception

            1    

to the Bivens doctrine that would get us out from under


            2    

liability in the -- in this particular case.  The --


            3              

QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, do you -- this -- this


            4    

involves only an action against the corporation not


            5    

against its employees.


            6              

MR. PHILLIPS:  That's correct, Justice O'Connor.


            7              

QUESTION:  Would -- if the action were brought


            8    

as a Bivens action against the employees, do you concede


            9    

that there would be a Bivens action against them? 


           10              

MR. PHILLIPS:  We have always assumed, from the


           11    

first day of this litigation, that a Bivens action would


           12    

lie against the individual employees.


           13              

QUESTION:  Well, there's a difference between


           14    

assuming it arguendo and conceding it. 


           15              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, for purposes of this


           16    

litigation and for purposes of my client, there's no


           17    

question we would concede that an action would have


           18    

legitimately been -- been raised against them.  To say in


           19    

a future case whether or not a private employee might


           20    

raise an argument as to whether Bivens should be extended


           21    

is a separate question. 


           22              

QUESTION:  Now, if that's -- if that's true and


           23    

that concession holds, if the employee is sued for a


           24    

wrongful act, under State law would it be permissible in


           25    

your view, just under standard principles of derivative

            1    

liability, to hold the corporation for that tort, for the


            2    

tort of its own employee?


            3              

MR. PHILLIPS:  You mean under a theory of


            4    

respondeat superior. 


            5              

QUESTION:  Yes. 


            6              

MR. PHILLIPS:  As a matter of State law, it's


            7    

going to depend on the State.  Most States I think do


            8    

recognize respondeat superior liability. 


            9              

QUESTION:  So, State courts -- State courts


           10    

could do that without interference with any Federal policy


           11    

or -- or without any superseding Federal law to the


           12    

contrary. 


           13              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, obviously, there's going to


           14    

be at least the potential argument raised with respect to


           15    

Boyle and whether or not the -- the decision to hold the


           16    

individual liable under those circumstances is preempted


           17    

under Boyle.  But I think the argument here is slightly


           18    

weaker than it was in Boyle, and it probably depends to a


           19    

certain extent on -- on the -- on whether or not the


           20    

Federal Government in fact is dictating what both the --


           21    

what the employer and the employee are doing with respect


           22    

to --


           23              

QUESTION:  Well, if that's true, the employer, I


           24    

assume, would routinely be named in the suit.  So, you're


           25    

not doing a whole lot by saying that the employer is

            1    

independently liable for its own -- for its own


            2    

participation in the -- or alleged participation in the


            3    

tort.


            4              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think you're doing an


            5    

extraordinary amount, Justice Kennedy.  And the


            6    

Government's brief, I think quite rightly, points out at


            7    

page 20 in footnote 10, that the availability of a


            8    

corporate defendant significantly changes the mix with


            9    

respect to any kind of litigation.  And actually, if you


           10    

look at the three cases that postdate this Court's


           11    

decision in FDIC v. Meyer, all of those are cases in which


           12    

the only defendant who was named happened to be the


           13    

corporation.  The individuals were not named under any of


           14    

those circumstances. 


           15              

QUESTION:  But Mr. -- Mr. Phillips, if the -- if


           16    

the proper way of looking at this is the principal agency


           17    

relationship, when you're dealing with the Federal


           18    

Government, the Federal Government is the principal, the


           19    

agent is the officer.  Here, when the Government


           20    

contracts, the principal agency relationship exists with


           21    

the corporation.  So, I don't see why it doesn't follow


           22    

that the agent -- the agent in this case is the


           23    

corporation -- why the agency liability doesn't carry


           24    

over.


           25              

MR. PHILLIPS:  The -- the premise of your

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005


            1    

question, Justice Ginsburg, I think is where the -- where


            2    

the mistake lies in the final outcome of the decision. 


            3    

This Court made quite clear in FDIC v. Meyer that it's not


            4    

a principal agency relationship because there's no


            5    

question that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation


            6    

was the agent of the United States Government for purposes


            7    

of what it did in that particular context.  The Court said


            8    

that's not the right analysis. 


            9              

The right analysis is to go back and look at the


           10    

Bivens action and make a judgment with respect to whether


           11    

or not the litigation, as it comes to this Court,


           12    

adequately serves the two primary purposes of Bivens; that


           13    

is, that there is relief available and that there is an


           14    

effective deterrent in place. 


           15              

If those -- if those are satisfied, then the


           16    

issue of whether you should extend Bivens to a new


           17    

category of defendants, this Court said, should be


           18    

answered in the negative, saying that there is no reason


           19    

to add additional defendants under those circumstances. 


           20              

QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, I wish somebody here


           21    

were arguing on behalf of the employee.  It's -- it's


           22    

certainly in your interest to say, well, of course,


           23    

there's liability on the part of the employee.  And it's


           24    

-- it's in the interest of -- of your opponent to -- to


           25    

say the same.  I'm not -- I can see us deciding this case

            1    

on, you know, well, after all, there's a suit against the


            2    

employee.  Shouldn't we face that in a -- in a case in


            3    

which somebody is -- is arguing that the employee is not


            4    

liable? 


            5              

MR. PHILLIPS:  No, Justice --


            6              

QUESTION:  And there are arguments to that


            7    

effect.  I mean, after all, the -- the employee you say is


            8    

an agent of the United States, but if -- if he's acting


            9    

under color of Federal law as an agent of the United


           10    

States, he's only an agent of the United States because


           11    

he's -- he's an agent of -- of your client.  So, he's sort


           12    

of an agent of an agent.  It would seem very strange to me


           13    

to hold -- to hold the employee and not to hold your


           14    

corporation.


           15              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the question ultimately


           16    

comes down to this, Your Honor, is that does it make any


           17    

more sense in this context to resolve this issue at this


           18    

point in time than it did to decide the FDIC v. Meyer case


           19    

at that point in time.  Because, again, we didn't have the


           20    

employee involved in the litigation as it came to this


           21    

Court.  He had fallen out in that litigation, just as the


           22    

employee had fallen out in this litigation.  And what the


           23    

Court said was, we should analyze and, indeed, have to


           24    

resolve the conflict as to whether a private corporate


           25    

defendant ought to be liable under these circumstances.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005


            1    

So, that issue needs to be resolved. 


            2              

And, what's more, if the Court puts off for


            3    

another day deciding the liability of the employee, it


            4    

doesn't affect whether my client ought to be held not


            5    

responsible in a Bivens action because either one of two


            6    

things will happen.  Either you will conclude that private


            7    

employees are, in fact, susceptible to an action under


            8    

Bivens, in which case the adequacy of the remedy and the


            9    

adequacy of the deterrent by having that direct lawsuit


           10    

means that there's no reason to extend Bivens to my


           11    

client.  Or you'll conclude that the distinction is


           12    

between public and private actors and that we have special


           13    

reasons giving us hesitation and caution into extending


           14    

the Bivens action, since it's an implied cause of action


           15    

and not a congressionally adopted one, into the sphere


           16    

where the private actors are acting under color of Federal


           17    

right.


           18              

QUESTION:  Strictly speaking, Mr. Phillips, for


           19    

you to say that you're making a concession that the


           20    

employee -- I mean, that's like a lawyer representing A


           21    

saying he concedes B would be liable. 


           22              

MR. PHILLIPS:  I was only --


           23              

QUESTION:  I mean, it's not much of a


           24    

concession.

Kennedy and Justice O'Connor's question.  They phrased it

in the form of a concession, to be sure. 


            3              

QUESTION:  I know they did. 


            4              

MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm not giving up much in that


            5    

regard. 


            6              

But as I say, the important element here, at


            7    

least in my judgment, about how all this plays out is that


            8    

if the Court decides that employees are amenable to suit,


            9    

there's no reason to sue the corporation.  If they decide


           10    

they are not amenable to suit, it's going to be because of


           11    

the public/private distinction.  And again, under that


           12    

theory, we're not amenable to suit.


           13              

QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips --


           14              

QUESTION:  Well, it could be on -- on the basis


           15    

that they're an agent of an agent, that we're not going to


           16    

track it that far down.  I mean, you -- it's your


           17    

corporation that has been hired directly by the


           18    

Government, not the individual employees of your


           19    

corporation.  I mean, that's certainly another basis on


           20    

which one could draw --


           21              

MR. PHILLIPS:  That would be an argument, but in


           22    

order to do that, Justice Scalia, you would then have to


           23    

abandon what was one of the principal legs of Bivens in


           24    

the first instance, which is that the litigation against


           25    

the private individual and the deterrent value of

            1    

litigation against the private individual is the most


            2    

significant way to achieve the overall objectives --


            3              

QUESTION:  Well, I don't know that we would have


            4    

to abandon that because the -- the concern, as I


            5    

understand it, that the action against the individual has


            6    

a more significant deterrent effect than the action


            7    

against the agency, was a concern that was expressed in


            8    

the context of dealing with a public agency. 


            9              

Here we're dealing, in the case of your client,


           10    

with a private corporation.  And I would suppose that the


           11    

deterrent effect of holding the private corporation liable


           12    

for the acts of its employee would be very significant.  I


           13    

assume that a private corporation like yours is going to


           14    

be very careful about employees who, in effect, saddle it


           15    

with significant liability.  So, on the deterrence theory,


           16    

it seems to me you -- you would lose the argument. 


           17              

MR. PHILLIPS:  I think the flaw in your analysis


           18    

of the deterrence theory, Justice Souter, is that you're


           19    

looking to figure out what is sort of the optimal answer


           20    

for deterrence.  And the way I read this Court's decision


           21    

in FDIC v. Meyer is that what we satisfy ourselves about


           22    

is, is there an effective deterrent and an effective


           23    

damages remedy in place and available to the individual


           24    

plaintiff in a particular instance.  And that -- it seems


           25    

to me that's the gap-filler role that Bivens calls on the

Court to -- to provide.


            2              

When you go beyond -- I'm sorry.


            3              

QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  You finish. 


            4              

MR. PHILLIPS:  But when you go beyond that, it


            5    

seems to me you then assume much more of a legislative


            6    

role.  Then you're trying to balance the relative optimal


            7    

deterrence values.  Then you have to take into account the


            8    

effect on the Federal fisc or the relationship between the


            9    

-- the Federal contractor and the Federal Government.  And


           10    

that's a series of questions, I submit to Your Honors, you


           11    

ought to leave to Congress. 


           12              

And that's exactly what the Court said in Meyer. 


           13    

It analyzed and said, questions of optimal deterrence,


           14    

questions of effect on the Federal treasury, those are


           15    

issues that we think are better dealt with by Congress as


           16    

long as we have an adequate --


           17              

QUESTION:  Yes, but if you carry -- if the carry


           18    

the logic of that argument far enough, then there would be


           19    

no liability at all because we know that if we hold, for


           20    

example, the individual liable, there is going to be a


           21    

tendency there to shift that liability either by insurance


           22    

or by respondeat superior and insurance, ultimately to the


           23    

cost of contracting.  And we know, even in the


           24    

governmental situation, if you hold the individual liable,


           25    

chances are there is going to be some kind of liability

            1    

mitigating mechanism, whether it be insurance or whatnot,


            2    

that ultimately is going to find its way into the wage


            3    

structure.  So, if -- if we start getting too fussy about


            4    

that, we better call the whole thing off and -- and


            5    

overrule Bivens.


            6              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well -- obviously, we don't ask


            7    

the Court to overrule Bivens.  At least, we make that


            8    

argument in the brief. 


            9              

But the -- I think the answer to that is there


           10    

are two components of Bivens.  One is, is there in place


           11    

the gap-filler adequate remedy?  Is there a damages remedy


           12    

and a deterrent effect from that damages remedy?  Is that


           13    

in place?  Then sometimes, even though that's in place,


           14    

there will be a serious question as to whether or not,


           15    

nevertheless, special circumstances suggest that there


           16    

ought to be caution.  And it's frankly the -- the


           17    

respondents burden to satisfy both elements of that. 


           18              

What I'm suggesting to you in this context is


           19    

you don't have to look at what the impact would be on the


           20    

Federal Government at the end of the day.  What you have


           21    

to look at is whether there is an adequate remedy in


           22    

place, and if you didn't have that, I think there would be


           23    

a serious --


           24              

QUESTION:  How is this adequate remedy?  The --


           25    

as far as deterrence is concerned, I thought Richardson

            1    

explains why the deterrence considerations with the


            2    

private company work perfectly, but they don't work at all


            3    

where the principal is the Federal agency.  And that's


            4    

what I think Justice Souter was pointing out.


            5              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.


            6              

QUESTION:  As far as alternative remedy is


            7    

concerned, which alternative remedy?  If you mean would


            8    

there be a remedy under State law, that of course exists


            9    

in Bivens too.  If you mean that you could sue the private


           10    

person under Bivens but not the company, if that's what


           11    

you mean, the individual but not the company --


           12              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Correct.


           13              

QUESTION:  -- well, the next case the


           14    

individual, if we say you can sue the company, would say


           15    

the same thing.  So, I mean, you see it's six of one, half


           16    

a dozen of the other.  The private person would say you


           17    

have an adequate -- do you see my point?


           18              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, you made two -- you made


           19    

two points, Justice Breyer. 


           20              

QUESTION:  The private person -- you -- you


           21    

could have -- if -- if you're going to allow corporations,


           22    

they say, oh, no, you have a private remedy against the


           23    

individual, which I'm sure you conceded for that reason. 


           24    

The individual would say, oh, no, you have a perfectly


           25    

adequate remedy against the corporation.

            8              

QUESTION:  Exactly.  That's right. 


            9              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Indeed, I may be making the


           10    

argument --


           11              

QUESTION:  So, why then, given that conundrum,


           12    

deterrence:  Richardson.  Adequate remedy:  the problem we


           13    

stated.  Conclusion:  make it a parallel to 1983.


           14              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, now you've made three


           15    

points, Justice Breyer.  And let me try to take them up in


           16    

-- in turn.


           17              

First of all, with -- with respect to


           18    

Richardson, I mean, that's an immunity case, and the Court


           19    

is in a world where it has to resolve optimization in the


           20    

immunity context.  That's a judge-made set of rules, and


           21    

this Court is obliged to resolve it in the best way that


           22    

it can under those circumstances.  It's a fundamentally


           23    

different question about whether you hold the defendant


           24    

liable in the first instance in a private -- privately


           25    

implied cause of action derived directly under the

            1    

Constitution. 


            2              

We could differ and disagree about what's the


            3    

right method of -- of achieving optimization, but I don't


            4    

think you can read Richardson as saying categorically that


            5    

you will -- you will lose all your deterrent effect.  To


            6    

say that is I think to both abandon what you said in


            7    

Bivens and clearly abandon what you said in Meyer.


            8              

With respect to the ability of the private


            9    

person to come in and argue the next time around, his


           10    

argument I think, frankly, is going to be a tough one


           11    

because what he's got to say is even though you have now


           12    

held the corporation not to be liable -- I'm assuming for


           13    

purposes of the moment that I win here -- that -- that we,


           14    

nevertheless, also ought not to be liable.  And, again, as


           15    

I said earlier, I think the distinction there is between


           16    

the -- having a remedy in place that is in any meaningful


           17    

way effect or not, and therefore it is a tougher argument


           18    

for the private employee under those circumstances to make


           19    

that particular argument. 


           20              

And then your last point with respect to section


           21    

1983 simply disregards what I perceive to be the


           22    

fundamental difference between having a congressional


           23    

enactment that comprehensively regulates a particular area


           24    

provide liability against any person and sets up a set of


           25    

rules in -- in order to effectuate that particular remedy

and the situation we face in Bivens where, heretofore, we


            2    

have never imposed -- this Court has never --


            3              

QUESTION:  And -- and --


            4              

MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry. 


            5              

QUESTION:  -- in 1983, too, in Monell we


            6    

rejected the idea there could be any sort of respondeat


            7    

superior liability.  You had to show that the -- there was


            8    

a policy maker involved and that sort of thing. 


            9              

MR. PHILLIPS:  That's absolutely correct, Mr.


           10    

Chief Justice.


           11              

QUESTION:  Is that not present here, Mr.


           12    

Phillips?  Because the policy of saying people who live


           13    

above -- below the fifth floor, that's a policy set by the


           14    

employer.  So, this is a case where it's not an assault by


           15    

a guard.  This is a case of policies set by the


           16    

corporation itself. 


           17              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there are two answers to


           18    

that, Justice Ginsburg. 


           19              

First of all, no policy gets set by a


           20    

corporation as such.  All -- all policies, just like all


           21    

actions of corporations, have to be undertaken by


           22    

individuals.  Somebody had to have adopted that policy. 


           23              

But second of all, I don't read the respondent's


           24    

complaint here to have alleged any policy of the


           25    

corporation was at fault here.  The -- the complaint

            1    

itself specifically says there was an exception made for


            2    

the respondent so that he could take the elevator.  A


            3    

specific employee who was named as a defendant --


            4              

QUESTION:  Not in -- not in the written policy. 


            5    

It wasn't written down and that's why this guard didn't


            6    

get it.  But anyway, at this stage, we have to construe


            7    

the complaint most favorably to the plaintiff.  Is that


            8    

not so? 


            9              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I -- you can construe it


           10    

most favorably to the plaintiff, but not necessarily to


           11    

embrace a complete different theory of the case that is


           12    

far from clear. 


           13              

And this is -- and remember, this was written by


           14    

counsel.  This is not a pro se complaint we're talking


           15    

about.  This was counsel's complaint.  I think if they had


           16    

meant for this to be a policy or practice case, they would


           17    

have said so. 


           18              

But I think the more fundamental point here is


           19    

-- is that -- is that there has to be a policy maker.  If


           20    

that policy was unconstitutional, then it's still


           21

unconstitutional policy and to sue the employee for having

If there are no further questions, I'd reserve


            3

QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Phillips. 


            5              

Mr. Lamken, we'll hear from you.


            6                

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN


            7         

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


            8                     

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


            9              

MR. LAMKEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


           10    

please the Court:


           11              

When an inmate in a federally operated facility


           12    

is subjected to a constitutional deprivation, that inmate


           13    

has a remedy against the individual Federal officers who


           14    

committed the constitutional deprivation.  There is no


           15    

indication that that Federal remedy is inadequate for --


           16              

QUESTION:  Are you making that as arguendo, or


           17    

are you conceding that?  Now, your brief seems to make a


           18    

concession to that effect. 


           19              

MR. LAMKEN:  In the first instance, we think it


           20    

should be assumed arguendo because if there's a reason not


           21    

to subject the individuals, the private individuals, to


           22    

liability under Bivens, it would be that private


           23    

individuals have so few immunities and so few defenses,


           24    

compared to their governmental counterparts, that there's


           25    

no reason to infer a Federal cause of action.  If it's

true with respect to them, then it's a fortiori true with


            2    

respect to the corporation as well.


            3              

QUESTION:  Why couldn't you say the same about


            4    

joint tortfeasors?


            5              

MR. LAMKEN:  Pardon?  Oh.


            6              

QUESTION:  Why couldn't you make the same kind


            7    

of argument about joint tortfeasors?  You'd say there's no


            8    

reason to hold two.  We have one.


            9              

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, in fact, with respect to


           10    

joint tortfeasors, you have two separate actions.  They're


           11    

both liable for their --


           12              

QUESTION:  Why wouldn't the second -- you'd say


           13    

we'd only give you one, whoever you sue first, because


           14    

it's adequate.


           15              

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, you need to deter both of the


           16    

joint -- the actions by the joint tortfeasors.


           17              

QUESTION:  And here we have to deter the


           18    

policies of the corporation.


           19              

MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, but the corporation is an


           20    

unusual tortfeasor in this sense, in that it cannot act


           21    

except through other individuals, through its employees. 


           22    

So long as you deter --


           23              

QUESTION:  But that's true across the whole law


           24    

of torts.  I mean, I've been lumbering along for half a


           25    

century under respondeat superior.  I thought this -- this

            1    

was a deterrent to the employer if the employer is liable


            2    

for the employee's wrong.  Why is it suddenly different? 


            3              

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, if this were a common law


            4    

court or a legislature, I could certainly see adopting the


            5    

common law rule.  But the Court -- this is not a common


            6    

law court, and what -- Congress has the principal role of


            7    

establishing causes of actions, Federal cause of action,


            8    

for damages.  So, the role of the Court is not to


            9    

establish --


           10              

QUESTION:  It just rings -- it just doesn't ring


           11    

true to me that there's no deterrence by holding the


           12    

corporation liable.  I -- I thought the whole law of torts


           13    

was based on a contrary assumption. 


           14              

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, in fact, Your Honor, if you


           15    

look at, for example, the fifth edition of Prosser &


           16    

Keeton on Torts, William Prosser tells us that that


           17    

argument is makeweight, and that the real reason for


           18    

holding the corporation liable under respondeat superior


           19    

is to ensure that the costs of accidents are incorporated


           20    

into the price of products and, therefore, spread to


           21    

society at large. 


           22              

In a context like this one, where you have one


           23    

purchaser, the Government, and the cause of action is


           24    

unique to where the Government is the purchaser of the


           25    

service, that type of rationale can't hold water.  This

Court is generally very cautious about imposing liability


            2    

for the purpose of distributing money --


            3              

QUESTION:  Except that one purchaser gets its


            4    

money from everybody.  I -- I think nobody can spread --


            5    

can spread the cost as well as the Government. 


            6              

(Laughter.) 


            7              

MR. LAMKEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  But it is


            8    

typically -- this Court is typically most cautious about


            9    

establishing rules that would have the effect of taking


           10    

money from the treasury, which is under Congress' control


           11    

and to be spent for the public good and spending it


           12    

according to --


           13              

QUESTION:  That's -- that's a different argument


           14    

which -- which you make, that we shouldn't --


           15              

QUESTION:  May I ask you --


           16              

MR. LAMKEN:  That -- that --


           17              

QUESTION:  It would be, in effect, the same as


           18    

holding the Government liable. 


           19              

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, in this case, where you have


           20    

a uniquely governmental purchaser and a uniquely


           21    

governmental cause of action, it does tend to have that


           22    

effect, Your Honor. 


           23              

QUESTION:  May I ask you a hypothetical that Mr.


           24    

Phillips' last argument suggested to me?  Supposing you


           25    

have a case in which an executive sets the policy that

            1    

everybody has to climb the -- the six flights of stairs


            2    

every day.  Then the executive quits.  Five years later,


            3    

an employee is compelled to climb the steps because that


            4    

policy is in place.  Whom can he sue?


            5              

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, Your Honor, when -- when


            6    

prisoners in public institutions, federally operated


            7    

institutions, encounter precisely that situation --


            8              

QUESTION:  No.  I'm assuming, of course, there's


            9    

a corporation involved here. 


           10              

MR. LAMKEN:  But it shows that this -- that type


           11    

of situation is hardly unique to a private corporation. 


           12    

It -- it occurs all the time in Federal institutions.  And


           13    

he would be able to sue first any employee who enforced


           14    

the -- the policy. 


           15              

QUESTION:  All the employee is doing is carrying


           16    

out his instructions. 


           17              

MR. LAMKEN:  Right, but there is under Bivens no


           18    

Nuremberg defense.  Each -- one of the teachings of Bivens


           19    

is that the responsibility for respecting constitutional


           20    

rights is personal and individual, and therefore,


           21    

liability for violating constitutional rights is also


           22    

personal and individual.  It ill-serves that notion of


           23    

personal responsibility to shift the liability from the --


           24    

from individual -- individuals who violate constitutional


           25    

rights to some other source of money such as the

shareholders or the Government. 


            2              

QUESTION:  Supposing the policy also said any


            3    

employee who fails to carry out this policy gets fired


            4    

forthwith.


            5              

MR. LAMKEN:  That would be the same thing if a


            6    

-- if an individual Bureau of Prisons employee --


            7              

QUESTION:  -- the individual liable for --


            8              

MR. LAMKEN:  Individually liable.  Plus you also


            9    

get to sue the policy maker and anybody who exhibited


           10    

deliberate indifference in carrying on that policy.  It's


           11    

precisely the same rule that exists in the Federal context


           12    

when you have a -- a Bureau of Prisons-run facility.


           13              

QUESTION:  Why does it make a large difference


           14    

whether you sue the CEO or the corporation itself? 


           15    

Practically in terms of your interest as the Government


           16    

money, if the corporation is going to pick up the tab, why


           17    

does the Government care?


           18              

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think the


           19    

rub is in the question, if the corporation is going to


           20    

pick up the tab.  The corporation will not necessarily


           21    

pick up the tab.  The Government, for example, does not


           22    

routinely indemnify its employees before a judgment or


           23    

even necessarily after judgment.  On occasion, we both


           24    

decline to indemnify them.  Sometimes we decline to


           25    

represent them.  Sometimes we criminally prosecute them

ourselves.  The point of the matter is to avoid moral


            2    

hazard, to ensure that there is that deterrent effect,


            3    

both corporations and the Government alike are wise not to


            4    

indemnify their employees in advance and refer only to


            5    

indemnify in those circumstances where it's both in the


            6    

corporate interest and in the interest of ensuring that


            7    

the corporation or the individuals --


            8              

QUESTION:  You also may get larger judgments


            9    

against the corporation than -- than against Jack


           10    

Armstrong personally.  No?


           11              

MR. LAMKEN:  That is one of the difficulties and


           12    

that is one of the reasons why there is concern that


           13    

individuals, if given the opportunity, will choose to sue


           14    

only the corporation and not the individuals.  And as Mr.


           15    

Phillips pointed out, in the three post-Meyer cases where


           16    

this issue has come up, in each of them, the individual


           17    

chose to sue only the corporation and not the individual. 


           18    

And, therefore, the direct deterrent effect on the


           19    

individual, the direct deterrent effect that exists and


           20    

operates within the Federal Government, would be absent in


           21    

the other context if the Court were to recognize a Bivens


           22    

against corporations as well as the individuals who


           23    

violate --

Bivens liability on the corporation, I assume Congress


            2    

can't do anything about that absent some supplemental


            3    

scheme that's equally effective? 


            4              

MR. LAMKEN:  Your Honor, it's not clear the


            5    

degree to which Congress can replace Bivens liability.  I


            6    

would believe that Congress would have the ability to


            7    

either -- if this Court were to decide not to have


            8    

corporate liability, Congress could act to establish that


            9    

liability, or if the Court were to say that there is --


           10              

QUESTION:  The other way around. 


           11              

MR. LAMKEN:  The other way around is a more


           12    

difficult question.  I don't believe this Court's cases


           13    

are clear.  However, if Congress does establish an


           14    

alternative remedy, I believe the Court would be very


           15    

likely to respect it unless it is clearly inadequate for


           16    

the purposes. 


           17              

QUESTION:  I don't understand that.  If Congress


           18    

established an alternative remedy, we might say that the


           19    

Constitution no longer requires the Bivens -- the Bivens


           20    

remedy. 


           21              

MR. LAMKEN:  No, Your Honor.  As I read


           22    

Bivens --


           23              

QUESTION:  But if Congress just -- just decides


           24    

that we're wrong in saying that there's a Bivens remedy


           25    

here, what could -- what could Congress possibly do about

it?  I mean, if -- if there is a Bivens remedy here, it's


            2    

one that's demanded by the Constitution.  Right? 


            3              

MR. LAMKEN:  Well, Your Honor, it depends on how


            4    

you read Bivens.  Bivens itself doesn't purport to be


            5    

compelled by the Constitution, that the Constitution


            6    

requires it.  It very much relied on cases like J.I. v.


            7    

Borak where the Court felt that it was in a position to


            8    

sort of assist in the vindication of constitutional


            9    

rights, even if it were not mandated or compelled by the


           10    

Constitution. 


           11              

Where the Court -- where the Court uses its


           12    

discretion to do that, however, the Court must be


           13    

particularly cautious about it so that it does not usurp


           14    

the role of Congress as the principal creator of -- of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN PASTERNAK


           20                    

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


           21              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


           22    

please the Court:


           23              

The question before the Court today is whether


           24    

the Bivens cause of action is applicable to a for-profit


           25    

corporation carrying out a core function of the Federal

Government.  There's no dispute that in operating the Le


            2    

Marquis Prison, CSC was performing a core governmental


            3    

function. 


            4              

There's an important distinction, both as a


            5    

matter of history, constitutional law, and common sense,


            6    

between Government and private corporations, between the


            7    

Government way of doing things or the Government model and


            8    

the private market model.  The Solicitor General so


            9    

recognized 4 years ago in the oral argument in Richardson


           10    

v. McKnight.  And the distinction exists due to the


           11    

differences in accountability, its mission, and the degree


           12    

of control that exists over the employees.


           13              

As far as accountability, the Bureau of Prisons,


           14    

as a Federal Government agent, is accountable to Congress


           15    

and to the public, as opposed to a private for-profit


           16    

corporation, like CSC, which is responsible to its


           17    

shareholders.  It has no one appointed onto its board from


           18    

either Congress or the President. 


           19              

QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Pasternak, if Bivens


           20    

remedies are available against the employees of the


           21    

corporation, why isn't that enough?


           22              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Because of the mentality that


           23    

exists as far as the corporation, Your Honor.  It's the


           24    

corporation that has a direct relationship with the


           25    

Federal Government.  It's the one that has the contract.

            1              

QUESTION:  Yes, but the corporation can only act


            2    

through its employees, and if those employees are subject


            3    

to Bivens liability, if they are, why isn't that enough to


            4    

deter any unconstitutional conduct?


            5              

MR. PASTERNAK:  It wouldn't be sufficient


            6    

because the employees are at-will employees.  Their job is


            7    

on the line.  Their promotions are on the line.  They're


            8    

following the directions as far as the corporation in


            9    

order to get ahead.  While the --


           10              

QUESTION:  How can you generalize that the


           11    

employees are at-will employees?  I mean, that would vary


           12    

perhaps from case to case. 


           13              

MR. PASTERNAK:  In the State of New York,


           14    

they're at-will employees.


           15              

QUESTION:  But we're deciding a case not just on


           16    

the basis of the State of New York, but maybe in some


           17    

other States, they have a 3-year contract. 


           18              

MR. PASTERNAK:  It may vary from State to State. 


           19    

It may vary from individual to individual, but the focus


           20    

still has to be that it's the corporation that has the


           21    

control, and to determine whether or not there's a breach


           22    

as far as the employee's contract or whatever, it's the


           23    

one that's setting the policies that the individuals have


           24    

been following. 


           25              

QUESTION:  Mr. Pasternak, do you think running a

municipally owned utility is a core governmental function?


            2              

MR. PASTERNAK:  It's possible that it may be. 


            3              

QUESTION:  May be. 


            4              

What about running a national park or a public


            5    

park?  Is that a core governmental function? 


            6              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Getting further removed.  I


            7    

think it might be, but again, it's not a prison situation.


            8              

QUESTION:  We're going to develop a whole new


            9    

area of constitutional or quasi-constitutional law


           10    

deciding case by case what is a core governmental function


           11    

and what isn't a core government -- you assert that only


           12    

-- only those corporations that are performing core


           13    

governmental functions would -- would be subject to Bivens


           14    

liability, not all corporations who are under contract


           15    

with the Government. 


           16              

MR. PASTERNAK:  If I may respond.  As far as the


           17    

1983 analysis or under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the


           18    

same type of analysis has to be done to determine whether


           19    

or not you have a Government actor and then whether or not


           20    

there was a violation that takes place. 


           21              

In our fact pattern here, there's no real


           22    

question that in operating the prison, it is a core


           23    

governmental function.  They are authorized to act because


           24    

the -- the Government has contracted with the corporation


           25    

and has embodied it with the power, in order to act and to

run that facility. 


            2              

QUESTION:  Have -- is there a whole line of


            3    

cases under section 1983 dealing with this subject of what


            4    

is a core governmental function? 


            5              

MR. PASTERNAK:  There's not a whole line of


            6    

cases, but there is -- there are cases, Your Honor, that


            7    

have to be addressed as far as either a Federal Tort


            8    

Claims Act case or a section 1983 as to the issue of


            9    

whether or not Amtrak, for instance -- whether it would be


           10    

acting as a Government agent or not. 


           11              

QUESTION:  Does it have to do with whether it's


           12    

performing a core governmental function or not?  It has to


           13    

do with whether it's a Federal agency or not.  That's


           14    

quite a different question from whether it's performing a


           15    

core governmental function.  I'm talking about a


           16    

concededly private corporation, and -- and you want us to


           17    

decide case by case when -- when you hire a private


           18    

corporation to manage concessions at a -- at a national


           19    

park, whether that is a core governmental function or not.


           20              

MR. PASTERNAK:  I think anytime you're dealing


           21    

with a corporation as opposed to a Government agency,


           22    

there are different things that come into play as far as


           23    

what their motives are. 


           24              

QUESTION:  I thought you just wanted us to


           25

State, by the Federal Government, or can be contracted out


            2    

by either.


            3              

MR. PASTERNAK:  That is what our fact pattern


            4    

is.


            5              

QUESTION:  And this is a substitute for a


            6    

Federal prison just as sometimes Federal prisoners are


            7    

housed in State prisons. 


            8              

MR. PASTERNAK:  That's correct.


            9              

QUESTION:  And would there be liability in that


           10    

situation?  Suppose this halfway house had been run by the


           11    

State of New York. 


           12              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Then there would be liability


           13    

for the violation of the Federal Constitution, and there


           14    

would be no difference.  In fact, this particular facility


           15    

housed both State and Federal prisoners --


           16              

QUESTION:  And as to the -- so, if -- if Mr.


           17    

Malesko had been a State prisoner?


           18              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Then he would have his claim. 


           19    

We would literally have to be checking the dog tags of the


           20    

individual housed at this particular facility under the


           21    

same fact pattern to determine, under the CSC's argument,


           22    

whether or not there would be liability.  And we submit


           23    

that that's the wrong analysis to make, that a Federal


           24    

prisoner should certainly have equal, the same rights as a


           25    

State prisoner.

            1              

QUESTION:  May I clarify a point that I raised


            2    

to Mr. Phillips?  Is your complaint one of a pattern or


            3    

practice attributable to the corporation as distinguished


            4    

from the action of the individual guard?  He said that you


            5    

did not plead any kind of policy on behalf of the


            6    

corporation.


            7              

MR. PASTERNAK:  There are different elements as


            8    

far as what was pleading in the complaint.  There was


            9    

initially a pro se complaint that was filed.  The only


           10    

substitution that really took place at the time of the


           11    

pleading was to name the individual guard.  That was ruled


           12    

to be untimely by the court because Mr. Malesko should


           13    

have known -- arguably should have known or should have


           14    

been trying to find out who that individual was. 


           15              

The problem that exists, obviously, is trying to


           16    

identify who the individuals are that set the corporate


           17    

policy. 


           18              

As far as the specific policy, there was the


           19    

policy of putting Mr. Malesko up on the firth floor, as


           20    

opposed to a lower floor. 


           21              

QUESTION:  Was that pleaded as a policy? 


           22              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Not pleaded directly as a


           23    

policy, no. 


           24              

QUESTION:  You say not pleaded directly as a


           25    

policy.  What do you mean by that?

MR. PASTERNAK:  Well, again, we're going back to


            2    

the language of the pro se complaint.


            3              

QUESTION:  Yes.  And that's what I was asking


            4    

you about.  What did the pro se complaint say about it?


            5              

MR. PASTERNAK:  He did not allege it as a policy


            6    

per se.  He alleged it that it was improper as far as the


            7    

housing.  We have the situation where you have him


            8    

housed --


            9              

QUESTION:  In fact, he did allege that he was


           10    

permitted to use the elevator usually, didn't he?


           11              

MR. PASTERNAK:  He did. 


           12              

QUESTION:  Yes.  So, he couldn't have been


           13    

complaining about the policy then. 


           14              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Well, there's still a complaint


           15    

that would exist -- I mean, there is a possible claim as


           16    

far as the ADA and just the general logic of housing


           17    

somebody with a known heart condition on the fifth floor


           18    

where he would be susceptible to being ill in the event of


           19    

a fire.  I mean, it doesn't make any sense, as they


           20    

acknowledged in discovery, in order to have someone housed


           21    

on that higher floor if there's a danger that exists.  It


           22    

just doesn't make any sense. 


           23              

QUESTION:  I thought his heart attack made it


           24    

hard to climb stairs, but going down stairs might be


           25    

different.

            2              

QUESTION:  I would like to hear directly your --


            3    

your response.  The Chief Justice had a point I hadn't


            4    

thought of, which is true, that in Monell, there isn't


            5    

direct respondeat superior liability in a case involving


            6    

an entity that does not have sovereign immunity, namely


            7    

the municipality. 


            8              

All right.  How -- how does that play out here?


            9              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Here --


           10              

QUESTION:  What is that -- should there be


           11    

respondeat superior?  Is it necessary to parallel the


           12    

Monell?  What's your opinion? 


           13              

MR. PASTERNAK:  I would argue that under either


           14    

situation, we would satisfy the requirement.  Under the


           15    

respondeat superior, we would certainly satisfy it.  Under


           16    

the Monell standard, it's the failure to adequately train


           17    

and supervise the guards.


           18              

QUESTION:  All right.  So, you can go either


           19    

way.  But what in your opinion is the correct rule of law?


           20              

MR. PASTERNAK:  If we're looking for parallelism


           21    

between the two, then it would make sense to have the


           22    

Monell standard, but it not necessarily has to follow


           23    

because under common law, we would have the respondeat


           24    

superior.  I would argue for the respondeat superior and


           25    

to have it as a normal liability as you do in normal

QUESTION:  Well, we rejected parallelism in


            3    

Richardson.  Parallelism -- symmetry is very difficult to


            4    

achieve in this area as of this point, no matter what we

do.


            6              

MR. PASTERNAK:  It was rejected and symmetry is


            7    

difficult to achieve.  However, we are seeking symmetry in


            8    

the sense that a private corporation should be held


            9    

accountable the same way it is acting under a contract


           10    

with the Government and the same way a State prisoner


           11    

would have the same remedy against the corporation --


           12              

QUESTION:  Well, you're arguing the so-called


           13    

parallelism with section 1983 actions.  But it's been


           14    

pointed out that was a congressional enactment, and there


           15    

is no parallel enactment for Bivens type claims.  That was


           16    

a Court-created doctrine and it's been rather limited.


           17              

MR. PASTERNAK:  It has been limited.  It is


           18    

Court-created, in order to address deterrence, but it has


           19    

been applied to the situation of a nongovernmental -­

           20    

nongovernment or to a nongovernment agency. 


           21              

In this situation, the question that arises is


           22    

where does a private for-profit corporation fall on the


           23    

spectrum.  Is it more akin to a Government agency which


           24    

has to be responsible to Congress, to the President, and


           25    

to the public, or is it more akin to a regular Federal

            1    

employee?  We would submit that it's closer to a Federal


            2    

employee, only it has certain negatives worse than a


            3    

Federal employee in the sense that it has a duty, a


            4    

fiduciary duty, to try and maximize profits, a factor that


            5    

would not normally enter into the situation of a Federal


            6    

employee who's just going along and doing his job and


            7    

fulfilling his requirements.  But here you have a specific


            8    

fiduciary duty to maximize the profits. 


            9              

They also -- the person who were in control. 


           10    

There, the corporation is the one that controls its


           11    

employees and sends the directives as far as hiring,


           12    

firing, promotions, benefits.  It is the one that has the


           13    

control and can send the signals on to each individual


           14    

employee. So, as far as where it falls in the scheme, we


           15    

would submit it is more akin to a Federal employee, only


           16    

there are greater dangers which would warrant the


           17    

imposition of the Bivens liability in order to have the


           18    

proper deterrence.


           19              

QUESTION:  Why shouldn't we leave this to the


           20    

Federal Government, to the Congress, to determine, rather


           21    

than doing it ourselves? 


           22              

MR. PASTERNAK:  For the same --


           23              

QUESTION:  I mean, we can say this is a totally


           24    

different situation from what Bivens, whether it was right


           25    

or wrong, decided.  That decided a case where you have a

            1    

Federal officer acting.  These are not technically Federal


            2    

officers.  If there is going to be a cause of action,


            3    

Congress can create it.  If Congress hasn't created it,


            4    

there's no cause of action, which is the usual situation


            5    

in the world, isn't it?


            6              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Oftentimes.  However, the issue


            7    

here is the Federal employee under Bivens is acting


            8    

because the Government has delegated that responsibility


            9    

to him to act.  In a sense it's a contract.  He's been


           10    

hired to act.  So too, you have the corporation who has


           11    

been hired by the Federal Government pursuant to the


           12    

contract in order to act and to satisfy what the


           13    

requirements are. 


           14              

QUESTION:  It may be logical to extend it.  It


           15    

may well be.  And if it's logical, presumably Congress


           16    

will do it. 


           17              

QUESTION:  And also, there -- there is


           18    

undoubtedly a State law cause of action in negligence that


           19    

would lie against both the employee and the employer under


           20    

respondeat superior.


           21              

MR. PASTERNAK:  There would be a common law


           22    

cause of action.  However, that would not necessarily


           23    

address the separate constitutional violation that


           24    

occurred that needs its own deterrence.


           25              

QUESTION:  Would there have been a State cause

of action against Federal agents acting under -- under


            2    

Federal law? 


            3              

MR. PASTERNAK:  You would have the issue as far


            4    

as normally you would have the immunity that would be


            5    

granted under the State law, and you would have the


            6    

problems in that direction.  But we do not have --


            7              

QUESTION:  Which means that there's a special


            8    

reason for the court to invent a cause of action that does


            9    

not appear anywhere in the Constitution or in a statute


           10    

for Federal agents who perhaps can't be sued under State


           11    

law.  But when you're not talking about Federal agents --


           12    

you're talking about private employees -- normal tort law


           13    

undoubtedly applies.  And why -- why can't we leave it


           14    

there?  And -- and if Congress wants to extend an


           15    

additional cause of action, let -- let Congress do it.


           16              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Since we are dealing with a


           17    

violation of the Federal Constitution, we would submit


           18    

that there should be one uniform body of decisions coming


           19    

out as far as what that Federal law should be and how it


           20    

should be interpreted, that we should not be subjected to


           21    

the vagaries of the differences in the various States as


           22    

to their rules as far as procedure, discovery, but there


           23    

should be one -- one body of law encompassing, from the


           24    

Federal side, a violation of a Federal constitutional


           25    

right.  It's not sufficient to just leave it to the

States.


            2              

QUESTION:  Well, is it clear that the employee


            3    

would be liable under State law in light of Boyle v.


            4    

United Technologies? 


            5              

MR. PASTERNAK:  In McKnight, the argument --


            6    

rejected the argument of Boyle, as far as a corporation


            7    

being -- not being liable and a danger as far as the


            8    

public fisc.  In this type of a situation, we would submit


            9    

that it would be appropriate to find the corporation


           10    

liable and that the dangers to the public fisc are


           11    

minimal, certainly more minimal than you would have in the


           12    

normal Bivens case, we would submit.


           13              

QUESTION:  Well, of course, McKnight rejected


           14    

parallelism, and -- and you -- you want it.  McKnight is


           15    

not your best precedent. 


           16              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Not entirely, but we are seeking


           17    

to have the parallelism also as far as a -- rights of a


           18    

Federal prisoner and a State prisoner, to both be able to


           19    

go and sue the corporation that is --


           20              

QUESTION:  But you have an anomaly either way


           21    

because why shouldn't the symmetry be between someone who


           22    

is a Federal prisoner in the Federal prison and someone


           23    

who's a Federal prisoner in a private prison?  You


           24    

recognize that there would be no action against the Bureau


           25    

of Prisons if the Bureau of Prisons had been the jailer.

So, why should it be -- why shouldn't that be the


            2    

symmetry?


            3              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Because the Correctional


            4    

Services Corporation is not the Government.  It operates


            5    

under a different set of rules and regulations.


            6              

QUESTION:  But you want it to be like the State


            7    

government, because if it were a State -- if a State were


            8    

running this prison, then there would be liability.


            9              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Yes, but what I'm looking for is


           10    

it for not -- for it to be recognized by this Court that


           11    

the private corporation, just like the State, is not the


           12    

Federal Government.  There is no Federal Government


           13    

immunity that applies.  That's the reason we can sue the


           14    

States if there's a violation.  So too, we should


           15    

certainly be able to sue a private corporation, a private


           16    

corporation which is operating under a different set of


           17    

rules and regulations than is the norm for the Federal


           18    

Government and for a Federal agency.


           19              

QUESTION:  With respect to the adequacy of a


           20    

remedy in the State court, is it not so that the liability


           21    

would be greater as to a private employee because the


           22    

private employee would not have a defense of qualified


           23    

immunity that would be available to a Federal officer?


           24              

MR. PASTERNAK:  There would be less defenses


           25    

raised as far as a private individual.  That's correct.

            1              

QUESTION:  And that would tend to make the State


            2    

law remedy more adequate?


            3              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Possibly more adequate but still


            4    

inadequate in order to address a Federal constitutional


            5    

violation.


            6              

QUESTION:  Well, you're saying that -- I think


            7    

you're saying the State law remedy simply doesn't address


            8    

the constitutional violation.  The State law remedy may be


            9    

a State tort remedy, but it's not an Eighth Amendment


           10    

remedy.  Is that you're --


           11              

MR. PASTERNAK:  That is correct.


           12              

QUESTION:  You know, there's one puzzling thing


           13    

about this case.  You don't really cite the Eighth


           14    

Amendment in your complaint, as I read it, do you?  That


           15    

is, it isn't an Eighth Amendment claim where you're


           16    

claiming deliberate indifference on behalf of the prison


           17    

officials?  Is that the nature?


           18              

MR. PASTERNAK:  It does -- it is an Eighth


           19    

Amendment, but it is not cited.


           20              

QUESTION:  And then, therefore, your burden in


           21    

the Federal claim under the Eighth Amendment is heavier


           22    

than an ordinary negligence case, isn't it?  So, by going


           23    

into Federal court, you -- you've assumed a higher burden


           24    

than if you brought a negligence case.  Am I correct in


           25    

that?

            1              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Well, both theories would be


            2    

applicable as far as being -- bringing the suit.  There


            3    

would be a higher standard in the Federal court as far as


            4    

the deliberate in difference --


            5              

QUESTION:  Right. 


            6              

MR. PASTERNAK:  -- a standard which we submit we


            7    

would -- my client, in filing the suit pro se, satisfied. 


            8    

He would also be satisfying a lower standard as far as the


            9    

negligence as well. 


           10              

QUESTION:  Was this complaint ever amended since


           11    

your client gained representation, or are we still


           12    

operating under the pro se complaint?


           13              

MR. PASTERNAK:  It was amended only for the


           14    

purposes of -- of attempting to name Mr. Urena as a


           15    

defendant, and then there was a proposed second amended


           16    

complaint which would be naming additional defendants,


           17    

which -- and I believe also different causes of actions,


           18    

but that was denied at that time. 


           19              

QUESTION:  At -- at -- it's puzzling why there


           20    

wasn't enough time to identify that individual, that Mr.


           21    

Urena.  I could understand the pro se litigant having a


           22    

limited ability, but once lawyers came into it, why wasn't


           23    

-- why was it so hard to find out who was John Doe I?


           24              

MR. PASTERNAK:  My appearance came after the


           25    

time period.  Mr. Malesko had the case, and there was a

            1    

motion that was initially made to dismiss the case.  It


            2    

was only after that case, that that motion was denied,


            3    

that my -- that I came into the case.  So, he had the case


            4    

pro se for the entire time period where he would have had


            5    

to identify who the John Doe was and would have had to


            6    

know how to conduct the discovery in order to ascertain


            7    

who the John Does were and the difficulty that he would


            8    

have, as far as the corporation's responsiveness to


            9    

identifying who Mr. Urena was, who set the policy as far


           10    

as the elevator, who set the policy as far as the


           11    

medication, who set all of the policies. 


           12              

It's not an easy burden for someone to try and


           13    

identify who the specific person is that would have to be


           14    

sued, which is why the suing of the corporation is a more


           15    

manageable one from the plaintiff's point of view. 


           16              

It would also be a more manageable one from the


           17    

defendant's point of view, we would submit, also because


           18    

it would allow the corporation to be the one who's


           19    

controlling the litigation. 


           20              

It would be avoiding potential conflicts that


           21    

exist by naming the individual employees and having them


           22    

go out and retain their own counsel.  It would limit the


           23    

-- it would reduce the cost of the litigation for the


           24    

defendant because you're ultimately looking at the


           25    

corporation, and it would only have to have one set of

attorneys as opposed to a multiple set of attorneys.  So,


            2    

the cost to defend would go down as far as the


            3    

corporation. 


            4              

If we're also operating under a claim under


            5    

Federal law, then the rules of the game, as far as the


            6    

discovery, as far as the motion practice and general


            7    

procedure, would also be under the Federal law as opposed


            8    

to the State law, so that it would be easier for the


            9    

corporations to control their costs because they would


           10    

know how to be defending this type of an action. 


           11              

And in fact, hopefully, these types of actions


           12    

would be decreasing as the liability would be there. 


           13    

There are certain programs that would be going into place


           14    

by the companies to make certain that everybody has the


           15    

proper training in order to avoid these types of


           16    

constitutional violations. 


           17              

Indeed, that's one of the reasons that we submit


           18    

that there would really be no danger to the public fisc. 


           19    

In the normal situation, you have a suit against a


           20    

Government employee where the Government afterwards comes


           21    

in and it either has provided counsel and will also pay


           22    

any judgment that exists.


           23              

QUESTION:  Mr. Lamken said that's not


           24    

necessarily so, that the Government would pay.


           25              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Not necessarily so, but it is

usually the case that happens. 


            2              

So too, you have a situation where CSC has


            3    

acknowledged that it normally does indemnify its


            4    

employees.  And in our situation, there's a contract that


            5    

exists between the Bureau of Prisons, which is a Federal


            6    

agency here, and the private for-profit corporation, CSC,


            7    

which required CSC to indemnify the Bureau of Prisons. 


            8              

In addition, it required CSC to have insurance. 


            9    

So, before any danger could take place to the public fisc,


           10    

the first thing that would happen, as far as a judgment


           11    

which would be rendered, is that it would be coming from


           12    

the insurance company. 


           13              

The insurance company would then have to make a


           14    

determination, is this something that would justify an


           15    

increase in premiums or can it be more properly addressed


           16    

solely by the implementation of special programs and


           17    

trainings and seminars to the individual employees? 


           18              

If it were to increase its premiums, then the


           19    

corporation would have to make a determination whether or


           20    

not to pay it or to seek other insurance to get a better


           21    

rate.  Only if that rate is increased, then the


           22    

corporation would then have to turn around and say, well,


           23    

is this a cost that we should be absorbing or to try and


           24    

pass it along to the Federal Government?

increase rates if the corporation -- if they know that the


            2    

corporations are going to be liable. 


            3              

MR. PASTERNAK:  Well, right now, respectfully --


            4              

QUESTION:  I mean, you know, they're -- they're


            5    

not dumb and they're competitive.  If corporations are not


            6    

liable, the rates are going to be lower.  If corporations


            7    

are liable, the rates of all the insurance companies are


            8    

going to be higher.  That's going to be passed on to the


            9    

United States Government.  I mean, you know, that has to


           10    

be -- that has to be the outcome. 


           11              

MR. PASTERNAK:  But no one is -- respectfully,


           12    

no one is arguing that there could not be a theory for CSC


           13    

to be liable under common law, respondeat superior, or


           14    

under the ADA or any other theory for the corporation to


           15    

be liable.  It's only a question under what theory the


           16    

corporation would become liable.  So, that the damages, or


           17    

the claims against the private corporation, would still


           18    

exist.  They would still have to be defending the claims. 


           19    

They would still ultimately, we would submit, be found


           20    

liable for it.


           21              

QUESTION:  You can't have it both ways.  You're


           22    

now telling me that you don't really need these cause of


           23    

action -- causes of action because there -- there are


           24    

other ways to get relief out there, which the insurance


           25    

companies are already taking into account.

I mean, there's either a substantial difference


            2    

in what you're urging this Court to adopt or not.  If


            3    

there's a substantial difference, it's going to come out


            4    

of the Government's pocket.  If there isn't a substantial


            5    

difference, why should -- why do we have to create a cause


            6    

of action that does not appear in the Constitution or in a


            7    

statute?


            8              

MR. PASTERNAK:  If I may, I don't think that it


            9    

necessarily comes out of the Government, because, A, you


           10    

have the insurance, and B, if the rates get increased to


           11    

the company, then the company then has to turn around and


           12    

bid it out to the Federal Government, and the Federal


           13    

Government can turn around and go through a different


           14    

contractor.  So, you have a different situation as far as


           15    

the ability to pass it along, as opposed to the Federal


           16    

Government where it comes in and indemnifies the


           17    

employees --


           18              

QUESTION:  This other contractor that it would


           19    

pass it on to would not be subject to the same law that --


           20    

that we hold today?


           21              

MR. PASTERNAK:  He would be subject to the same


           22    

law.


           23              

QUESTION:  And therefore, his rates would be


           24    

higher too, wouldn't it?

            3    

ascertain what the potential is and what programs are in

            6              

QUESTION:  Mr. Pasternak, compare for a moment,


            7    

if you will, the elements of damages you would be seeking


            8    

under the kind of claim you have in mind and the elements


            9    

of damages you might be seeking under a State -- State law


           10    

negligence action as -- as to amounts, amounts of money. 


           11    

Are there elements that you could recover for under the


           12    

Federal claim that you couldn't recover for under a State


           13    

negligence claim?


           14              

MR. PASTERNAK:  As far as amounts, it's


           15    

difficult to quantify as to what it is.  As far as the


           16    

Federal claim, we would have the claim of violation of the


           17    

Federal Constitution. 


           18              

QUESTION:  Yes, but what you want as a result of


           19    

the claimed violation is money damages, I take it.


           20              

MR. PASTERNAK:  That is correct. 


           21              

QUESTION:  And I'm -- I'm asking you would the


           22    

money damages be any different under -- under a theory of


           23    

negligence as opposed to the theory you're proposing. 


           24    

Could some element of damages be permitted under one and


           25    

not under the other, or would they be the same?

            1              

MR. PASTERNAK:  I think it would depend on how a


            2    

jury viewed the elements --


            3              

QUESTION:  Well, but I -- I mean -- I realize


            4    

one jury can give you one result and one another.  But


            5    

let's suppose it's the same jury.  Or just -- just -- I


            6    

mean, the testimony as -- as to physical suffering and


            7    

that sort of thing, it would be pretty much the same,


            8    

wouldn't it?


            9              

MR. PASTERNAK:  That would be. 


           10              

QUESTION:  Except you might have punitive


           11    

damages under State law, mightn't you, if -- if indeed it


           12    

was -- it was gross negligence or indeed virtually -- an


           13    

intentional harming of -- of the prisoner?  Under many


           14    

State laws, you'd be able to get punitive damages,


           15    

wouldn't you? 


           16              

MR. PASTERNAK:  There would be a potential under


           17    

certain situations under State law to obtain punitive


           18    

damages. 


           19              

QUESTION:  And you can't -- as far as I know, we


           20    

haven't held that punitive damages are available under


           21    

Bivens, have we? 


           22              

MR. PASTERNAK:  That's correct. 


           23              

QUESTION:  A State cause of action -- could --


           24    

could a State just incorporate the Eighth Amendment

            2              

QUESTION:  Could the State, as part of a State


            3    

cause of action, simply incorporate the Eighth Amendment


            4    

as part of a State tort standard?  There could be no


            5    

reckless indifference or you're -- you're liable under


            6    

State law. 


            7              

MR. PASTERNAK:  It could.  The States would have


            8    

the power to do whatever it pleased.  Each State would


            9    

have its own decision making. 


           10              

QUESTION:  So, then you don't need the Bivens


           11    

cause of action even for the Eighth Amendment because


           12    

States are free to enact it if they choose.


           13              

MR. PASTERNAK:  But that would leave to each


           14    

individual State to ascertain and decide whether or not


           15    

there should be a remedy that exists as far as a Federal


           16    

constitutional violation, which is a separate and distinct


           17    

harm that needs to be addressed. 


           18              

QUESTION:  Is the same thing true about other


           19    

Bivens actions?


           20              

MR. PASTERNAK:  This Court -- yes, it is.  And


           21    

this Court has routinely held that just the fact that


           22    

there is a common law claim that might exist is not


           23    

sufficient in order to find that there should not also be


           24    

Bivens liability. 


           25

Federal officer.

MR. PASTERNAK:  Not as to a Federal officer,


            4    

correct. 


            5              

In here, though, where we have a private


            6    

corporation, who is operating pursuant to its contract


            7    

with the Government, where it has a separate motive, a


            8    

fiduciary duty in order to maximize its profits, and there


            9    

the danger to the Federal fisc is less, we submit, or


           10    

certainly no greater than if there were an additional


           11    

Bivens situation, we would submit that the greatest


           12    

deterrence that could exist is to go and permit the suit


           13    

against the corporation and not impose the duty in order


           14    

to try and ascertain which employee would it be, whether


           15    

or not it's a former employee who set a policy who's no


           16    

longer there, but to permit it because it is the


           17    

corporation who has control of its individual employees


           18    

based on the relationship, whether it be for a limited


           19    

contract and what contract terms are or whether it be an

at-will employee, and also based on respondeat superior,

private corporation.  We are not dealing with the FDIC or


           23    

the Government or a Government agency.  In light of the


           24    

fact that there's a direct relationship of contract that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


            8                    

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


            9              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


           10              

I'd like to address what I think are sort of two


           11    

pivotal points here. 


           12              

One, derive -- I derive from Justice Kennedy's


           13    

question asking Mr. Pasternak about the effect of the


           14    

Richardson decision because it seems to me the Court,


           15    

obviously, should be concerned about what its prior


           16    

precedents tell us about the appropriate way to proceed. 


           17    

He concedes, too, that Richardson, a case on which he


           18    

relied very heavily in his brief, frankly does not provide


           19    

him with much comfort. 


           20              

I would have asked him, in -- in turn, the


           21    

extent to which he derives comfort from the FDIC v. Meyer


           22    

decision in which this Court, it seems to me, essentially


           23    

addressed the same issue we have here and told litigants


           24    

going forward look to the private employee, look to the


           25    

employees as the primary source to obtain remedies and to

            1    

obtain maximum deterrence.  And once you satisfy that,


            2    

then you're done with the inquiry because the Court


            3    

specifically addressed in Meyer the -- the question of do


            4    

you -- do you extend Bivens to a new category of


            5    

defendants.


            6              

And that takes me to the second point I think is


            7    

worth keeping in mind, and that was the question that


            8    

Justice Scalia asked, which is why don't we simply leave


            9    

this to Congress to resolve at the end of the day.  And it


           10    

seems to me a -- an intricate debate about questions of


           11    

indemnification, where we don't know what the final answer


           12    

is about who has what rights of indemnification, questions


           13    

of respondeat superior where we don't even know specifics


           14    

about what -- what causes of action may or may not be


           15    

available, questions of the availability of punitive


           16    

damages, all of these questions are left on the table


           17    

completely unknown at this point. 


           18              

It seems to me, in the context of that kind of a


           19    

circumstance, the Court was correct in Meyer in saying


           20    

that we should leave these questions to Congress, and if


           21    

Congress acts, then you can seek out the kind of


           22    

parallelism between 1983 and a Federal cause of action, or


           23    

if you don't, presumably Congress will have explained to


           24    

you why there are disparities between the various


           25    

approaches.  It seems to me that the best solution for

            1    

this Court is to recognize that a hands-off approach is


            2    

the final answer. 


            3              

QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, can I ask one quick


            4    

question?  Do you concede, for purpose of -- of review of


            5    

the case and based on your question presented, that the


            6    

complaint states a cause of action? 


            7              

MR. PHILLIPS:  For purposes of where the case is


            8    

right at the moment, yes. 


            9              

QUESTION:  Yes. 


           10              

MR. PHILLIPS:  I think on remand, obviously we


           11    

would fight -- if -- if the case were to go forward, we


           12    

would continue to fight that issue. 


           13              

QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, is it, -- is it correct


           14    

-- and some of the questions, including my own, have


           15    

assumed that you can't sue a Federal offer in State -- you


           16    

can't sue a Federal officer for a tort committed in the


           17    

course of his official duties.  I'm not sure that's right. 


           18    

You can't sue him in State -- or you can sue him in State


           19    

court, but it is removable to Federal court.


           20              

MR. PHILLIPS:  It's immediately removable. 


           21              

QUESTION:  But there's -- there's no Federal


           22    

prohibition against the suit, is there? 


           23              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there will be a preemption


           24    

issue that's going to immediately arise as to whether or


           25    

not he's immune -- whether he's immune.  And -- you know,

            1    

if it's within the scope of his responsibilities, then


            2    

he'll have -- he'll have an immunity --


            3              

QUESTION:  Qualified immunity, but -- but you --


            4    

if it's not, you -- you can sue him and -- and the only


            5    

prohibition is, if he wants, he can remove it to Federal


            6    

court. 


            7              

MR. PHILLIPS:  That's correct.


            8              

QUESTION:  Okay.


            9              

MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Your Honor.


           10              

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


           11    

Phillips.


           12              

The case is submitted.

           14    

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
