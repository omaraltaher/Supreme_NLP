 CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:  We'll hear  argument


now in No. 03-44, Basim Omar Sabri v. the United States. 


Mr. Birrell.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. BIRRELL


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR.  BIRRELL:  Mr.  Chief  Justice, and  may it


please the Court:


 Section 

666(a)(2) 

of 

title 

18 

is


unconstitutional on its face because it never requires the


jury  to  find  an element  that  the  Constitution always


requires.  The statute's  unambiguous  language allows  a


violation  to  be  proved  with  entirely  local  conduct


unrelated to Federal  spending.  It thus intrudes  deeply


into an area the Court has recognized  as one in which the


States possess primary authority. 


QUESTION:  Yet there's no doubt, Mr. Birrell, is


there, that  in some  circumstances the  statute could  be


constitutionally applied?


 MR. BIRRELL:  There  are no circumstances  where


66(a)(2) -- 666(a)(2) could be  constitutionally applied,


Your  Honor,  because  the -- because  the  statute never


requires  that  the  jury find  a  connection  between the


Federal spending and the offense conduct.  In the same way

that  there were  possibly  circumstances  in Lopez  where


there might have been an  adequate Federal connection, but


because the jury is not required to find it, there are not


any  circumstances 

where  the  statute 

could  be


constitutional. 


QUESTION:  Why -- why can't it be constitutional


under the Commerce Clause?  I know the Government doesn't


rely on  that, but respondent can be supported here on any


-- any  ground. 

Why -- why  isn't  this  a commercial


transaction as -- as, you know, our -- our Commerce Clause


law is?  So long as the transaction is commercial, we will


assume it's interstate commerce.  We will accept Congress'


judgment on that.


 Why isn't it a  commercial transaction when  you


bribe somebody?  Money for -- for whatever the  favor he


does.


 MR.  BIRRELL: 

A  couple things,  Your  Honor.


First  of all, there is  not a requirement that interstate


commerce nexus be proved in the statute.


 QUESTION:  That's not  necessary.  So long  as


it's commercial, our  cases -- our recent  cases, say  so


long as  it's commercial, we'll accept  Congress' judgment


that it's interstate.


 MR.  BIRRELL:  Well,  if Congress  could create


commerce -- Commerce Clause jurisdiction  everywhere that

it could spend money, then -­

QUESTION:  No, no, not everywhere it could spend


money.  Everywhere there is a commercial transaction.  One


of our cases,  for example, held that  loan-sharking could


be  covered under  the Commerce  Clause because  it was  a


commercial transaction, just  as illegal as  -- as the  -­

the bribery  here, but  if that  could be  covered by  the


Commerce Clause, why can't this?


 MR.  BIRRELL: 

Because without  -- without  a


showing that in each case  there was a connection  between


interstate commerce and the transaction -­

QUESTION:  That's not what our cases require.

 QUESTION:  Is that  true of  the drug  statutes 

too?

 MR. BIRRELL:  I'm sorry, Your Honor? 


QUESTION:  I mean, is  it true whenever the Feds


prosecute a person for a  drug transaction, a jury has  to


determine there was  a connection between these  drugs and


interstate commerce? 


I've never  heard of  that  requirement that  -­

that the -- that the jury would have to determine whatever


facts are necessary  for the statute to  be constitutional


even -- even though that's not an element of the offense.


Does that come out of a case  or someplace?  Where does it


come from?

 MR. BIRRELL:  Well, unless -- unless  there was


an  understanding  that  in every  instance  there  was an 

effect on interstate commerce, then -­

QUESTION:  I  mean, there  might  be  instances 

where there's no effect on  interstate commerce, a home -­

you  know,  that  -- that  will  be  an  issue, homegrown


marijuana.  So  suppose there is some  drug somewhere that


has no effect.  Suppose it didn't.  There could be such a


thing.  We  can imagine  it.  But does that  mean in  all


these  other cases that  Congress -- that the  statute is


void  because the  jury hasn't  found -- I'd  be repeating


myself.  You answer.


 MR. BIRRELL:  I -- I think that it is different


because the  Commerce Clause is  -- is a  regulatory power


that permits Congress  to regulate.  The Spending  Clause


power  is -- is  a different sort  of power.  It does not


make that -­

QUESTION:  And  you say  here Congress does  not


rely on the Spending Clause because it -- it makes conduct


criminal against an individual. 


MR.  BIRRELL:  I believe  that  Congress passed


this law  under  the Spending  Clause  power.  I  believe


that's what they intended to do.  All the -­

the  basis  in the  court  below  and that  combined  with

Necessary and Proper.


 MR. BIRRELL:  That's right, Your Honor. 


QUESTION: 

And that's  the  position  that was


taken  below, and I  think most  of the courts  of appeals


went on that same ground.


 MR. BIRRELL:  It's my understanding  that every


court  that has  looked  at this  has  said that  Congress


attempted to pass  this -- this particular statute  under


the Spending Clause. 


QUESTION: 

Does -- does  it matter  what they


intended to pass it under?  I mean, if they have the power


under another -- under  another head, would -- would that


not be enough?


 MR. BIRRELL:  That is  true, Your Honor.  They


could -- they could  -- the  statute could  be upheld  if


Congress has the power to do it on any basis.


 QUESTION: 

The  justification  sounds  like  a


Spending Clause  justification,  doesn't it,  that the  -­

that they  could  not by  a lesser  means safeguard  these


Federal  funds?  They  tried  narrower statutes  and they


didn't  work.  But what  they were  trying to  do was  to


safeguard the integrity of the money that they were giving


to these  units by not  having corrupt operations.  Isn't


that the case?


 MR. BIRRELL:  That -- that's what they said they

were trying  to  do.  They were  trying  to regulate  the


integrity  of  -- or  -- or  police  the  integrity  of


organizations, agencies, and  local and State  governments


that  receive Federal funds.  That's what  they said they


were trying to do.


 QUESTION:  And why is that not satisfactory?


 MR. BIRRELL:  It's not satisfactory because the


statute  doesn't  require  any  connection  between  the


spending -- Federal spending and the criminal conduct.


 QUESTION:  Suppose that, just  to use an analogy


in the private sphere, a major corporation has a choice of


two  subcontractors and  one  subcontractor is  known  for


engaging  in  lots of  bribery  and kickbacks,  et cetera.


It's confident that it's got auditors that will be able to


protect it in this instance.  But don't you think if  you


were the  CEO of the  corporation, you'd rather  prefer -­

rather deal with the subcontractor  that was always clean?


It's just a common sense business judgment, and that's all


the Government is doing here.


 MR. BIRRELL:  That's not  what the Government is


doing here, Your Honor.  What the Government is doing here


is  to  criminalize  purely  local  conduct. 

They're


criminalizing conduct that has no  relation to any Federal


spending.


 QUESTION:  Well,  it has  relation  because  it

wants to  give its  funds to  those entities  that it  has


confidence in with respect to all of their operations.


 MR. BIRRELL:  Well,  it can make a  choice about


giving  money  or  not  without  criminalizing  conduct.


Congress has  a number  of ways  that it  can protect  its


Federal money.  It can protect it  under Commerce Clause,


Property Clause, not  giving money, relying on  the States


to do  -- to do  what they need  to do, False  Claims Act,


conditional spending.  There's -­

QUESTION:  They really  say if  we find  a city


council that  takes money and -- from us, the city council


takes the  money for  us for  some of  its programs  here.


There's a corrupt  city councilman.  We want  to prosecute


that person.  Why?  Because we want council -- members of


councils  to  know  that  we're  not  going  to  tolerate


corruption on behalf  of the agency that's  giving out our


money, whether in the particular  instance it involved our


money or  not.  Now  -- now,  why  isn't that  sufficient


connection?


 MR. BIRRELL:  Because, Your Honor, there  is -­

it may be  that what -- that is what  the Government wants


to do,  but the question is whether the Government has the


power to do that.


 QUESTION:  That's true, but why doesn't it?


 MR. BIRRELL:  It doesn't  have the power  to do

that  because there's not  an element in  the statute that


requires there be a connection  proved between the Federal


spending and  the wrongful conduct.  There may be one, but


the jury is not required to find one.


 QUESTION:  Suppose the  Federal Government  had


recast the statute and said no State can get -- what's the


limit  -- $10,000  or more  from  the  Federal Government


unless  it  agrees  to  criminalize  and impose  the  same


penalty set forth  here for any  State corruption.  Would


that be constitutional under the  spending power?  It's  a


condition to the grant.


 MR. BIRRELL:  It might be if -­

QUESTION:  It  unquestionably would be, wouldn't


it?  It's take it or leave it.  It's -­

MR. BIRRELL:  Assuming it wasn't -­

QUESTION:  -- it's connected to the  grant.  It


has  some  remote connection  to  it.  That  ought to  be


enough.  It just seems very strange to me that the Federal


Government  would be able  to compel  the State  to impose


such  criminal penalties,  but it  cannot itself do  so in


connection with its spending.


 MR.  BIRRELL: 

In  --

in  Your  Honor's


hypothetical, it  might be coercive, unduly  coercive, but


other  than  that,  I  don't  see  a  problem  with  your


hypothetical.

 But there's a -- the -- the Court -- this -- the


Court  has  said that  Congress  can attach  conditions to


money provided  that the four Dole  factors are met.  But


that is not what's occurring  here.  This Court has  never


said that  Congress can use  the Spending Clause  power to


create a criminal law statute.  And the danger with  this


is -­

QUESTION:  Well, have we ever said it can't?


 MR. BIRRELL:  Well,  only inferentially by Dole.


So the question is never square with -­

QUESTION:  I  think it's  kind of hard  to read


Dole for that proposition.


 I may have  missed your  response to an  earlier


question.  You  -- you  bring a  facial  challenge.  Why


should  we entertain  a  facial  challenge?  What  if  we


treated  it as an  as-applied challenge?  Do you  say the


Government cannot prove  the elements  that you think  are


necessary and thereby obtain a conviction?


 MR. BIRRELL:  I -- I say that  we -- we properly


bring  a  facial  challenge  because  the statute  has  no 

element  requiring  a  connection  between  the  Federal 

spending -­

QUESTION: 

I  don't 

--  

we  don't  normally 

entertain facial challenges  to statutes on a  ground like


that.  If it could be  applied properly in  an individual

case, why would we entertain the broader challenge? 


MR. BIRRELL:  This  statute cannot  be properly


applied in any case.  It's always unconstitutional because


it lacks this connection element.  The statute is like -­

QUESTION: 

You  say  because  it  lacks  the 

requirement  of  a  jury  finding  that  there  was  the 

connection.

 MR.  BIRRELL: 

Yes. 

Well,  there  are  two


concepts, both that  there's not an  element and that  the


jury doesn't need to find it.  This statute is -- is like


the statute in Lopez.


 QUESTION:  Well, what if -- what if Congress had


found that interstate  commerce is  involved here and  did


not provide for an individual  jury finding in every case,


would your argument be the same?


 MR.  BIRRELL:  I  don't  know, Your  Honor, but


Congress didn't make that finding.


 QUESTION:  It's a very candid answer. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Where -- where does this -- I  mean,


I've asked you this before, but  I'm not sure.  Where does


this  jury  finding  thing  come  from? 

It's  quite


interesting.


 But  -- but  where  -- I  mean,  suppose  that


Congress  passed  a  statute  under  the  Patent  Clause

criminalizing certain conduct in respect to patent, and at


the border there  might be an -- a question  of whether it


does  or  does not  fall  within the  Patent  Clause, that


particular criminal behavior.  But  I wouldn't jump  from


that fact  that you'd have  a legal argument  it's outside


the Patent Clause to the conclusion that therefore a  jury


has to find  in every patent crime  -- a jury has  to find


that it is within the clause.  I'd have thought that was a


question for  the judge,  not the  jury.  So you've  been


emphasizing  the contrary idea,  and where  do you  get it


from?


 MR. BIRRELL:  Well, in the -- in the -- in Your


Honor's Patent Clause  hypothetical, that is a  case where


the  Court would  -- or the  Congress would  have a  -- an


enumerated  regulatory  power. 

This  is 

--  

this  is a 

different thing.  Now -­

QUESTION: 

Well, it  has  the  Commerce Clause 

power. 


I -- I don't understand  your reliance on Lopez.


You  just said just -- just as Lopez  was bad, whether or


not  there -- Lopez was  -- was  bad because  it was  not


commerce, which is  a judgment that this Court  will make,


whether it's  commerce or  not, but  once it  is commerce,


you're in a different ball park.  Once it is commerce, we


assume  it's interstate commerce,  and that  explains, you

know,  a  whole bunch  of  our cases,  such  as our  loan­

sharking cases.  So  Lopez has  nothing to  do with  this


case.  Lopez was not commerce.


 Now, you -- you may argue that -- that bribery


is not  commerce although  loan-sharking is,  but I'm  not


sure how strong an argument that is.


 MR. BIRRELL:  This case  is like Lopez  because


the  way I read  Lopez -- I mean,  I understand your point


about whether the conduct in Lopez was commerce conduct or


not, but  the way I'm reading  Lopez is that the  point is


that when  you're  on the  -- the  fringes  of the  power,


commerce power in that case,  that there needs to be  a -­

an  element where the  jury would  find in each  case that 

there  was  a connection  between  the exercised  power of 

Congress and the conduct. 

So in our case -­

QUESTION:  You think there  is such a -- such  a


connection with loan-sharking, good, old, local, you know,


break-your-knees  loan-sharking. 

It's  not  -- not  an


interstate thing.


 MR. BIRRELL:  Well,  you've -- you've told  me


that -- that the  Court has said that there is, and I -- I


accept that.


 QUESTION:  That's  United States  v. Perez.  We


took a very expansive view of the Commerce Clause.  And it

was pretty  much of a local transaction in -- in the case,


but  the Court  pointed out,  you know, the  ripple effect


that all commercial transactions have.


 MR. BIRRELL:  Well, I would return to  my point


that  I think  that if  the Congress  can create  Commerce


Clause  jurisdiction  by spending  money  and Congress  is


entitled to spend money under the Constitution anywhere it


deems  it  important for  the  general welfare,  then what


would naturally  follow, it  seems to  me, is the  general


police power that  the Constitution denies to  the Federal


Government.  It seems to me to be an  inescapable chain of


reasoning that will get us there.


 QUESTION: 

Have  any  local  law  enforcement


offices complained about the Federal presence?


 MR. BIRRELL:  There -- there's nothing in  the


record  about  it, and  I  don't  have anything  to  offer


outside the record of it.  But the -- the question whether


the local governments  or government agents consent  to an


invasion  of  their  area  of  authority  is  -- is  not


dispositive.


 QUESTION:  Question whether they regard it as an


invasion  of  their  authority  or  rather  a  legitimate


endeavor by the Federal Government to protect its money.


 MR. BIRRELL:  Well, the -- the  statute doesn't


require the Federal Government to be acting to protect its

money.  There -- there is  not any requirement  that this


money be the Government's  money.  For example, a  private


citizen offers a -- a bribe  to an agent.  It could  be an


agent of a -- a corporation.  The offer is refused  and 12


months later and for the  first time more than $10,000  is


given to an  unrelated part of  the agent's business,  the


business the agent works  for.  Then we now have a Federal


crime  committed. 

There's not  any  requirement  in the


statute that  there be  a connection  between the  Federal


money and the  offense conduct.  And  furthermore, there's


not any requirement that the jury find it.


 QUESTION:  Would you like to reserve the balance


of your time, Mr. Birrell?


 MR. BIRRELL:  I will reserve the  balance of my


time, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Very well. 


We'll hear from you, Mr. Dreeben.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


 MR.  DREEBEN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice, and  may it


please the Court:


 The court of appeals correctly held that section


666 does not require proof of a Federal connection between


the offense conduct  and the  federally funded program  or


Federal funds  beyond that which  the text of  the statute

itself requires.

 QUESTION: 

What 

--  

what  is the  basis,  Mr. 

Dreeben? 

Under  what authority  did  Congress  pass the 

statute?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, the  Government


has  relied  on  Congress'  Necessary  and  Proper  Clause


authority to  protect its Spending Clause expenditures and


programs in this case.


 I recognize that the  Commerce Clause could also


provide  a  basis  for  Congress  to  reach  transactions


involving criminal activity that affect commerce, but this


Court  in  Salinas  v. United  States,  in  describing why


section 666 was constitutional, as applied to the facts of


that case, discussed  that there was a  legitimate Federal


interest  in  protecting  the  particular  program  that


corruption had affected  in that case.  And the outgrowth


of section 666 historically is of an effort by Congress to


improve  on  previously  deficient  methods of  protecting


federally funded programs.  There were -­

QUESTION:  How far  does that  go?  What  if -­

what if the Federal Government  gave the State $1?  Could


it  make -- could it make it  -- it a crime for any person


to bribe any State officer anywhere in any program at all?


You know, the -- really is -- is there no end to the -- to

 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia,  I think that this


Court  recognized, as  recently as  last term in  Jinks v.


Richland  County,  that analysis  under the  Necessary and


Proper Clause is  deferential, tracing  its roots back  to


McCulloch v. Maryland, but there is an attenuation element


to the analysis.  The law does  need to be conducive  and


plainly adapted  to the  end that  Congress is  seeking to


protect.  And  in your example of  $1 to a State  and then


protection  through  criminalizing  the  activities  of 

hundreds  of  thousands  of  agents,  there  might  be  an 

attenuation problem. 

QUESTION:  Do you think $10,000 is -- is clearly


-- what's -- what's the -- what's the annual budget of New


York State, do you know, or California? 


MR.  DREEBEN: 

Okay. 

The annual  budget  of


California is -- at least in 1999, was $242 billion. 


QUESTION:  $242 billion. 


MR. DREEBEN:  And the Federal Government -­

QUESTION: 

And  because  there's  $10,000  of


Federal money, a drop  of Federal money in this  sea of -­

of California  funds, the  -- the  Federal Government  can


control the whole thing.


 MR. DREEBEN:  But there's not a drop.  There's a


virtual flood.  There was -­

apply, it takes only $10,000.


 MR.  DREEBEN: 

It does,  Justice  Scalia,  but


Congress was well aware that every  State is the recipient


of billion upon billions of dollars in Federal aid.  There


is substantial Federal money flowing to all of the States,


and  Congress  could  have  dispensed  with  any  dollar


limitation whatsoever with respect to State aid and simply


made  a per se  finding that  Federal money is  so infused


into the  State's budgetary  activities, Federal  programs


are so pervasive -­

QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, I am concerned about the


breadth  of  your  reliance on  the  Necessary  and Proper


Clause and the Spending Clause power here.  It seems to me


that  Federal  funding  extends  to  a  huge  range  of


activities, and  why, under your theory, couldn't Congress


make -- take over the entire criminal  law scheme because


it  affects Federal taxpayers?  I  mean, I don't  see any


limit to  your  theory,  and  I'm curious  why  you're  so


reluctant to rely on the Commerce Clause.  What's going on


in this case?


 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice O'Connor -­

QUESTION: 

Are  you  trying  to  overcome  the


problems  of Lopez somehow,  get a new  thread of analysis


that gets  you  out from  under that? 

What's -- what's

 MR.  DREEBEN:  No.  I  think  there are  ample

avenues  for the  Federal  Government  to legislate,  when


things involve interstate commerce, without worrying about


Lopez. 


I believe the Court could  uphold the statute as


a regulation of  interstate commerce,  but it was  clearly


not designed with that in mind, and this Court did not  so


regard  it,  or  at  least  didn't  articulate  itself  as


regarding it that way in  Salinas v. United States. 

The


problem  that  Congress was  trying  to solve  was  a very


particularized  problem, not  the  generalized problem  of


there  is  crime  in  America,  therefore it  will  affect


federally funded activities. 


The  problem that  Congress was trying  to solve


was  that  it  would  give  Federal  money  to  particular


entities to -- to administer Federal programs,  and there


would  be crime  that had  the potential  to affect  those


Federal  interests,  but  because  of  deficiencies  or


perceived deficiencies in prior statutory law,  that crime


could not be prosecuted.  In particular, with theft crimes


there was a problem because once title had passed with the


money to the  local entity  or State  entity, some  courts


were  saying that  was no  longer  theft from  the Federal


Government  and  the  theft statute  didn't  apply.  With


respect to  the Federal  bribery statute,  18 U.S.C.  201,


lower  courts  had  divided  on  whether State  and  local

officials who were administering Federal programs could be


held accountable as Federal officials.


 And to remedy  those deficiencies of prior  law,


section 666,  as  the  court  of  appeals  I  think  aptly


described  it, changed  the  enforcement paradigm,  and it


said that what  we want now is not  to focus on particular


Federal  monies  that  we  have  difficulty  tracing  into


federally funded entities  or who  is a Federal  official.


We want  to make sure  that the entities  that we fund  to


carry out Federal  assistance programs are clean,  and the


way  that  we  are  going  to  do  that  is  to  draft  a


prophylactic statute that ensures that  all agents who are


involved in the authority to conduct business on behalf of


the entity are  not engaged in significant  acts of theft, 

embezzlement, or bribery.

 It,  therefore, included various  limitations in 

section  666  that  prevent  it  from  being  an  all-


encompassing,  all-devouring  statute that  sweeps  in all


related crimes to the entities that are funded.  There's a


$5,000  limitation with  respect to the  transactions that


are going to be influenced.  It's not every traffic ticket


that  is issued by any State agency.  And there is a -- a


condition, of  course, that  there be  $10,000 of  Federal


money going into the entity. 


Of course,  there are  going to  be cases  under

MR.  DREEBEN:  Any  1-year period,  but there's

mean that  it has to span  the offense conduct.  And that


provision  was  designed to  overcome the  difficulty that


State and local agents would be bribed for activities that

they would  have the power to  engage in once  the Federal

Federal money coming into the  entity, the officials could

Government  could  also criminalize  federally  robbery or

received Federal funds, who has received a Federal subsidy

Yes,  Justice  Scalia,  within

 MR. DREEBEN:  That's -­

QUESTION:  And  that's what this says.  Anybody


who -- who bribes any  State official, whether the Federal


funds are at issue or not.


 MR.  DREEBEN: 

Well,  this  -- this  statute,


though,  I think rests  on a  generalization that  is less


attenuated  and more reasonable  than statutes  that would


take the form  of the  statute Your  Honor has  described.


This statute basically says if  you have corrupt officials


in the entity that's getting Federal money, we have reason


to worry that  you have poor  internal controls, that  you


have a culture  of corruption, that you  have insufficient


mechanisms to root it out, and that the officials that are


engaged in corruption  today with  respect to State  money


may  tomorrow  be engaged  in  corruption with  respect to


Federal money.


 QUESTION:  So -- so call -- call this the clean


funnel  rationale.  The  agencies  are funnels  funneling


money  to the  -- and say,  look, we have  a pretty strong


rationale here.  We want clean  funnels because a  little


bit of  the money going through is  Federal.  Take that as

given.


 If  I  were  to  say  you're right,  what's  the


standard  where  the Spending  Clause is  at issue?  What


words would be  used there?  And  the reason that  this is


difficult at the  moment for me is  because this is not  a


condition imposed upon spending.  You're not saying to the


State, we'll give you the  transport money if you -- this


is really  a Federal law  protecting the -- the spending.


You may be right in this case,  but we're going to have to


say some kind of standard.


 Should  we  say  it's  just  whatever  would  be


necessary  and  proper  to  protect  the  object  of  the


spending, which is quite far out because you can spend for


things you  don't  otherwise have  the power  to  do?  Or


should we  say something else, or  should we say  we don't


have to reach that here because if in fact the power would


be  there under the Commerce Clause  anyway, that at least


is good  enough and isn't a stretch of the Spending Clause


where there's a necessary and  proper rationale?  What  in


your view is the proper way to write those words?


 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, I think  the most


logical  way to write this opinion  is to rely on the test


that this Court articulated in  1819 through Chief Justice


Marshall with respect to the power under the Necessary and


Proper Clause.  Here  the enumerated  power that's  being

protected is the spending power.  The Necessary and Proper


Clause was long ago construed to give Congress substantial


deference to  pass laws so long  as they are  conducive to


the end  that  Congress  is  trying  to  achieve  and  its 

legitimate. 

QUESTION:  The  -- the McCulloch language?  Let 

the end be legitimate -­

MR. DREEBEN:  That's -- that's correct.  That's


correct, Justice Kennedy. 


QUESTION:  Suppose that  -- that to  -- to take


the phrase,  the clean funnel theory, we thought that that


theory is best sustained under the  Commerce Clause.  What


would be the closest case that we could cite in support of


our position if we were writing under the Commerce Clause?


Are there cases in which governmental entities and -- and


their -- the integrity  of the  operations are  protected


under  the Commerce  Clause?  Have  we ever  talked about


that?


 MR. DREEBEN:  I can't  think, off the top of  my


head, Justice  Kennedy, of a Commerce Clause case that was


specifically  directed  at  governmental  activity. 

Of


course,  this  statute  is not  specifically  directed  at


governmental  activity. 

It's  directed  at  any  fund


recipient, be it  private, Indian tribe, or  governmental.


So  the Court could  rely on  cases probably like  Reno v.

Condon in  which the Court upheld a law that dealt with an


item in commerce, be it in  the hands of the Government or


in hands of private parties.  And of course, United States


v.  Perez did uphold  a very  broad view of  the Congress'


power to regulate transactional conduct.

 QUESTION: 

No  governmental  entities in  that 

case, as I recall. 

MR. DREEBEN:  No governmental  entities in -- in 

Perez,  but  of  course,  this  case  doesn't  focus  on


governmental entities as such.  What it focuses on them is


-- it  focuses on them in their capacity as administrators


of  funds  that  are  paid  out under  Federal  assistance


programs.  It treats them  identically to private entities


that also  receive Federal  funds under Federal  programs,


which is strong  evidence that what  Congress had in  mind


here was  ensuring that its  purposes and goals  under the


Spending  Clause aren't  frustrated  by corruption  within


whatever entity  it is that happens to be taking the funds


to administer the program.

 MR.  DREEBEN: 

Justice  Ginsburg,  18  U.S.C.,


section  641,  which was  the  Federal theft  statute, was


really a protection of Federal property, and that probably


could be justified  under a  variety of enumerated  powers


under Article I.


 18 U.S.C., section  201 was the  Federal bribery


statute that primarily  focuses on people who  are Federal


officials  or  who  are  designated  to  become  Federal


officials.  And  this Court  in United  States  v. Dixson


interpreted the statute to cover State and local officials


who were administering Federal programs because  they were


acting on behalf of the  United States.  And with  respect


to that  branch of section 201, although the Court did not


address  the constitutional  question in  Dixson,  I think


that the  proper grant of authority  to analyze it  is the


Necessary and  Proper Clause  as applied  to the  spending


power  because  it,  like  section 666,  criminalizes  the


activities of non-U.S. persons because they are engaged in


an activity that relates to federally funded programs. 


So the theory of protecting through criminal law


the misdeeds of agents that may impair Federal programs or


impair Federal  funds  is not  new.  What  was new  about


section  666  was  its  removal  of the  impediments  that


Congress found in  the prior law so that it  could have an


effective  mechanism  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  its

programs. 


The  case that  is before  the Court today  is a


facial challenge to section 666, arguing that it is always


and  everywhere  unconstitutional. 

That  submission  is


impossible  to reconcile  with  this Court's  decision  in


Salinas v. United  States which specifically said  that as


applied  to the conduct  in that  case, where there  was a


connection  to  a  Federal  program,  the  statute  was


constitutional as applied. 


What that means is that the court of appeals was


clearly  correct  in  holding  that  section  666  is  not


facially unconstitutional.  It leaves  open whether there


is  an as-applied constitutional challenge to section 666.


No such challenge was brought in this case, and the United


States made a proffer to the district court indicating how


the  particular bribery  in this  case would  have had  an


effect on Federal funds and Federal programs, making clear


that no such as-applied challenge would have succeeded.


 So the only  way that petitioner can  prevail in


this  case  if  this  Court  is  prepared  to  say  that


notwithstanding  its  prior decision  in  Salinas, holding


that section  666 was  constitutional as  applied, it  now


turns out  that section  666 is  facially unconstitutional


and can  never be applied to  anyone anywhere.  We submit


that that is incorrect.

 QUESTION:  If  there were  a nexus  requirement


that we  wrote into the statute -- the hypothetical gets a


little murky at this point  -- would -- would juries  have


to  find  that there  was  a  nexus  or  could  the  judge


instruct -­

MR. DREEBEN:  Judging  from the  way that  this


Court resolved the Salinas  decision, Justice Kennedy,  it


would  be  a  constitutional as-applied  challenge  to  be


resolved by  the Court.  This  Court in Salinas  said that


the statute was  constitutional as  applied and there  had


been no jury finding on any nexus requirement. 


QUESTION:  But in subsequent trials, if we found


a nexus requirement,  would the  juries have to  determine


the nexus?


 MR. DREEBEN:  I  don't think  that they  would,


Justice  Kennedy.  Just  as in  a case  like New  York v.


Ferber where the Court held that child pornography  can be


outlawed across the board, the statute is not --


QUESTION:  Well, but --


MR.  DREEBEN:  It's not invalid  on overbreadth


grounds.


 QUESTION:  Yes.


 MR.  DREEBEN: 

But  the  Court left  open  the


possibility that there would be as-applied challenges, and


it  didn't suggest  that  those as-applied  constitutional

challenges would raise  jury issues.  They would  instead


raise issues of law for the -­

QUESTION:  Well, but if Congress in its -- in -­

in the  statute says  there must be  some connection  with


interstate commerce, then certainly it's a jury issue.


 And Justice Kennedy's question,  as I understood


it,  was that supposing the Court were  to read in a nexus


requirement, just exactly what Congress might have put in.


You say that would not be a jury question then. 


MR.  DREEBEN: 

I  am  judging,  Chief Justice


Rehnquist, by the way  that this Court resolved the  legal


issue in  the  Salinas case.  The  Court  would have  two


options  open  to  it  if  it  decided,  contrary  to  our 

arguments  today,  to  read  in  some  sort  of  a  nexus 

requirement.  It  could  do  what  the Second  and  Third 

Circuits  have  done,  which  is,  we  think  incorrectly,


superimpose on the statute as an implicit element that has


no textual foundation some sort of a Federal nexus.


 Now, if the  Court did  construe section 666  to


require a Federal nexus, that's clearly a jury issue under


United States v. Gaudin.  Every element, be it implicit or


explicit, has to be found by the jury. 


But alternatively, I understood Justice  Kennedy


to  be  suggesting that  there  could be  a constitutional


overlay  to  ensure  that  there  was no  unconstitutional

as  the  statutory valuation  elements  are met,  that the


transaction  involves $5,000  or more,  which it  probably


would, given teacher salaries, then it would be covered by

prosecute it.  I think  what that illustrates is that  the


broad prophylactic  approach that section 666  takes leads


easily  to  the manufacturing  of hypotheticals  that seem


attenuated from core Federal interests. 


And the choice  that Congress had before  it was


to draft a statute that would go to that degree of breadth


but eliminate  impediments that had previously hobbled the


enforcement of  a law or  draft a  statute which  Congress


believed was  both under-inclusive  and would  put to  the


jury perhaps difficult  and murky issues of  whether there


really was a Federal connection that justified application


of the statute.  And let me give an example because it's a 

very important,  classic example  of the way  that we  use 

section 666.

 Suppose that there is a city council person or a


mayor or some other official  who has responsibilities for


some respect -- in some respects administering  a Federal


program or Federal funds, and  he turns out to be  engaged


in corruption with respect to  non-Federal monies and non-


Federal programs.  The Government wants to  prosecute him


to ensure  that he  doesn't begin  to widen  his field  of


operation and harm  the Federal program, but in  the facts


that can actually be proved, there's no connection between


the Federal program and the offense conduct.


 Conceivably  could  a  statute be  drafted  that

would allow  the  Government to  say  that's the  kind  of


Federal nexus that's  covered?  Certainly, but there  are


many,  many  hypotheticals where  the potential  injury to


Federal interests is  not necessarily going to be  easy to


articulate and prove to a jury. 


As a matter of discretion, the United -­

QUESTION:  Who -- whose  burden is it?  I  mean,


assume  we accept your -- your  proposition that we should


uphold it  on  its face,  at least,  and  that future  as-


applied challenges will still be allowed.  Would it be the


burden  of the  defendant to  establish that -- that this


goes too far,  that this is  not reasonable protection  of


the Federal monetary interest? 

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, Justice  Scalia.  If  it's a 

question  of  law,  is  the  statute  unconstitutional  as 

applied,  then  the defendant  should  have the  burden of 

establishing that.  But I  understood Justice  Ginsburg's


hypothetical to raise  the question  what if Congress  had


drafted  a  narrower  statute  that had  some  sort  of an


offense nexus element.  Then we'd have to prove it up. 


The United States  Attorneys Manual does  direct


prosecutors  to  use  666  in  cases  where  there's  a


substantial and  identifiable Federal  interest.  So what


you have  here is a combination of Congress saying we need


a  statute that's adequate  to vindicate Federal interests

and prior efforts  to draft narrower ones  have frustrated


that goal.  We're going to draft a broader  statute.  And


then the Federal  executive branch uses its  discretion to


prosecute cases  that do,  indeed, pose a  real threat  to


Federal interests.  Now, that's as a matter of discretion.


It's not as a matter  of constitutional law, and it's  not


as a matter of what the statute provides.


 QUESTION:  Well,  then why  should we take  that


into consideration deciding the question before us?


 MR.  DREEBEN: 

It's  not  relevant,  strictly


speaking,  to  the constitutional  question.  What  it is


relevant to is why it was rational for Congress to draft a


somewhat broader statute  without fearing that,  by virtue


of having  given the  executive branch  this power,  State


criminal law would be thoroughly swamped, I believe as one


of the dissenting opinions said.


 QUESTION:  But what if you have a  new executive


coming in who is  really hot on this  subject and says  we


want to prosecute every case we can under it?


 MR. DREEBEN:  Then I'll  have to withdraw  this


statement. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION: 

Or  an  even  more  realistic


hypothetical is the  United States Attorney in  Chicago or


New York, who are not  always, shall I say, responsive  to

the directives of central  justice, bringing a prosecution


against a political opponent that has really no connection


with a Federal interest.  That might happen.


 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia, I often  say that


the only  way that we  get uniformity in  Federal criminal


law enforcement is from a decision by this Court.


 If the Court has no further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. BIRRELL


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. BIRRELL:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


Turning first to  the discussion about  Salinas,


Salinas did not  decide the issue presented  in this case.


The constitutionality of  the statute  was not before  the


Court in  Salinas.  Salinas was  a question of  statutory


interpretation.  What  the Court  appeared to  do was  to


conduct  a 

harmless  error 

review  because 

the


constitutionality had not  been raised in the  briefs, was


not in  the  cert petition,  and it  does  not impede  our


facial challenge. 


I think that this -- this -­

constitutional been raised, would have -- should have come


out the other way.


 MR. BIRRELL:  I think that if the constitutional


issue had been raised in  Salinas, it would have come  out


the other way, yes.


 I think as well that if I could direct the Court


to page 34  of our  brief, that this  will respond to  the


discussion about  the element,  that this  is an  analysis


about the  element in  Lopez.  We would  submit the  same


would apply here. 


There  are  many  noncommercial  applications of


this statute, for example, bribery regarding civil  rights


law.  So  I don't think the  Commerce Clause is -- is the


answer.


 Furthermore,  in  -- 666(a)(2)  doesn't  even


require any actual recipient  corruption because the third


party  to the  funding  contract under  (a)(2) can  -- can


offer a bribe to an  absolutely incorruptible official and


yet still be charged with a Federal crime.


 The -- the  overreaching question in  this case,


Your Honors, is  that Federal  power must have  judicially


enforceable limits and  this statute  ignores them and  is


unconstitutional in every instance. 


Thank you. 


CHIEF  JUSTICE  REHNQUIST: 

Thank  you,  Mr.
