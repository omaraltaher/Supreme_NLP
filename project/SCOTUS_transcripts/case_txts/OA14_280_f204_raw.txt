(10:05  a.m.) 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­280,  Montgomery  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Louisiana. 

            

Mr.  Bernstein. 

 

         

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  RICHARD  D.  BERNSTEIN 

 

 

 

 

 

     

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  COURT­APPOINTED  AMICUS  CURIAE 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

The  issue  is  whether  to  decide  the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Miller's  retroactivity  in  this  case  or  in  a  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas  case  such  as  Johnson  v.  Manis,  No.  15­1  on  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  docket. 

 

            

In  today's  case  there  is  no  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  that  question  because  the  point  of  Section  1257  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  enforce  the  Supremacy  Clause.  And  the  Supremacy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause  States  that  when,  quote,  "the  laws  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,"  unquote,  apply,  quote,  "the  judges"  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  this  is  ­­ these  are  the  key  words  ­­ "in  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  shall  be  bound  thereby." 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  no  such  thing  as  supreme  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  that  depends  on  whether  a  particular  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

voluntarily  makes  Federal  precedence  binding.  When  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State  does  that,  when  a  State  voluntarily  adopts

nonbinding  Federal  precedence,  that  creates  no  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Federal  law,  which  is  what  1257  requires,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Michigan  v.  Long  does  not  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  how  would  you  describe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  adequate  and  independent  State  ground  on  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ this  decision  rested? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  I  would  say  that  the  lack  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  binding  Federal  law  question  is  an  antecedent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  to  borrow  the  terminology  of  the  S.G.'s 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief,  before  you  get  to  the  adequate  and  independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  ground  analysis. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  why  don't  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  to  answer  that  question? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  You  certainly  have 

  

 

 

 

jurisdiction  to  answer  the  question  whether  Teague  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally  required  in  State  collateral  review 

 

 

 

 

 

courts. 

            

The  second  part  of  our  brief  said  why  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  constitutionally  required  in  State  collateral  review 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts,  and  that's  basically  this  Court's  precedence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Danforth  back  to  the  beginning  in  Desist  and  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kaufman,  have  said  that  the  Teague  ­­ what  have  become 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Teague  exceptions  are  matters  of  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion  and  not  matters  of  the  Constitution,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  habeas  statute  on  its  face  only  applies  in

Federal  court. 

 

            

So  the  Federal  habeas  court  can  grant  relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  relief  is  warranted  under  the  Teague  exception. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  If  a  State  says,  we 

   

  

 

 

 

acknowledge  that  we  are  holding  a  prisoner  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

contravention  of  Federal  law  but  we  choose  to  do  nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  it,  then  the  answer  is  Federal  habeas  corpus; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  not  a  second  answer  that  the  State  can  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  under  the  Supremacy  Clause,  under  its  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures,  to  enforce  the  Federal  law? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  ­­ if  I'm  ­­ and  if  I  were  to  take  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  argue  that  second  position,  I'm  not  quite  sure  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  I  would  have  to  support  me.  It  wouldn't  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Well,  I  think  that  Your 

   

  

 

 

 

Honor's  opinion  for  the  Court  in  Martinez  v.  Ryan  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  ­­ 132  Supreme  Court  at  1319 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  1320  suggested  that  there  are  advantages  to  citing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  habeas  right  in  the  Federal  habeas  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than  what  the  Court  called  a  freestanding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  claim.  A  major  advantage  here  is  if  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  the  State  courts  are  bound  by  the  Teague 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions  by  the  Constitution,  then  when  it  goes  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  habeas,  there  will  be  very  deferential  AEDPA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review.

If  you  say  that  the  redress  question,  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale  of  Danforth  indicated,  in  State  court  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  State  law,  then  when  the  issue  goes  to  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas,  AEDPA  will  not  apply  because  the  State  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  not  have  decided  the  Federal  issue.  And  that  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ it  is  a  major  difference.  You  would  actually  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

weakening  the  Federal  habeas  statute  to  recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

And  this  Court  will  benefit  from  having  de 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

novo  percolation  in  the  lower  Federal  courts,  the  lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas  courts,  all  of  which  will  be  out  the  window  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  jurisdiction  in  this  case,  because  the  lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  habeas  courts  will  only  be  able,  and  the  courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewing  them  on  appeal,  to  apply  the  highly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferential  AEDPA  review. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  In  effect,  are  you  ­­ we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  the  Supremacy  Clause  binds  the  States  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  direct  criminal  proceedings? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  mean,  is  that  another 

    

 

 

 

 

way  of  phrasing  your  argument? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  It  would  be  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Supremacy  Clause  only  binds  the  States  in  direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings  and  in  collateral  proceedings  where  it's  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

old  rule,  because  that's  the  equivalent  of  a  direct

proceeding.  But  if  you  are  talking  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity  of  a  new  rule,  then  the  ­­ that's  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Teague  ­­ the  two  Teague  exceptions  apply.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  to  new  rules.  They  apply  to  collateral  review. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  those  are  based  in  statutory  equitable  discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than  the  Constitution.  But  the  Court  has  already 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held  that  both  direct  review  and  the  application  of  old 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  present  Federal  questions. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  do  you  differentiate 

  

 

 

 

 

this  case  from  Standard  Oil? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Because  in  Standard  Oil,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

issue  was  the  underlying  status  of  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  arm,  and  the  Court  said  that  question  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlled  by  Federal  law.  Standard  Oil  is  like  Miller 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself,  where  the  issue  was:  What  does  the  Eighth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  require?  That's  a  Federal  constitutional 

   

  

 

 

issue  it  applied. 

 

 

            

In  Standard  Oil,  as  a  combination  of  statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  and  Federal  common  law,  Federal  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlled  the  question.  Here  the  statute  doesn't  apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  State  court,  as  Danforth  and  numerous  other  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  held,  like  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  in  State  court,  even  though  many  courts  follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar  provisions  and  certainly  follow  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

precedence  in  interpreting  those  similar  rules.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  we  did  say  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  could  define  the  exemption  any  which  way  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted. 

            

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  so  it  could  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost  identical  here;  we  would  announce  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law  is,  send  it  back.  The  State  has  already 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  it's  going  to  follow  Teague,  but  I  guess  it  might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  might  not  be  free  to  change  its  mind  about  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  I  think  the  difference  and 

    

 

 

 

 

what  makes  this  case  special  is  that  this  Court  has  held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  Murdock  v.  City  of  Memphis,  almost  150  years  ago, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

87  U.S.  at  326  to  327,  that  the  1267  jurisdiction  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  by  question.  It  is  not  like  1331,  case  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  It  is  question  by  question. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  do  not  believe  the  Court  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  to  skip  over  the  question  of  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law  applies  and  then  answer  the  hypothetical  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law  applied,  what  would  it  be.  I  think  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  whether  Federal  law  applies  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  question. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  How  ­­ how  ­­ suppose  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  think  of  the  first  Teague  exception.  Suppose  ­­

sedition  laws  that  make  certain  conduct  unlawful  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  a  thousand  people  in  prison.  This  Court  in  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  rule  holds  you  cannot  criminalize  that  behavior. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  right.  What  is  the  law  that  would  make  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactive  to  people  in  prison?  It  sounds  to  me  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  isn't  like  some  kind  of  statutory  discretion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rather,  there  are  human  beings  who  are  in  prison,  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  there  without  having  violated  any  valid  law,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  always  protected  by  the  First  Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  that's  right,  then  it's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution,  the  Due  Process  Clause,  that  says  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  held  ­­ even  though  they  committed  the  crime  22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  ago,  they  are  now  being  held  in  confinement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  due  process  of  law  because  you  cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminalize  their  behavior. 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Do  you  see  where  I'm  going? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That  being  so,  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Constitution  rule,  the  exceptions  of  Teague, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Teague  drops  out  of  the  case.  The  only  question  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  they  satisfy  the  two  exceptions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Well,  in  your  hypothetical, 

  

 

 

 

 

respectfully,  I  don't  think  that  would  be  a  new  rule. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

It  would  be  an  old  rule  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I've  made  it  a  new  rule. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  If  it  were  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  For  purposes  of  my 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

hypothetical,  I'm  making  it  a  new  rule. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

rule  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  If  it  were  a  genuinely  new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  ­­ then  under  Danforth  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

going  all  the  way  back,  the  ­­ Justice  Harlan's  opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Mackey  said,  we're  not  creating  the  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  because  the  Constitution  requires  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Danforth  was  the  case 

  

 

 

 

 

saying  that  the  States  could  be  more  generous.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  a  case  ­­ this  is  a  case  that  ­­ the  opposite  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  generous:  Can  they  be  more  stingy?  And  I  cannot 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

find  anything  in  ­­ in  Harlan  ­­ maybe  I'll  read  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  but  I  can't  find  anything  there,  nor  can  I  find 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  in  Danforth  that  answers  the  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  thought  it  is  a  new  question.  Hence, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that  question  I  posed  to  you,  because  I  want  to  get  your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response.  I  don't  think  you  can  answer  it  by  means  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent.  I  think  you  have  to  try  to  figure  it  out 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  the  help  of  precedent. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Well,  if  it  is  a  new  rule, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  has  held  ­­ and  sorry  to  cite  a  precedent  ­­

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  all  right. 

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Linkletter  has  held  that 

  

 

 

 

 

retroactivity  on  collateral  review  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional.  That  aspect  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  true.  But  then  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

have  Teague,  and  Teague  is  saying  we  don't  like

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Because  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean,  why  doesn't  it 

    

 

 

 

 

violate  the  Constitution  to  hold  a  person  in  prison  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  years  for  conduct  which  the  Constitution  forbids 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  criminal? 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Well,  it  does  violate  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  it  wasn't  criminal  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  time.  I  mean,  it  wasn't  prohibited  by  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  at  the  time  he  was  convicted,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Fair  enough.

Schweiker  v.  ­­

which  witch  is  being  a  witch?  There  were  some  people  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Salem  who  were  imprisoned  for  being  a  witch.  And  lo  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behold  in  1820,  it  was  held  by  this  Court  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated  the  Constitution. 

 

 

            

Now,  you  see,  I  just  make  a  more  outrageous 

   

   

 

 

 

 

example  of  the  same  thing. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  ­­ and  what  I  want  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  say,  okay,  I  got  your  point.  It  didn't  violate  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  at  the  time.  I've  also  got  the  point  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  some  authority. 

 

 

            

Anything  else? 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  This  Court  has  been 

  

 

 

 

 

reluctant,  even  when  there  is  a  violation  of  the  Due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Process  Clause,  to  create  a  judicial  remedy,  an  implied 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial  remedy  on  top  of  the  Federal  statutory  remedy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  Schweiker  v.  Chilicky,  cited  in  our  briefs.  And

assume  the  premise  of  Justice  Breyer's  question,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  there  is  a  Constitutional  violation  in  keeping 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  in  prison  for  some  conduct  that  can't  be

The  State  has  set  up  a  collateral  review 

   

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism.  We're  not  asking  it  to  set  up  a  new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism  that  it  hasn't  had  before.  It  has  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral  review  mechanism,  and  the  only  question  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  going  to  comply  with  Federal  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  in  that  collateral  review  mechanism. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  And  the  other  question  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether  that  issue  of  retroactivity  is  itself  a  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  issue.  If  it  is,  obviously  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  If  it  is  not,  I  would  submit  there  is  not

habeas.

substantive  rule  prohibiting  mandatory  life  without 

 

 

 

 

 

parole  for  juveniles,  which  should  be  applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactively. 

            

This  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  hear  Henry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montgomery's  claim  because  the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied  exclusively  on  Federal  jurisprudence. 

 

 

 

 

            

In  Miller,  this  Court  held  that  mandatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life  in  prison  was  unconstitutional.  It  also  held  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life  in  prison  would  be  an  uncommon,  rare  sentence,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Isn't  it  just  like  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State  saying:  We  have  a  Fourth  Amendment,  and  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Constitution  has  a  Fourth  Amendment;  we  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  apply  our  own  Constitution,  but  in  applying  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  will  follow  the  Federal  precedent? 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  we  would  say,  in  that  case,  the  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  decided  on  the  State  constitutional  ground, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  though  the  State  court,  in  interpreting  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground,  is  looking  to  Federal  decisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  In  this  case,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  did  not  state  that  it  was

Michigan  v.  Long  ­­

MR.  PLAISANCE:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  thought  it  cited  an 

    

 

 

 

 

            

            

earlier  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  case  which  made  it  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  it  was  following  the  Federal  rule  as  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  discretion  and  not  because  ­­ not  because  it  had  to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  could  in  a  later  opinion  decide  not  to  follow 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law. 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  It  is  my  interpretation  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  earlier  case  that  the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  a  choice,  and  they  made  the  choice  to  apply 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Teague.  In  fact,  they  said  in  that  opinion,  we  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dictated  by  the  Teague  analysis.  And  that's  what  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

            

Under  Michigan  v.  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Did  they  not  say  in  Taylor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  were  not  bound  to  follow  Teague?  Didn't  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  we're  going  to  follow  Teague  but  we  ­­ we  want  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  it  clear  we're  not  bound  to  do  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  They  did  say  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  They've  never  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

they've 

never  retracted  that,  have  they? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  Correct,  but  the 
 

  

 

 

 

choice 

itself  is  not  necessarily  a  matter  of  State 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

law.  While 

  

the  Supreme  Court  had  the  authority  to  make 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 

decision,  it  said,  we  believe  ­­ by  choosing

believe  that  is  the  better  law,  and  therefore,  we  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow  the  Federal  guidelines  from  Teague,  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence,  in  doing  so. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  believe  that  under  Michigan  v.  Long, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unless  they  state  a  clear  and  independent  ground,  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  can  conclusively  presume  that  they  applied  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  as  they  believed  this  Court  would  apply  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  I  thought  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

thought  it's  unless  they  clearly  state  otherwise,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  assume  that  they're  applying  Federal  law.  And  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  did  clearly  state  otherwise.  They  said,  we  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  follow  Federal  law,  but  we're  going  to  model  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  on  Federal  law.  It  seems  to  me  that  satisfies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  exception  requirement  of  ­­ of  Michigan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  It  is  my  opinion  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Michigan  v.  Long  indicates  the  reverse,  Your  Honor,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  must  say,  we  are  following  State  law  in  making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  decision.  We're  applying  State  law  rather  than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  they  did  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here.  They  said  that.  This  is  a  matter  of  State  law; 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  don't  have  to  follow  Teague,  but  we  choose  to  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  State  law.  I  thought  that's  what  they  said. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  And  I  believe  that  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

sufficient  to  indicate  to  this  Court  that  it  is  applying

from  your  standard  Michigan  v.  law  question  ­­ Long

do  something  different,  but  we  want  to  follow  Teague. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  what  we  want  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  in  ­­ in  all  its  particulars.  All 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  And  then  the  question  is:  If  the  State  commits 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  following  Teague,  it's  not  ­­ it  doesn't  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  else  has  committed  it.  It  self­commits  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  Teague  and  to  following  Federal  law.  Then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  happens?  Is  there  enough  of  a  Federal  question  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  this  case? 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  not  a  Michigan  v.  Long  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

It's  more  like  a  Merrell  Dow  question  or  something  like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  where  Federal  law  is  ­­ the  State  has  chosen  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it's  just  part  and  parcel  of  the  claim,  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  is  so  committed  to  following  Federal  law  in  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  particulars. 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  I  agree  with  Your  Honor. 

    

 

 

 

 

And  even  in  Danforth,  this  Court  said  that  the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  retroactivity  is  a  pure  question  of  Federal  law.

MR.  PLAISANCE:  That  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  Why 

  

  

 

 

 

            

            

don't  you  finish? 

 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  That's  the  answer  to  ­­ to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  ­­ to  your  explanation  or  hypothetical,  that  you  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  said  if  the  State  decided  that  they  were  choosing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law,  then  what  ­­ what's  the  next  step?  And  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  next  step  the  question  is  retroactivity,  which  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  majority  and  the  dissent  in  Danforth  said  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  retroactivity  is  a  pure  question  of  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Federal  statutory 

  

 

 

 

law,  right?  I  thought  that  was  the  point  of  Danforth, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  reason  the  States  can  go  beyond  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  interpretation  is  is  because  we're  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  habeas  statute.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

but  even  in  Yates,  this  Court  said  that  on  State  habeas, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  State  considers  the  merits  of  the  Federal  claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  merits  of  this  claim  are:  Is  Mr.  Montgomery 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serving  an  unconstitutional  sentence?  Is  Miller 

  

 

 

 

 

retroactive  to  address  the  fact  that  he's  serving  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional  sentence? 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  How  do  you  deal  with

off  if  ­­ if  you  are  correct?  That  is,  if  the  question

decide  ­­ decides  it  without  any  AEDPA  problem.  But  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  court  goes  first,  then  the  Federal  review  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

truncated. 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  That  would  be  my 

  

 

 

 

 

understanding,  Your  Honor,  that  while  Mr.  ­­ while 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Henry  ­­ while  jurisdiction  in  this  Court  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depend  on  what  has  occurred  so  far,  it  depends  upon  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  does  decide.  But  again,  whether  he  can  go  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court  or  this  Court  doesn't  affect  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  that  this  Court,  I  believe,  has  today.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  is:  If  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  in  ­­ in  ­­ how  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  answer  the  argument:  All  right,  suppose  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right,  but  your  victory  is  going  to  leave  your  client  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  worse  position  because  when  he  gets  to  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court,  he  will  be  saddled  with  AEDPA? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  Well,  not  if  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rules  it  has  jurisdiction  and  makes  Miller  retroactive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then  obviously,  at  that  point,  he  would  not  be  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  court. 

 

            

And  the  question  is:  Is  Mr.  Montgomery 

  

 

 

 

 

 

being  held  unconstitutionally?  This  Court  in  Miller 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  a  mandatory  life­in­prison  sentence  is

unconstitutional  because  it  fails  to  address  the  fact  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  matter  that  this  Court  believed  kids  are  different. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Mr.  Plaisance,  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  point,  let  me  see  if  I  understand  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  arguing.  A  lot  of  State  rules  of  procedure  are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modeled  after  Federal  Rules  of  Procedure,  and  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  courts  simply  follow  the  Federal  Rules.  But  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow  it  as  a  matter  of  choice  and  not  because  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  they're  bound  by  the  Federal  rules. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  let's  say  that  there  is  a  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreement  in  Federal  court  about  what  Federal  Rule  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Evidence  403  means.  The  State  court  says,  well,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  we're  going  to  follow  the  ­­ the  Federal  rule,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  that  the  right  course  as  between  these  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divergent  Federal  courts  of  appeals  is  the  Second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit.  So  we're  going  to  follow  the  Second  Circuit's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  Federal  Rule  403.  What  ­­ would  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  jurisdiction  to  ­­ to  review  that  decision  as  ­­ as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  decision  on  a  question  of  Federal  law? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  If  it  was  clear  to  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  that  the  State  court  made  a  conscious  choice  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sent  enough  of  a  signal  to  this  Court  that  it  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopting  Federal  law  to  use  as  State  law.  But  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  there  is  no  indication  that  the  State  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  of  Louisiana  was  making  that  decision.

They  said  that  we  are  ­­ our  analysis  is  dictated  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Teague,  and  in  doing  so,  they  found  that  Mr.  ­­ they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  apply  Miller  retroactively.  That's  the  real 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  of  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Suppose  we  hold  that  we  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

review  the  ­­ the  ­­ we  have  jurisdiction  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  court  said  it  was  going  to  follow  Teague.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  we  go  on  and  we  say  that  under  Teague,  Miller  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  applied  on  collateral  review.  And  then  the  case  goes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court,  and  they  say,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  said  previously  in  Taylor  that  we  were  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow  Teague,  but  that  was  based  on  our  understanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Teague  at  that  time.  But  now  that  we  see  what  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  interpreted  to  mean  by  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  not  going  to  follow  Teague.  Then  what  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen? 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  I  think  Louisiana  would  be 

    

 

 

 

 

bound  to  follow  this  Court's  ruling  as  you  set  forth. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It  would  be?  Why?  Because 

  

  

  

 

 

 

it  said  that  we  would  voluntarily  follow  it  in  Taylor? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  bound  them? 

 

 

            

MR.  PLAISANCE:  I  think  they  made  the 

    

 

 

 

 

conscious  choice  to  follow  this  Court's  laws,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  jurisprudence.  In  doing  so,  it  must  follow  this

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  They  changed  their  mind. 

  

 

 

 

 

They  have  now  chosen  the  course  not  to  follow  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence.  What  forces  them  to  stay  where  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were?  It's  a  matter  of  State  law.  They've  decided, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  change  State  law.

if  we  agree  with  you  and  then  we  send  it  back  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  it  and  they  say,  oh,  if  that's  what  Teague 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means,  we're  not  going  to  follow  Teague,  what  stops  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  doing  that?  And  doesn't  that  make  us  look  foolish?

This  Court  does  have  jurisdiction  to  decide

Louisiana  has  voluntarily  incorporated  into  its  law  a

MR.  DREEBEN:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And 
 

  

 

 

they  can 

 

            

            

voluntarily 
 

choose  they're  not  going  to 
 

 

 

 

 

follow  it 

 

anymore. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

            

And  the  same  is  true  in  any 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Michigan  v.  Long 

 

 

case.  What 
 

  

Michigan  v.  Long  said  is  that  this  Court  has
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  under  Section  1257  to  resolve  State  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolutions  of  Federal  law,  and  it  will  presume  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  constitutional  decision  of  a  mirror  image,  say,  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Fourth  Amendment,  will  be  binding,  but  recognized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  only  circumstance  in  which  the  Court  will  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treat  Federal  law  as  governing  both  questions  is  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  makes  clear  that  it  would  reach  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

result  under  State  constitutional  law  as  it  did  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law. 

 

            

It  did  not  preclude  the  option  of  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  back  and  reaching  a  different  decision  once 

   

 

 

 

 

 

enlightened  by  this  Court  as  to  the  content  of  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

Standard  Oil  is  completely  clear  on  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  says  the  State  chose  to  use  Federal  law  to  determine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  a  Federal  post  exchange  was  a  Federal 

   

   

 

 

 

instrumentality.  And  we're  going  to  correct  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  of  Federal  law.

But  on  remand,  the  State  can  now,  freed  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  misapprehensions  of  Federal  law,  decide  what  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinks  State  law  requires.  And  if  it  does  that,  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  may  be  a  Federal  constitutional  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  How  ­­ how  ­­ how  does  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work?  It  ­­ it  should  be  pretty  elementary,  but  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  I  looked  at  the  Indian  case,  and  that  seems  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  far  out. 

 

 

            

The  ­­ the  ­­ the  ­­ though  it  definitely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  you  support  on  your  statement  here,  suppose  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took  Justice  Scalia's  example:  We  have  Iowa  State  Rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56.  We  interpret  Iowa  State  Rule  56  the  same  way  as  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  That's  our  rule.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  this  is  what  it  means  in  that  case.  And  they  say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  we're  doing  it  under  Iowa  State  rule. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  you  say  we  can  review  that  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  Iowa  State  rule  is  the  same  as  the  Federal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  I  ­­ I  ­­

   

   

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  that  right? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  ­­

    

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  I  just  ­­ how  do  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

fit  that  in  the  words  in  1257? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  doubt  ­­ I  doubt  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that  would  satisfy  the  Court. 

 

 

 

 

            

There's  a  theoretical  answer,  and  then

there's  a  practical  answer.  Let  me  give  the  practical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer  first. 

 

            

The  States  that  copy  the  Federal  Rules  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Evidence  and  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  ­­ Procedure  pretty  uniformly 

  

 

 

 

 

say,  we  will  treat  Federal  precedent  as  guidance  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions  as  ­­ for  its  persuasive  value.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  that  there  are  State  rules  of  procedure  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  rules  of  evidence  that  will  belong  to  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  they  say  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

particular  case,  it's  guidance.  It's  great  guidance. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

We  agree.  Our  interpretation  is  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  that  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  can  we  review  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  in  fact,  it  wasn't  the  Federal  interpretation? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  can  we  review  it? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  ­­ I  ­­

    

   

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes  or  no? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  There  ­­ there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  between  this  case  and  that  that  may  suggest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  case,  the  Court  has  jurisdiction  over,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  one,  the  Court  does  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  you  say  the  Court  does

not  in  the  example  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Procedure  that  Justice  Scalia  gave? 

 

 

 

 

            

case. 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  think  this  is  a  stronger 

    

   

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  It's  a  thought. 

   

  

  

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  I'm  doubtful  that  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  jurisdiction  or  choose  to  exercise  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  ­­ I  accept,  for  premises  of  the  argument,  Your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor's  hypothetical.  But  in  the  real  world,  it  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  but  when  you  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  doubtful  case,  I  think  you  are  implicitly 

   

   

 

 

 

 

acknowledging  that,  if  we  adopt  your  argument,  we  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  get  that  case  and  lots  of  similar  cases,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  have  to  parse  the  words  that  were  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  ­­ the  words  that  were  used  by  the  State  Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court:  Well,  we're  following  ­­ we're  going  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guided  by  it.  We're  going  to  be  strongly  guided  by  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  going  to  adopt  it.  We're  going  to  get  all  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  cases. 

 

            

            

            

Why  should  we  go  down  that  road  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  think  the  Court  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ when  there's  a  perfectly 

   

  

 

 

 

available  and  possibly  superior  remedy  available  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  by  filing  a  Federal  habeas  petition?

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  there  are  several  reasons, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito. 

 

            

First  of  all,  I  don't  think  that  it  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ going  to  come  up  in  that  way  to  this  Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that's  not  the  way  States  treat  their  own  rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  procedure.  I  don't  think  it  will  be  very  difficult. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  a  principle  in  the  Court's  cases 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  when  Federal  law  has  been  adopted  as  Federal  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  will  review  it  even  if  the  State  could  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chosen  a  different  path. 

   

 

            

So  ­­

 

            

problem  ­­

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Dreeben,  what's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Pardon  me. 

  

 

 

            

Did  you  misspeak?  When  ­­ when  Federal  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  adopted  as  State  law,  the  Federal  courts  can  review 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  Isn't  that  what  you  meant  to  say?  Or  ­­ or  ­­ I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  you're  very  ­­ you're  very  careful,  and  you  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  mistakes,  but  I  ­­

   

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think,  Justice 

   

   

  

 

 

Kennedy  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  You  ­­ you  said  ­­

trying  to  ­­

adopts  Federal  law  as  Federal  law,  then  there's  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Okay. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  The  State  has  adopted  Teague 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  reason  that  does  not  exist  in  any  of  these  civil 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  cases,  and  that  is  that  the  State  knows  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Federal  law  will  be  applied  to  the  very  case  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas  case.  So  the  State  has  decided  consciously  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

synchronize  its  law  with  the  law  that  it  knows  will  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied. 

            

And  this  actually  serves  a  very  important 

   

 

 

 

 

Federalism  purpose.  The  State  says,  if  we  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rectify  in  ­­ a  ­­ a  constitutional  error  in  our  case 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  become  final,  we  would  like  the  opportunity  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  And  if  the  Federal  habeas  court  is  going  to  treat 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  decision  as  retroactive,  we  would  like  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crack  at  it. 

 

 

            

California  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You're  ­­ you're  ­­ you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying  "hooray"  that  ­­ that  the  Federal  habeas  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  thereafter  be  bound  by  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  No,  because  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ because  the  State  got 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  first. 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  No.  There's  an  elementary 

  

  

 

 

 

reason  why  that's  not  so,  Justice  Scalia,  and  this

answers  Justice  Ginsburg's  question  earlier. 

 

 

 

 

            

2254(d)  applies  to  State  determinations  on 

 

 

 

 

 

the  merits.  That's  the  only  time  that  the  deference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  kicks  in.  And  a  determination  under  Teague  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  threshold  determination  that  comes  before  the  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  merits.  This  Court  has  said  that  in  any  number 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  cases.  It's  not  a  merits  resolution  of  the  case.  So 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference  to  a  State  determination  on  retroactivity 

   

 

 

 

 

would  never  occur. 

 

 

            

What  I  ­­

   

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  was  just  going  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

suggest  maybe  we  hear  a  little  bit  more  on  the  merits. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Certainly,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ the  rule  in  Miller  v.  Alabama,  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view,  is  a  substantive  rule,  because  it  goes  far  beyond 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merely  regulating  the  procedure  by  which  youths  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced  for  homicide  crimes.  It  compelled  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  adopt  new  substantive  sentencing  options,  an  option 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  less  severe  than  life  without  parole. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  only  other  time  that  this  Court  has  ever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalidated  a  mandatory  sentencing  provision  was 

   

 

 

 

Woodson  v.  North  Carolina  in  1976.  So  we  went  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  36  years  before  we  had  another  decision  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded  that  the  law  must  change  to  accommodate  the

compelling  interests  in  having  the  characteristics  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

youth  that  mitigate  culpability  considered  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  process. 

 

            

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Would  it  be 

  

 

 

 

enough  ­­ is  ­­ is  it  enough  if  the  States  simply  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay,  with  respect  to  people  who  have  been  mandatorily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced  to  life  without  parole,  we're  going  to  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parole? 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes.  I  believe  that  it  would 

    

  

 

 

 

 

be.  That  would  be  the  same  remedy  that  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordered  in  a  Graham  v.  Florida  case  for  ­­ which  is  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  that  held  that  youths  who  do  not  commit  homicide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  are  convicted  of  other  crimes  cannot  be  sentenced  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life  without  parole  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  Court's  remedy  for  that  problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  either  be  a  sentence  of  term  of  years,  but  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  also  be  simply  converting  the  life­without­parole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  to  a  life­with­parole  sentence. 

   

 

 

            

            

So  that  would  be  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Dreeben,  how  do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

explain  how  your  articulation  of  your  test  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  to  the  guideline  changes  in  Booker  that  we  made? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  I  ­­ I  think,  Justice 

   

   

  

 

 

Sotomayor,  the  key  difference  is  that,  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  guidelines,  there  was  always  a  ­­ a  minimum  and  a

maximum  set  by  statute.  And  the  guidelines,  even  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  mandatory,  did  not  preclude  judges  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  outside  the  guidelines,  depending  upon  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence  of  aggravating  or  mitigating  factors  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't  taken  into  account. 

 

 

 

            

And  as  Justice  Alito's  opinion  for  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  United  States  v.  Rodriguez  recognized,  even  the  top 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  mandatory  guidelines  range  was  not  truly  mandatory. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  even  under  the  mandatory  guidelines,  which  for  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  purposes  were  treated  as  if  they  established 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements  of  the  offense,  for  the  purposes  that  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  here,  they  are  not  mandatory  in  the  same  way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  that  Booker  brought  about  a  procedural  change. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  is  the  substantive 

  

 

 

 

 

difference  ­­ if  you  pardon  the  use  of  that  word  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  your  formulation  and  Petitioner's  formulation? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

He  says  this  is  substantive  because  it  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away  with  mandatory  life  imprisonment.  You're 

  

 

 

 

 

articulating  it  slightly  different.  Tell  me  what  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  as  the  difference  and  why  your  articulation  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Justice  Sotomayor,  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

think  there  is  any  substantive,  to  use  the  word, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

daylight  between  Petitioner's  position  and  ours.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

description  of  the  crime  at  issue  as  punishable  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  life  imprisonment  and  treating  that  as  a

category,  I  think,  sums  up  the  reality  of  what  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happening. 

            

We  broke  it  out  into  its  component  parts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  think  it  facilitates  the  analysis  of  it  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  that  Miller  does  have  a  procedural  component. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Sentencing  courts  must  now  consider  the  mitigating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics  of  age,  but  it  also,  and  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamentally  in  our  view,  contains  a  substantive 

   

 

 

 

 

component  that  required  a  change  in  the  law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  change  here  was  expanding  the  range 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  outcomes.  Previously  when  this  Court  has  analyzed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  changes  in  the  law,  there  have  been  changes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  restricted  the  form  of  outcome;  say,  for  example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Justice  Breyer's  hypothetical,  forbidding  punishment 

 

 

 

 

 

at  all. 

 

            

But  I  think  that  if  you  trace  back  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

origins  of  the  substantive  category  to  Justice  Harlan's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  in  Mackey,  this  is  still  faithful  to  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Harlan  had  in  mind.  Justice  Harlan  said  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearest  case  of  an  injustice  in  not  applying  a  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactively  is  when  it  puts  off­limits  altogether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  punishment.  He  did  not  say  that  it  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  case. 

 

            

And  I  think  that  if  you  consider  what  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  on  in  Miller  and  the  reasons  for  the  rule,  the

Court  made  very  clear  that  it  believed  that  of  the  2,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  that  were  in  prison  and  under  mandatory  life  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juvenile  homicide,  the  Court  believed  that  that  penalty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  frequently  disproportionate,  that  it  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncommonly  imposed  in  the  future,  and  that  it  was  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  that  was  consistent  in  most  cases  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mitigating  characteristics  of  youth  that  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  in  Roper  and  in  Graham  and  then  in  Miller. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Would  it  be  accurate  to  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  rule  is  substantive  if  it  makes  a  particular 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

outcome  less  likely  or  much  less  likely  or  much,  much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  likely  than  was  previously  the  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Probably  the  last,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Alito.  When  ­­ when  the  Court  characterized  substantive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules,  most  recently  in  the  Summerlin  opinion  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What's  the  difference 

  

 

 

 

between  much  less  likely  and  much,  much  less  likely? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  would  put  it  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

words  that  the  Court  has  used  previously.  The  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  a  substantive  rule  creates  a  significant  risk 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that  the  person  is  serving  a  sentence  that's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  for  that  person,  maybe  not  even  legally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  for  that  purpose.  It  did  not  say  absolutely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusively  proves  it.  It  said  significant  risk. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  contrast,  when  the  Court  has  talked

about  procedural  rules,  rules  that  govern  the  manner  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  a  case  is  adjudicated,  it  has  said  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likelihood  or  potential  for  a  different  outcome  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

speculative. 

            

And  I  think  if  you  put  this  case  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculative­significant  risk  axis,  this  case  falls  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  significant  risk  domain  precisely  because  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  why  the  Court  said  it  was  deciding  Miller. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  reasons  why  the  Court  decided  Miller  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  with  the  reduced  culpability  of  youth  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity  of  youth  to  mature,  change,  and  achieve  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

degree  of  rehabilitation  that  is  consistent  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  less  than  the  most  harsh  sentence  available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  youths  who  commit  murder  ­­ a  terrible  crime,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  the  harshest  sentence,  the  Court  thought,  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserved  for  the  worst  of  the  worst,  which  is,  in  fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Louisiana  said  when  it  amended  its  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantively  to  conform  them  to  Miller.  It  said  life 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  parole  should  be  reserved  for  the  worst 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenders  who  commit  the  worst  crimes. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  when  you  combine  the  fact  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  a  rule  that  ­­ that  only  governs  procedure  ­­ it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  just  govern  evidence;  it  also  mandates  changes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  outcomes  as  an  available  option  ­­ with  the  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

genesis  of  the  Miller  rule  in  a  conclusion  that,  for  the

people  in  this  class,  the  appropriateness  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment  of  the  harshest  degree,  life  without  parole, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  relatively  uncommon,  it  seems  clear  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miller  rule  falls  on  the  substantive  side  of  the  axis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather  than  on  the  procedural  side  of  the  axis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Have  any  States  treated 

  

 

 

 

 

Miller  as  retroactive  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ on  State  habeas? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes.  The  majority  of 

  

  

 

 

 

States  ­­ it's  a  close  call.  I  think  it's  maybe  about 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ten  to  seven  or  ten  to  eight.  But  the  majority  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  that  have  reviewed  this  have  concluded  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miller  is  retroactive.  Most  of  them  have  done  it  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  substantive  law.  There  are  a  couple  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

opinions  that  talk  about  the  watershed  exception,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  the  way  that  we  think  that  this  case  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analyzed. 

            

But  not  only  the  ­­ the  States  have  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  but  the  United  States  has  taken  that  position  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  juveniles  that  were  sentenced  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miller  to  life  without  parole  as  a  mandatory  sentence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  in  the  resentencings  of  those  that  have  taken  place 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  far  ­­ it's  only  been  about  ten,  but  those  ­­ those

are  terms  of  years  significantly  shorter  than  life. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  what  is  the  population 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're  dealing  with  if  most  States  do  apply  Miller 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactively?  I  think  that  there  was  a  figure  of  2,000 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

people  with  life  without  parole. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  haven't  broken  it  down  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

may  I  answer,  Mr.  Chief  Justice? 

   

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  have  not  broken  it  down 

    

 

 

 

 

 

numerically,  Justice  Ginsburg,  but  Michigan  has  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  it  retroactively,  and  it  has  a  very  large 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

population  of  juveniles  who  are  in  the  Miller  class. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  don't  think  that  Pennsylvania  has  resolved  it, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  not  favorably  yet  for  the  defendants.

questions  about  jurisdiction,  and  so  I'd  like  to  briefly

begin  there. 

 

            

We're  in  an  odd  position  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  because  we  won  below  and  we'd  win  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth  Circuit  on  Federal  habeas,  which  has  found  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miller  is  not  retroactive.  Why  then  do  we  not  contest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction? 

            

We  believe  and  still  believe  that  this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straightforward  case.  Not  ­­ and  Justice  Kagan,  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  standard  Michigan  v.  Long  case,  but  it's  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interwoven  case,  meaning  that  the  ­­ the  State  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took  Teague  lock,  stock,  and  barrel. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  there  is  no  doubt,  Justice  Scalia,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  ­­ in  the  Taylor  ­­ in  the  previous  Louisiana 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  opinions,  that  the  State  said  we  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntarily  adopting  Teague.  There  is  no  doubt  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  So  we  think  the  question  is  whether  that  raises 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  possibility  of  an  advisory  opinion  from  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  why  do  we  say  it  doesn't? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well,  because  in  cases  like  Coleman  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thompson  and  Eddings  v.  Oklahoma,  the  Court  said  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  law  holding  is  integral  to  the  State  court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposition  of  the  matter,  there  is  no  risk  of  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory  opinion.  And  later,  in  Coleman,  the  Court  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  if  resolution  of  the  Federal  issue  in  court  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  affect  the  judgment  is  it  at  risk  of  an  advisory

opinion. 

            

So  here  we  don't  think  there  is  a  risk  of  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory  opinion.  Of  course,  it  is  within  the  realm  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility.  We  doubt  that  it's  going  to  happen,  but  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  happen  that  on  remand  the  Louisiana  Supreme  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  say,  well,  we've  seen  what  you  think  about  Teague 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we're  going  to  adopt  our  own  retroactivity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards,  as  some  States  have  done.  They  could  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  The  question  is:  Does  that  make  this  Court's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  advisory?  And  we  think  not. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The  Solicitor  General  ­­ the  Assistant 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor  General  has  talked  about  cases  like  Standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Oil  v.  Johnson,  where  the  ­­ the  State  was  under  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  to  tether  its  State  law  to  Federal  standards, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  didn't  say  so,  though. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

In  ­­ in  ­­ in  Standard  Oil,  the  ­­ this  is  a  quote  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  opinion:  "The  relationship  between  Post  Exchanges; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  government  of  the  United  States  is  controlled  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law." 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Right.  That's  right.  My 

  

  

  

 

 

point,  Justice  Scalia,  is  that  the  ­­ the  tax  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  embedded  in  a  tax­exemption  statute.  The  tax

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  that  would  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

true  no  matter  what  the  State  did,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  no,  the  State  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  We're  deciding  a  question 

   

  

 

 

of  Federal  law  that  ­­ that  would  have  applied  on  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own. 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well  ­­ well,  no  ­­ well,  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  Standard  Oil,  I  think  the  ­­ my  point  is,  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  State  didn't  have  to  make  its  tax­exemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status  turn  on  a  Federal  question.  It  did,  and  so  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  had  jurisdiction  to  resolve  it.  That's  all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  don't  you  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  made  its  tax­exemption  law  turn  on  Federal  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  are  Federal  constitutional  requirements  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  area?  Could  the  ­­ could  the  State  have  taxed  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  there  was  the  question  of  whether  or  not  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Supremacy  Clause  would  permit  the  State  to  tax  sales 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Post  Exchanges. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  I  think  that's  possible,  but 

    

 

 

 

 

this  Court  didn't  make  its  jurisdiction  dependent  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And  so  take  a  case  like  Ohio  v.  Reiner  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  it  did.  In  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

provision  I  just  quoted,  it  said  that  the  relationship 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  Post  Exchanges  and  the  government  of  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  is  controlled  by  Federal  law.  That's  what  our

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  so  take  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Assistant  Solicitor  General  brought  up  the  case  of  Ohio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v.  Reiner,  where  a  State  made  its  transactional  immunity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  turn  on  the  validity  of  a  Fifth  Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

privilege.  This  Court  ­­ this  Court  addressed  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

embedded  and  discrete  Federal  issue  with  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  Mr.  Duncan,  isn't  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

quite  similar  when  Justice  Scalia  used  this  "controlled" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language?  The  Louisiana  Supreme  Court  has  used  similar 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language.  It's  dictated  by  Teague.  Now,  it's  only 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

dictated  by  Teague  because  they've  chosen  to  make  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dictated  by  Teague,  but  once  that  choice  has  been  made, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  outcomes  are  dictated  by  Teague.  It's  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue. 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  we  think  ­­ we  agree  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  We  think  it's  binding  ­­ quote/unquote,  "binding" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  meaning  of  binding  Federal  law,  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  has  chosen  to  do  it  and  it's  never  shown  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  do  it.  You  know,  so  ­­ we  ­­ we  think  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Look,  if  the  Court  disagrees  with  us  on  that,  we  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  a  position  ­­

   

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  in  Ohio  v.  Reiner, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  you  just  cited,  was  there  any  other  way  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  could  have  obtained  review  of  the  State

supreme  court's  erroneous  determination  that  the  witness 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  question  there  did  not  have  a  Fifth  Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

privilege  because  she  said  that  she  didn't  commit  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime? 

            

this  ­­

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  I  don't  think  so,  because 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  do  you  think  that's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  distinction  between  that  case  and  this  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  if  ­­ if  ­­ if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Teague  ­­ if  the  Teague  standard  is  a  discrete  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  that  the  State  has  made  ­­ has  ­­ has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated,  then  the  only  way  ­­ well,  the  Louisiana 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  could  ­­ the  defendant  could  go  to  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas,  sure,  and  you  could  get  an  interpretation  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way. 

            

But  it  doesn't  seem  to  us  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  Federal  habeas  and  review  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  supreme  court  decision  makes  any  difference  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  this  Court's  jurisdiction.  It  might  mean 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  Court  would  wait,  you  know,  for  a  ­­ for  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know,  a  more  robust  split  to  develop  and  take  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  case  that  way. 

 

 

 

            

But  in  this  case  ­­ and  this  ­­ this  goes  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  second  reason  why  we  haven't  strongly  contested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  at  all  ­­ because  there  is  a  robust  split

on  this  direct  ­­ on  this  specific  issue  that  extends  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  like  21  State  and  Federal  courts,  they're  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  the  same  Federal  issue,  so  it  seems  to  us  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  practical  matter,  this  Court  ought  to  weigh  in. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  going  to  weigh  in  sooner  or  later.  It's  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weigh  in  either  on  a  Federal  habeas  case  or  from  a  State 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  we  weigh  in  when  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  jurisdiction.  You  don't  think  that  matters  at  all? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  No,  of  course  jurisdiction 

  

 

 

 

 

matters,  Justice  Scalia.  We  just  ­­ of  course  it  does. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  so  what  you  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  make  much  sense. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  I  think  it  makes  sense. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Let's  get  in  there  quickly, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether  we  have  jurisdiction  or  not.  You're  not  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  are  you? 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  no,  we're  not  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that.  We're  not  saying  that.  We're  saying  if  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  issue  is  genuinely  interwoven  with  State  law  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  independent  State  grounds,  then  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  jurisdiction  to  decide  the  question.  Otherwise, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  going  to  have  to  wait  for  a  Federal  habeas  case.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  We  clearly  have 

  

 

 

 

jurisdiction,  don't  we?  Why  ­­ I'm  just  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure  this  out  in  my  mind. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  have  jurisdiction  where  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  ­­ that's  the  defendant  ­­ and  the  defendant  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court's  decision  ­­ that's  your  court's  decision  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  contrary  to  the  Constitution  or  statute  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States.  That's  just  what  they  say. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  That  answers  the  question  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  we  have  jurisdiction  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer  the  question. 

 

 

            

Now,  the  question  is:  How  do  we  dispose  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Exactly. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ in  which  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction?  And  in  three  instances,  I  guess,  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court  has  done,  in  disposing  of  such  a  case,  what  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor  General  says;  namely,  they  have  said,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ we  are  not  going  to  say  whether  he's  right  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  it's  contrary  to  the  Constitution.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  might  be  an  adequate  State  ground;  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  not  be.  Their  adequate  State  ground  was  one  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  ­­ was  elucidated  or  explained  as  being  ­­ flowing

And  so  whereas  ­­ whereas  Atkins  ­­ I  mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Atkins  creates  a  binding  constitutional  right.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

question  of  remedy,  though.  The  question  is:  Is  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  constitutionally  bound  to  offer  that  remedy?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  recognized,  in  cases  like  Pennsylvania  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finley,  for  example,  that  States  have  wide  discretion  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structuring  their  post­conviction. 

 

 

            

And  the  ­­ the  next  point,  though,  has  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  finality. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  has  to  do  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different,  because  as  Justice  Breyer  pointed  out,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  wide  discretion  to  structure  it  as  you  want,  but  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  structured  it  in  a  way  that  you're  going  to  say,  I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offering  due  process,  isn't  there  a  check,  a  substantive 

   

   

 

 

 

 

check  by  due  process  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ that  you  have  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

offer  the  minimum?

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  I  mean,  that  is  ­­ that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  question.  So  this  Court  has  found  that  there's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  check  on  due  process  in  Griffith,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  talking  about  direct  review. 

 

 

 

 

            

When  we're  talking  about  collateral 

 

 

 

 

review  ­­ I  mean,  our  view,  although  we  haven't  taken  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  on  it,  collateral  review  is  a  different  animal

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  we  have  any  number 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  cases  where  States  have  viewed  the  exceptions  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlling  the  fact  that  they  have  to  offer  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  minimum. 

 

            

that. 

            

            

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  But  this  Court  has  never  held

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  really  the

MR.  DUNCAN:  It  ­­ it  ­­ it  is  a  serious

position  on  that  question  because  we  feel  that  this  case

In  Miller,  this  ­­ on  to  the  merits:  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miller,  this  Court  was  invited  to  categorically  bar  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  of  life  without  parole  for  juveniles  who  commit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

murder,  but  it  decided  not  to  do  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that  decision  leads  directly  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion,  in  our  view,  that  Miller  is  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  rule  under  Teague's  first  exception. 

 

 

 

 

 

Consideration  of  the  Teague  framework,  Teague  policies, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Teague  precedent  points  instead  to  the  conclusion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Miller  is  a  procedural  and  not  a  substantive  rule. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  think  Summerlin  most  helpfully  sets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  the  framework  that  ought  to  govern  this  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Duncan  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  DUNCAN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ can  I  give  you  just  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical?  I  mean  ­­

    

 

            

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ suppose  that  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  and  it  has  a  ­­ a  mandatory  minimum  for  a  theft. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

It  says  the  mandatory  minimum  for  theft  is  20  years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  suppose  a  court  looks  at  that  and  says, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know  what?  That's  incredibly  disproportionate  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  theft,  and  so  strikes  the  mandatory  minimum. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Says,  you  just  can't  have  a  mandatory  minimum  like  that; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  it  lower.

Would  that  be  a  substantive  ruling? 

   

 

 

 

MR.  DUNCAN:  We  don't  think  so,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan,  because  the  mandatory  aspect  of  it  goes  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manner  of  imposing  a  penalty. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It  does  not  go  to  the  manner 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  imposing.  It  says  nothing  about  the  manner  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposing. 

            

What  it  does  is  it  just  increases  the  range 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  sentencing  possibilities.  It  actually  leaves  it  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ to  the  courts.  It  says  absolutely  nothing  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  factors  ought  to  be  taken  into  account.  Nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  that  at  all. 

 

 

 

            

All  it  says  is,  you  can't  have  a  mandatory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum  of  20  years  for  theft;  make  it  lower. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  so  in  ­­ in  ­­ if  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  that  doesn't  go  to  the  manner  of  imposing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  penalty,  then  it's  different  than  Miller,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miller  made  very  clear  that  the  mandatory  aspect  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  goes  to  the  manner  of  imposing  the  penalty  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  ­­ not  something  substantive. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  if  you're  saying,  no, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  different  because  there  was  something  else  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miller  ­­ there  is  something  else  in  Miller.  There  is  a

component  of  Miller,  no  question  about  it,  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  says  what  courts  are  supposed  to  look  at  is  ­­ are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  characteristics  of  youth  and  are  supposed  to  try  to

you  ­­ you  really  are  looking  at  an  incorrigible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant. 

            

So  there  is  that  process  component.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  process  component  does  not  take  away  the  fact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  completely  separate,  self­sufficient 

   

 

 

 

component  as  to  what  the  range  of  punishment  has  to  be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  completely  on  all  fours  with  the  hypothetical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  gave  you. 

   

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  your  ­­ Justice  Kagan, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  relevant  difference  in  terms  of  the  Teague 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  is  that  this  Court  in  Miller  did  not  take  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment  of  life  without  parole,  the  distinct  category 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  punishment  of  life  without  parole,  off  the  table. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  Court  has  never  held  that  a  noncategorical  rule  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  under  Teague. 

 

 

            

And  it's  done  that  for  good  reasons: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  that  would  fly  in  the  face  of  the  policies  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inform  the  Teague  analysis. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  you're  exactly  right. 

  

 

 

 

 

It  did  not  take  the  LWOP  punishment  off  the  table.  But

similarly,  in  my  hypothetical,  a  20­year  sentence  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

theft  has  not  been  taken  off  the  table. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  the  Court  has  done  is  to  say,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  be  other  options.  There  has  to  be  an  option  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ten  years  or  five  years  or  two  years,  whatever  it  is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  they've  expanded  the  range  of 

 

 

 

 

 

possibilities.  They've  just  made  the  sentence 

  

 

 

 

 

different,  because  a  sentence  is  defined  both  by  its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

upper  end  and  by  its  lower  end. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  I  ­­

    

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  so  they've  made  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  different. 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  I  understand  that.  But  making 

    

  

 

 

 

the  sentence  different  doesn't  necessarily  mean  make  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  under  the  Teague  framework. 

 

 

 

 

            

Here's  another  way  of  looking  at  it.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  in  a  ­­ a  juvenile  murderer  who  committed  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

who  committed  murder  and  is  serving  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

life­without­parole  sentence  today,  pre­Miller,  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

facing  a  punishment  that  the  law  cannot  impose  on  him. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  we  know  that  from  Miller  because  Miller  said  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  decision  does  not  preclude  that  punishment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  that  goes  to  finality.  The  finality 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  underlying  convictions  do  not  yield  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  still  has  the  power  to  impose  that  punishment.

Finality  interests  yield  ­­ Justice  Harlan  explained  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mackey  and  this  Court  adopted  in  Teague,  finality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  yield  only  where  the  State  lacks  the  power. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  where  the  finality  interests  crumble,  so  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speak,  because  the  State  no  longer  can  impose  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category  of  penalty. 

 

 

            

So  that  would  go  for  Roper.  It  would  go  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Graham.  It  would  go  for  Justice  Breyer's  sedition  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witch  crimes.  If  ­­ if  ­­ if  somebody's  in  jail  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  accused  of  being  a  witch,  then  the  State  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  finality  interest  in  keeping  that  person  in  jail. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  by  the  same  token,  if  ­­ if  ­­ if  the  punishment  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

death  for  a  juvenile,  the  State  has  no  finality  interest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  doing  that. 

 

 

            

So  leaving  the  punishment  on  the  table  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crucial.  If  he  doesn't  take  it  off,  it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive. 

            

The  second  policy  reason  for  Teague  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoiding  the  adverse  consequences  of  retrial.  And  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  Miller  is  even  more  clearly  not  substantive  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  standard,  because  categorical  rules  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactively,  Justice  Harlan  explained,  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  carry  the  adverse  consequences  of  retrial.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  make  you  go  back  and  redo  the  trial  and  unearth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

old  facts  and  ­­ and  drain  State  resources  and  come  up

with  distorted  ­­ distorted  retrials. 

 

 

 

 

            

Miller,  by  its  nature,  envisions  a 

 

 

 

 

 

fact­intensive  hearing  that  considers  multiple 

 

 

 

 

characteristics  at  the  time  of  the  crime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you  don't  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

distorted  new  trial  if  you  just  grant  a  parole  hearing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  That's  right.  That  ­­ that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

right.  But  that's,  of  course,  not  what  Miller  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require.  That's  what  Graham  would  require,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy,  because  Graham  is  obviously  a  categorical  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  says  you  can  no  longer  impose  that  punishment,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  give  them  a  parole  hearing  or  some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningful  way  of  release. 

 

 

 

            

Miller  is  about  the  step  before  whether  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  a  parole  hearing,  whether  the  person  can  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  for  parole  at  the  outset.  That's  the  inquiry 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we're  talking  about  in  Miller,  and  that's  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  a  parole  hearing. 

   

 

 

            

The  fact  of  the  matter  is,  though,  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying  Miller  retroactively  inevitably  turns  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Miller  ­­ the  retroactive  Miller  hearing  into  a  parole

that's  retroactive  has  two  parts.  I  think  we  were 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

unanimous  on  this  point. 

 

 

 

            

 

The  two  parts  were:  Is  it  implicit  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

concept  of  ordered  liberty?  And  here  it  would  seem  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be,  because  it's  applicable  to  the  States.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  is:  Is  it  central  to  an  accurate  determination 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  life  without  parole  is  a  legally  appropriate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

punishment?  And  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  rule  that  a  mandatory 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  exist  is  central  to  making  that  ­­ that  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  point  of  the  Miller  opinion. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  that's  the  correct  analysis  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

watershed  rule,  procedural  rule  that's  retroactive  ­­ if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  right  about  that,  why  doesn't  it  fit  within  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category? 

            

the  point. 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  let's  take  the  first  one, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  just  implicit  in  the  concept  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordered  liberty.  The  way  that  the  ­­ the  watershed  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  stated,  the  first  ­­ the  first  prong  of  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  has  to  alter  our  understanding  of  bedrock  procedural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements  necessary  to  fundamental  fairness.  And  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  a  strange  case  to  find  that  in,  because  Miller 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  doesn't  represent  a  bedrock  revolution  in

sentencing  practices.  It  takes  a  sentencing  practice 

   

  

 

 

 

from  another  area  and  puts  it  in  this  new  area.  So  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  incremental  change  in  that  sense.  It's  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholesale  discovery  of  a  new  bedrock  procedural  element, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  we  had  in  ­­ in  a  case  like  Gideon  v. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wainwright. 

            

So  ­­ and  ­­ and  I  think  this  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained  in  Whorton  v.  Bockting  that  it's  not  enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  rule  be  fundamental  in  some  ­­ in  some  abstract 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  ­­ right?  ­­ but  it  has  to  itself  represent  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  in  bedrock  procedural  understandings.  And  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  Miller  does  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

We  also  don't  think  it's  necessary  to  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accurate  determination  of  a  sentence.  It  would  enhance 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  accuracy  of  the  sentence,  but  it's  not  necessary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  other  point  there  is  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  hold  that  a  ­­ held  that  a  pure  sentencing  rule 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  qualify  under  watershed,  because,  after  all,  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  on  many  occasions  said  that  a  watershed  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  necessary  to  the  accurate  determination  of  guilt  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocence,  and  here  we're  talking  about  a  sentence. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  ­­ we  agree  with  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  watershed  procedural  analysis  is  not  the  way  to  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  but  it  does  raise  an  interesting  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  Summerlin  ­­ because,  after  all,  we  do  ­­

we  do  part  company  quite  strongly  from  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  ­­ when  the  United  States  says  we  need  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome­expanding  alteration  to  the  definition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  rules  under  Teague.  We  say  that's  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  a  slight  tweak  to  Teague.  What  that  is  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  in  the  understanding  of  what  a  substantive  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is. 

            

Substantive  rules  under  Teague  analysis  have 

 

 

 

 

 

never  depended  on  the  frequency  with  which  new  outcomes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  ­­ might  come  about  under  the  new  procedures.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  in  Summerlin  ­­ and  this  goes  back  to  my  original 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  about  the  framework.  Summerlin  explained  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  defendant  under  a  procedural  rule  does  have  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity  of  getting  a  more  lenient  outcome  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  procedures.  So  ­­ and  nonetheless,  Summerlin  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  such  procedural  rules  are  not  applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactively. 

            

And  so,  as  ­­ Justice  Alito,  as  you  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  the  difference  between  a  substantive  and  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  rule  under  Teague  is  not  whether  it's  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely  or  very,  very  likely  to  result  in  a  new  outcome. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  about  whether  the  new  rule  categorically  removes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  power  of  the  State  to  impose  a  category  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment.  That's  what  a  ­­ that's  what  a  categorical 

   

   

  

 

 

 

rule  does.  That  is  not  what  Miller  does,  right?

Miller  may  express  an  expectation  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  that  Miller  hearings  will  come  out.  And  that  may  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  not  come  ­­ come  to  pass  in  the  future.  Who  knows, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  We  can  point  to  cases  where  criminal  defendants 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  had  Miller  hearings  and  have  still  received  life 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  parole,  and  I  can  point  to  several  in  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  State  of  Louisiana  under  its  new  Miller 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures,  but  the  point  being  is  that  the  idea  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changing  outcomes,  which  is  what  the  United  States' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire  argument  depends  on,  is  built  into  the  procedural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  of  Teague  and  not  the  substantive  side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The  substantive  side  is  about  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Duncan,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

think  not.  I  think  by  your  own  definition  this  fits  on 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  substantive  side. 

 

 

            

You  said  you  ­­ you  categorically  remove  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  outcome.  And  ­­ and  ­­ and  that's  exactly  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Miller  does.  If  you  ­­ as  long  as  you  understand  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence,  which  I  think  you  agreed  with,  as  defined  both 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  its  upper  end  and  by  its  lower  end,  effectively  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  said  in  Miller  was  that  that  sentence,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  mandatory  LWOP  sentence,  cannot  control  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juveniles.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  ­­ that  increases  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  DUNCAN:  Right. 

  

 

Miller  ­­ Miller  quite  clearly  said,  as  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  Justice  Kagan,  that  it  does  not  categorically  bar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  penalty,  but  ­­ and  ­­ and  so  ­­ and  what  did  it  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  that  penalty?  It's  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It  allows  something  within 

  

 

 

 

 

the  range,  but  it  has  ­­ it  has  completely  changed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

range  that's  ­­ that  is  ­­ that  is  given  for  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juvenile  defendant. 

 

            

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  we  think  that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  range  is  important. 

  

 

 

 

 

It's  not  just  the  top  end.  This  is  what  we  said  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alleyne,  that  you  can't  think  about  a  sentence  without 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking  about  both  parts  of  the  sentence,  both  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maximum  and  the  minimum.  And  when  you  decide  whether  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  change  in  that  sentence  has  been  made,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  both  the  maximum  and  the  minimum. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  I  ­­ look,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

hope  this  is  responsive.  I  mean,  I  think  after  Miller 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

we  would  see  two  categories  of  punishment  on  the  table. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  would  see  a  life­without­parole  category  and  a

life­with­parole,  for  example. 

 

 

            

But  my  point  is,  is  that  Miller  doesn't  ban 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  category,  and  that  is  determinative  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  something  is  a  substantive  rule  or  not. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I'm  ­­ I  would  ­­ I  would 

   

   

  

 

 

 

not  describe  changing  the  range  of  sentences  available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  changing  the  sentence. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  It  ­­ it  puts  an  element  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

table,  I  think,  is  the  most  you  could  say.

MR.  DUNCAN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ necessarily. 

  

 

 

MR.  DUNCAN:  Right.

floor  of  a  sentencing  range  from  the  penalty  affixed  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  crime.  And  similarly,  we  said  criminal  statutes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  long  specified  both  the  floor  and  ceiling  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  ranges,  which  is  evidence  that  both  define

MR.  DUNCAN:  Probably  ­­ probably  not,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Honor.  But  the  ­­ the  question  ­­ that  ­­ that,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  is  a  pre­Teague  case.  It  raises  the  question: 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Is  Woodson  substantive  or  procedural  under  Teague?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  argument  is  it's  a  procedural  rule. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why? 

  

 

MR.  DUNCAN:  It's  a  procedural  rule  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  just  said  you 

  

 

 

 

 

couldn't  have  mandatory  death  penalties,  just  like  here: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  can't  have  mandatory  life  without  parole. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  But  it  required  an

MR.  DUNCAN:  It  ­­ it  would  put  new  ­­

they  could  have  still  given  death. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  They  certainly  could  have,  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  is  whether  it's  substantive  or  procedural

under  the  Teague  rubric,  which,  of  course,  it  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre­Teague  case.  And  I  think  the  most  we  can  say  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  it's  not  substantive  under  Teague  for  the  reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we've  said. 

 

 

            

Now,  raise  the  question:  Is  it  a  watershed 

   

  

 

 

 

 

procedural  rule?  Perhaps  that's  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  But  that's  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

language  ­­ "bedrock"  is  ­­ I  don't  think  is  the  right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language,  because  that  was  the  language  he  referred  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  sentence  in  Mackey,  correct?  I've  just  been 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

looking  it  up. 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  ­­ but  then  in  Teague  itself, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  O'Connor  tries  to  get  the  right  words,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  she  ends  up  with  here  is  that  the  procedural  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  test,  the  first  part,  is  ­­ can  be  addressed  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limiting  the  scope  of  the  second  exception  ­­ that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

watershed  rule  ­­ to  those  new  procedures  without  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  likelihood  of  an  accurate  conviction  is  seriously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminished.  Okay. 

  

            

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  That's  the  first  one. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  that's  joined  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice,  Justice  Scalia,  and  the  fourth  I  can't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

remember. 

            

But  ­­ so  is  it  seriously  diminished?  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  read  through  Miller.  It's  pretty  hard  to  say  ­­ I

mean,  my  goodness,  Miller  is  just  filled  with  paragraph 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  paragraph  about  how  a  mandatory  requirement  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

life  without  parole  fails  to  take  account  of  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics  or  many  characteristics  adherent  in 

 

 

 

 

 

youth. 

            

And  it's  pretty  hard  to  come  away  from  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  thinking,  gee,  accuracy  under  a  mandatory  life 

   

 

 

 

 

 

without  parole  does  seriously  diminish  the  accuracy  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposing  life  without  parole  when  you  apply  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  to  a  youth. 

   

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  But  in  ­­ every  Eighth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  sentencing  rule  goes  to  accuracy  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  no.  But  you  have  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

say  the  accuracy  is  seriously  diminished.  And  she  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  I  don't  think  there  will  be  too  many  such  cases. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  again,  take  a  ­­ we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

haven't  talked  about  the  capital  sentencing  cases,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  a  case  like  O'Dell,  where  the  capital  jury  was  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informed  of  the  defendant's  parole  and  eligibility  while 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering  his  future  dangerousness.  I  mean,  one  could 

    

 

 

 

 

 

easily  say  that  the  accuracy  of  the  resulting  death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  under  the  old  rule  was  seriously  diminished, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  yet  this  Court  said  in  O'Dell  that  that  is  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

watershed  procedural  rule.  And  you  can  go  down  the  line

with  all  those  cases,  the  Beard  case  and  the  Sawyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  Those  are  cases  in  which  the  defendant  could  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  well,  seriously  ­­ seriously  diminished  accuracy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  yet  the  Court  found  no  watershed  rule.  And,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  the  bedrock  is  what  the  word  that  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  in  referring  to  that  exception,  particularly  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whorton  v.  Bockting. 

 

 

            

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Is  there  any  watershed 

  

 

 

procedural  rule  other  than  Gideon? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  this  Court  has  said  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ it's  doubtful  that  any  will  emerge.  And  so  we  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  is  an  implausible  case  for  a  new  watershed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  to  emerge,  since  this  rule  ­­ and  back  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bedrock  point  ­­ is  not  a  creating  a  ­­ it's  not  ­­ it's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  revolution  in  bedrock  understanding  of  procedure. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

It's  ­­ it's  an  incremental  step  in  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

juveniles.  So  if  a  case  ­­ if  a  case  like  Crawford  is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  a  watershed  procedural  rule,  then  it's  difficult  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  how  this  one  would  be. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  We  have  one  brief  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

tells  us  that  this  Court  has  never  barred  punishment  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cruel  and  unusual  under  the  Eighth  Amendment,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refused  to  make  the  decision  retroactive.

MR.  DUNCAN:  ­­ disagree  with  that.  There 

  

  

 

 

 

 

are  cases  ­­ take  the  ­­ take  the  case  that  refused  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  retroactive  the  rule  in  Caldwell  v.  Mississippi. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  an  Eighth  Amendment  case  that  goes  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accuracy  of  a  capital  jury  sentence  in  determination  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

death.  And  this  Court  didn't  make  that  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactive,  and  found  that  it  was  procedural  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­watershed  at  the  same  time.  So  we  take  issue  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

Just  a  few  more  words  about  the 

   

 

 

 

 

United  States'  proposed  expansion  of  Teague.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ it  would  shift  the  whole  focus  of  what  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  rule  is  from  the  categorical  nature  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  to  the  effects  of  the  rule.  And  so  that  ­­ if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  defendant  in  these  capital  sentencing  cases  we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  been  talking  about,  O'Dell  and  Sawyer  and  Beard, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  now  have  the  argument  handed  to  them  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  new  rule  that  says,  well,  that  new  rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave  me  the  opportunity  for  a  better  outcome.  I  might 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

have  not  gotten  the  death  penalty  if  my  jury  had  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly  instructed. 

 

            

We  don't  understand  how  the  United  States' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  rule  in  this  case  can  be  cabined  only  to  where  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  sentence  is  taken  off  the  table.

yourself  cabined  it  when  you  said  that  the  difference  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  ­­ there  is  some  category  of  cases  which  do  refer  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process,  to  how  a  decisionmaker  makes  a  particular 

   

   

 

 

 

result,  and  another  category  of  cases  which  refer  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we've  called  substance,  which  is:  What  results  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  table?  What  category  of  punishment  is  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

table?  And  that's  the  difference  between  this  and  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  kinds  of  things  that  you're  mentioning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  I  ­­

   

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  This  is  not  about  the  how  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  it's  partly  about  the  how,  but  there's  also  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  punishments  are  on  the  table. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DUNCAN:  Well,  I  just  have  to  ­­ just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  push  back  on  the  premise  a  little  bit,  where  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  ­­ our  position  is  not  that  a  substantive  rule  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  punishments  are  on  the  table.  A  substantive 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  is  about  whether  a  State  categorically  no  longer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  the  power  to  impose  a  category  of  punishment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here,  it's  clear  from  the  Miller  opinion  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  Grayer  ­­ from  the  Graham  opinion  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  category  is  life  without  parole.  The  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  has  the  ability  to  impose  that  punishment.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  ­­ that's  a  sharp  distinction  from  what  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  rule  is.  And  the  United  States'  new 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conception  of  what  a  substantive  rule  is  would  blur

that.  It  would  blur  that,  and  it  would  call  into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  all  of  the  capital  sentencing  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  heard  a  question  ­­ I  don't  remember 

   

   

   

 

 

which  Justice  asked  it  ­­ about  Booker.  And  my  reaction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  that  is  ­­ but  Booker  as  a  matter  of  the  Sixth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  made  a  sentencing  guideline  non­mandatory,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

it  surely  opened  up  new  sentencing  outcomes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  by  ­­ by  what  reason  could  a  ­­ could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  Federal  habeas  petitioner  now  not  say  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States'  new  test  Booker  is  now  retroactive,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alleyne,  for  that  matter?  Alleyne  overturned  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  minimum  under  the  Sixth  Amendment,  opening  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new  sentencing  outcomes.  Why  couldn't  a  Federal 

   

  

 

 

 

defendant  on  Federal  habeas  say,  now  I  ought  to  get  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  of  that  rule  retroactively? 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  position  is  those  cases  ­­ Booker, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alleyne,  Apprendi  ­­ are  clearly  procedural,  as  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  explained  in  ­­ in  Summerlin  ­­ Schriro  v.

those  categories.

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  RICHARD  D.  BERNSTEIN 

 

 

 

 

 

     

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  COURT­APPOINTED  AMICUS  CURIAE 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BERNSTEIN:  What  this  fantastic 

  

 

 

 

discussion  has  shown  is  why  the  Court,  as  it  always  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  past,  should  keep  the  Teague  exceptions  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  equitable  discretion,  rather  than  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement. 

            

The  Court  has  much  more  freedom,  generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speaking,  on  the  matter  of  equitable  discretion  than  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  on  constitutional  requirements.  There  is  no  way  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  prior  precedents  of  the  Court  in  Teague  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  of  those  courts  to  say,  oh,  here's  what  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  discretion  is.  The  only  time  you  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

retroactivity  is  when  the  Constitution  requires  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  would  have  been  a  really  short  opinion.  And  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  that. 

 

 

            

Now,  to  turn  quickly  to  the  cases  that  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  cited:  The  critical  difference  between  this  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  one  hand  and  Merrell  Dow  and  Three  Affiliated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribes  on  the  other  hand  is  that  jurisdiction  under  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  is  question  by  question  under  Murdock. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  Merrell  Dow,  the  question  of  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's  conduct  had  violated  the  Federal  drug 

 

 

 

 

 

 

labeling  laws  was  a  Federal  question.  The  Court  never 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  gone  on  to  say,  and  we're  also  going  to

Federalize  the  remedy.  We're  going  to  decide  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  lost  profits  or  out­of­pocket  costs. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Similarly,  in  Three  Affiliated  Tribes,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

was  no  question  that  there  was  a  Federal  statute  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  State  court  jurisdiction.  The  only  issue  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  scope  of  that  statute. 

 

 

 

 

            

Here  we  have  the  opposite.  There  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  the  Federal  statute  does  not  apply  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  court,  and  yet  people  say  you  should  decide  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope  question,  even  though  the  underlying  issue  may  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  State  law. 

 

 

 

            

And  then,  finally,  to  the  Solicitor 

 

 

 

 

 

General's  new  cake­and­eat­it­too  argument  that  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  review  in  this  Court  and  de  novo  review  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas:  The  statutory  language  in  2254(d)  is  pretty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

broad.  Quote:  "Any  claim  that  was  adjudicated  on  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits  in  State  court  proceeding." 

 

 

 

 

            

The  only  claim  in  this  case  is  remedy.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  was  filed  after  Miller  was  decided.  The  only  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case  is  redress.  And  it  would  be  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wonderful  turn  if  you  could  say  on  the  one  hand  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2254(d)  doesn't  apply,  but  on  the  other  hand,  1257 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  when  it  ­­ when  it  requires  a,  quote,  "right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claimed  under  Federal  law,"  which  gets  to  your  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan.

Is  it  enough  that  a  State  court  says,  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntarily  want  to  be  bound?  And  the  best  answer  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  not  only  in  the  cases  I  would  recommend  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Moore,  which  is  cited  in  Merrell  Dow,  which  goes  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  way  to  show  how  Federal  law  is  binding  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intrastate  commerce  conduct  in  that  case  before  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  could  review  it  ­­ but  it's  also  plain  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  of  the  Supremacy  Clause.  Binding  Federal  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  binding  in  all  50  States,  and  that's  why  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  also  says  "right  under  Federal  law." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you. 

 

            

            

remaining. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

And,  Mr.  Plaisance,  you  have  three  minutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  PLAISANCE:  Your  Honors,  I'd  like  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

make  two  quick  points. 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  in  jurisdiction:  Resolving 

  

 

 

 

 

this  case  under  Teague  avoids  the  serious  constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  whether  due  process  requires  retroactivity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  Miller. 

 

              

A  second  point  on  the  merits:  Miller  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  juvenile  homicide  offenders  should  not  have  to  die 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  prison  with  no  chance  for  rehabilitation  and  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration  of  youth.  That  important  rule  changed  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  outcomes  available.  Indeed,  this  Court  said

that  life  without  prison  should  be  uncommon. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  individuals  sentenced  before  Miller  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

that  remains  about  1,500  ­­ deserve  a  chance  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

redemption. 

            

Thank  you. 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Bernstein,  the  Court  appointed  you  as  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus  curiae  to  brief  and  argue  this  case  against  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  jurisdiction.  You  have  ably  discharged  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

responsibility,  for  which  the  Court  is  grateful. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon,  at  11:18  a.m.,  the  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
