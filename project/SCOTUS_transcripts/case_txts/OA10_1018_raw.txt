 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 (11:03 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

1
2
3
4  next this morning in Case 10-1018, Filarsky v. Delia.
5
6
7
8
9  please the Court:
10
11  retained by the government to work in coordination with 
12  or under the direct supervision of government employees 
13  in fulfilling the government's business, in getting the 
14  government's work done, that attorney is entitled to the 
same immunity that a government employee performing that 
15
16  same function for that same government would receive. 
17  In this case, that is qualified immunity.  That rule 
18  comports with the history and policy concerns that have 
19  animated this Court's section 1983 and immunity 
20
21
22  Ms. Millett, the rule you just stated?  Is there any 
23  situation in which a private attorney engaged to assist 
24  a government office in the performance of a public 
25

function would lack qualified immunity?  Or is it simply 

jurisprudence. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's across the board, 

3
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MS. MILLETT:  I think it -- it may well be 

the latter rule, the more broader one, but for these 

public service -- for example, if a State government 

1  wherever a government agency employs a private attorney 
2  to assist it in doing its work, that attorney will have 
3  qualified immunity? 
4
5
6  purposes, the Court only needs to decide the situation 
7  when they are working in coordination with or under 
8  direct supervision of government employees.  And I want 
9  to clarify that answer because how one defines doing a 
10
11  appoints somebody to represent one of their police 
12  officers who's sued in a 1983 action, if there's five 
13  defendants, the attorney general can't represent them 
14  all; they will all commonly appoint people and will pay 
them -- some States will pay them from the -- from the 
15
16  State fisc. 
17
 And so, they'll be paid by the government to 
18  perform a governmental function in that sense, but their 
19  allegiance there is to the individual employee, not to 
20
21
22  someone can be retained by the government in that sense, 
23  paid by the government in that sense. 
24
25

the government.  The same with public defenders. 

 So, there are certain situations where 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why does it matter whether 

the privately retained attorney works in close

the case come out differently then? 

1  cooperation with government employees?  Suppose in this 
2  case Mr. Filarsky had simply been hired to go off and 
3  perform this investigation and, at the end of the 
4  investigation, report the results to the town?  Would 
5
6
 MS. MILLETT:  I don't think that would, but 
7  in this -- but I think it depends on what one means by 
8  coordination with or supervision.  And with respect to 
9  attorneys, attorneys can never be an independent 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
 And that's why the whole -- the whole reason 
18  we should have this rule is understanding what immunity 
19  protects.  It protects government decisionmaking, 
20
21  an area -- in an area of reasoned decisionmaking. 
22
23  argue that there is a built-in limitation because the 
24  question doesn't even come up unless there's state 
25

contractor in relationship to their client in the way 
the prison was in Richardson.  Attorneys just can't be. 
They are always, in the sense of the rule that I'm using 
it, working for their client agency, their client 
government, and under its control and authority.  And 
the decisions they make are the decisions of that 
client. 

action.  So, there has to be close enough cooperation so 

governmental conduct, and its ability to maneuver with 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I -- I suppose you can 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MS. MILLETT:  Right, because, certainly, the 

there the question just wouldn't even come up; am I 

1  there's state action.  I had never thought that when a 
2  private attorney gives an opinion letter to a government 
3  agency or government entity at its request that there's 
4  any state action there at all.  So, that question -- so, 
5
6  correct?  I assume --
7
8  state action limitation both limits the operation of 
9  this rule.  There's many times attorneys or others who 
work with the government will not implicate the state 
10
11 
action rule.  And that's sort of the irony of -- of this 
case, and I think it would not be uncommon in attorney 
12 
13 
cases.  The only reason this was a tort, or an alleged 
tort, is because the government was involved, because 
14 
governmental actors took his advice, conducted a 
15
search -- he didn't -- issued an order -- he didn't. 
16 
17 
And yet we have -- we're left in this is odd world where 
the only way this tort, constitutional tort lawsuit, can 
18 
go forward is without the government.
19 
20
21  conduct, but this Court's immunity jurisprudence says we 
22  don't over-deter and we want to allow the government to 
23  operate within a realm of reasoned decisionmaking.  And 
24  they need to operate within that realm, get reasoned 
25

 Now, 1983 is about deterring governmental 

advice and make reasoned decisions, regardless of 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 The need is for reasoned decisionmaking. 

1  whether the source of the advice is a temporarily or 
2  permanently retained attorney. 
3
4  And if you over-deter, which is what an action against 
the private attorney who is now charged with litigating 
5
6  and defending the government's allegedly 
7  unconstitutional conduct, standing all alone while all 
8  the government actors have walked away -- that turns 
9  section 1983 on its head.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But your test -- and 
10
11  this is -- I think goes broader than the articulation of 
12  the test -- doesn't give this private attorney much 
13  assurance by itself.  It's sort of a multifactor, is he 
14  coordinating, is he under the supervision, is he really 
doing public service?  I mean, if the idea is to give 
15
16  him sufficient breathing room so he doesn't stop, and 
17  when, as in this case, he's threatened that we're going 
18  to sue you if you do this, he has to think, well, now, 
19  am I being supervised by the government?  Am I 
20
21  them what -- it -- the test itself undermines the 
22  asserted purpose. 
23
24  First of all, the State law requirement -- the state 
25

action requirement that Justice Kennedy referred to will 

coordinating with the government?  Or I -- am I telling 

 MS. MILLETT:  Well, two responses to that.

 But the second reason is, as I said, with 

1  up front require allegations by the plaintiffs that will 
2  discuss the coordinated -- presumably the coordinated 
3  action.  There's going to have to be some level of 
4  coordination.
5
6  respect to attorneys, I don't think this is going to be 
7  a hard question because they are forever agents and 
8  fiduciaries.  They can never be the independent 
9  contractor that you had in Richardson.  They are always 
answerable to and working for their governmental client. 
10
11 
And when I say "supervision" here, I don't think the 
test here is -- is an on-hands, day-to-day looking over 
12 
13 
your shoulders.  The government has to be able to get 
the advice of professionals and to trust them --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose -- suppose the 
government hires an attorney to do an independent 
investigation; it hires an outside attorney precisely 
because it does not want to be faced with allegations 
that it has manipulated the outcome of the investigation 
because its own conduct is at issue.  So, they say 
you're going to be independent, hands-off; we're not 
going to interfere at all.  But that would still in your 
-- in your submission satisfy the coordination 
requirement?

 MS. MILLETT:  It -- it would in this sense, 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company

for the government and on behalf of the government. 
 And it's not usually because we say the 

they're working for the government.  The government is 
their client.  They are not freewheeling independent 
contractors.  And --

1  because there would be -- and I'm assuming here we're 
2  not talking like a Bivens appointment or something like 
3  that.  But here -- because understand what happens in 
4  that situation.  They're being appointed to investigate 
5
6
7  government writ large may have done something that would 
8  create a conflict.  It may be an individual employee or 
9  something.  That's where the conflict comes.  But 
10
11 
12 
13
 JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the difference 
14  between that and the prison situation?  The private 
prison -- the guard in the private prison is performing 
15
16  a function that has been delegated to that or assumed by 
17  that entity pursuant to a contract.  I don't understand 
18  exactly what the difference is. 
19
20
21  difference.  The practical difference is that, in 
22  Richardson, it was a quite unique situation where the 
23  government really had washed its hands of the prison 
24  operation.  It had put the day-to-day operation of the 
prison, the decisionmaking of the prison, how we treat 
25

 MS. MILLETT:  The difference is -- there's a 

practical difference and then a legal doctrinal

 So, the decisions that were being made there 

a control.  It did not exercise the day-to-day 

1  the prisoners, entirely in the hands of a private 
2  contractor, subject only to what this Court said was 
3  very limited supervision, essentially in contract terms. 
4  But it had ceded that authority, and it did not exercise 
5
6  decisionmaking.  And that's where we get into the 
7  doctrinal point. 
8
9  and that there were -- the lawsuit concerned, there 
wasn't a single governmental defendant named in that 
10
11 
case.  It was just the private -- the private guards 
that were at issue there.  And the decisions that were 
12 
13 
made were the private company's decisions. 
14
15
16  is to protect what?  The government's decisionmaking, 
17  the special concerns that arise when you are bringing 
18  lawsuits that are designed to regulate, limit, deter 
19  governmental decisionmaking.  We have to protect that 
20

 So, that sort of puts your argument on its 

 MS. MILLETT:  I'm sorry? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It seems to me that 

1
2
3  there's enough evidence that the lawyer was the one who 
4  held the investigation; the people who attended the 
meeting between the lawyer, the Respondent, and the 
5
6  other personnel that were there were acceding to what he 
7  was doing.  The chief -- he goes to the chief and he 
8  says:  I want you to do this.  And the chief is relying 
9  on him, not his own independent judgment, to issue the 
10
11
12  head because it appears that he was more the independent 
13  investigator --
14
15

18  couple of responses.  First of all, no, that's nothing 
19  like Richardson.  This was the government's 
20
21  to the team for his expertise, much like prosecutors 
22  might bring on a psychologist to evaluate a criminal 
23  defendant.  Now, are the prosecutors going to sit there 
24  and say, you know, Psychologist, you should ask this 
question?  Or are they going to defer to the medical

4  that he's serving just like any other government lawyer. 
If you were going to fit this case under the Richardson 
5
6  majority test, how would you do it? 
7
8  all, I keep -- I'm putting it right in -- in 
9  Richardson's language, which said it was reserving this 
10
11 
12 
13

15
16  situation.  This -- there's no turnkey here.  This is 
17  Mr. Filarsky being brought on to the team.

21  administration is disinterested in this prosecution and

 MS. MILLETT:  No.  And that's --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  He's not working in 
3  close coordination.  He's not subject to supervision. 
4  The whole purpose of an independent counsel is to 
5
6
 MS. MILLETT:  Yes, but independent counsel 
7  is still sued in the name of the United States.  Their 
8  client was the United States Government.  That is 
9  whom -- that is the interest in which they worked.  They 
were -- they had a client that they were answerable to. 
10
11 
They were not freewheeling independent contractors; they 
12 
were attorneys with a client.

10
11
 MS. MILLETT:  Well, this Court's already 
12  crossed that bridge in cases like Wyatt, where, for 
13  example -- and it does because the State law requirement 
14  can sweep broadly in some situations.
 So, I don't think in a situation like 
15
16  Wyatt v. Cole, where you have private plaintiffs 
17  pursuing their private agenda and they simply invoke a 
18  State law, that that makes them integrated with the 
19  government in the way that an attorney is, and certainly 
the way Petitioner was here, that they're not part of 
20
21  the governmental team, and they're not making -- they 
22  weren't making decisions in the interest of the 
23  government.  There was no governmental decisionmaking to 
24  protect there, and that's what -- the rationale this 
Court gave for denying qualified immunity in Wyatt. 
25

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 The key here is that this is -- you cannot 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Lawyers are not 

intimidated in the situation we had here. 

1
2  protect governmental decisionmaking in this context 
3  without protecting the source of advice for that 
4  decisionmaking.
5
6  supposed to be cowed by the exigencies of the situation. 
7  We're worried in qualified immunity with protecting 
8  governmental actors, to make sure they will feel 
9  comfortable doing the right thing rather than being 
10
11
 Lawyers have that professional obligation in 
12  the first place.  So, why does a lawyer need the -- the 
13  defense of qualified immunity? 
14
First of all, that rationale would mean no government 
15
16  lawyers get the protection either, because they have 
17  that exact same obligation of fealty, and we don't apply 
18  that rule.  That hasn't even been questioned.  And the 
19  reason we don't is we understand that this is a more --
20
21
22  subconscious pressures that would come with full-freight 
23  liability for governmental conduct to any angry third 
24  party even subconsciously interfering with the decisions 
25

of government lawyers temporarily or permanently 

 MS. MILLETT:  There are a couple of reasons. 

it's a more layered inquiry into timidity. 

 First of all, we don't even want the 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company

full-time staff, and the cost of getting an attorney is 
all those things that qualified immunity wanted to 
protect against. 

1  retained. 
2
 Secondly, we want the government to be able 
3  to get the advice, to be encouraged to get the advice. 
4  Section 1983 must support governments getting legal 
advice to counsel them in complying with the law that 
5
6  section 1983 enforces, but government will be deterred 
7  from obtaining legal advice if the cost of getting an 
8  attorney -- especially if you're a small town, 
9  municipality, county, you don't -- can't afford a 
10
11 
12 
13
 Our decision -- reasonable decisionmaking 
14  that we thought was protected by qualified immunity is 
15
16  a jury is going to assess liability for a reasonable 
17  governmental decision. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Millett, our cases have 
18
19  said that we're supposed to look not only to policy but 
also to history.  Would you disagree with the premise 
20
21  that a person in your client's position historically 
22  would have had at most an actual malice -- a malice 
23  defense or a reasonable cause defense?  Would a person 
24  have anything more than that?
25

now on trial.  And we have to be there as witnesses, and 

 MS. MILLETT:  They would have had the same 

16

 MS. MILLETT:  It -- it -- the Harlow 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, in Wyatt, we said that 

that was a very different kind of immunity than the 

1  sort of good-faith defense that this Court in Harlow 
2  turned into qualified immunity, both as lawyers 
3  working --
4
5
6  Harlow immunity, and we said historically it provided no 
7  basis for giving Harlow immunity. 
8
9  immunity came from the same roots.  Well, the -- what 
happened in Wyatt was we said we will turn that into 
10
11 
protection for the government when we need to protect 
the special functioning of government.  You had no 
12

need -- the Court had no need to do that in Wyatt 
because there was no governmental decisionmaking at 
14 
stake there.

 MS. MILLETT:  Not this case at all, because 

where -- where attorneys were provided a reasonable and

gets turned into qualified immunity when needed to 
protect government's reasoned decisionmaking.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, if they don't 

1  and may it please the Court: 
2
 Petitioner may assert qualified immunity on 
3  the same terms as the fire department officials because 
4  he was working side-by-side with them and under their 
supervision on a personnel investigation.  And this is 
5
6  really exactly the situation that the Court reserved and 
7  anticipated in Richardson, that when you have a 
8  situation where private and government workers work 
9  closely together and you deny qualified immunity to the 
private person, it would directly affect the ability of 
10
11 
the government employees to do their jobs. 
12
13  work closely together at all and it's just this one 
14  fellow conducting the investigation, he wouldn't have 
15
16
17  which there's a very close working relationship --

19  he --

1  our position that when people are doing the business of 
2  government, private people, can be sued under section 
3  1983 or Bivens, there should be a presumption in favor 
4  of qualified immunity.
 And Richardson is not to the contrary 
5
6  because that is a fairly unique case in which the 
7  private prison was so removed from the day-to-day 
8  workings of government officials that it would not have 
9  furthered the purposes of qualified immunity to give 
qualified immunity to the folks in those situations. 
10
 So, what we're talking about, like --
11
12
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's just hard to imagine 
13  anything more imbued with state action than imprisoning 
14  someone.  That's -- that's the problem I have in 
15
16
 MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  I mean, several 
17  members of the Court said that in Richardson.  And 
18  the -- the Court's opinion really talked about the 
19  uniqueness of the situation there, that Tennessee was 
20
21  giving the day-to-day decisionmaking to the folks in 
22  that situation in the private prison, and only checking 
23  up.  There was monitoring, you know, annually.  It was 
24  really not much ongoing monitoring at all.

doing something really out on the forefront in terms of 

thinking about the case.

important in the context there, where you don't have 
individuals who are working closely with government. 
 The Court needed -- and the purposes of

2  distinguished the situation that you have here, where 
3  you have people --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Wasn't Richardson really all 
about how market forces would make immunity unnecessary? 
5
6  And how is it that market forces play any different role 
7  in this case than they do in Richardson? 
8

18  be willing to take on the business of government and 
19  would be able to do it, you know, consistent with the

21
 So, we don't understand the Court to have

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think market forces 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  We do think that there's a 
difference in that the attorney in this situation has 

1  well, there's a market for the person, couldn't someone 
2  else fill those shoes, et cetera, et cetera.  So, we 
3  think the Court's market forces decision was -- was 
4  fairly confined to what the Court itself described as a

7  do operate differently here, or is it basically the same 
8  thing? 
9
10
11  private clients that that attorney can work for, whereas 
12  the private prison company really could only work for 
13  the government.  But --
14
15
16  said its dominant business was giving advice to local 
17  government, local municipal government units.  So --
 MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  I mean, that was an 
18
19  important part of the firm's business, but Mr. Filarsky 
20
21  broad training and expertise in employment-related 
22  matters.  So, there's certainly other work that could be 
23  done.  But, you know, we thought the core of the Court's 
24  decision in Richardson was really focusing on the 
25

purposes of qualified immunity and whether they would be

12  employee of a private company but not for somebody who's 
13  an employee of the government? 
14
didn't mean to suggest that we thought that the market 
15
16  forces inquiry was particularly relevant to the -- to 
17  answering the qualified immunity question.  I'm just 
18  explaining that the way we read the Court's opinion in 
19  Richardson, which obviously the members of this Court 
are the experts on, is that the Court was looking to 
20
21  market forces to reassure itself after it determined 
22  that the purposes of qualified immunity just wouldn't be 
23  served by giving an organization that was so far removed 
24  from the day-to-day workings of government the

protection of qualified immunity.  The Court just -- the 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Wyatt and in Richardson, which is, is it necessary to 

his own fiduciary obligations, it is certainly the case 
that when he was threatened during the conduct of this 
personnel investigation, that that is something that 
potentially could chill his behavior. 

1  market forces really was just something unique to that 
2  case. 
3
4  what the Court started with both in the decision in 
5
6  give qualified immunity here to make sure there's 
7  principled and fearless government decisionmaking?  It's 
8  the business of government that's important.  And in 
9  this case, although Petitioner is an attorney who has

11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  affects the ability of government to do their job.  And 
17  I might give the Court --
18
19  breach of his duty as an attorney.
 MS. SAHARSKY:  I'm saying --
20
21
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And he would be subject 
22  to malpractice in that case.  You -- seriously, I find 
23  this whole argument about market forces with respect to 
24  attorneys representing people odd because there's a

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I'm saying that an attorney 

Court has extended qualified immunity to government 
attorneys who are in this position, either giving legal 
advice, like in the Burns case, or serving as 
prosecutors.  And there's just no difference when he's 
operating in this case that would make him 
distinguishable from a government attorney. 

1  take on any government service they can. 
2
 So, going back to the -- that's -- what I 
3  consider the central argument you're making, which is: 
4  Will it chill advice?  And I'm not sure how it can, 
given the independent fiduciary duty that an attorney 
5
6  has to zealously guard his or her client's interest. 
7
8  is in a difficult position there, and it's the same 
9  position that a government attorney would be in, and the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  your question, the Court talked about, in terms of 
18  deterrence and chilling, making sure that there were 
19  talented candidates who wanted to take on the position 
of government.  So, the Court has never said, you know, 
20
21  we're concerned about wiping out the market entirely. 
22  It said, you know, if there is a segment of the market 
23  that will not take on this business anymore, that's a 
24  fairly serious problem when we need to make sure that 
25

 To answer another suggestion, I think, in 

the government of -- of business is done.

 And if I can just make -- give the Court 

 You want him to make fearless decisions 

1
2  another example to, perhaps outside the context of this 
3  case, see how a private person being denied qualified 
4  immunity would affect government employees, consider a 
fire department that has some full-time fire department 
5
6  personnel and also some volunteer firefighters.  When 
7  they're working together in fighting a fire, you don't 
8  want the volunteer firefighter thinking:  Should I break 
9  down this door?  I might face personal liability.
10
11  because whether he breaks down the door or not is going 
12  to directly affect the ability of the other folks who 
13  are trying to go into those homes, trying to stop the 
14  fire, to do their jobs.
15
16  court security.  The United States Marshals Service 
17  sometimes uses private security guards, and we have 
18  direct supervision and control over them, but --
19
20
21  mean, the town, whatever, contracts, out-sources, 
22  whatever, but it's just run by volunteers.  Is your 
23  answer the same?

it's a 100 percent purely volunteer fire department?  I

 MS. SAHARSKY:  It's just difficult in the

1  employees.  And your argument seems a little derivative. 
2  You're saying the whole point is to protect the 
3  government employees, and you have to have qualified 
4  immunity for the non-employee to do that.  But does your 
5
6  around? 
7
8  fire department situation, even if there is an 
9  all-volunteer force, that there wouldn't be some type of 
direct supervision by the mayor, by the city council, et 
10
11 
cetera.  You know, that's -- particularly in the local 
government situation, those folks would tend to work 
12 
13 
fairly closely together. 
14
 It is, in the case of deterrence and wanting 
fearless decisionmaking, a primary concern that we have 
15
16  about protecting government.  But we need to protect the 
17  individuals to protect government.  So, we do need to 
18  make sure that their decisions aren't chilled, that 
19  persons like Petitioner are willing to take on 
representation of this kind.  And the Ninth Circuit's 
20
21  suggestion that no private person should be -- should 
22  get qualified immunity, even when they're doing the 
23  day-to-day business of government, is just one that 
24  can't be reconciled with this Court's decisions in Wyatt

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, the Ninth Circuit found 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's another part of 
1
2  qualified immunity, and I know it's not teed up in this 
3  case, but why is it reasoned decisionmaking to recognize 
4  you can't enter a home without a warrant, but you can 
tell the occupant to bring out every item you want to 
5
6  see?  It seems to me that that's not -- that there --
7  there's clearly established law to say that's wrong. 
8
9  that it wasn't clearly established law.  I understand 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  lines is that both the district court made a finding, on 
19  page 49 of the Joint Appendix, and then the court of 
appeals made a finding in its opinion, and this was the 
20
21  reason that the court of appeals found it wasn't clearly 
22  established, was because there was no attendant threat 
23  in terms of employment consequences to Respondent in 
24  this case.
25

that it's a fairly difficult Fourth Amendment question. 
But as you say, it wasn't teed up in this case.  It 
wasn't -- there wasn't a petition on this question.  It 
wasn't raised in the brief in opposition.  You know, in 
light of the fact that the Ninth Circuit found it wasn't 
clearly established, it probably wouldn't make sense for 
the Court to address it.

 MR. MCGILL:  No, I don't -- I don't think 
8  so.  Any time -- like in Mr. Filarsky's situation, Mr. 
9  Filarsky is a for-profit law firm.  You know, he sells 
himself as a -- as an experienced professional in the 
10
11 
field providing legal services to the city --
12
13  there are a lot of -- I think -- well, there are a lot 
14  of law firms.  I think all law firms other than public 
interest firms are for-profit firms, and the attorneys 
15
16  are part-time employees of municipalities and other 
17  government units to perform various functions, part-time 
18  judges, part-time prosecutors. 
19
20
21  are integral to the judicial process.  So, when you talk 
22  about a judge or a prosecutor, that's a -- that's a 
23  special function.  That's sort of a different situation.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What would have happened if 

 MR. MCGILL:  As a historical basis, there 

 MR. MCGILL:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  They did exactly the same 

thing, by the way; it was just that Lincoln had a better 
reputation.  Every word was the same. 

1  that immunity provides. 
2
3  Abraham Lincoln today were there?  And I gather what 
4  happened is they thought the local prosecutor is good, 
but Lincoln is better.  So, we'll let Lincoln prosecute 
5
6  this case. 
7
 Now, in your view, Abraham Lincoln would not 
8  have had immunity, but the local prosecutor would have. 
9
10
11 
12 
13
14  does not appear to be immunity for private prosecutors. 
However, this Court over the years has provided immunity 
15
16  for the judicial --
17
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But in your -- I'm asking 
18  you, in your opinion, when I write this opinion, is I 
19  could say not even Abraham Lincoln, when he acted as a 
public prosecutor brought in for the occasion?  In your 
20
21  opinion, he should not have the immunity that Joe Jones, 
22  the local prosecutor, would have? 
23
24
25

 MR. MCGILL:  I --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm just trying to get your 

opinion. 

37

 MR. MCGILL:  I think that that's a much 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it because it's Abraham 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You should say section 1983 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But investigatory 

 MR. MCGILL:  What? 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to that one, right? 
 MR. MCGILL:  But I think it's a much closer 
call because he was engaged in a prosecutorial function, 

1
2  closer call --
3
4  Lincoln or --
5
6  didn't exist.  That's your answer --
7
8
9
10
11  which this Court over the years --
12
13  functions -- they don't get immunity.  So, if Lincoln 
14  had looked into it and said, you know, I've looked into 
this; I don't think we should prosecute.  And what they 
15
16  said was use your judgment. 
17
 MR. MCGILL:  No. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So, there are 
18
19  problems with both standards both ways.  This is one of 
20
 MR. MCGILL:  Right. 
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Imagine in this case the 
22
23  lawyer sat down with the other firemen, the supervisor 
24  and so forth, and they said -- not necessarily this 
25

event; they said we want to do X.  And the lawyer said: 

the things that -- that is bothering me. 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, can a lawyer give that advice?  Yes. 

 So, what do we do about that?  The lawyer is 

1  I have to tell you, it's unclear whether X is 
2  constitutional or not.  Now, because it's unclear, I 
3  also have to tell you that if you do it, you will not be 
4  held personally liable.
5
6  When he does, of course, he's subjecting himself to 
7  personal liability.  Now, it's that conflict that is 
8  worrying me, among other things. 
9
being asked to give advice to the client.  Under the 
10
11  canons of ethics, he ought to have their interest at 
12  heart, and in doing that, he's subjecting himself to 
13  what could be hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars 
14  worth of damages or whatever in suits for malpractice. 
15
16  dilemma? 
17
18  necessarily an immunity question; it's more of a 
19  liability question because it very well may be that --
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

assuming in the question is, since it's a close 
question, he has to worry about a court saying:  You 
were wrong in saying it was legal.  It was not legal. 
The matter was unclear, but it was not legal.

Is there a way that we side with you out of that 

 MR. MCGILL:  I don't think that that's 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  What I'm 

 At that point, he becomes subject to much 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  damages.  But, of course, the others do not, and he had 
2  to tell them go ahead with it.  You understand my point. 
3
 MR. MCGILL:  I do. 
4
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So, what is the answer?
 MR. MCGILL:  But -- but I think what -- what 
5
6  it is -- the difference there is that there you have an 
7  attorney just providing advice, which is different than 
8  what happened here, where you actually had the attorney 
9  engaged --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  circumstances could be held liable for a constitutional 
violation for simply giving advice and he happens to be 
20
21  a private attorney working for profit, then he wouldn't 
22  have immunity. 
23
24  he puts them up to it.
25

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that may be, but what 
I'm trying to work out is what is your set of rules?  If 
we don't say -- if we don't say you have immunity, and 
you agree that this is a bad dilemma at least in my 
hypothetical case, I'm trying to work out what set of 
rules you advocate in order to either say, well, that's 
too bad, the dilemma is there, we can't get around it, 
or something else.  That's why I want your answer. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I change it slightly, and 

 MR. MCGILL:  If the attorney under those 

 MR. MCGILL:  Well --

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Because I don't know why he 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, you can finish 

1
2  couldn't.  I mean, you know, he says go do it.  Or, in 
3  other words, my hypothetical -- okay, go ahead. 
4
 MR. MCGILL:  I think the answer's the same. 
If somehow under those circumstances the attorney could 
5
6  be held liable for giving that advice, and he's -- he's 
7  a private attorney, and he doesn't pass the Richardson 
8  test, then he would not be entitled to immunity. 
9
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your case --
MR. MCGILL:  So, there's no -- there's no --
10
11 
12
13  your answer. 
14
is no historical basis of immunity just for giving legal 
15
16  advice.  The Petitioner hasn't pointed this Court to any 
17  firmly rooted tradition of an immunity. 
18
19  highlights -- I think is a very good example of why the 
lawyer ought to have qualified immunity.  I mean, this 
20
21  was a case where it looks like there's a lot of 
22  threatening and bullying going on.  I mean, the -- the 
23  lawyer says -- you know, we're going to figure out a way 
24  to name you, Mr. Filarsky.  You're issuing an illegal 
25

order.  If you want to take that chance go right ahead. 

I'm sorry. 

 MR. MCGILL:  There's certainly no -- there 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your case 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

developed.  We want Filarsky to give what he -- do what 

naturally, or some lawyer in that situation, is going to 
think, wow, do I really want to run that risk? 

1  You might want to think -- take a minute to think about 
2  it. 
 I mean, it seems exactly the kind of 
3
4  situation for which qualified immunity was -- was 
5
6  he thinks is the right thing in this situation.  We 
7  don't want him to be worried about the fact that he 
8  might be sued.  And you have a lawyer here saying, well, 
9  if you do that, I'm going to sue you.  So, Filarsky 
10
11 
12
13  immunity? 
14
that because Mr. Filarsky is a private individual, he 
15
16  doesn't need qualified immunity.  You know, Richardson 
17  is decided in 1997, but in 2003, the Ninth Circuit 
18  issued its decision in Gonzalez v. Spencer.  And in 
19  Gonzalez v. Spencer, the court held that private 
20
21  don't get immunity.  So, the law in the land since 
22  2003 --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's easy 
23
24  for a judge to say because they're absolutely immune, 
but for the lawyer who is sitting there and saying --
25

 Isn't that exactly why we have qualified 

 MR. MCGILL:  No.  And the reason for that is 

attorneys like Mr. Filarsky don't need immunity; they 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. MCGILL:  But, for nearly a decade, the 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 
 MR. MCGILL:  And that -- the fact that is, 

 (Laughter.) 
1
2
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- saying I'm going 
3  to sue you, if you were -- well, you are a lawyer.  And 
4  you're sitting in that situation.  Isn't that going to 
enter into your mind?  You say, well, sue all you want; 
5
6  I don't care; this is the right answer. 
7
8  law within the Ninth Circuit has been that private 
9  attorneys don't receive immunity.
10
11
12  is that Mr. Filarsky knew going into that -- that 
13  investigation that he wouldn't have immunity for 
14  anything he -- he did.  And it didn't deter him; it 
15
16
17  know? 
 MR. MCGILL:  Well, because he -- in the 
18
19  light of the threats that he received, he still went 
20
21  unconstitutional search.  So, the policy purposes of, 
22  you know, wanting to prevent unwarranted timidity and 
23  deterring talented candidates from working for the 
24  government --
25

forward with the -- what was deemed to be an 

didn't make him --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how do you 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, he had -- he

Official 

mean, I'm not quite sure that things went exactly as 

 MR. MCGILL:  Well, Mr. Filarsky said -- and 

issuing the order on behalf of the department.  That's 
what he said.  And then there was some -- some 
discussion back and forth between Mr. Delia's attorney 
and Mr. Filarsky, and that's what led to the 
formalization of -- of the order.

1  had the chief issue the order, right? 
 MR. MCGILL:  Well, the --
2
3
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then the chief 
4  later on says, well, he told me to issue the order.  I 
5
6  they would if you had qualified immunity. 
7
8  this is what he said on the record; it's in the 
9  transcripts in the Joint Appendix -- is that he's 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  there is a lot of bad, cowardly legal advice being given 
17  in the Ninth Circuit. 
18
19
20
21
22
23  cross-appeal on the clearly established law?  Because 
24  then -- then you could concede, so, arguendo, he had 
qualified immunity, but the advice that he gave was 
25

 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't really know that, 

but you don't know the opposite, either, do you? 

 MR. MCGILL:  I don't. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why didn't you 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I understand that 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. MCGILL:  So, why did the Petitioner --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why didn't you bring up 

that -- that issue? 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, but -- but whether it 

1  contrary to clearly established law. 
2
3  or the Respondent not cross-appeal? 
4
5
6
 MR. MCGILL:  I think it was -- that's sort 
7  of the law of the case, is that the Ninth Circuit found 
8  that there was a constitutional violation.  So, we 
9  obviously didn't want to appeal that.
10
11  was clearly established.  In other words, what we had 
12  here was a recognition:  We can't go into the house; we 
13  can't go into a house, private house, without a warrant. 
14  So -- in fact, Filarsky said something about I know a 
way -- a way to get around that; we just tell them to 
15
16  bring out the items. 
17
18  opinion and our position has been is that it -- the law 
19  was clearly established on that.  Why the decision was 
20
21  sure.  But --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you saying it's clearly 
22
23  established that there isn't a difference between going 
24  in and looking for the insulation, et cetera, and 
25

telling him to bring it out?  Is it clearly established 

made not to cross-appeal on that, I'm not -- I'm not 

 MR. MCGILL:  Right.  I -- my personal 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. MCGILL:  I -- I think it's pretty well 

known that the house is --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, 

1  that the -- that as a condition of employment in a 
2  situation like this, the employee cannot be required to 
3  submit to a search? 
4
5
6
7  particularly --
 MR. MCGILL:  -- is --
8
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, even as -- the 
9
reason it's an issue is because he says, look, I've got 
10
11  this stuff at my house.  That's how his -- his defense 
12  is.  I haven't used it; I've got the insulation there. 
13  So, you think it's still clearly established that it 
14  violates the Fourth Amendment for the city to say, okay, 
15
16  defense? 
17
18  certainly, Mr. Filarsky didn't have any reasonable 
19  suspicion to believe that Mr. Delia was lying or was 
being dishonest.  He certainly didn't have probable 
20
21  cause.  He had a hunch.  And then that's what he said, 
22  I -- I -- he said it as -- at the -- during the 
23  interview that I -- I don't necessarily know that you're 
24  lying; I just -- I want to see if you are.
25

well, show it to us if you want to use that as your 

 So, you know, the investigation turned from 

 MR. MCGILL:  Yes, I do because it -- it --

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. McGill, back to 

 I think that would be a different situation 

1  wanting to see whether Mr. Delia was off work on false 
2  pretenses into, well, I don't have anything there; so, 
3  let me just see if he's lying just for the sake of it. 
4  And that's when they ended up issuing that order.
5
6  if perhaps you could argue that they had a reasonable 
7  suspicion or had some cause to search his house, but 
8  here they didn't.  So, I think it is under those facts 
9  clearly established.
10
11  immunity, what -- one thing I don't understand about our 
12  law here, you say there was no historic basis.  And I 
13  have to concede that that's right.  Seems to me that 
14  there's -- there was only a malice defense.  But isn't 
that always true when it comes to a -- a private person? 
15
16  In other words, of course there's no historic basis for 
17  qualified immunity.  This kind of immunity was developed 
18  in 1970.  It's sort of by definition there's no historic 
19  basis for this sort of immunity.
 So, to say that the historic basis matters 
20
21  is really to say that private people never get Harlow 
22  immunity. 
23
24  right.  There was not qualified immunity at common law, 
but there was absolute immunity.  And in -- there -- I 
25

 MR. MCGILL:  Well, I think that that's 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But the Court's cases are a 

over and over that it's not going to create new 

absolute immunity in instances where there wasn't 
absolute immunity at common law; isn't that true? 

1  mean, I can't go back and think about all the different 
2  immunities that may or may not have existed, but I -- I 
3  do know that the Petitioner has the burden to bring 
4  forth a firmly rooted tradition.  This Court has said 
5
6  immunities. 
7
8  mix of history and -- and policy.  The Court has 
9  recognized both absolute immunity -- has recognized 
10
11 
12
 MR. MCGILL:  Right. 
13
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and the rule about 
14  malice being -- being the criterion of liability, that 
applied not just to -- not just to private lawyers but 
15
16  to government lawyers as well, didn't it? 
17
18  good-faith defense applied --
19
20
21  immunity to government lawyers or expand the government 
22  immunity to -- for government lawyers so they can do 
23  anything so long as it's not malicious? 
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, if we're going to be 

historically faithful, we should deny any qualified 

 MR. MCGILL:  It did.  That that -- that that 

 MR. MCGILL:  Well, that -- that's what this 

Court would have to do. 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 
 MR. MCGILL:  It would have to basically 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
 MR. MCGILL:  -- a defense. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, the devil with history, 

1
2
3  expand what was at common law --
4
5
6
7  right? 
8
9  Court having to expand that immunity that it expanded in 
Harlow to private individuals.  And our position is that 
10
11 
because a private individual like Mr. Filarsky is a 
market participant, the purposes of immunity aren't 
12 
13 
served.  They just simply aren't needed.  And I was 
mentioning earlier about --
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about -- what about 
the argument that Filarsky makes, that if there were to 
be a proceeding against him, inevitably the witnesses 
would be the government employees?  They would be the 
battalion chiefs, the fire chief.  So, one of the 
reasons for the qualified immunity is you don't want to 
disturb government employees in the routine performance 
of their work.  Certainly, in this case, there would be 
disruption, distraction of these government employees. 
 MR. MCGILL:  Well, there probably would be 

 MR. MCGILL:  Well, it would result in this 

some distraction.  That would be inevitable, but it 

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 So, even though the immunity may kick in and 

government employer itself can still be liable under 
Monell. 

1  would be no different than the distraction that the 
2  government would face when a private attorney is sued 
3  for any number of claims, malpractice or, you know, some 
4  State law violation.
5
6  the government is going to face based on just what is 
7  probably a small sliver of the big pie, which is, you 
8  know, 1983 litigation, is pretty speculative.  And, of 
9  course, it doesn't answer the question that the -- the 
10
11 
12
13  the individuals may get off or may not have to stand 
14  suit, it -- there are still occasions when the 
15
16  distraction is still going to exist. 
17
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if Filarsky was 
18  there, you know, hired to help the fire department with 
19  these -- and he did absolutely nothing?  He just sits 
there and watches.  The battalion chief says, I want to 
20
21  do this; I'm going to go get the stuff; you bring it all 
22  out.  And he just -- he just sits there, doesn't see any 
23  reason to offer any legal advice or opinion.  Could you 
24  still sue him under 1983?
25

government is still going to be there.  So, that 

Official 

 And to say that the -- the distraction that 

 MR. MCGILL:  Well, I don't think he would be 

50
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Really?  He has an 

something illegal is going on.  That's his job.  And he 

qualified immunity.  He would still be under the same 
Richardson test where there's no historical basis for 
it, and because he's the private individual working 
under -- you know, working for profit and subject to 
market pressures, he wouldn't --

1  liable, but I don't think under that situation, he would 
2  have participated in the --
3
4  obligation as a lawyer to speak up if he thinks 
5
6  doesn't -- he just sits there quietly? 
7
 MR. MCGILL:  No.  I don't know that -- that 
8  he would be liable under section 1983.  But if he were, 
9  and he were a private lawyer, he would not have 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if he -- this 
15
for profits -- I -- the significance of that eludes me. 
16 
Sometimes people act out of, you know, public service, 
17 
and particularly in these sorts of situations, the town 
18 
needs a lawyer, and he's helping out.  What -- if he 
19 
were purely a volunteer, it would be a different answer? 
20
21
 MR. MCGILL:  If he were purely a volunteer, 
22  it very well might be a different answer because some of 
23  those policy concerns that -- that Richardson talked 
24  about and discussed may not be present.  So, you have to 
25

apply the test to the situation you have before you. 

51
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And, well -- and 

50 percent his normal rate. 

1
2  what if he gives the city a discount?  He's working for 
3  half -- half his fee because it's the city.  He wants to 
4  help out, but he can't do it totally for free.  So, it's 
5
6
 MR. MCGILL:  I don't know that 50 percent 
7  makes a difference.  And earlier, we were discussing 
8  that -- the 1-year or the 2-year and so forth, the 
9  length of the contract.  I don't think that those things 
necessarily make a difference.  The point is whether Mr. 
10
11 
Filarsky was undertaking that representation or that 
role in a manner that made him subject to other regular 
12 
13 
market pressures. 
14
competing against other lawyers or other investigators 
15
16  performing that same function, then the point is there, 
17  you know, he isn't going to be as timid because he's 
18  going to want to do a good job.  And the same policy 
19  concerns that are present for that government lawyer 
20
21
22  were to -- or a State were to abolish all the civil 
23  service rules and all the special rules and go back to 
24  employment at will for government employees.  Would that 
-- would that take with it the whole qualified immunity 
25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose a municipality 

aren't there for him as a private individual. 

 If he was performing a function and 

52
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

would qualified immunity still be needed? 

1  regime? 
2
 MR. MCGILL:  I don't think that it would. 
3  In other words, is the question whether or not, if we 
4  abolished the merit system or civil service system, 
5
6
 I think if that were the question, that --
7  well, that's a tough question to answer.  But it very 
8  well may not be because, you know, part of the decision 
9  in Richardson here was -- it was -- they are operating 
within a different system.  Private versus public.  And 
10
11 
if you start to make the public system look more like a 
private system, then it very well may be that immunity 
12 
13 
won't be needed at all. 
14
15
16  pre-date the -- the institution of the civil service 
17  system.  Everybody is subject to market forces.  Every 
18  person who works is influenced by market forces to some 
19  degree; isn't that correct?
20
21  but when you have a civil service system, a merit 
22  system, it's -- it is not as easy to correct behavior as 
23  it would be for, say, a private person.  For, like, Mr. 
24  Filarsky, if he was not performing at -- at the level 
that the City of Rialto had hoped, he can be replaced 
25

immunities, at least some of the immunities, long 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It seems strange because the

 For a government employee, though, there are

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Most lawyers are not

part of the civil service system.  They're generally

 In addition, as I understand it, the test is 

in close coordination and supervision.  Those are highly 

into -- into full-blown litigation and discovery and so 
forth.  So, that -- that test is problematic. 

1  about the Petitioner's test a little bit, too, because 
2  the Court had some concerns about it.  And I share those 
3  same concerns, and that's that the test requires a 
4  factual analysis, you know, being temporarily retained

6  factual questions that aren't going to bode well for 
7  early resolution of a case.

13  going to be extended well beyond attorneys.  The test 
14  results in anybody working for the government under, you 
15
16  means, is going to get immunity.  So, that is well 
17  beyond attorneys, to anybody.  Anybody who contracts 
18  with the government and meets that factual test is now 
19  going to have immunity.
 And that's something -- that's a huge step 
20
21  that this Court, you know, should not take, especially 
22  when there is no historical basis for it and the policy

 Mr. Filarsky was not performing a function

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. MCGILL:  Thank you. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Ms. Millett, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

1
2
3

5
6
 MS. MILLETT:  Thank you. 
7
 Justice Breyer, your dilemma is -- sits at 
8  the crux of why qualified immunity is appropriate here 
9  because not only do you have the lawyer saying, well, 
you'll be all okay, but I'm going to be going down in 
10
11 
this lawsuit; the lawyer's going to have a duty to 
inform his client that, in fact, this will lead to 
12 
13 
litigation.  You will be protected in your personal 
capacity, but guess what, litigation is going to ensue.
14 
 That can influence and deter both lawyers' 
15
16  willingness to work for the government at these cut 
17  rates or pro bono rates, their -- subconsciously, the 
18  advice they give, and it can make the government not 
19  want to act on the advice, which is precisely what we

21
22  Richardson.  The government was nowhere on the scene 
23  when the constitutional decisions being challenged --
24  they weren't even percipient witnesses in that 
25

 Nothing like that was happening in

situation. 

60
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

you can't deny qualified immunity on that ground or 

completely different market from Richardson, where 
there's only one client for prisons, and that's the 
government. 

 The second point I want to make is fiduciary 
1
2  duty doesn't change it other than it confirms that he's 
3  working in the interest of the government, but every 
4  agent has a fiduciary duty to their principal.  And so, 
5
6  you'll have a sweeping decision on your hands. 
7
 The market concerns, Justice Sotomayor --
8  the test is not whether a warm body could be found to 
9  fulfill this operation if he won't do it.  This is a 
10
11 
12 
13
 Here, the government is competing for the 
14  services.  When it needs a skilled attorney, when it 
wants people of the caliber that the government service 
15
16  needs and deserves, it is competing.  And right now, as 
17  the Chief Justice recognized, a lot of times, including 
18  for Mr. Filarsky, that's done at discount rates. 
19
20
21  decisions, then you're going to push that weight.  And 
22  if the answer is, if you decide to take on this pro bono 
23  representation or cut your rates out of public duty and 
24  -- and a willingness to serve your government, guess 
25

what comes with it:  You alone will be left holding the
