 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about purchase?  What 

 MR. WELLS:  We do, Your Honor.  And --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How so? 
 MR. WELLS:  Justice Scalia, the reason 

federally inspected slaughterhouse, I think all the 
parties agree that it occurs on or after the receipt; 
so, it's part of the operational process. 

1
2  about -- what about the contract to purchase?  The 
3  California law addresses that.  Do you -- do you contend 
4  that that is pre-empted as well?
5
6
7
8  that -- the reason that we do is because, to the extent 
9  that purchase is -- is even relevant with respect to a 
10
11 
12 
13
14  it took place at an auction site apart from the 
15
16
17  because the scope of the FMIA starts at the gate of the 
18  slaughterhouse and ends with sale, California, I think, 
19  could regulate and not -- not have its regulation be 
20
21  before the purchase occurred. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or contract of purchase.  I 
22
23  mean, if the contract of purchase is made apart from the 
24  slaughterhouse itself, they could make it unlawful for 
the -- the person who raises the animals to sell them 
25

expressly pre-empted if it attempted to prevent purchase 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  What if it weren't?  What if 

slaughterhouse? 

 MR. WELLS:  Well, Justice Kagan, I --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
 MR. WELLS:  -- by Federal law.  There could 

 MR. WELLS:  So long as the -- so long as the 
contract -- so long as title didn't pass, Your Honor, or 

1  when they're nonambulatory and unlawful for the 
2  slaughterhouse to contract to buy them, right, so long 
3  as the contract is off the premises? 
4
5
6  the -- it didn't interfere with what happens on the 
7  premises from the gate through sale, then I believe that 
8  would not be expressly pre-empted by --
9
10
11  be implied pre-emption issues, however, in that 
12  circumstance --
13
14  position is if the contract for purchase is consummated 
15
16  your answer to Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia is that 
17  if the purchase contract occurs before the animals 
18  arrive at the gate of the slaughterhouse, that that 
19  would not be pre-empted?
20
21  Again, there may be implied pre-emption issues, but if 
22  the law -- I think, Your Honor, if the law is intended 
23  to target --
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, your whole 

argument is on express pre-emption. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, your -- your 

in some way on premises, that's pre-empted?  And so,

4  argument on implied.
5
6  argument before this Court.  That's correct. 
7
8  think the sale of the meat is expressly pre-empted.  The 
9  Solicitor General says it's a closer question on sale of 
the meat because the slaughterhouse processes -- the law 
10
11 
is involved only with the operations and -- of the 
premises and manner of slaughtering and has nothing to 
12 
13 
do with sales.  So, why is the sale of the meat 
pre-empted?
14 
15
16  practical step.  And the word "operations" as used in 
17  678, I think all the parties agree it encompasses all 
18  the practical steps of the slaughterhouse.  Sale clearly 
19  is the last practical step, to which all other practical 
steps are directed.  So, it is an operational step.  It 
20
21  would be news to the slaughterhouses that sales is not a 
22  part of their operations.  That's --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, how about there's a 
23
24  law that says you can't slaughter cats, dogs, or horses, 
25

or you can't sell cats, dogs, or horses for slaughter? 

 MR. WELLS:  Your Honor, sale is a -- it is a

 MR. WELLS:  It -- it would be.  Well, with

2  to be --
3
4
5
6
7  respect to cats and dogs, the answer would be no, 
8  because those are not amenable species that are subject 
9  to inspection at a federally inspected slaughterhouse. 
10
11
12  regulation to that effect? 
13
 MR. WELLS:  No -- yes.  Only amenable 
14  species can be slaughtered.  Amenable species are 
15
16  (w).  And cats and dogs are not amenable species.  So --
17
 JUSTICE ALITO:  And what's that definition? 
 MR. WELLS:  Well, the definition is -- it's 
18
19  kind of a roundabout definition, Your Honor.  Amenable 
species is -- mentions -- I mean, frankly, it mentions 
20
21  catfish and -- and other species, and then all of the 
22  animals which were amenable species prior to the 
23  amendment of the Act in 2005.  We set that forth in 
24  footnote 11 of our -- our brief, but it clearly includes 
25

defined at U.S.C. -- 21 U.S.C. section 601 subsection 

swine, and it includes -- it includes horses.  It

 MR. WELLS:  Yes, Your Honor.  I believe they

2
3  and -- and I forget what the other circuit was -- were 
4  incorrect in saying that the -- that the State could 
5
6
7  were incorrect, although I would say that, even under 
8  the rationale that the Fifth and Seventh Circuits used, 
9  their rationale would not save this State law.  And the 
reason that it wouldn't is, even if you were to decide 
10
11 
that those -- those cases were decided correctly, the 
rationale that the court used was we can interpret those 
12 
13 
States' laws in a way that the -- the laws never have to 
affect the operations of the slaughterhouse because we 
14 
can interpret those laws to keep the animals off the 
15
16 
slaughterhouse -- off premises. 
17
18  keep it off the premises.  That's not true with 
19  nonambulatory animals.  Nonambulatory animals present 
with the symptom of nonambulatory-ness on the premises 
20
21  or on the trucks that are waiting to arrive on the 
22  premises.  So, there is no way that this State law could 
23  be interpreted in a way not to operate on premises.

1  speaks to an issue like that?  This doesn't have 
2  anything -- whether or not horses should be slaughtered 
3  and sold and their meat should be sold doesn't have 
4  anything to do with food safety, does it?  And it 
doesn't have anything to do with humane treatment, 
5
6  assuming the same methods of slaughter are used? 
7
8  Honor.  It clearly has to do -- this issue clearly has 
9  to do with both of those issues.  As the State has

20
21  does that have to do with any of the purposes of the 
22  Federal Meat Inspection Act? 
 MR. WELLS:  Well, because Congress has made 
23
24  a different -- a different judgment, Justice Alito; and 
25

 MR. WELLS:  Well--
 JUSTICE ALITO:  That's based just on a 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I wasn't speaking of the 

California law.  I was speaking of the law that

what Congress has said is we have identified -- we,

 MR. WELLS:  That -- Congress -- correct. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, Lassie -- Lassie and 

 MR. WELLS:  Congress made a moral judgment 

1  Congress, have made a moral judgment that the following 
2  species are amenable and may be inspected on 
3  slaughterhouse premises.  And to the extent that the 
4  State is making a different moral judgment --
5
6  Congress excluded cats and dogs?

16  for slaughter and which ones aren't. 
17
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Young, you suggested 
18  that even if the Seventh Circuit was correct, there 
19  would still be a difference because of ease of 
20
21  keep the horse away from the slaughterhouse.  Would it 
22  be possible to say the same thing about nonambulatory 
23  swine?  And I guess my question is, do nonambulatory 
24  swine usually become nonambulatory in transit or at the 
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But Dobbin is all right. 
 MR. WELLS:  I believe that's right, Your 

Congress as to which animals are going to be amenable 

identification.  You can tell a horse is a horse and 

slaughterhouse, or could you identify such swine 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I guess the -- the 

1  earlier? 
2
 MR. WELLS:  They -- nonambulatory swine 
3  become nonambulatory -- may become nonambulatory in 
4  transit.  They may become nonambulatory on the 
slaughterhouse premises.  The only way that the 
5
6  slaughterhouse operator knows that an -- that an animal 
7  that has been transported has become nonambulatory, 
8  however, is when the truck is brought onto the premises, 
9  the gates are thrown open, and the animals are 
shepherded off, and one of them doesn't move. 
10
11
12  State could make it unlawful for a rancher or -- what 
13  are the people that ship the animals to you called? 
14  Could it --
15
16
17  make it unlawful for them to ship a nonambulatory swine, 
18  could they not? 
19
20
21  to slaughterhouses because, again, the scope with 
22  respect to slaughterhouses started at the slaughterhouse 
23  gate. 
24
25

 MR. WELLS:  Your Honor, Congress actually 
has enacted regulations that don't -- they don't apply 

MR. WELLS:  Could be a rancher or a farmer. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  A rancher or farmer could 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but as far as this 

statute is concerned, it would not preclude a State law 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

regulations that govern the transportation of dead, 

1  that forbids a -- a rancher to -- to ship a
 
2  nonambulatory swine, right?
 
3
4  Federal -- I should point out, there are Federal
 
5
6  dying, and diseased animals.  They don't apply to 
7  slaughterhouses.  They may apply in the situation that 
8  Your Honor is contemplating. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 
9
that your argument on sales would apply at the front end 
10
11  as well.  You say sales can't be regulated because it's 
12  really just a way to get to the regulation of what goes 
13  on at the slaughterhouse.  Wouldn't that concern also 
14  apply at the front end?
15
16  about sale is slightly different, and it's a little 
17  different than the argument that's being made by the 
18  Government.  Our argument with respect to sale is there 
19  are requirements specifically regulating sale.  That's 
20
21  essentially, meat may not be sold if it is adulterated, 
22  or, to put it another way, you may sell the meat if it's 
23  unadulterated.  So, that's a requirement.  It's within 
24  the scope of the FMIA.  It -- it goes directly to sales 
25

found in 21 U.S.C. section 610(c).  That says, 

 MR. WELLS:  Well, Your Honor, our argument 

Official 

 MR. WELLS:  That's correct.  There are
 

as an operation. 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

mean that you can sell meat so long as it's not been 
adulterated; right? 

 And it is different than and in addition to 
1
2  the State regulation because what the State -- the State 
3  adds another condition.  They say you may not sell the 
4  meat if it is from a nonambulatory animal, or, looked at 
the other way, you may sell the meat as long as it's not 
5
6  from a nonambulatory animal. 
7
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that -- isn't 
8  that logically not -- doesn't that logically not follow? 
9  You may not sell meat if it's been adulterated doesn't 
10
11 
12
13
14  not a grant.
15
16  there were -- I think that -- the Federal -- what the 
17  Federal Government has done is established a requirement 
18  for the sale of meat.  California has established 
19  another requirement for the sale of meat.
20
21  sale of meat is that it not be adulterated, that it pass 
22  through inspection, that it be stamped "USDA approved," 
23  all the conditions that happen at a slaughterhouse.  The 
24  State, though, has set forth a different condition, and 
that is you may not sell that meat unless it comes from 
25

 Under Federal law, one requirement for the 

 MR. WELLS:  Well, no.  I think --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One is a limitation, 

 MR. WELLS:  Well, I think, though, that

1  a nonambulatory animal --
2
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, isn't it the case that 
3  most nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory because 
4  of the method of transportation that's used?  Do you 
dispute the statistics in the brief of the non-State
 
5
6  Respondent that -- Respondents that, nationwide,
 
7  approximately 220,000 swine die during transport,
 
8  another 440,000 become nonambulatory during the
 
9  transportation process?

 MR. WELLS:  I don't -- Your Honor, the short 
10
11  answer is I don't know where those statistics come from, 
12  and to my knowledge they are not accurate.  But I don't 
13  have additional statistics to --
14
15
16  animals that are nonambulatory at the time when the trip 
17  begins, but that most of these nonambulatory animals 
18  become nonambulatory during the transportation process? 
19
20
21  present being nonambulatory when -- when the doors to 
22  the -- to the truck are opened.  I think that that's 
23  correct.  I think that the practice is not to ship 
24  nonambulatory animals if you know beforehand that they 
25

the reason -- that ranchers generally do not ship 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you dispute the fact that 

 MR. WELLS:  I think that is a fair 

assumption, Your Honor, with respect to pigs that 

are nonambulatory. 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. WELLS:  No.  It isn't the only 

horse or a pig, but you can't tell whether a pig can 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And you think it's difficult 
1
2  to identify which animals are nonambulatory?  That's the 
3  difference between horses -- between prohibiting the 
4  slaughter of horses, because you can tell whether it's a 
5
6  walk? 
7
8  difference, Your Honor.  Really, it -- the -- what I'm 
9  really saying is the -- the condition of being 
10

15
16 
17 
18 
19
20

nonambulatory presents on the slaughterhouse premises. 
And so, there is no way for a law to -- no way for us to 
say the California law can be interpreted in a way that 
will not tell a Federal slaughterhouse what to do and --
and how to do it with respect to nonambulatory animals. 
That's not true in the horse case.  In the horse case, 
you can say keep the horses out.  The -- the Federal 
slaughterhouse doesn't have to have anything to do with 
horses.  So --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Would it be possible --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me, if it's 

okay for California to say you can't sell a 
nonambulatory animal and that that applies to everyone 
off the slaughterhouse premises, is that -- that's 
basically your position.  So that if the purchase occurs 
on premises, then the person who's selling it, even if 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. WELLS:  If I understand your question, 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What a -- what a 

fascinating area of immunity.  Now what we're saying to 

1  it's not the slaughterhouse, can still sell it on the 
2  premises? 
3
4  Your Honor, if the -- if, let's say just for the 
shorthand, if title passes on the premises, if that's 
5
6  how it's understood in the industry and that's what it 
7  is, that would be pre-empted.  But if the law took 
8  effect --
9
10
11  auction houses and everyone else is don't pass title 
12  until you get to the slaughterhouse. 
13
14  mean, I think the -- the real question is what has the 
Federal Government said about nonambulatory animals in 
15
16  general, and are those amenable species and may they 
17  be -- may they be slaughtered and turned into food?  And 
18  the Federal regulations deal directly with that 
19  situation.  So, whether title passes before or after, if 
the animal is on the Federal premises, there are a whole 
20
21  series of Federal regulations that tell the 
22  slaughterhouse worker exactly what the worker is 
23  supposed to do with that animal. 
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Does that mean that a State 
could actually pass a law and create a facility, let's 

 MR. WELLS:  Well, Your Honor, it's just -- I

sure that those animals don't go on to the 

1  say, that says -- the law says the trucks have to stop 
2  at the State facility before it gets to the 
3  slaughterhouse, and at the State facility, we'll check 
4  to see whether there are nonambulatory animals and make 
5
6  slaughterhouse?  Would a State be within its rights to 
7  do that? 
 MR. WELLS:  Your Honor, the language of 
8
9  section 603(a) says that the inspection is to occur 
before they enter the slaughterhouse.  Now, that has 
10
11 
been interpreted by the Secretary to essentially mean 
12 
immediately before; so -- so, trucks in line. 
13
14  hypothetical, if the State had set up their own 
15
16  a federally inspected slaughterhouse, that currently 
17  would be within the scope of the FMIA, because that's 
18  how the Secretary has defined it.  The further upstream 
19  it goes, though, the -- the less likely it is to be

think, have gone to kind of the situations at the 

how it is to handle that animal. 

 But that is not any different, of course, 

 So, the Court's questions this morning, I

 The -- the question about whether -- the 

we're in.  And the question is, what is the 
slaughterhouse employee to do with that animal?  And the 
State law says, well, you can't buy it, you can't hold 
it, you can't receive it, you can't turn it into meat, 
and you have to immediately euthanize it.

1  margins, at the extreme.  So, let me try to -- try to 
2  address some of those questions. 
3
4  question about the purchase of the nonambulatory animal 
and the regulation, the regulation there, the first 
5
6  thing is, as a practical matter, I think you have to 
7  think about it in a concrete situation, which is that 
8  there is a nonambulatory animal that's on the 
9  slaughterhouse premises.  That's the hypothetical that 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  point, the animal has to be transported.  Does Federal 
17  law regulate for humane purposes the transportation of 
18  animals to slaughterhouses? 
19
regarding transportation.  The Federal Meat Inspection 
20
21  Act has not been interpreted by the Secretary to apply 
22  specifically to trucks that are in transit, although I 
23  should say that the Secretary has, for example, 
24  interpreted the FMIA -- and this is in part 309.1(b) --
to apply, at least to the extent of humane handling, to 
25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, before you get to that 

 MR. HORWICH:  There are Federal laws 

19

 And I think if there were a situation such 

where a State determined that it wanted to essentially 

1  pens at stockyards that are committed exclusively to a 
2  slaughterhouse. 
3
4  as I think, Justice Kagan, your hypothetical envisioned, 
5
6  assert an inspection jurisdiction over animals that were 
7  in transit to a slaughterhouse -- so, essentially 
8  between the pen and the slaughterhouse -- the Secretary 
9  might well recognize that -- that his authority needs to 
extend -- needs to extend to those, because the purpose 
10
11 
of the Act, after all, is to set a Federal inspection 
standard for animals to determine if they're suitable to 
12 
13 
be turned into meat.  And in your --
14
15
16  of animals to prevent inhumane treatment in transit, why 
17  should a State law that aims at that objective be 
18  pre-empted? 
19
20
21  of the FMIA in that regard, the State law with respect 
22  to the handling of the animals while they're in transit 
23  wouldn't be pre-empted.  But, of course, the injunction 
24  that I understand Petitioners to be seeking is not one 
that goes to State regulation of trucks but, rather, to 
25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if the Federal -- if 
Congress has not chosen to regulate the transportation

practical to do that? 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if the State could 

1  State regulation of animals that are on the 
2  slaughterhouse premises.  And the Secretary has made 
3  unmistakably clear that the scope of the FMIA is at 
4  least as large as the official slaughter establishment's 
5
6
7  inspect the trucks at a weigh station before they get to 
8  the slaughterhouse, why can't they do the same thing 
9  when they get to the slaughterhouse, where it's more 
10
11
 MR. HORWICH:  Well, accepting the premise of 
12  your hypothetical that the State could do the inspection 
13  on the truck --
14
15
16
17  accept that premise.  Even if I accept that premise, the 
18  question here is different because the Secretary has 
19  drawn a line that says the scope of the FMIA -- and 
20
21  That's in section 678.  The Secretary has made very 
22  clear that the scope of the FMIA extends to -- to all 
23  animals that are on the premises of the establishment. 
24  That's -- you can look at appendix --
25

that's -- the question is the scope of Federal law here. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, is there anything

 MR. HORWICH:  Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. 

1  saved to the State?  I mean, there is a savings clause. 
2  Once you get to the entrance to the slaughterhouse, is 
3  there any room for any State regulation? 
4
I mean, State laws of general applicability would, to 
5
6  the extent they don't in some particular application 
7  intrude into the scope of the FMIA, they would apply. 
 And I also want to be very clear, so that 
8
9  there's no mistaking the Government's position:  State 
prosecutions for animal cruelty are not pre-empted to 
10
11 
the extent they are prosecuting conduct that is unlawful 
under Federal law, because that is -- that is an example 
12 
13 
of a State that is not applying a different or an 
additional standard of conduct but simply adding --
14 
applying its own sanction for conduct that Federal law 
15
would similarly sanction.  So, there's absolutely room 
16 
17 
for State -- the application of State law on the 
premises of the slaughterhouse. 
18 
19
20
21  slaughterhouse to ensure that their coextensive laws are 
22  properly enforced?  And if that's so, are there problems 
23  of judgment, that a Federal inspector says, no, this is 
24  okay under Federal law, and the State official says, no, 
25

this is not okay under the State law, even though they

matter.  But let's assume for the sake of argument that 

1  say the same thing? 
2
 MR. HORWICH:  I'm -- I am not aware that in 
3  general State inspectors or other State officials would 
4  go to a federally inspected premises as a general 
5
6  they were, and then your question -- excuse me --
7  presents the question about these sort of differences in 
8  judgment that might be made.  The Federal regulations 
9  generally provide that the disposition made by 
veterinarians, by Federal veterinarians, is the 
10
11 
conclusive judgment of the Secretary as to the fitness 
of the animal for turning into meat.  And so, in that 
12 
13 
situation, the State official would not be able to reach 
a different judgment on that question.  And so, I -- so, 
14 
I think that would resolve any situation where State 
15
16 
officials were there. 
17
18  officials do inspections is the one that the Act itself 
19  envisions and that California has not taken the 
20

22  regulations and have their own inspectors there as long

 Of course, the situation where State

2  sections, the State law, and some of them have three
 
3  parts.  Suppose I thought, well, the word "buy" -- I
 
4  mean, "buy" might cover an awful lot of things that
 
5
6  they do.  Suppose I ended up thinking that, but I 
7  thought you were right about all the rest of it.  What

16  injunction; so, I think the Court could appropriately 
17  articulate its answer and its understanding of the 
18  different provisions, and that probably would then lead 
19  to the lower courts working out the particulars of the 
20
21
22  regard about what the injunction might or might not look 
23  like with respect to the buying provision, which is that 
24  I don't understand the State to have some free-floating 
interest in when title does or doesn't pass.  The State 
25

question is this case comes here on preliminary

7  two steps what the State clearly can't do in one step,

1  with some specific aspect of the injunction -- and I

21  the work would be to understand that -- that California

24  is that it wants to tell slaughterhouses:  Don't turn

3  answers your question --
4
about that.  We say, if I agree with you about that, 
5
6  there we are; you're supposed to pick up this animal 
7  which is on the slaughterhouse floor and kill it right 
8  away.  That seems to have to do with operations.  All 
9  the rest of these other 10 provisions are just 
variations on that theme, according to the Government, 
10

eventually they'll be turned into meat. 

1  legislative history of the Act, show that the scope of 
2  the Act is concerned with animals that are going to 
3  become meat. 
4
Smith?  I thought that under the Federal program some of 
5
6  these animals could become meat, that under the Federal 
7  program, you take a nonambulatory animal and you say, 
8  well, some of them might be condemned, but some of them 
9  are suspect, and if they're only suspect, it may be that 
10
11
 MS. SMITH:  That is correct.  But the entire 
12  purpose of the Act is to inspect and examine animals to 
13  determine whether or not their meat will be wholesome 
14  and unadulterated.
15
16  of the Act, at least as amended, also require humane 
17  treatment of the animals while they're being processed. 
18  That has nothing to do with whether the meat is any 
19  good.  It has to do with humane treatment of the 
20
21
22  animals deals with animals in the connection of 
23  slaughter or while being slaughtered.  And the animals 
24  that California is regulating, the nonambulatory animals 
25

that we're withdrawing from the process, will not be

 MS. SMITH:  Well, the language of the 

1  slaughtered, will not be turned into meat.  Even the --
2
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  I don't -- you mean 
3  the Federal requirements of humane treatment do not 
4  apply once the slaughterhouse decides that this animal 
5
6  slaughterhouse can do whatever it wants with the poor 
7  animal?  That can't be right.

18  that says that they will not be exposed to sharp --
19  sharp instruments that can injure them?  Does that apply 
20
21
 MS. SMITH:  It applies to -- well, 
22  specifically the provisions in the Federal Meat 
23  Inspection Act apply to the animals that are going to be 
24  turned into meat.  To the extent they apply to other 
animals or all animals as has been referenced, they 
25

U.S. condemned animals, for instance, say that U.S. 
condemned animals shall be killed and shall not be 
slaughtered and dressed in the same facility with 
animals that will be turned into meat.  So, even in the 
regulations there's a distinction between animals that 
will be slaughtered for meat and that will be edible and 
ones that are -- are condemned and will be killed. 

to only those that are going to be sold for meat? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about the provision 

30

provisions as well. 

 MS. SMITH:  It applies to the humane 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait, no.  But that 

Act amends, amends, the Act that does have a pre-emption 

 MS. SMITH:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, therefore, it seems to 

1  would be pursuant -- those provisions would be pursuant 
2  to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, which is -- does 
3  not have a pre-emption clause and does not --
4
5
6  clause. 
7
8
9  me the pre-emption clause applies to the humane 
10
11
12  provisions with animals -- with respect to the animals 
13  in connection with slaughter and that will be 
14  slaughtered, with respect to the Federal Meat Inspection 
Act.  Because the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act was 
15
16  not incorporated into the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 
17  it does not have an express pre-emption clause, and 
18  there's no language in the text of that Act, the Humane 
19  Methods Act, or in the legislative history showing that 
it was an attempt to federalize animal cruelty law, for 
20
21  instance.  So, the idea that --
22
23  mean, to the extent it's incorporated in that Act, it 
24  only applies to humane treatment by slaughterhouses, 
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just in slaughterhouses.  I 

right?

1
2  Federal Meat Inspection Act reference the Humane Methods 
3  Act and reference that that is to be applied when the 
4  animals are in the -- being processed in the connection 
with slaughter and being slaughtered.  So, again, it 
5
6  is -- it is limited to the animals that -- that are 
7  going to become meat under the Federal Meat Inspection 
8  Act. 
9
10
11  until after the Federal process of post-mortem 
12  inspection and all of that.  And your rules seem to 
13  prohibit that. 
14
15
16  required of animals that are going to be turned into 
17  meat, correct.  And our -- the California law does not 
18  touch on post-mortem inspection at all.  And only in the 
19  case -- excuse me.  And the -- as far as --
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

your -- your argument up to this point has been that 
this doesn't interfere with the Federal laws because the 
Federal laws are designed only to deal with meat that is 
for consumption.  And you say with your -- with respect 
to your animals, that's not what it is. 

 MS. SMITH:  Our rules -- well, the ante-

mortem inspection and post-mortem inspection are 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but I mean 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

the State law until you've violated it. 

 MS. SMITH:  No, because when an animal 

nonambulatory, the requirement would be to immediately 
euthanize the animal because it's not part of the meat 
supply system. 

 But here, as I understand the Petitioner's 
1
2  and the Government's position, it is that nonambulatory 
3  animals can be turned into meat for consumption.  So, 
4  you don't know whether it fits under the definition of 
5
6
7  becomes nonambulatory, it is readily apparent.  That's a 
8  characteristic that is readily apparent.  And in -- at 
9  least in California, when the animal becomes 
10
11 
12 
13
14  California system diverges from the Federal system 
because under the Federal system you separate the animal 
15
16  out, and then you take a look at it, and then you decide 
17  whether that animal can continue to go through the 
18  process and eventually become meat, or whether you 
19  euthanize it.  So, the California system commands an 
20
21  may not be. 
22
23  not within the scope of the Act because at the very 
24  outset California is saying that these animals are not

6  supply system, but it's not required.  It's not --
7  nonambulatory animals are not --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But in any case, it's --
8
9  look, this is a simple question that occurs.  I am an
 
inspector at a federally inspected meat facility.  I 
10
11 
look around, and there is a -- a cow and it's lying 
down.  All right?  It seems to me that your law says I 
12 
13 
have to go over and see that it is immediately 
euthanized.
14 
15
16  requirement -- the exact words are -- "in addition to or 
17  different from the Federal requirements governing the 
18  operations of that Federal meatpacking facility." 
19
immediately to go over and euthanize the cow.  Your law 
20
21  does require me to go over and immediately euthanize the 
22  cow.  And, therefore, your law seems an additional 
23  requirement in respect to the operations of a -- a 
24  federally inspected meatpacking facility.  Now, that 
seems to me the obvious, simple argument that people 
25

 Now, how is that not what is forbidden, a 

 The Federal law does not require me

 So, with respect to that provision, the 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I understood that the 

Federal regulation -- you can correct me if I'm 

1  have been making, and I would like to know your obvious, 
2  simple answer. 
 MS. SMITH:  Certainly, Your Honor.  The 
3
4  euthanization is an operation of the slaughterhouse. 
But it's -- but this -- California's provision is not 
5
6  within the scope.  And pursuant to 678, to be expressly 
7  pre-empted, it has to be within the scope and with 
8  respect to operations. 
9
euthanization provision, we concede that it is -- it is 
10
11  part of the operations.  But it is not within the scope 
12  because we're dealing with an animal that California has 
13  deemed as not part -- as -- excuse me --
14
15
16  misunderstanding -- is that if there is a suspect animal 
17  of any kind, that it requires a slaughterhouse to wait 
18  until the Federal inspector comes and finds out whether 
19  it's just suspect or it's something that can't be sold.
20
21  I understand it, is that there are some diseases that 
22  are so contagious that if the inspector decides that 
23  that animal is carrying that disease, that the whole lot 
24  will be quarantined or otherwise destroyed.  So, are you 
25

fighting with -- that that's what the purpose of 

 And the reason why the inspection occurs, as

 MS. SMITH:  The distinction I would make,
 

meat will be wholesome and unadulterated.  To the extent 

1  pre-inspection under the Federal system is for?
 
2
3  Your Honor, is that the purpose of the ante-mortem
 
4  inspection is to determine if the -- if the animal's
 
5
6  that the pre-inspection or the inspection also finds 
7  diseases that can be passed on to other animals or -- or 
8  to the rest of the herd, that's -- that's certainly a 
9  benefit, but it's not part of the purpose of the Federal 
10
11
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm having a hard time 
12  drawing that distinction.  If there is a valid purpose 
13  to the pre-mortem inspection -- and I can't see how you 
14  can argue otherwise -- that there may be some diseases 
that are so contagious that the entire lot, ambulatory 
15
16  or nonambulatory swine, are affected, then I don't see 
17  how you can argue that you aren't trenching on the scope 
18  of the statute.  If the scope of the statute is to 
19  ensure that meat is unadulterated and if there is the 
20
21
22  that were referenced by the amicus dealing with this are 
23  diseases that will be passed to the animals, not to 
24  humans.
25

risk of contagion, that has to be within the scope. 

 MS. SMITH:  Two points.  One, the diseases 

 And the second point is that the -- the 

36
 

Alderson Reporting Company

system. 

pursuant to the Federal law, will receive that 
ante-mortem inspection and will, by the inspector or the 
veterinarian, be declared disease free or not.  So, they 
will find -- they will be able to find those diseases in 
the ambulatory animals and the ones that are going into 
the meat supply system. 

1  purpose, again, of the Act as specified in 602 is to 
2  make sure that the meat of the animal is wholesome and 
3  unadulterated.  And the ante-mortem inspection will 
4  occur for every animal that goes into the meat supply 
5
6
 So, if California withdraws a nonambulatory 
7  animal, it doesn't receive the ante-mortem inspection, 
8  it's not going into the meat supply system.  But all of 
9  the other animals in that pen that are ambulatory,

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, I suppose what you're 
17  saying, Ms. Smith, is that California or any State is 
18  entitled to take certain categories of animals outside 
19  of the whole process, to exclude certain categories of 
animals from the whole process and so to exclude them, 
20
21  if you will, from of the scope of this chapter.  And 
22  much as the Seventh Circuit said a State can simply 
23  exclude horses from the scope of this statute, you're 
24  saying a State can exclude nonambulatory swine from the 
25

scope of this statute. 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

it would be clear that the State was doing something 

1
2  the question:  Are nonambulatory swine so easily 
3  excludable as horses?  Why couldn't the State then 
4  exclude swine with various kinds of diseases?  And then 
5
6  that the Federal statute is supposed to be doing. 
7
 MS. SMITH:  Your Honor, if your question is, 
8  would that be pre-empted if California excluded pursuant 
9  to other diseases, it would not be expressly pre-empted. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  requirement.  I don't know why it's conflict 
19  pre-emption.  It's express pre-emption.  If indeed the 
Federal regulations say that these diseases disqualify 
20
21  the animal from being slaughtered and sold as meat, and 
22  California says no, we think additional diseases should 
23  disqualify the slaughter and sale, that's an additional 
24  requirement.  I don't know how you say that's somehow 
25

So, California can make decisions on categories of 
animals, here nonambulatory swine, and the -- it would 
not be expressly pre-empted.  There may be questions 
about conflict pre-emption, but in this particular case, 
conflict pre-emption was litigated in the Ninth Circuit, 
and the Ninth Circuit found that there was no conflict 
pre-emption. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's an additional 

Official 

 But then you have to, you know, ask yourself 

conflict pre-emption.  It's express pre-emption.

 MS. SMITH:  It's not expressly pre-empted

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You keep saying "not within

3  not putting requirements on animals --
4
5
6  the scope."  Why is it not within the scope? 
7
 MS. SMITH:  Because the scope of the Federal 
8  Meat Inspection Act does not include every animal on the 
9  premises of a slaughterhouse.  It's limited by the 
language of the -- of the text of the Federal Meat 
10
11 
Inspection Act and the authority given to the Secretary. 
12
13  limits it?  What enables the State to disqualify other 
14  diseases that the Federal law does not disqualify?

 MS. SMITH:  Because it's also within the 

the scope of the chapter with respect to premises, 
facilities, and operations.  So, there -- the scope of 
the chapter must be considered in terms of what the 
purpose is, what the language of the text allows the 
Federal Government --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, your argument is 

1  of the operations, both the operations that pertain to 
2  those animals that are later sold as meat and the 
3  operations that pertain to those animals that are 
4  slaughtered and whose carcasses are burned or disposed

21
22  Justice --
23
24  me -- what you're saying then with respect to animals 
that are slaughtered in a slaughterhouse is that the 
25

that because the Act doesn't speak to whether or not 
cats and dogs and horses can be sold as meat, you can 
also say it's not within the scope because it doesn't 
speak to specifically whether nonambulatory animals can 
be sold as meat or not. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that seems to 

 MS. SMITH:  Correct, and since, Mr. Chief 

40

can't say you can't. 

 MS. SMITH:  Correct. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Correct?  Well, 

 MS. SMITH:  Well, the Federal law doesn't 

1  difference is that the State law says you can't sell 
2  that as meat while the Federal law says you can.  Right? 
3  In other words, you're saying, well, just because the

5
6
7
8  isn't the exact flip side of saying you can sell it is 
9  that -- that you can't sell it is that you can.  So, 
when the Federal law says you can, that pre-empts the 
10
11 
rule from the States that says you can't. 
12
13  say you must.  It does not say you must sell the meat or 
14  you must --

24  the Act.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But we're not talking about 
conflict pre-emption.  If it said you must and the State 
says you can't, then there would be conflict 
pre-emption.  But we're talking about express 
pre-emption, which says in so many words no additional 
requirements.  And I don't know how you can get around 
the fact that this is an additional requirement. 

 MS. SMITH:  Because the "no additional

1  You're right.  I see where you're going.  It says we're

3  the Act.  But I have assumed that that means we're not 
4  talking about airplanes; we're talking about the subject 
5
6  regulation that is within the subject matter of the Act? 
7  And it seems to be.  It has to do with how you slaughter 
8  animals.  It has to -- I mean, if you're going to be so 
9  specific as you say the only things that are within the 
scope of the Act are the specific requirements that are 
10
11  there already in the Federal Act, then this prohibition 
12  against extra regulations means nothing. 
13
 I mean, it can't mean that.  So, it just 
14  means the subject matter.  And now, if it means the 
15

 MS. SMITH:  This -- well, even if one looks 
17  at the subject matter instead of the scope of the Act --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you mean, instead

 MS. SMITH:  Because the "in addition to" is 

whole process of what happens from the minute they 
arrive to the minute they're sold.  So, if we don't 
accept your limitation based on a scope being defined by 
purpose, how do you win? 

1
2  qualified by on the -- with respect to the premises, 
3  facilities, and operations and within the scope of the 
4  Act.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you define the scope 
5
6  almost exclusively by purpose.  And regulatory power is 
7  broader than purpose, I mean, as is reflected by the 
8  regulations here which are dealing not merely with 
9  animals that are adulterated but are dealing with the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  specified as dealing with -- or making sure that no 
17  adulterated meat or any carcass, part of carcass, meat 
18  food product therefor is not adulterated.  So, the focus 
19  in 621 on the Secretary's authority is on making sure 
that -- that the meat is not adulterated.  So -- so, 
20
21  it's not simply the -- the purpose of the Act at 602 but 
22  also the scope of the authority given to the Secretary. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you seem to be 
23
24  assuming that in effecting its obligations that only 
25

when it finds adulterated meat is that within the -- the

1  scope.  The Government has basically said:  We've got to 
2  figure out if it is, and this is how we're going to do 
3  it:  We're going to do it starting from the receipt of 
4  the swine through its sale, and we're going to have 
inspections all through the process, whether or not the 
5
6  meat will ultimately be sold or not; our scope is what 
7  happens in that slaughterhouse.  That --
 MS. SMITH:  Correct.  But the -- the focus 
8
9  of the Secretary's authority, as well as the specified 
purpose of the Act, is focused on not all animals, but 
10
11 
animals that will eventually become meat and making a 
determination, by inspections or examinations, whether 
12 
13 
or not -- whether or not those swine or those meat will 
be wholesome and not adulterated.
14 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I didn't see your 
15
16  argument, and now I see it.  Okay.  So, I understand 
17  where you're going. 
 But then if I look at section 610 of the 
18
19  Act, it has a whole bunch of prohibitions, including 
prohibitions and references to how you slaughter 
20
21  animals, and including how you slaughter animals 
22  humanely.  So, there, how do you say that this provision 
23  which talks about euthanizing an animal that you look 
24  around and it's lying down -- how is that not within the 
25

scope of the Act?  I'm not saying that they have that

21
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think that's what 
22  within the scope means.  The pre-emption provision here 
23  in the statute has two provisions.  The first one, which 
24  is the one we're talking about, says requirements within 
25

And so, to the extent that that -- that slaughter is 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I see.  That's what 

you said before --

 Now, the second pre-emption provision reads: 

1  facilities, and operations which are in addition to or 
2  different than those made under this chapter may not be 
3  imposed.  That's the first one.  Okay?  Requirements 
4  within the scope with respect to premises, facilities.
5
6  "marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient 
7  requirements in addition to, or different than, those 
8  made under this chapter."  Now, I read the difference 
9  between those two being, under number two it has to be 
different from something that has been made; whereas 
10
11 
under number one, it just has to be different from 
12 
anything that could have been made under this chapter. 
13
 It's within the scope of the chapter.  It's 
14  within the Secretary's authority to prescribe under this 
15
16  difference between requirements within the scope and, in 
17  number two, "in addition to, or different than, those 
18  made," and that to my mind is -- is a much more 
19  plausible explanation of "within the scope" than -- you 
know, it's directed to the purpose of -- of the statute. 
20

22  California statute is setting out requirements, the 
23  requirements in the penal code dealing with animal 
24  cruelty in -- in areas traditionally regulated by the

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But suppose, Ms. Smith, you 
3  decided that the Secretary was not doing a good job in 
4  terms of inspecting for disease.  So, I guess that 
there's some disease called diamond skin disease which 
5
6  affects a lot of pigs.  And you just thought that the 
7  inspection standards were far too lenient, and you said, 
8  okay, we're not going to allow pigs with diamond skin 
9  disease to be slaughtered.  Under your theory you could 
10
11
12  be categorically withdrawing the animal from -- from the 
13  process.  I want to be clear, though, we're not -- with 
14  this law we are not setting up an inspection and 
examination process.  It's -- this provision is in the 
15
16  penal code.  It's an animal -- it's within the animal 
17  cruelty statutes.  It is not an attempt to set --
18
19  parallel inspection system.  It's trying to do the exact 
same thing that the Secretary is trying to do, which is 
20
21  trying to remove animals with a certain kind of disease, 
22  and it requires an inspection system of its own.

9  animal cruelty.  And so, prohibiting the purchase, 
10

12  to be, the answer, that, no, it doesn't have anything 
13  else to do because the animal cruelty that you're 
14  concerned about takes place on the premises as a result 
of the operations.  And so, you prohibit the buying and

16  selling of an animal that wasn't treated the way you 
17  think it should be treated, to give effect to your views

4  all animals on the premises be handled humanely and that

distinction in implementing section 602 through 604 
10
11  between animals that the State may choose to try to 
12  categorically remove.  It applies to all animals, and 
13  that is critical because a State -- a slaughterhouse 
14  worker who is on the premises needs to have one set of 
15
16  knows that if he follows the advice of a Federal 
17  inspector and, for example, puts a nonambulatory 
18  animal -- separates the animal, puts it in a covered 
19  pen, and lets it go through the ante-mortem inspection

20

13  prohibitions which are backed up by criminal penalties
