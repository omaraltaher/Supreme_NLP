CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­1406,  Nebraska  v.  Parker. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Smith. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JAMES  D.  SMITH 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

For  over  a  century,  the  following  three 

   

 

 

 

 

things  have  been  true  in  the  disputed  area. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  the  non­Indian  population  has  always 

 

 

 

 

 

been  greater  than  98  percent. 

 

 

 

 

            

Second,  the  Tribe  never  exercised 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

And  third,  by  contrast,  the  State  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nebraska  has  governed  the  disputed  area. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  story  of  the  disputed  area  is  that  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land  that  long  ago  lost  its  Indian  character,  if  it  ever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  any.  The  three  things  I  mentioned  at  the  outset 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  for  a  reason.  They  happened  because  it  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ or  the  intent  of  Congress  in  the  context  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  of  the  1882  Act  that  the  disputed  area  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminished  from  the  reservation.

position  correctly,  you're  not  asking  us  to  overrule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solem? 

            

MR.  SMITH:  No.  No,  Your  Honor.  We  are  not 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

asking  you  to  overrule  Solem.  In  fact,  what  we  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  the  Court  to  do  is  to  imply  ­­ apply  the  entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solem  rule  and,  in  particular,  the  compelling  third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor  of  the  subsequent  circumstances  of  the  land's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  history.  As  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  From  what  ­­ from  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  just  said  and  from  your  brief,  I  gathered  ­­ perhaps 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  was  wrong  ­­ that  you  are  arguing  for  a  de  facto 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminishment  test;  that  is,  you  pointed  out  the  area  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  overwhelmingly  populated  by  non­Indians  and  they  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ they  haven't  attempted  before  to  exercise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governing  authority. 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Your  Honor,  we  think  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

de  facto  diminishment  does  fit  within  the  third  element 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Solem  test,  which  is  the  subsequent  circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  after  the  enactment.  And  so  obviously  we  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  opposed  to  the  Court  concluding  and  reaching  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  on  the  grounds  of  de  facto  diminishment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  we  also  think  this  case  fits  within  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  precedent  under  Solem,  which  would  involve  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  our  view,  the  third  element  of  the  test  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  strong  and  compelling  in  this  case,  while

in  Solem,  in  that  particular  case,  it  was  ­­ it  was  ­­ I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess  I  would  call  fairly  easy  to  distinguish  because, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  Solem  talks  about  as  far  as  the  events,  what  took 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  after  the  Act,  the  focus  should  be  ­­ if  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  intent  of  Congress,  you  should  be  looking  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Congress  is  doing  after  the  Act  that  is  reflective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  not  understanding  essentially  that  they've  diminished 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reservation. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It's  a  different  Congress. 

   

  

 

 

I  mean,  to  say,  you  know,  a  later  Congress  did  thus  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so,  and  therefore  the  earlier  Congress,  when  it  enacted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  particular  statute,  must  have  diminished.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  make  any  sense. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  It  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  ­­ and  ­­ and  moreover, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  the  third  factor  is  dispositive,  as  ­­ as  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assert,  you  would  not  ­­ we  would  not  need  the  ­­ the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  de  facto  diminishment  doctrine  whereby,  by  a  sort 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of,  you  know,  adverse  possession,  a  jurisdiction, 

   

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  Indians  or  ­­ or  even  a  State  that  used  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  jurisdiction  over  a  particular  area  has  forfeited 

   

   

 

 

 

 

it  by  long­,  long­accepted  usage  to  the  contrary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  ­­ if  that  is  true  and  ­­ and  if  ­­ if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  third  factor  is  as  important  as  you  say,  we  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  need  that  doctrine.  We  ­­ we  would  just  find

diminishment. 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  and  that  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  concept  that,  if  a  party  just  ­­ if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  belatedly  assert  a  claim  to  having  sovereign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

authority  over  this,  as  in  this  case  it's  over  a  hundred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  some  years  after  the  land  was  open  for  settlement, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ there  ­­ at  least  the  Sherrill  case,  some  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  in  that  case  would  be  supportive  of  de  facto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminishment. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  As  far  as  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That  case  didn't  involve 

  

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  diminishment.  Diminishment  was  not  an  issue. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  That  ­­ that  is  true.  I  ­­ I  ­­

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  I  was  referring  to  was  the  ­­ the  principle  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  decided  in  the  case  as  far  as  a  long­standing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption  of  jurisdiction  by  the  State  over  an  area 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  primarily  non­Indian  in  ­­ in  population  land 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creates  justifiable  expectations,  and  if  they  did  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  sovereignty  over  it,  they  had  long  since  forfeited. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  that's  not  what  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguing  here.  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  understand  you're  arguing 

    

   

   

 

 

 

diminishment,  not  ­­ not  adverse  possession,  so  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speak. 

            

MR.  SMITH:  We  are  arguing  that  it's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer  part  of  the  reservation.  We  are  not  saying  it  ­­

Court  could  not  find  it  under  the  de  facto,  but  we  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  facts  of  this  case  does  fit  within  Solem.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ and  if  the  Court  applies  the  Solem  test,  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  prevail  in  this  case,  which  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  don't  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

other  side  says  you  did  not  raise  a  City  of  Sherrill 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  Do  you  agree  with  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SMITH:  We  have  ­­ we  have  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  A  lot  of  the  ­­ a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  the  arguments  you  make  seem  to  sound  more  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

City  of  Sherrill­type  proposition,  but  you  haven't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  that  argument,  have  you? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  We,  I  ­­ I  believe  in 

   

   

  

 

 

paragraphs  ­­ or  pages  22,  I  think  it's  25  of  our  brief, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  at  least  citing  Sherrill  as  ­­ as  precedent  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  principle  of  loss  of  sovereignty,  loss  of  sovereign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control  by  the  fact  that  the  State  has  long  exercised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jurisdiction. 

 

            

But  our  focus  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  that's  based  on  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Solem  said.  Solem  did  bring  up  a  de  facto  diminishment. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  is  on  page  471  of  the  opinion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  says  "On  a  more  pragmatic  level,  we  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  that  who  actually  moved  onto  the  open

surplus  land  Act  diminished  a  reservation.  Where 

   

  

 

 

 

non­Indian  settlers  flooded  into  the  opening  portion  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reservation  and  the  area  has  long  since  lost  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indian  character,  we  have  acknowledged  that  de  facto  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  de  jure  diminishment  may  have  occurred." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  was  the  theme  that  was  picked  up  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sherrill,  but  it's  stated  in  Solem. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Yes.  Yes. 

  

  

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  may  I  ­­ may  I  ask  a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

preliminary  question?  We're  talking  about  a  liquor 

   

  

 

 

 

license  or  alcoholic  beverage  license  and  a  sales  tax  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alcoholic  beverages.  Does  the  State  itself  impose  such 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements,  that  is,  a  licensing  requirement  and  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sales  tax? 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  The  State  itself  does  impose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

liquor  license  requirements.  They  ­­ they  can  in  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  of  Nebraska  has  sales  taxes,  yes,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  This  tax  was  not  imposed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  Tribe  ­­ Tribe.  This  was  a  statute  of  Congress 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  permitted  the  Indians  to  do  this,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  My  recollection  was  the  Interior 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Department  approved  the  Tribe's  request  to  have  such  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinance,  and  then  ­­ the  Tribe's  ordinance  then  was  in

Tribes  can't  tax  at  will.  They  have  to  get  approval  for

MR.  SMITH:  Your  ­­ your  point  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct,  Your  Honor.  The  Tribe  has  to  request  it.  They

what  else  do  you  lose  if  this  ruling  is  against  you? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We've  already  circumscribed  the  powers  of  the  Tribes  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  own  reservations  greatly,  so  what  powers  do  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lose? 

            

You've  already  ceded  to  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

government  criminal  prosecution  powers.  So  you're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

losing  out  on  that.  What  are  you  losing  out  on? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

take  this  ­­ it  would  be  in  the  context  of  what  are  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justifiable  expectations  of  those  who  live  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputed  area?  What  would  be  significantly  disrupted  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

far  as  their  justifiable  expectations? 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  start  off  with  the  first  thing  ­­

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Smith,  can  ­­ can  I  take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  back  to  Justice  Scalia's  question?  You  know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  usually,  at  least  now,  we  don't  think  much  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequent  history  of  any  kind.  Now,  maybe  they  thought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  little  bit  more  highly  of  it  in  the  days  when  Solem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  written,  but  now  it  would  ­­ it's  ­­ it's  pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  of  a  stretch  to  use  subsequent  legislative  history 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  subsequent  history  generally  when  we're  dealing  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting  a  statute. 

   

            

And  I'm  just  wondering:  Is  there  a  reason 

   

  

 

 

 

 

why  it  should  be  more  credited  here  than  in  any  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context? 

            

MR.  SMITH:  The  Court's  precedent,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

believe,  recognizes  in  the  area  of  land  surplus  acts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Indian  land  surplus  acts  are  a  unique  animal  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  normal  legislative  analysis.  And  that  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  in  the  context  of  the  times  back  before  the  turn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of,  I  guess,  two  centuries  ago  in  the  1800s,  Congress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  doing  land  surplus  acts  in  which  the  concept  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  we  diminishing  or  not  diminishing  a  reservation  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  nothing  that  Congress  thought  of. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  put  that  on  the  basic  principle  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  Congress  can  diminish  a  reservation,  it  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

becomes  the  problem  of  how  do  we  determine  what  Congress

intended  when,  frankly,  the  reality  of  the  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent  is,  it's  something  that  Court  ­­ or  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally  did  not  think  of.  They  were  inconsistent. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  the  Solem  test  really  evolves  out  of  an  attempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  determine  what  was  the  intent  of  Congress  at  the

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  When  did  ­­ when  did  this

MR.  SMITH:  It  becomes  a  big  issue  when  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

issue  is  who  ­­ frankly,  who  has  authority  to  govern? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is  this  still  part  of  the  reservation  or  not?  Does  the

the  city  of  Pender  besides  opposing  this  liquor  tax? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Well,  what  it  can  do,  it  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

displace  State  jurisdiction  over  environmental 

 

 

 

 

regulations  that  this  is  a  rural  farming  area.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

environment  is  very  important.  State  regulation  is  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

important.  It's  what  the  people  have  expected.  And  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  give  an  example:  If  you're  a  farmer,  and  the  guy 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across  the  road  drops  a  load  of  manure  in  your  pond 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  being  used  to  feed  cattle,  you  call  the  State  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nebraska;  you  want  them  to  come  out  and  you  want  them  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  something.  Those  regulations  would  be  replaced.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

call  the  State  of  Nebraska  and  the  response  is  I'm  sorry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  called  the  wrong  number. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  about  municipalities?

powers  in  a  way  that's  harmful  to  settled  expectations, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  might  have  a  remedy  in  law.  That's  what  City  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sherrill  says,  but  that  didn't  take  away  ­­ the  City  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sherrill  didn't  say  the  Indians  weren't  sovereign.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  said  they  can't  exercise  the  sovereignty.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  say  it  was  a  diminishment.  What  they  said  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  couldn't  exercise  it  because  of  latches.

In  our  ­­ in  the  eastern  part,  the  Tribe

don't  get  to  remove  them  from  office  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Smith,  I  ­­ I  can 

   

   

  

 

 

understand  why  people  might  be  concerned,  for  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  that  you're  talking  about.  We  do  have  pretty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  and  settled  law  in  this  area  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminishment,  that  we've  said  only  Congress  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminish,  that  the  idea  is  that  we're  supposed  to  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  congressional  intent.  And  you  say  Congress  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  think  in  these  terms.  And  there's  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  fair  about  that. 

 

 

 

            

But  Congress  did  use  very  different  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  different  ones  of  these  acts,  and  we've  looked  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  language  as  a  pretty  good  guide  to  suggesting  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ones  diminish  and  which  ones  do  not.  And  it  seems  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  the  language  here  in  ­­ in  the  act  in  which  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned  ­­ it's  ­­ it's  none  of  the  language  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  suggest  that  Congress  diminished  this  act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  was  wondering  if  you  could  talk  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  Is  there  anything  in  the  language  of  this  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  suggests  a  diminishment?  Any  of  the  usual  kind  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  cede  everything,  we  relinquish  everything?  Like, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what's  the  best  you  can  do  on  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Appreciate  that,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  yes,  the  standard  diminishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  starts  with  looking  at  the  Act.  Is  there  language

in  the  Act?  Hagen  and  Solem  both  specifically  say  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  form  of  words  are  required. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

What  we  do  have  in  this  Act  is  we've  got  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

areas  of  the  reservation.  The  area  west  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation,  it's  a  very  well­defined  area.  It  doesn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

create  a  checkerboard  effect. 

   

 

            

What  is  significant  is  the  different  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  treats  the  area  west  of  the  railroad  different  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  area  east  of  the  railroad.  Specifically  ­­ and  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  major  distinction  in  Solem  ­­ there  is  nothing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserved  for  the  Tribe  in  the  land  on  the  west  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

railroad,  the  disputed  area.  There's  nothing  reserved 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  ­­ in  the  bullpen,  so  to  speak.  There  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation  of  land­use  rights.  There's  no  reservation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  land­use  rights  for  schools,  agency,  Tribal  religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes,  no  reservation  in  mineral  rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  Solem  those  were  considered  significant 

 

 

 

 

 

factors  because  what  you  end  up  with  is  that  the  Tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

headquarters,  its  governmental  headquarters  ended  up  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solem  being  in  the  disputed  area. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Counsel,  do  you  agree  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

City  of  Sherrill  did  nothing  more  than  deny  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  relief  and  did  not  repudiate  the  proposition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Indian  sovereignty  over  the  land  in  question? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  if  you  agree  with  that,  then  I  guess  I'm  more

But  if  you  disagree  with  it,  as  I  think  you  ought  to,

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yes,  but  it  says  the  Tribe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  sovereignty,  is  what  it  says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  It  ­­ well,  it  says  the  Tribe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  sovereignty  just  to  buy  land  back  and  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  sovereignty  that  it  had  long  ago  lost  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

MR.  SMITH:  ­­ and  it  applies  equitable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

principles  to  say  you're  ­­

Tribe  does  not  have  sovereignty. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Yes.  Yes.  And  I  ­­ and  I  think 

   

   

  

  

  

 

 

it's  perfectly  reasonable  for  the  Court  to  reach  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  with  a  land  which  long  ago  it  lost  its  Indian 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

character,  long  ago  they've  ­­ they've  never  exercised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  sovereignty,  and  then  show  up  after  the  public,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

descendants,  everyone  who's  lived  there,  and  after  130 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  you  suddenly  find  out  we  ­­ we've  got  an  Indian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  that  somehow  has  some  governmental  authority  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us.

We've  never  elected  them;  we  don't  have  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  vote  them  out  of  office.  If  we  don't  like  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  do,  I  guess  we  can  complain  to  somebody, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  we  can't  recall  members  of  the  Tribal  Council. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  ­­ it  is  a  recognition  that  those  things  happened 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that's  what  Congress  intended  to  have  happen,

As  far  as  that  legislative  history  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ what  happened  afterwards,  Solem  emphasizes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decades  immediately  after  the  Act.  And  in  the  decades 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately  after  this  Act,  we  don't  have  what  Solem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks  about,  the  rife  with  inconsistencies.  What  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  is  a  total,  one  hundred  percent  consistent  record 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  everyone  understood. 

 

 

            

This  land  was  diminished.  It's  not  part  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reservation.  Congress  in  ­­ eighty,  ninety­six 

  

 

 

 

 

 

years  later,  and  I  understand  the  point  about  subsequent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  intent,  but  at  least  they  did  not  take  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  that  would  reflect  Congress  didn't  understand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  did. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Smith,  on  the  City  of

Below,  what  was  the  status  of  the  City  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sherrill  argument  in  the  lower  courts? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  The  ­­ in  the  lower  courts,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  ­­ the  argument  was  made  as  far  as  that  de 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facto  diminishment  can  be  found.  The  Eighth  Circuit's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  is  what  I  would  call  a  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I'm  not  sure  quite  what  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

means.  Does  that  mean  de  facto  diminishment  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solem,  or  does  that  mean  ­­ Solem  ­­ or  does  that  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  talked  about  City  of  Sherrill  as  an  independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground? 

            

MR.  SMITH:  We  talked  about  de  facto 

  

 

 

 

 

 

diminishment  as  an  independent  ground.  I  didn't  argue 

    

 

 

 

 

 

it,  but  my  ­­ my  recollection  is  Sherrill  is  not  cited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  ­­ as  authority  for  that,  but  we  did  make  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  it  was  de  facto  because  Solem  does  say  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  recognized  de  facto  diminishment.

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  question  in  this  case  is  whether  an  1882 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  of  Congress  diminished  the  Omaha  Reservation  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redrew  its  boundaries.  We  think  multiple  considerations 

  

 

 

 

 

 

make  clear  that  the  Act  of  Congress  did  not  diminish  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation,  but  simply  opened  up  a  portion  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation  for  settlement  within  the  existing 

 

 

 

 

 

boundaries. 

            

Now  the  first,  and  probably  most 

 

 

 

 

 

significant,  factor  is  that  the  text  of  the  statute  uses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  classic  language  this  Court  has  identified  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opening  up  a  reservation  for  settlement  without  creating 

   

 

 

 

 

 

a  diminishment. 

 

            

But  secondly,  and  I  think  very  telling  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

specific  to  this  statute,  at  the  same  time  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  in  the  statute  that  supports  a  finding  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminishment.  I  think  there  is  language  in  the  statute. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Specifically,  the  final  proviso  of  Section  8  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  inconsistent  with  the  idea  that  what  Congress  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  draw  a  new  western  boundary  to  the  reservation, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  ­­ that  proviso  gave  Tribal  members  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  take  their  allotments  east  or  west  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right­of­way. 

            

And  the  record  reflects  that  many  ­­ that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  number  of  members  of  the  Tribe  took  their

allotments  west  of  the  right­of­way.  And  importantly,  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  them  took  their  allotments  that  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straddled  the  right­of­way. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  number? 

  

 

 

 

What  ­­ what  is  the  number? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  There  are  15  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Nine? 

  

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  No,  15,  I  think  ­­ well,  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

parties  dispute  ­­ between  10  and  15,  about  850  to  900 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acres.  But  I  don't  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Out  ­­ out  of  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  that  took  allotments? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Out  of  how  many  Tribal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

members?  I  think  there  were  roughly  300­plus 

    

 

 

 

 

allotments.  So  it  was,  you  know,  three  percent. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  the  fact  that  they  were  allowed, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  though  they're  small  numbers  ­­ I'm  not  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  a  ­­ a  volume  argument  here.  I'm  making  an 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

argument  that  if  what  Congress  just  did  was  draw  a  new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

western  boundary  to  the  reservation,  it  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  odd  to  allow  Tribal  members  to  take  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allotments  off  the  reservation,  and  maybe  odder  still  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow  them  to  take  an  allotment  that  essentially  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bisected  by  the  new  boundary. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  would  that  be

purchase  their  ­­

 

 

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  don't  think  ­­

    

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ or  take 

  

 

 

 

 

allotments  outside  the  reservation? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  don't  think  that  would  have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

been  a  logical  assumption,  given  the  conception  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

time,  where  I  think  Congress  was  thinking  in  the  main 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Tribal  ownership  or  Indian  ownership  went  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation  status. 

 

            

And  I  think,  again,  if  you  think  of  this  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  a  Surplus  Land  Act  that  simply  opens  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation  up,  a  portion  of  it  to  settlement,  then  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  perfect  sense  to  say  the  Tribal  members  can  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  allotments  anywhere  on  the  reservation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  you  think  you've  really  drawn  a  new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

boundary  to  the  reservation,  then  I  think  it's  more  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passing  strange  that  you  can  take  allotments  to  the  west 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  it,  or  you  can  take  an  allotment  and  the  new  border 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  smack  dab  through  the  middle  of  it.  That  ­­

your  answer  to  the  Chief  Justice's  question.  An  Indian 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  wanted  to  have  an  allotment  off  the  reservation,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allotments  were  generally  available,  could  take  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allotment  off  the  reservation  if  the  Indian  chose  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so,  correct? 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  No.  My  position  is  no,  they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't.  And  they  could  take  it  west  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right­of­way,  but  I  am  saying  that's  how  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Allotments  were  only  open 

  

 

 

 

 

to  non­Indians? 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  No,  no.  Before  any  settlers, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

non­Indians,  came  in,  the  existing  Tribal  members  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  to  take  their  allotments. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  All  right. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  And  they  were  allowed  to  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  allotments  anywhere  on  the  preexisting 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  All  right.  So  we're  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

talking  about  allotments  open  to  the  general  population? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  No.  No. 

  

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  And  ­­ and  this  is  clear  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  proviso  in  Section  8.  It's  the  allotment  only  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  of  the  Tribe.  And  they  can  take,  consistent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  historical  understanding,  an  allotment  anywhere

on  the  reservation,  including  west  of  the  right­of­way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  seems  to  me  to  be  very  consistent  with  the  idea 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  right­of­way  is  an  interesting  thing  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  granted  through  their  reservation,  but  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  new  boundary.  And  I  think  the  subsequent  history 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

really  supports  that  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  do  you  mean  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  mean,  my  friend  on  the  other 

    

 

 

 

 

side  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  what  do  you  mean, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Clement,  of  the  language  that  I  read  from  Solem 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  which  seems  to  fit  this  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  take  that  language, 

   

  

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg,  as  Justice  Marshal  writing  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  saying  that  when  you're  in  the  third  factor,  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  witness  de  facto  immunity  ­­ I'm  sorry  ­­ de  facto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  diminishment,  that  that  may  ultimately  support  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion  that  there  was  in  fact  diminishment  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  law. 

 

 

              

I  don't  take  him  to  be  opening  up  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely  different  route  to  finding  immunity  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminishment,  rather,  that  doesn't  go  through  an  act  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress.  And  I  think  that's  the  only  way  to  read  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  as  a  whole  because  when  the  Court  starts  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion,  it  says  the  very  first  principle  in  this  area

is  that  only  Congress  can  diminish  a  reservation. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  it's  perfectly  compatible  with  that  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  when  we  get  to  the  third  factor  and  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  all  sorts  of  things,  we'll  look  at  settlement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patterns  as  part  of  that.  But  I  don't  think  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  that  world  view  to  then  say  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually,  the  third  factor  is  a  standalone  alternative 

   

 

 

 

 

 

route  to  find  diminishment,  not  by  congressional  action, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  by  market  reaction  to  a  surplus  land  Act.

not  a  big  deal.  I  am  telling  ­­ I'm  here  to  tell  you 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  things,  though. 

 

 

            

One  is  that  Solem  went  out  of  its  way  to  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  the  diminishment  issue.  So  it  is  clearly  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  way  of  thinking  about  the  cases,  and  I  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  they're  coextensive.  Which  is  to  say,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  could  be  a  particular  assertion  of  Tribal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

authority  that  you  might  say  violates  City  of  Sherrill 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles,  even  within  an  undiminished  reservation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  do  think  it's  then  critically 

   

 

 

 

 

important  that  ­­ my  friend  on  the  other  side  has  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised  this  argument  below.  I  certainly  did  not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

understand  it  to  be  an  independent  argument  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court.  It's  all  well  and  good  to  cite  the  case,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  doesn't  make  it  an  independent  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Even  his  amici,  who  thought  that  they  wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  bring  before  this  Court  the  City  of  Sherrill 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  admitted  that  the  Petitioners  hadn't  made  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

City  of  Sherrill  argument. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  ­­ but  Solem  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk  about  de  facto  diminishment.  And  it  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you've  got  to  recognize  when  they  do  that,  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  something  other  than  de  jure,  in  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words,  pursuant  to  the  law.  It's  pursuant  to  the  facts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  ground.

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  understand, 

    

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  but  I  think  there's  two  ways  to  talk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  de  facto  v.  de  jure.  One  way  to  talk  about  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they're  two  totally  alternative  routes.  Another 

  

 

 

 

 

 

way  is  to  say  de  facto  diminishment  means  the  settlement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patterns,  and  that's  something  that  can  inform  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimate  conclusion  of  whether  there's  diminishment. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  really  think  the  Court  in  Solem  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

using  it  in  that  passage  in  the  latter  respect.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  the  only  way  to  make  sense  of  the  case  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole,  because  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Except  that  it's  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

presented  before  the  Court  turns  to  apply  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles. 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Exactly.  That's  right.  It's 

  

  

  

 

 

part  of  the  general  principles  of  the  Court  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  It's  ­­ it's  not  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  tied  to  the  third  factor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  take, 

   

   

   

  

 

though,  that  it  actually  is,  in  my  view,  tied  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third  factor.  I  think  Justice  Marshall  was  laying  out 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  the  factors,  starting  with  the  first  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governing  principle,  being  that  only  Congress  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminish.  And  he  winds  up  the  sort  of  general  principle 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section  with  this  last  thing  about  de  facto/de  jure  ­­

de  facto  diminishment,  and  then  that  ties  up  exactly  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  discussion  of  settlement  patterns  in  the  third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor  of  Solem.  And  I  really  think  that's  the  right 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  read  that  opinion. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  like  to  make  one  other  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  point  here,  though,  is  I  think  the  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  understand  that  if  you  were  to  rule  in  favor  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners  in  this  case,  the  parties  would  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  go  back  and  reconstruct  the  right­of­way  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  railroad  is  no  longer  there.  There's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rails­For­Trails  program  in  Thurston  County.  So  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  a  Google  map  and  look  at  this  area,  you  can't  even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  where  the  right­of­way  was. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  think  that's  significant,  because  if 

   

 

 

 

 

there  really  was  a  contemporaneous  understanding  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

1950s  and  1960s,  when  the  railroad  literally  pulled  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  tracks  and  left,  that  the  right­of­way  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boundary  of  the  reservation,  then  I  think  there  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  some  effort  to  sort  of  preserve  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  boundary. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well  ­­ well  ­­ well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

please  correct  me  if  I'm  wrong  from  the  record.  My  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  understanding  was  in  the  west  portion,  the  Tribe  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  ­­ had  exercised  no  jurisdiction  until  the  Beverage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Control  Ordinance  recently,  but  on  the  east  portion,

that  they  had.  But  then  you  say,  well,  we  can't  tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  difference  in  east  and  west. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  ­­

reading  of  the  record  mistaken? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  what  there 

   

   

  

 

 

 

is  is  a  practical  understanding  ­­ as  Justice  Sotomayor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicated,  this  is  not  a  wealthy  Tribe  that's  looking  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assert  jurisdictions  in  places  that  are  impractical.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  made  a  judgment  that  most  of  its  efforts  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directed  at  the  eastern  portion  of  the  reservation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  what  I'm  saying  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  ­­ what  ­­ but  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  nothing,  if  ­­ if  the  record  is  correct  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  assume  the  record  shows  that  the  Tribe  exercised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  jurisdiction  over  the  western  portion  until  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alcoholic  Beverage  Control  Ordinance.  Is  that  relevant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  case  at  all?

the  situation  was  very  cloudy. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  one  of  the  things  also  to  keep  in  mind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  even  before  Montana,  the  authority  that  a  Tribe

else,  on  your  theory,  could  the  Tribe  do  in  the  way  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governance  in  this  area? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  think  as  a  practical  matter, 

    

   

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg,  there's  two  other  things  that  are  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stake  here,  and  they  both  go  to  the  equities  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Indians  on  the  reservation,  not  the  non­Indians,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  non­Indians  on  the  reservation,  the  Tribal  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  very,  very  limited. 

 

 

 

            

So  one  thing  that  is  at  issue  here  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential  to  continue  the  revenue­sharing  agreement  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State.  And  this  is  something  that  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  came  to  the  Tribe  about.  And  the  theory  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revenue­sharing  agreement  for  the  fuel  taxes  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  going  to  be  transactions  in  the  western 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portion  of  the  reservation  where  it's  actually  Tribal

happen,  because  there  are  a  lot  of  gas  stations  over 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there.  And  of  course,  the  Tribe  would  have  authority  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tax  the  Tribal  members  on  the  reservations  for  those  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  transactions.  So  what  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  You  ­­ you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg  asked  you  a  question,  you  said,  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  matter.  I  thought  ­­ maybe  I  misinterpreted 

    

   

 

 

 

her  question  here  ­­ as  a  legal  matter.  As  a  legal 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

matter,  if  you  prevail,  can  the  Tribe  cast  any  doubt  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  authority  and  the  jurisdiction  of  the  existing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipality? 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  No,  not  at  all.  What  they  can 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  is  they  can  make  cooperative  agreements  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  of  Nebraska  to  tax  Indians  when  they  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchases  in  Pender. 

 

 

            

And  the  other  thing  they  can  do  is  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  two  Tribal  members  get  in  a  scuffle  in  the  village 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Pender,  the  Tribal  authorities  can  be  contacted,  and

MR.  CLEMENT:  Under  ­­ under  its 

  

 

 

 

 

authority  ­­ first  of  all  ­­ I  ­­ I  mean,  you  know,  let 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  say  two  things: 

 

 

 

            

One  is:  I'm  not  even  sure,  because  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrocession  under  ­­ after  Public  Law  280,  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  clear  to  me  that  Nebraska  ceded  its  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  that  it  enjoyed  under  280.  The  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retrocession,  as  I  understand  it,  was  criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

retrocession  with  the  exception  of  the  motor  vehicle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws. 

            

The  second  thing:  As  a  practical  matter,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  this  is  very  important  to  understand.  The  next 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

town  east  from  Pender  is  the  Town  of  Walthill.  It  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unambiguously  in  the  reservation  boundaries.  It  is  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated  municipality  of  the  ­­ of  sort  of  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  of  Nebraska. 

 

 

            

            

In  the  Winnebago  reservation  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  just  educate  me 

  

 

 

 

 

because  I  ­­ I  don't  know  the  law  on  this  point.  Can  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excuse  me. 

 

            

Can  a  State  incorporate  municipalities 

   

 

 

within  the  boundary  of  a  Indian  Reservation? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Yes.  It  can,  and  it  does,  and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  quite  common.  And  what  this  Court  ­­ in  fact,  this

Court  in  ­­ in  ­­ in  the  Seymour  case,  one  of  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earliest  diminishment  cases,  confronted  a  Federal 

   

 

 

 

township,  Omak,  Washington,  that  had  always  been  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

township.  There's  civil  authority  there,  but  it's  still 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  reservation.  And  that  is  actually  quite  common. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Does  that  displace 

  

 

 

 

 

Tribal  authority  in  that  area? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  No.  Because  again,  remember, 

  

  

 

 

 

the  Tribal  authority  over  the  non­Indians  is  so  small. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  the  ­­ the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  talking  about  the  area. 

 

 

 

 

            

Can  Tribal  ­­ Tribal  police  patrol  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  municipality? 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  think  they  probably  could. 

    

 

 

 

 

The  only,  really  ­­ with  an  eye  towards  seeing  if  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  Indians  there  who  were,  you  know,  needing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patrolling.  And  there's  some  evidence  in  the  record  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  at  Joint  Appendix  371  and  372  ­­ that  there  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occasional  patrols  of  the  Tribe  into  Pender.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  a  footnote  in  that  same  section  that  says  that  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practical  matter,  when  a  Tribal  member  was  apprehended 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Village  of  Pender,  the  police  officer  would  call 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  to  the  Tribal  authorities  and  have  them  take  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person.

is  your  Montana  decision  which  substantially  limits  the

MR.  CLEMENT:  It  ­­ it  is,  but  that  is  the

reservations  has  been  a  unique  Federal  authority  for  as

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  ­­ I  don't  think  that  it

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ALLON  KEDEM 

 

 

 

 

           

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  FEDERAL  RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

In  Solem  v.  Bartlett,  this  Court  explained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  once  a  block  of  land  is  set  aside  as  an  Indian 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reservation  and  no  matter  what  happens  to  the  title  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  plots  within  the  area,  the  entire  block 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

retains  its  reservation  status  until  Congress  explicitly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicates  otherwise.  It  has  not  done  so  here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  start,  if  I  may,  with  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question:  What  would  change  if  this  Court  were  to  rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  reservation  is  still  intact?  First  of  all, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  services,  States  can  provide  services  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members  of  tribes  and  nonmembers  alike  anywhere  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reservation.  And  the  State  of  Nebraska  provides 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

services  not  only  in  the  disputed  area  but  on  the  east 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  as  well.

Let  me  give  you  a  very  specific  example. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

There's  a  town  called  Bancroft,  which  is  split  in  half 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  right­of­way.  There's  another  town  called 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Rosalie,  which  is  clearly  within  the  eastern  undisputed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  reservation.  There's  a  school  district 

   

  

 

 

 

 

called  the  Bancroft­Rosalie  School  District,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administered  under  the  auspices  of  the  State  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nebraska.  And  that  is  true  notwithstanding  the  fact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  much  of  the  land  is  on  the  east  side,  and  true 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding  the  fact  that  many  members  ­­ many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students  who  go  to  that  school  are  members  of  the  Tribe. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That's  what  ­­ what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State  can  do,  but  the  State  wouldn't  be  obliged  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  wouldn't  be  obliged  to  provide  schools? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  see  no  basis  for  the  State  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refuse  to  provide  services  to  its  own  citizens, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially  if  they  are  not  members  of  the  Tribe. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  sovereignty. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KEDEM:  The  State  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  This  is  ­­ this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reservation.  That's  your  argument.  It's  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

reservation,  and  that's  not  the  ­­ the  State  land,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  spend  our  money  for  schools  or  whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  ­­ in  the  State,  not  on  the  reservation.

impression,  after  my  friend's  argument,  that  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  stop  issuing  environmental  permits  and  all  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sudden  the  Tribe  would  start  issuing  them.  That  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct.  First  of  all,  the  Environmental  Protection 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Agency  has  been  administering  on  the  west  side  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation,  including  providing  permits  for  animal  feed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots.  There's  also  a  permit  for  wastewater  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  Environmental 

  

 

 

 

Protection  Agency,  which  ­­ the  State  or  Federal? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Federal.  Federal. 

  

  

 

            

­­ including  a  permit  for  a  wastewater 

   

   

 

 

treatment  facility,  although  I  believe  it  discharges 

   

 

 

 

 

into  Logon  Creek  on  the  east  side;  so  it  may  not  tell  us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  that  much  about  the  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  our  ­­ our  questions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  been,  suppose  that  you  prevail,  what  can  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do?  And  we  say,  oh,  it's  a  practical  matter.  Don't 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

worry.  They  won't  do  ­­ the  Tribe  won't  do  anything. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Tribe  won't  do  anything.  What  could  the  Tribe  do? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  What  could  the  Tribe  do?

MR.  KEDEM:  So  the  things  that  the  Tribe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

members. 

            

could  do  would  be  any  express  delegation  of  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Congress.  The  only  one  that  we've  heard  about  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  alcohol  ordinance.  Beyond  that,  the  State  and  Tribe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  go  back  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  We  heard  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

fuel  ­­ the  revenue  sharing  of  the  fuel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  right.  There  was  an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

agreement  to  share  revenue  fuel,  although  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  the  State  entered  into  voluntarily  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Tribe.  Beyond  that,  the  Tribe  would  have  to  fall 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  one  of  the  two  Montana  exceptions,  which  are,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  is  aware  of  because  of  the  Dollar  General 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  very  limited. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  suppose  one  reason 

    

 

 

 

 

the  Tribe  might  ­­ might  not  provide  services  is  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  area  is  98­point­whatever  percent  nonTribal,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

correct. 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  that's  absolutely 

    

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  they  would  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  services  would  be  for  the  ­­ how  many?  Nine  ­­ nine

MR.  KEDEM:  They  could,  but  if  we're  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  effect  on  nonmembers,  they  would  have  to  fall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  one  ­­ one  of  the  two  Montana  exceptions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Okay.  But  at  least  as  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Tribal  members  in  the  west  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  That's  right.  Tribal  members  on 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  reservation  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ they  would  be  subject  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Tribe's  jurisdiction  which  they  otherwise  would  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  that  that's  accurate. 

    

 

 

 

 

If  I  could  go  to  the  City  of  Sherrill  argument,  which

extremely  different  from  the  City  of  Sherrill  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  reasons,  but  let  me  give  you  two  big  ones. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  the  City  of  Sherrill,  this  Court  held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  principles  of  equity  restrained  the  Tribe  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  resurrect  a  claim  of  inherent  sovereign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

immunity.

In  this  case  by  contrast,  first  of  all, 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  not  just  talking  about  the  Tribe's  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We're  talking  about  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  as  well. 

 

 

            

And  second  of  all,  we're  not  talking  about  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  of  inherent  authority.  This  is  authority 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exercised  pursuant  to  a  Federal  statute,  18  U.S.C.  1161. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  it  ­­ for  that  reason,  principles  of  equity  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  apply  here. 

 

 

            

            

Moreover,  in  City  of  Sherrill  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  understand  that. 

    

 

 

 

Try  ­­ try  it  again. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

apply  here? 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Principles  of  equity  do  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KEDEM:  They  don't  apply  in  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  So  in  City  of  Sherrill  the  Court  applied  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

latches­type  reasoning.  But  latches  would  not  apply  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent  the  exercise  of  authority  under  a  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  an  express  delegation  of  authority  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  law. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Why  not? 

  

 

 

MR.  KEDEM:  Because  that's  what  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said,  for  instance,  in  the  copyright  decision  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg  recently  wrote,  which  is  that  when  you

not  to  be  ­­ apply  and  be  displaced  when  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  law  that  Congress  passes  to  deal  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  issue. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  law  that 

  

 

 

 

 

authorized  the  imposition  of  these  taxes  in  the  western 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  reservation. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  The  law  authorizes  the  exercise 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  this  authority  if  there  is  a  reservation  and  if  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  applies  to  the  Department  of  the  Interior,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  approve  the  ordinance. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  doesn't  that 

  

 

 

 

 

beg  the  question?  The  question  was  whether  or  not  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation  has  been  diminished.  So  it's  not  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation. 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Well,  that's  the  question  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  application  of  the  statute.  But  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  talking  about  City  of  Sherrill,  we're  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  background  equitable  principles.  And  I'm  simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

making  the  point  that  those  principles  don't  apply  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  an  express  congressional  statute  dealing  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  issue.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Explain  why  not. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  KEDEM:  ­­ we're  not  talking  about  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  Tribe  can  do.  We're  also  talking  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  as  well.  And  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  nothing  in  the  City  of  Sherrill  which  suggests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  pursuant  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  creation  of  a  reservation  can  be  curtailed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  Tribe's  failure  to  exercise  authority  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputed  area. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Frankly,  I'm  more  ­­ I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

more  inclined  to  vote  your  way  if  the  City  of  Sherrill 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  apply  than  if  the  City  of  Sherrill  doesn't  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  you're  telling  me  is,  unless  you  get  there  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solem,  it  doesn't  matter  whether  the  State  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­Indians  have  for  generations  viewed  this  land  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  own.  That's  what  you're  telling  me,  right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Well,  I'm  telling  you  that  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  extent  City  of  Sherrill  applies,  it  applies  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  different  question,  not  the  question  as  to  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  borders  of  the  reservation  are.  It  applies  to  the

sovereignty  do?  Now,  it  might  under  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  if  the  Tribe  tried  to  repurchase  a  bunch 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  land  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  not  what  city  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  what  Sherrill  said.  Sherrill  said  the  Tribe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  no  jurisdiction.  It  said  it  had  no  sovereignty  over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  area  anymore. 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Again,  the  diminishment  question 

  

 

 

 

 

goes  not  just  to  the  Tribe's  sovereignty  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  as  well  of  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  we're  talking  about  expectations, 

 

 

 

 

 

another  point  that  I  would  make  is  that  the  single  best 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  what  these  parties  could  have  expected  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  retrocession,  because  that  was  a  unique  moment  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  State  of  Nebraska  and  the  United  States  talked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  and  officially  to  one  another  about  the  burdens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  responsibilities  for  exercising  jurisdiction  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation.  And  the  United  States  in  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

register,  as  official  as  can  be,  said  the  entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation  remains  intact. 

 

 

            

And  the  State  of  Nebraska,  as  we  point  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  brief,  had  exactly  the  same  understanding.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistant  attorney  general  for  Nebraska  came  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified  before  Congress  that  all  of  Thurston  County  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  Winnebago  and  within  the  Omaha  Reservation.

MR.  KEDEM:  Not  in  the  least.  It  goes  to  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  what  I  think. 

   

  

 

 

MR.  KEDEM:  I  was  simply  responding  to  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

point  that  the  expectations  here  might  be  all  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  direction. 

 

              

I  would  also  point  to  30  years  of  Nebraska 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revenue  rulings,  all  of  which  say,  point  blank,  Pender 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  still  part  of  the  reservation.  I  would  also  point  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  definition  of  Thurston  County. 

 

 

 

 

            

As  my  friend  pointed  out,  Pender  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

county  seat.  I  think  it's  implausible  to  know  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ to  assert  that  the  State  of  Nebraska  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  that  its  own  law  specifies  that  all  of  Thurston 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

County  is  within  the  reservations  of  the  Omaha  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Winnebagos. 

              

I  would  also  like  to  address,  if  I  could, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  tipping  point  theory  that  I  think  emerges  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  reply  brief,  and  that's  the  idea  that  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1872,  Congress  tried  but  failed  to  diminish  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation  because  there  were  only  about  300  acres 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sold.  But  in  1882,  it  succeeded  because  a  lot  more  land 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  sold.  I  think  there  are  a  lot  of  problems  with  this 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory.

First  of  all,  if  that  was  what  Congress  had

percentage  of  land  sales,  some  other  measure  of  success. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  nothing  about  that  in  the  text.  There's  nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  that  in  the  legislative  history. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second  of  all,  the  concept  that  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  attempt  but  fail  to  diminish  a  reservation,  as  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend  said  that  it  did  in  1872,  is  a  concept  that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholly  foreign  to  this  Court's  jurisprudence,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  clear  that  Congress  has  plenary  power. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  finally,  I  think  this  Court  should  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

very  reluctant  to  assume  that  Congress  implicitly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transferred  any  part  of  its  authority  to  change  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borders  of  an  Indian  reservation  to  private  parties  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  it  contingent  on  what  this  Court  in  Dakota  referred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  as  uncertain  future  sales. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  is  that  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  such  thing  as  de  facto  diminishment? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  that  de  facto 

    

 

 

 

 

diminishment,  if  you  think  of  it  as  some  sort  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

freestanding  alternative  path  to  change  the  boundaries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  reservation,  I  do  agree  that  it  doesn't  exist. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  you're  talking  about  it  ­­

consistent  with  the  language  in  Solem  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg  read? 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  ­­ I  think  it's  a  little  bit 

    

   

   

 

 

 

hard  to  know  exactly  what  the  court  meant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court  has  never  found  de  facto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminishment.  All  seven  of  its  surplus  land  cases  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  on  the  basis  of  congressional  intent.  And  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  sometimes  a  few  sentences  thrown  in  about  how 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  status  quo  wouldn't  change  very  much. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  want  to  leave  you  with  one  more  point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  about  Sherrill? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Pardon? 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  about  Sherrill? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  Sherrill  is  very  explicit,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  not  a  diminishment  ruling.  There's  a  footnote  in 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

City  of  Sherrill  which  makes  very  clear  that  it  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  the  diminishment  issue  or  the  jurisdiction  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What's  ­­ what's 

  

 

 

 

 

vague  about  the  language  where  non­Indian  settlers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flooded  into  the  opened  portion  of  a  reservation  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area  has  long  since  lost  its  Indian  character,  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledged  that  de  facto,  if  not  de  jure  diminishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  have  occurred.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  I  think  if  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  passage,  it  goes  on,  then,  to  discuss  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addition  to  that,  then  we  look  to  subsequent  demographic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  as  an  additional  clue  as  to  what  Congress  meant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  read  those  as  the  two  different  paragraphs  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  two  different  points. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KEDEM:  I  think  you  could  definitely 

    

 

 

 

 

read  it  that  way  if  you  just  had  Solem.  I  think  if  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  Solem  in  light  of  Yankton  Sioux,  you  reach  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  result. 

 

            

If  I  could  make  one  final  point  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unsettling  expectations.  There  are  more  than  300 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federally­recognized  Indian  reservations  all  throughout 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States.  The  single  most  unsettling  thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  Court  could  do  would  be  to  suggest  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borders  of  those  reservations  depend  not  on  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  said  about  them,  but  on  shifting  demographic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patterns  or  who  provides  what  services  where. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions.

Mr.  Smith,  you  have  four  minutes  remaining. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

           

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JAMES  D.  SMITH 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  SMITH:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

Where  do  I  start? 

   

 

Let's  start  first  with  ­­ pointed  out  to  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  co­counsel  that  a  misstatement  I  made  in  response  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan.  The  Eighth  Circuit  briefs  do  cite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sherrill  in  support  of  the  proposition  for  de  facto 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminishment.  My  apology.  I  hadn't  argued  at  that 

    

  

 

 

 

 

point,  but  it  is  there  in  the  Eighth  Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  cite  to  the  Joint  Appendixes  so  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  is  aware  exactly  where  it  can  find  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undisputed,  as  far  as  the  demographics,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  history,  JA  215  to  JA  216,  JA  318  to  JA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

319,  JA  609  to  JA  611. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ the  concept  that,  gee,  nothing  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

big's  going  to  change,  having  the  Tribal  police  show  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  their  police  vehicles  patrolling  the  streets  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  on  Tribal  land  is  going  to  be  a  huge  disruption  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expectations. 

            

My  background  is  in  criminal  law.  I  know  if 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  a  crime  you're  investigating,  you  don't  know  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  all  crimes,  you  know,  there's  not  a  sign  saying  gee,

this  was  committed  by  an  Indian;  this  was  committed  by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­Indian.  You  have  a  lot  of  who­done­its  in  which  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  who's  supposed  to  investigate,  and  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  overlapping  jurisdiction  where  law  enforcement 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  is  confused  as  to  who's  supposed  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigating  when  they  don't  even  know,  maybe,  who  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetrator  is. 

 

            

The  idea  that  a  Tribal  member  of  a  State 

   

   

 

 

 

 

governmental  authority  is  somehow  shows  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Excuse  me.  Wouldn't  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

wouldn't  the  latter  be  the  case  with  respect  to  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

municipality  that's  within  a  reservation?  We've  been 

   

  

 

 

 

told  there  are  a  lot  of  those.  And  ­­ and  wouldn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ wouldn't  that  be  a  problem  in  all  of  those, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  that  you  have  overlapping  jurisdiction  of  Tribal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police  and  municipal  police?  And  until  you  know  who  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetrator  is,  you  don't  know  which  one  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

MR.  SMITH:  It's  a  problem  if  you  know,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

chose  to  live  on  an  Indian  reservation.  It  ­­ it  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  that  exists. 

 

 

            

What's  different  in  this  case  is  the  history 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  130  years  of  people  who  believe  and  chose.  And  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  living  on  an  Indian  reservation;  they  are  living 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  State  of  Nebraska.  I  call  the  State  patrol.  The

Tribal  police  are  not  patrolling  up  and  down  my  street. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  difference.  It's  the  justifiable 

  

 

 

 

 

expectations  of  the  people  who  live  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Their  point  is,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

government  says,  fine,  make  that  argument.  Make  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  rubric  City  of  Sherrill.  Maybe  you  make  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  you  go  down  on  remand  or  something,  but  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workable  to  divide  the  issue  into  two  parts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  first  issue  is  what's  the  reservation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  second  issue  is  what  can  you  do  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation? 

            

When  you  get  to  question  two,  if  the  Tribe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  made  no  assertion  of  jurisdiction,  nobody  even  knows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  it  for  150  years.  Maybe  it's  basically  unfair  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let  them  do  what  they  want  to  do.  And  that  depends  on  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  factors,  such  as  what  Congress  says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  do  you  think  of  that  argument? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Let's  leave  it  for  later.  Nobody's  argued  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SMITH:  Glad  I  didn't  answer  what  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

thought  of  that  argument. 

 

 

 

            

Your  Honor,  what  ­­ it  is  still  ­­ invites 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  litigation  over  what  is  the  extent  of  the  power. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Who's  got  the  power  to  govern?  What  is  the  extent  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  power?  Uncertainty,  when  you  have  expectations, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  live  in  an  area  where  the  State  governs  you,  and

then  to  say  we  can  go  back  and  litigate  all  these  issues

The  people  in  Pender,  this  is  a  big  deal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  care  about  this.  They  have  expectations.  It's  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

big  deal  whether  a  Tribe  ­­ Tribal  Council  has  authority
