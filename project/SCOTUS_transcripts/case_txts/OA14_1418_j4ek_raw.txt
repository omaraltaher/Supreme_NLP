CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this  morning  in  Case  14­1418,  Zubik  v.  Burwell,  and  the

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS  IN 

 

 

 

           

NOS.  15­35,  15­05,  15­119  &  15­191 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor  and  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co­petitioners  face  a  dilemma  that  the  Religious  Freedom 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Restoration  Act  does  not  allow.  They  can  adhere  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  religious  beliefs  and  pay  millions  of  dollars  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalties,  or  they  can  take  steps  that  they  believe  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  religiously  and  morally  objectionable,  and  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  deems  necessary,  for  them  to  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraception  coverage  through  their  health  care  plans. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  government  concedes  the  sincerity 

 

 

 

 

 

of  these  religious  beliefs,  but  it  attempts  to  recast 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  as  an  objection  to  the  very  act  of  opting  out  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objecting.  And  with  all  due  respect,  that  is  simply  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrably  not  true.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  you  explain  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  analogy  with  military  objectors  during  the  war? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Many  of  them  felt  that  ­­ genuine  belief;  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pacifists  ­­ that  if  they  registered  as  pacifists,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  mean  other  people  would  have  to  serve  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  lieu.  They  were  going  to  jail,  and  many  of  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  go  to  jail,  because  of  this  belief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why  is  going  to  jail  less  burdensome  or  less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  than  paying  a  financial  penalty? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Oh,  I  ­­ I  don't  think  it  is, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor.  But  let  me  stick  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conscientious  objector  example  in  the  draft  context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  think  the  way  to  analyze  a  conscientious 

   

   

 

 

 

 

objector  case  is  to  say  that  because  they  face  jail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time,  there's  clearly  a  substantial  burden.  Of  course, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  get  to  the  second  part  of  the  analysis,  and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  would  insist  on  a  conscientious  objector 

   

 

 

 

 

actually  objecting. 

 

            

But  I  think  it's  important  to  distinguish 

   

 

 

 

 

between  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Let's  stop  there. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  To  the  extent  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conscientious  objector's  good  faith  belief  is  that  if  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

register,  someone  will  serve  in  my  lieu,  what  burden  is

it  on  the  government?  Meaning,  if  ­­ if  you're  looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  it  in  terms  of  strict  scrutiny,  the  government  sends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  how  many  notices  to  people  to  come  and  serve? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ten  ­­ you  know,  1,000,  1,200.  Do  you  really  think  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  a  difference  if  it  knows  whether  or  not  one  person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  going  to  show  up?  And  if  we're  going  down  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

road  of  what's  the  difference,  why  would  that  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

survive? 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  think  it  would,  because  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  would  be  very  difficult  to  administer  that  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  system  if  either  you  couldn't  even  know  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection  or  you  couldn't  take  any  steps  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  part  to  fill  the  spot. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But  I  think  what's  critical  ­­

   

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  then,  isn't  that 

  

 

 

 

 

the  same  thing  here?  If  you  don't  know  who  can  pay,  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  ­­ who's  not  eligible,  or  who's  eligible  to  pay,  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  this  system  work? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  two  things,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

One,  this  is  perhaps  the  unique  government  program  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  can  provide  an  exemption  without  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requiring  somebody  to  opt  out,  because  that's  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  do  for  the  churches,  for  the  integrated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

auxiliaries,  and  the  religious  orders  ­­

tell  us  that  their  church  plans  ­­ have  to  tell  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  their  church  plans.  Somebody  has  to  tell  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  who's  eligible  or  not  eligible. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  That  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  is  that  different 

  

 

 

 

 

from  military  service? 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  first  of  all,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  that's  just  not  true  with  respect  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

churches,  their  integrated  auxiliaries,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

religious  orders  that  stick  to  their  knitting  and  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engage  in  religious  activity.  So  factually,  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  distinction. 

 

            

But  I  think  the  more  important  thing,  Your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  is  I  would  distinguish  between  the  situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where  somebody  has  an  objection  to  opting  out  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  going  to  take  wholly  independent  steps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  find  somebody  to  fill  their  spot,  and  a  conscientious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objector  who  objects  to  objecting  on  a  form  where  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  way  they  can  object  is  if  they  list  the  name  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  else  who's  draft­eligible  who  will  then  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligated  to  serve  in  their  stead.  I  would  ­­

mischaracterizes  your  position,  and  I  was  just  not  quite 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  where  that  argument  was  taking  us.  You're  getting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  into  the  specifics  of  it  now,  but  could  you  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

begin  again  there,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  ­­

    

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ again,  what  we  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about? 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  would  be  delighted  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

delighted  to  do  that,  Justice  Kennedy. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

My  point  was  simply  that  my  clients  do  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

object  to  objecting.  And  part  of  the  reason  you  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  they  have  not  been  shy  about  objecting.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told  the  government  in  the  regulatory  process  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  making  a  mistake  when  they  eliminated  the  true 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  to  religious  orders  to  only  those  orders  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stuck  to  purely  religious  things.  And  my  client  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Little  Sisters  could  not  go  out  because  they  serve  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elderly  poor  on  a  nondenominational  basis.  That's  why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

they  don't  qualify  for  the  exemption.  So  they  objected 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then.  They  objected  when  they  filed  this  lawsuit.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaffirmed  their  objection  when  they  filed  the  notice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  necessary  to  comply  with  this  Court's  interim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection.

might  be  so.  But  what  happens  if  somebody  did  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

object  to  objecting?  It  seems  all  your  arguments  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  the  same  way.  In  other  words,  somebody  comes  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  says,  I  do  object  to  objecting  because  objecting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  make  it  easier  for  the  government  to  fill  my  slot. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  a  perfectly  understandable  thing  to  say.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that's  part  of  my  sincere  religious  belief.  And  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sincere  religious  belief  is  what  controls.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  too  it  would  seem  under  your  very  theory  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  say  that  that's  a  substantial  burden,  even  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  objecting  to  objecting. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Two  things,  Justice  Kagan. 

  

 

 

 

 

First,  it  would  only  qualify  as  a  substantial  burden  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  objection  requirement  was  enforced  with  massive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalties.  And  that's  a  relatively  rare  situation,  but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ but  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes.  Yes.  I  mean,  we  have 

    

  

  

 

 

 

the  same  penalties  that  we  have  here,  and  the  person  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  objecting  to  objecting.  And  that's  part  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious  belief  because  that  will  make  it  more  likely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  government  will  be  able  to  fill  the  slot  and  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  efforts  to,  you  know,  to  ­­ to  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptives. 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  understand,  Justice  Kagan. 

    

 

 

 

That  brings  me  to  the  second  part  of  my  answer,  which  is

I  think  the  right  way  to  understand  that  hypothetical  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  was  explaining  to  Justice  Kennedy,  it's  just  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  it's  a  hypothetical 

   

  

 

 

that's  directly  implicated  by  your  very  theory  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  because  your  theory  of  the  case  says  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  depends  on  a  person  coming  in  saying  this  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  my  religion,  and  that  being  the  end­all  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be­all. 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  don't  think  that's  our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

position.  Our  position  is  that  ­­ the  sincerity  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious  beliefs.  The  government  can  question  them. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They've  conceded  to  them  here.  There  is  a  legal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  about  the  substantial  burden,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  burden  analysis  in  this  case  is  very  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  these  millions  of  dollars  in  penalties,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exact  same  penalties  that  were  issued  in  Hobby  Lobby. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  Court  said  it  was  an  easy  case  on  substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You're  just  not  answering 

  

 

 

 

 

the  question. 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I'm  trying  ­­ I'm  trying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to,  with  all  due  respect,  which  is  that  brings  to  ­­ if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  everything  else  the  same,  that  brings  you  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  second  part  of  the  RFRA  analysis.  And  I  would  think

if  our  objection,  contrary  to  fact,  were  we  absolutely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

object  to  objecting,  if  you  come  in  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  ­­ based  on  our  objection,  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides  the  service  through  the  Exchanges,  through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Title  X,  through  an  Aetna  uber­policy  where  everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gets  their  contraceptives,  some  overall  government 

 

 

 

 

 

policy,  we,  in  fact,  object  to  none  of  those  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  if  we  did,  I  think  we  would  lose  under  the  second 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  of  the  RFRA  analysis,  because  I  think  that's  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  analysis. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  if  I  understand  that 

   

  

 

 

 

answer,  it's  that  if  a  person  had  a  sincere  religious 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

belief  that  objecting  to  objecting  was  a  form  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicity,  then  that  would  control,  and  you  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  go  to  the  second  part  of  the  analysis,  which  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  is  there  a  compelling  interest  test?  Has  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

government's  response  been  narrowly  tailored?  But 

  

 

 

 

 

essentially,  the  objecting  ­­ the  difference  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objecting  to  objecting  and  your  clients'  position  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  difference  at  all  with  respect  to  the  burden  analysis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  I  do  think  my  clients' 

   

  

 

 

 

 

objection  is  distinguishable  from  the  hypothetical, 

 

 

 

 

 

because  this  is  not  an  objecting  to  objecting.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  one  way  to  understand  this  is,  if  there  were,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  two  forms,  one  was  an  opt­out  form,  one  was  an

authorization  form,  my  clients  would  have  no  objection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  signing  the  opt­out  form.  They  would  very  much  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  objection  to  the  authorization  form.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  what  I'm  saying,  Mr. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Clement,  is  I  understand  the  factual  distinction  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you're  making,  but  the  factual  distinction  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  given  your  own  legal  analysis. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  don't  think  it  does  based  on 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  precedents  either,  but  even  if  I'm  wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  that,  you  could  certainly  write  an  opinion  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  there  are  three  legs  to  the  stool  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  is  the  fact  that  the  government  demands  more  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  objection,  the  fact  that  it  enforces  it  with  massive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalties,  and  the  reality  that  if  that  happens,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  going  to  hijack  our  health  plans  and  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  coverage  against  our  will. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  I  don't  understand, 

   

  

 

 

Mr.  Clement,  is  when  will  any  government  law  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  claims  burdens  their  practice  ever  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insubstantial?  Because  every  believer  that's  ever  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

before  us,  including  the  people  in  the  military,  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  my  soul  will  be  damned  in  some  way.  I'm  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naysaying  that  that  is  a  very  substantial  perceived 

   

 

 

 

 

 

personal  burden  by  them.  But  if  that's  always  going  to

MR.  CLEMENT:  Two  things  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ that  won't  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problem? 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Two  things,  Justice  Sotomayor. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  first  is  that  I  do  think  that  what  you're  saying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  government  not  being  able  to  function  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  substantial  burden  and  then  the  least  restrictive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  analysis,  that's  exactly  what  Justice  Scalia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  for  the  Court  in  the  Smith  decision.  And  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

O'Connor  took  a  different  view.  And  they  had  a  healthy 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

debate.  And  you  can  question  who  had  the  better  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate,  but  there  is  no  question  which  side  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debate  settled  things. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  it's  the  side  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  debate  that  settles,  which  is  if  we  are  not  asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  to  do  anything  except  identify  yourself,  and  if  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  going  to  do  the  action  is  either  the  government  or  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third  party,  that  that's  the  balance  that  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

struck,  that  it's  not  a  substantial  burden  if  someone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

else  is  going  to  do  the  act  that  you're  objecting  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Justice  Sotomayor,  if  the  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

action  involved  is  a  third­party  action  like  in  part  of

the  Bowen  against  Roy  case  or  in  the  Lyng  case,  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right,  that's  not  a  substantial  burden.  But  when  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

government  says  ­­ and  it  needs  more.  I  want  to  be  as 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  as  I  can  about  this.  The  government  admits  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages  87  through  89  of  their  brief  that  they  need  more, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  then,  to  know  that  we  raise  our  hand  and  opt  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  also  need  additional  information  about  our  insurer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  our  TPA.  So  they  require  more.  So  ­­ and  ­­ if  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  they  ­­ what  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

than  ­­ who  is  the  TPA?  Who  is  the  insurer?  That's

need. 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  That's  what  they  say  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  then  they  have  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

independent  contract.  The  insurer  or  the  TPA  is  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  dealing  with  the  employer  at  all.  It  has  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  obligation  that  is  imposed  by  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  it,  and  not  the  ­­ not  the  company. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Justice  Ginsburg,  that's  true 

  

 

 

 

 

if  and  only  if  we  provide  the  form,  because  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  the  information  on  the  form.  The  government  treats 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  form  as  an  authorization.  In  the  case  of

authorization.  The  government  ­­ the  law  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  requires  it,  but  it  doesn't  matter  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  say  yes  or  no.  And  you  could  say,  I  fill  out  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form.  I  do  not  authorize.  I  do  not  permit.  It  won't 

    

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

make  any  difference. 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  It  makes  all  the  difference, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg.  If  we  don't  provide  the  form,  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  coverage  doesn't  flow.  We  haven't  provided  the  form 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  these  cases,  and  as  a  result,  the  coverage  hasn't

obvious  with  respect  to  the  self­insured  plans,  but  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  of  all  of  them.  The  government  thinks  it  needs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  from  us  so  it  can  take  that  something  and  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  a  plan  document. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Because  the  government 

  

 

 

 

has  another  interest  at  stake  in  ­­ one  thing  you  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  want  it  clear  that  this  is  not  involved  at  all. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No  one  doubts  for  a  moment  the  sincerity  of  the  belief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  your  client  and  all  the  others.  And  since  sincerity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  their  belief  is  accepted,  it's  off  the  table,  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  the  sincerity  of  belief  of  the  parents  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Roy  case  was  questioned.  In  none  of  these  cases  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  issue.  That's  accepted. 

  

 

 

            

But  the  government  has  acted  in  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  you  know,  the  ­­ the  original  health  care  plan  didn't

provide  these  covered  services  for  women,  and  it  saw  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelling  interest  there,  a  need  that  was  marginally 

   

 

 

 

 

 

ignored  up  until  then.  So  as  in  all  things,  it  can't  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  my  way.  There  has  to  be  an  accomodation,  and  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  government  tried  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  agree,  Justice  Ginsburg,  but 

    

 

 

 

 

just  because  they  call  it  an  accomodation  doesn't  mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  immune  from  RFRA  analysis.  And  if  what  they  gave 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  clients  is  what  they  gave  the  345,000  churches,  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrated  auxiliaries  and  the  purely  religious 

 

 

 

 

 

activities  of  religious  orders,  if  they  gave  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accomodation  to  my  client,  we'd  fill  out  any  form  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to.  But  the  problem  is  we  have  to  fill  out  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form,  and  the  consequence  of  us  filling  out  that  form  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  will  be  treated  very  differently  from  those  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious  employers. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  It  doesn't  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  started  to  talk  about  ­­

case  that  the  form  or  the  notice  to  HHS  in  that  instance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes  a  plan  instrument? 

   

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  In  both  cases,  Your  Honor,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes  a  plan  instrument,  and  I  think  ­­ you  know,  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  thinks  that  our  notification  in  this  case  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  functional  equivalent  of  the  EBSA  700  Form,  and  the

reason  they  required  a  form  ­­ and  this  shows  you  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  really  an  opt  out,  because  the  way  the  regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  originally  designed,  you  didn't  raise  your  hand  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  the  government,  I  object.  You  sent  a  form  directly 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  the  insurer  or  directly  to  the  TPA  that  they  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated  as  the  permission  slip  to  provide  the  coverage. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  that's  out  now. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  no,  it's  not  out. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's  actually  still  one  of  the  ways  that  you  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Yes,  but  you  don't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  that.  You  can  notify  the  government. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Well,  the  alternative,  thanks 

  

 

 

 

 

to  this  Court  in  its  interim  relief,  is  that  we  now  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file  an  objection  that  the  government  treats  exactly  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  way.  All  they  do  that's  different  is  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  ­­ it's  a  mailing  rule.  They  take  our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

objection  and  then  they  provide  that  objection  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third­party  administrator,  and  at  least  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­insured  plans,  that  becomes  every  bit  as  much  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  document  as  the  EBSA  Form  700. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  with  all  due  respect,  it's  a  little  rich 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  government  to  say,  This  isn't  your  plan,  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worry  about  this,  when  their  whole  interest  is  put  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms  of  seamless  coverage.  If  it's  seamless  to  the

perception  that  it's  seamless  to  them,  and  they  are,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  complicit  is  an  irrational  belief  by  any  stretch. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  the  ­­ is  the  essence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  your  argument  that  ­­ and  your  objection  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptive  coverage  is  ­­ is  being  done  through  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  insurance  that  you  contract  with? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  That's  ­­ I  think  that's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

fair  description  of  it,  Justice  Kennedy.  And  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  problem  the  government  is  having  understanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  position  is  that  that  health  plan  is  somewhat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intangible.  And  I  think  if  you  put  this  in  more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tangible  terms,  if  the  ­­ if  the  consequence  of  us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing  the  form  was  that  they  would  come  in  to  one  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Little  Sisters  homes  and  set  up  shop  in  a  room,  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  pay  us  rent,  it  wouldn't  cost  us  a  thing.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  they  operated  a  Title  X  clinic  out  of  our  homes?  I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  everyone  would  understand  that,  of  course,  we  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicit  in  the  coverage  that's  provided  on  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premises.  And  just  because  this  is  more  intangible,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  the  principle  is  any  different,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  from  the  perspective  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Do  we  accept  the  ­­ your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients'  view  on  complicity,  or  do  we  have  a  Palsgraf

we  just  accept  your  view  on  complicity  and  then  just  see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  the  accomodation  is  possible  on  this  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  least  restrictive? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  I  think  that's  the  role  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

your  courts  have  had  for  the  Court,  because  I  think  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  want  to  get  in  the  role  of  having  the  truth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detector  test,  and  that  ­­ and  that's  not  just  the  Hobby 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lobby  decision.  That  goes  back  to  the  Thomas  decision. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  you  remember  that  decision,  you  had  a  religious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

adherent  who  had  an  objection  to  formulating  cylindrical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tanks  ­­ cylindrical  things  that  would  go  into  tanks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  there  was  another  Jehovah's  Witness 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  in  the  record  that  said,  You  don't  need  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

object  to  that.  That's  not  that  big  a  deal.  It's  too 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

attenuated.  And  this  Court  specifically  said,  We're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  get  in  the  business  of  refereeing  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputes,  and  we're  not  going  to  get  in  the  business  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  figure  out  and  second­guessing  whether  Mr. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thomas  is  really  correctly  misunderstanding  his  faith. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  here  you  have  a  ton  of  amicus  briefs 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  reinforce  that  the  religious  beliefs  that  are  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  here  for  the  Little  Sisters  and  for  my  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients  are  not  at  all  idiosyncratic,  are  not  at  all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  wrong  as  a  matter  of  faith.  But  that's  not  an

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Are  you  finished? 

  

 

 

 

MR.  CLEMENT:  Yeah,  I  am. 

   

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  I  have  ­­ You 

    

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

must  have  thought  about  this  question,  I  suspect.  I'll 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

assume,  I  want  to  assume  for  purposes  of  the  question, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  isn't  just  a  matter  of  signing  a  form  with  an 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection.  Your  ­­ your  clients  are  involved  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  care  plan  in  major  ways.  They  probably  figure  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sign  papers  every  five  months  or  every  day,  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose  insurers.  They  do  all  kinds  of  things.  And  it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  topping,  the  icing  on  the  cake,  that  pushes  it  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  edge,  which  is  that  you  have  to  fill  out  the  form 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  I  object,  this  is  my  insurer,  you  then  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact  my  employees,  da,  da,  da,  da,  da.  It's  a  whole 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bunch  of  things. 

 

 

            

All  right.  So  the  question  is,  putting  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  together  now,  are  they  protected  by  RFRA?  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  that  the  Court  went  from  Sherbert  and  Verner 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  to  Smith  was  they  couldn't  figure  out  how  to  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sherbert  and  Verner.  And  it's  Sherbert  and  Verner  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RFRA  picks  up.  And  this  is  at  least  one  difficulty  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  which  is  where  I'm  going.  And  I've  even  read  St. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Benedict.  You  know,  not  ­­ not  for  religious  purposes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  trying  to  find  out  something  about  being  a  member  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

society.

Sometimes  when  a  religious  person  who's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

a  hermit  or  a  monk  is  a  member  of  society,  he  does  have 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  accept  all  kinds  of  things  that  are  just  terrible  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him.  Think  of  the  Quakers,  the  Quakers  who  object  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vietnam.  Think  of  the  people  who  object  to  laws 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protecting  blasphemy.  Think  of  the  people  who  object  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shoveling  the  snow  in  front  of  the  walk  that  will  lead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  abortion  clinic.  Think  of  the  Christian 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scientists  who  know  when  they  report  the  accident,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child  will  go  to  the  hospital  or  the  adult  and  receive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical  care  that  is  against  their  religion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  there  are  loads  of  things.  I've  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  you  four.  Think  of  the  taxes.  Well,  there's  no 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  that  doesn't  violate  the  religious  clause.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plenty  of  other  things  do.  So  what's  the  line?  Why  do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Quakers  have  to  pay  the  taxes  for  Vietnam,  but  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  find  the  religious  Jew  or  Muslim  getting  an  extra 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day  off  during  the  week  when  the  law  says  nobody  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  on  Sunday  because  their  sabbath  is  on  Saturday? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  is  the  line? 

 

 

 

            

And  I've  been  reading  and  reading  to  try  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  a  fairly  clear  simple  statement  of  what  that  line 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  and  how  it  works.  And  to  repeat  the  difficulty  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sherbert  and  Verner,  which  is  what  RFRA  does,  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

honestly,  doesn't  help  me.  But  you  might.

MR.  CLEMENT:  I'm  going  to  try,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  and  then  I'm  going  to  try  to  reserve  my  time  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rebuttal. 

            

So  what  I  would  say  to  you  is  you're  exactly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right,  that  Smith  was  a  much  more  administrable  world,

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Did  ­­ did  they  tell  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  worked? 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Absolutely.  So  here's  the  way 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  you  work  it  and  draw  the  line.  You  first  ask,  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  a  substantial  burden  on  religious  exercise?  That 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  going  to  weed  out  some  claims.  If  I  was  trying  to

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  the  Quaker,  the  Quaker. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

You  think  that  wasn't  a  substantial  burden? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  No,  no,  no.  I'm  just  trying 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  tell  you  that  that's  one  step.  It  will  weed  out  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims.  I  do  think  then  there's  going  to  be  work  to  be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  on  the  second  half  of  the  test,  and  I  think  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  some  fairly  obvious  differences  between  a  regime 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where  essentially  the  government  itself  by  its  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions  has  showed  that  people  can't  opt  out.  It's  too 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important.  It's  too  universal. 

  

 

 

            

And  then  you  come  at  a  case  like  this,  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  Sherbert  itself.  The  thing  that  made  Sherbert  an

easy  case  was  the  government  of  South  Carolina  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  taken  care  of  the  Sunday  objectors.  So  at  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  their  argument  that  the  whole  system  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collapse  if  we  take  care  of  the  Sabattarians,  it  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  particularly  persuasive  argument. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

Here,  they've  taken  care  of  the  churches. 

 

 

 

 

They've  taken  care  of  a  religious  order  just  like  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Little  Sisters,  if  only  the  Little  Sisters  wouldn't  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  and  care  for  the  elderly  and  poor.  They've

The  government  here  has  the  same  interest

employer­based  plan.  Yet  for  all  of  these  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees,  the  government  tells  us  that  it  furthers  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  other  ways.  The  government,  therefore, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

needs  to  prove  that  those  other  ways  are  somehow

insufficient  when  it  comes  to  Petitioners'  employees, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  sum  total  of  their  showing  in  this  case  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  to  less  than  one  column  of  one  page  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Register.  That  is  simply  insufficient  before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  can  demand  that  organizations  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Catholic  Charities  and  the  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engage  in  conduct  that  all  agree  here  they  regard  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sinful. 

            

Instead,  what  we  have  here  is  a  religious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

employer  definition,  that  is,  those  organizations  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  the  full­blown  exemption  as  opposed  to  organizations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  Petitioners  here  that  gives  a  full­blown 

   

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  to  organizations  even  if  they  don't  object  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing  contraceptive  coverage  that  treats  identical 

 

 

 

 

 

organizations  differently  where  you've  got  a  Catholic 

   

 

 

 

 

school  on  the  west  side  of  town  that  has  to  comply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Are  you  suggesting  that 

  

 

 

 

 

once  you  have  this  category,  the  church,  then  any  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organization,  religiously­oriented  organization,  has  to 

 

 

 

 

come  within  that  same  category  as  the  church  itself? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  government  can't  treat  the  church  as  special  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  it  an  exemption  that  it  doesn't  give  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious­oriented  organizations? 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  No,  Your  Honor,  I'm  not

particular,  when  you  look  at  what  Congress  has,  in  fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done,  that  is,  in  fact,  the  line  that  Congress  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawn.  Both  in  the  Title  VII  exemption  where  churches, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  the  houses  of  worship  and  religious  organizations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  our  clients  get  treated  the  same.  Like  in  the  tax 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  regime.  Here  the  government's  entire  line  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawn  from  the  tax  world  where  the  line  ­­ where  they  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  define  those  who  have  to  file  informational  tax 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

returns  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Yes,  the  government  could 

  

 

 

 

 

do  that,  but  does  it  have  to?  That  is,  can  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  say  we  are  going  to  treat  the  church  itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultra  protected?  Religious­oriented  organizations  are 

  

 

 

 

protected,  but  not  at  that  same  level. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  no,  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

think  they  can  do  that  in  the  context  of  this  regime.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  the  government  can  take  the  position  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor  are  any  less  at  the  core

university? 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  I  think  with  a  university, 

    

   

 

 

yes,  Your  Honor,  because,  again,  when  you  look  at  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  drawn  the  lines,  universities  get  the  Title 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

VII  exemption  from  ­­ for  religious  hiring.  Churches 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do.  The  Little  Sisters  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  but  then  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

answering  really  to  the  affirmative  in  ­­ to  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg's  question.  Once  you  give  it  to  a  ­­ a  church, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  give  it  to  any  other  religious  organization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  ­­ that's  your  position. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Not  quite,  Your  Honor.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think  that  the  problem  is  that  the  government  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

draw  a  definition  that  is  coherent  and  that  is  rational. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  the  problem  here  is  they've  drawn  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  from  the  tax  regime  that  doesn't  comply  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  carry  it  over  to  this  regime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  the  tax  world,  when  the  churches,  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  universities,  when  the  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file  that  informational  tax  return,  they  actually  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  exact  same  exemption  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It's  going  to  be  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  for  this  Court  to  write  an  opinion  which  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  once  you  have  a  church  organization,  you  have  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treat  a  religious  university  the  same.  I  just  find  that

very  difficult  to  write. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  And,  Your  Honor,  we're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting  that.  What  we  are  suggesting  is  that  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  has  the  same  interest  here  that  it  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  all  of  the  other  employees  in  this  country  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  get  coverage  from  a  ­­ from  an  employer­based 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  ­­ and  it's  not  just  the  religious  employers.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  the  grandfathered  plans.  In  addition,  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  self­employed,  the  unemployed,  and  the  employees  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small  businesses.  The  government  has  the  same  interest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  all  of  those  organizations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  thought  there  was  a  ­­ a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

very  strong  tradition  in  this  country,  which  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  comes  to  religious  exercises,  churches  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special,  and  that  ­­ you  know,  we  have  said  this  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recently  in  Hosanna­Tabor,  but  it's  a  long  line  of  cases 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  says  that  there's  something  very  special  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

churches  themselves. 

 

            

And  ­­ and  if  you're  saying  that  every  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  gives  an  exemption  to  churches  and  synagogues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  mosques,  that  they  have  to  open  that  up  to  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious  people,  then  the  effect  of  that  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  just  decides  not  to  give  an  exemption  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  why  there  are  some  people  who  are  extremely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong  RFRA  supporters  who  have  deserted  this  cause

right  here,  Professor  Laycock  among  them,  because  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mortal  danger  that  it  poses  to  churches. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  And,  Your  Honor,  just  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear,  I  am  not  suggesting  that  whenever  you  give  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  to  churches,  that  exemption  has  to  apply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  other  religious  organizations.  What  I  am  suggesting 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  that  when  the  government  has  the  same  interest  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  both  religious  and  secular  employees,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

churches,  the  religious  employers,  the  employees  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small  businesses,  the  employees  of  grandfathered  plans, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  government  furthers  that  interest  with  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  all  of  those  employees  in  many  other  ways  ­­ whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  the  Affordable  Care  Act  Exchanges,  whether  Title  X, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  Medicare  and  Medicaid  ­­ at  a  minimum,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  needs  to  explain  why  all  of  those  other  ways 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  sufficient  for  all  of  those  other  employees,  but

exemption  for  the  very  small  business  to  everyone? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Not  at  all,  Your  Honor.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  I  am  saying  is  if  Title  VII  had  an  exemption  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  you  can't  discriminate  on  the  basis  of  race  unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  a  pre­existing  policy  of  race  discrimination,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

which  case  you  can  maintain  that  case  in  perpetuity  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long  as  you  don't  change  it,  that's  fine,  then  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  undermine  the  ­­ the  purpose  of  Title  VII. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  precisely  the  type  of  exemption  that  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  contraceptive  mandate. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Couldn't  Congress,  or 

  

 

 

 

perhaps  the  Executive,  survey  the  employees

and  of  other  ­­ of  religious  nonprofits  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories 

of  religious  nonprofits,  the  Little  Sisters, 

 

 

 

 

 

a  big 

   

university,  and  determine  the  percentage  of

that,  and  they  could  do  many  other  things,  as  well.

religious  tenet.  And  so  why  are  we  worried  about  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  at  all? 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Well,  Your  Honor,  because  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  We  are  worried  because 

  

 

 

 

 

there  are  some  women  who  don't  adhere  to  that  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious  tenant,  and  who  have  ­­ we  perceive  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  has  determined,  have  a  real  need  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptives. 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  And,  Justice  Sotomayor,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

think  that  goes  to  the  larger  problem  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  case  here,  which  is  the  utter  absence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  Let's  assume,  for  the  sake  of  argument  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  is  the  utter 

  

 

 

 

 

absence?  there  is  plenty  of  evidence  that  was  relied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  to  show  that  when  contraceptives  are  provided  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

women  in  a  seamless  way,  that  the  number  of  unintended 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pregnancies  dramatically  falls,  as  does  the  number  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortions.  And  so  that  health  risk  to  women  who  want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptives  who  can't  get  it  is  proven, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scientifically  and  otherwise. 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  But,  Justice  Sotomayor,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

problem,  the  problem  with  seamlessness  or  whether  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call  it  the  problem  of  burdensomeness,  that's  the

problem  that  exists  not  just  with  respect  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employers  of  Petitioner's  employees,  but  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  other  employee  who,  like  Petitioner's  employees, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you  know  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

exempt  certain  employers  of  certain  size  from  Title  VII, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it's  not  because  we  don't  believe  that  racial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination  is  a  bad  thing,  and  it's  not  that  we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  committed  to  eradicating  that  problem,  but  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  a  certain  point,  we  have  assumed  as  a  society,  or  as 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  government,  that  you  can't  do  everything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  you  can't  take  care  of  the  health  needs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  hundred  percent  of  women,  but  you  can  of  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  number.  Why  is  that  a  judgment  that  is  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  some  respect? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Because  I  think  it  means  one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  two  things:  Either  the  government  is  willing  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolerate  all  of  the  problems  it  identifies  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  employees  with  respect  to  the  employees  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grandfathered  plans  ­­ and  we  understand  that  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  44  million  of  those  ­­ with  respect  to  ­­ respect

to  tolerate  the  problems  with  all  of  those  people,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  really  does  question  whether  they  have  a  compelling 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  forcing  these  particular  Petitioners  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply.  But  on  the  flip  side,  if,  as  they  suggest  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  briefs,  they  are  not  actually  willing  to  tolerate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  problem  with  respect  to  all  of  those  other  people, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  instead,  think  they  can  further  their  interest  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  ways,  the  question  becomes:  Why  are  all  of  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  ways  that  are  sufficient  for  all  of  those  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  suddenly  insufficient  when  it  comes  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  employees? 

 

            

And  that's  the  fundamental  breakdown  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  side  of  the  case.  More  generally,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

we  see  an  absence  of  evidence  on  many  of  the  critical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  here. 

 

            

Let's  assume  for  the  sake  of  argument  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew  what  the  size  of  the  problem  was,  how  many  women 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  there  actually  lack  access  to  contraceptive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coverage.  And  we  don't  know  the  answer  to  that.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  further  assume  that  we  knew  how  much  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  would  be  reduced  by  forcing  organizations  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  to  comply.  Would  we  reduce  it  by  1 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent?  15  percent?  50  percent?  And  we  don't  know 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

We  still  don't  know  whether  the  government

could  achieve  a  comparable  reduction  through  less

that  it  says  are  sufficient  to  further  its  interests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  all  of  the  other  employees  who,  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  employees,  don't  get  contraceptive  coverage 

 

 

 

 

 

from  an  employer­based  plan. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Francisco,  I  have  to 

   

  

 

 

 

admit  to  not  quite  understanding  this  argument,  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  seems  as  though  the  most  important  laws,  the  laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  serve  the  most  compelling  interests,  are  ­­ often 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  exceptions  in  them.  There  are  often  small  business 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions.  There  are  often  transition  rules,  like  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

grandfathering  provision  here.  And  if,  every  time  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

existed,  somebody  could  come  in  and  say,  well,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  must  not  really  believe  in  this  law  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  an  exception  to  it,  state  ­­ allows  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  ­­ then,  I  mean,  we  might  as  well  pack  it  all  in. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  not  a  law  in  town  that  doesn't  have  exceptions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  that. 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  I  don't  think  that's  right, 

    

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  First  of  all,  the  grandfather  plan  is  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transition  rule.  It  contains  no  sunset  provision.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

allows  ­­

your  health  plan,  then  you're  out  from  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grandfather,  and  every  employer  is  going  to  make  changes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  health  plan.  So  it's  a  diminishing  ­­ it's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transitional  period.  Once  you  make  a  change  in  your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

plan,  you're  out  from  under  the  grandfather. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  except  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  allow  ­­ they  allow  employees  to  raise  copayments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  rate  of  medical  inflation  without  losing  status, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  allow  you  to  continue  adding  employees  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  without  losing  grandfathered  status,  which  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

partly  explains  why  it's  leveled  off  at  about  25  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  the  last  couple  of  years.  But  even  putting  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aside,  I  think  that  once  you've  drawn  a  massive 

   

   

 

 

 

 

exemption  for  secular  and  religious  reasons,  it  tends  to

Congress,  Congress,  next  time  you  pass  a  law,  don't  put 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  an  exemption  for  churches;  you're  going  to  get  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real  trouble  doing  that.  Don't  write  transition  rules 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  will  help  people  adjust  to  a  new  legal  regime; 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to  get  in  real  trouble  doing  that.  Don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

write  exemptions  for  small  businesses,  even  though  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  very  particular  concerns  that  small  businesses  face; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to  get  in  trouble  for  that.  Now,  those  are

not? 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  No  ­­ Your  Honor,  I  think

interest,  the  overwhelming  interest  to  force 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners  ­­ organizations  like  Petitioners  to  violate

let's  imagine  a  widespread  government  program  filled 

   

 

 

 

 

with  exemptions.  There  are  a  smaller  group  of  people 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

who  need  an  exemption  for  religious  reasons.  We  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  other  exemptions.  Some  seem  to  have  good  reasons; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  seem  to  have  terrible  reasons.  We  ­­ really,  under

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Sure,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  I've  just  described 

  

  

 

 

 

to  you  the  United  States  Tax  Code  where  we  know  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  not  have  to  have  an  exemption  for  those  who  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religiously  objecting,  for  example,  to  paying  taxes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  would  support  a  war. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Sure,  Your  Honor.  But  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  So  what  ­­ that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

what  I'm  looking  for.  Same  question.  And  I'm  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  it  to  refute  you;  I'm  asking  it  because  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  for  what  the  distinction  actually  is.  And  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  I  just  said,  I  don't  think  the  distinction 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

can  be,  well,  you've  exempted  some  people,  so  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  exempt  the  religious  people  too.  But  that  would  run 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout  the  government  of  the  United  States.

question.  The  thrust  is  I  haven't  found  it  yet.  I  want

you  allowed  to  require  them  to  do  this  particular  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  violates  their  beliefs?  And  in  making  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  you  look  at  what  the  ­­ how  the  government  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treating  other  similar  situations.

saying,  with  respect  to  all  of  these  other  people  who

willing  to  tolerate  it  or  else  willing  to  address  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  in  other  ways,  then  under  RFRA  the  answer  is  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  look  to  those  other  ways  to  see  whether  they're

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  possibly  so, 

  

 

 

 

 

possibly  not,  and  if  I  could  explain.  We've  not  been 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered  that  kind  of  alternative  to  consider.  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  more  distance  you  put  between  the  Petitioners  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  hand  and  the  provision  of  the  objectionable  coverage

is  from  their  particular  perspective. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  what  might  be 

  

 

 

 

 

acceptable  if  it  puts  enough  distance? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Sure.  Easily.  Enough

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  Justice  Kagan's

You  ­­ you  ­­ as  far  as  I  understand,  you're

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Uh­huh.

religious  organization.  As  long  as  that  insurer  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

linked,  it's  how  these  students  will  have  to  get

MR.  FRANCISCO:  And  Justice  Ginsburg,  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

trying  to  be  careful  because  we  have  many  clients  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  many  different  views.  But  I  think  as  a  general 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

matter,  I  could  certainly  see  the  case  that  if  they're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seizing  control  of  our  plans,  the  plans  that  we  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  to  provide  under  threat  of  penalty,  and  using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  plans  as  the  vehicle  to  delivering  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectionable  coverage  to  our  employees  solely  as  long 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  they're  enrolled  on  those  plans,  which  is  what  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does,  then  I  could  certainly  see  why  many  clients  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  that  as  a  substantial  burden  on  their  religious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

beliefs. 

            

We  then  turn  to  less  restrictive 

 

 

 

 

 

alternatives.  And  Your  Honor,  I'll  just  conclude  here, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  quite  clear  that  the  government  has  alternatives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it's  the  same  alternatives  that  it  uses  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody  else.  And  if  all  of  those  alternatives  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine  with  them,  they  at  least  need  evidence  explaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  they're  not  fine  for  us  as  well.

The  accommodation  that  Petitioners  challenge 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case  strikes  precisely  the  sensible  balance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  religious  liberty  and  compelling  governmental 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  that  Congress  sought  when  it  enacted  RFRA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  this  Court  recognized  in  Hobby  Lobby,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accommodation  seeks  to  respect  the  religious  liberty  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners  by  exempting  them  from  the  contraceptive  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptive  requirement,  and  to  respect  the  interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Petitioners'  employees  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  is  it  fair  for  me  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infer  from  the  way  you  open  your  remarks  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concede  that  there  is  a  substantial  burden  here?  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  then  is  what  is  a  permissible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

accommodation?  What's  the  least  restrictive 

  

 

 

 

alternative? 

            

Do  you  concede  that  there's  a  substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

burden? 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  We  do  not  concede  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  substantial  burden,  Justice  Kennedy.  We  ­­ we  concede 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  religious  belief  is  sincere.  We're  not

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  do  ­­ do  you

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No,  we  do  not.

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So,  look,  I'm  ­­ I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happy  to  discuss  the  substantial  burden  further,  but  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  want  to  go  to  what  I  think  is  the  critical  point  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  of  how  RFRA  scrutiny  applies,  if  it  does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply,  and  it's  this:  Mr.  Francisco  spent  a  lot  of  time 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  the  various  alternatives  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  might  be  able  to  use  instead  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accommodation,  and  I  think  there's  a  real  problem  with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

every  single  one  of  them  in  that  every  single  one  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  defeats  the  very  purpose  for  which  Congress  imposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  preventive  services  requirement,  not  just  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  contraception,  but  with  respect  to  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preventive  services.  And  the  point  here,  and  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  see  this,  if  you  look  at  the  relevant  statutory

appendix  to  our  brief,  which  is  the  preventive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services  ­­ preventive  services  provision,  the  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  of  this  provision  is  that  a  group  health  plan, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

i.e.,  the  health  plan  that  covers  people  through  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer,  or  individual  health  insurance  coverage,  i.e., 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  kind  of  coverage  that's  sold  on  the  Exchanges,  shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  cost  free  all  of  the  preventive  services. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  whole  point  of  this  provision,  the  whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  of  it,  was  to  ensure  that  people  who  got  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  would  get  the  preventive  services  as  part  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  regular  care  from  their  regular  doctor  with  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barriers. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  That's  ­­ in  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

words,  your  compelling  interest  is  not  that  women  obtain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  contraceptive  services.  Your  compelling  interest  is

the  Petitioners,  hired  by  the  Little  Sisters. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  other  words,  it  seems  to  me  you  can't  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  what  you're  trying  to  do  is  make  sure  everybody  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  coverage.  You  want  to  make  sure  they  have  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  program  set  up  by  the  Little  Sisters,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  they  object  to. 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes,  I  understand  that, 

   

  

 

 

Your  Honor.  But  assuming  for  the  moment  ­­ and  I'm

happy  to  discuss  substantial  burden  further  ­­ but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming  for  the  moment  that  we  are  in  RFRA  scrutiny 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  is  a  substantial  burden,  the  point  I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  here,  and  I  do  think  this  is  critical,  is  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ none  of  these  options  that  the  Petitioners  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  going  out  on  the  Exchange  and  buying  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  individual  policy,  a  contraceptive  coverage 

   

 

 

 

only  policy,  Title  X,  Medicare,  Medicaid,  with  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  every  one  of  them,  you'd  have  to  change  the  law  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  them  even  eligible  here.  But  even  if  you  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  the  law,  every  single  one  of  them  creates  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  problem  that  Congress  was  trying  to  solve  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  because  it  would  require  setting  up  a  one­off 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jerry­rigged  separate  channel  to  get  contraceptive 

 

 

 

 

 

coverage. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  point  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  the  form  in  which  the  services  are  provided  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  object  to,  not  the  fact  that  they  be  provided  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not,  because  that's  not  the  question.  In  other  words, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Petitioner  has  used  the  phrase  "hijacking,"  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me  that  that's  an  accurate  description  of  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  wants  to  do.  They  want  to  use  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism  that  the  Little  Sisters  and  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners  have  set  up  to  provide  services  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  the  coverage  to  be  seamless.

Now,  maybe  that's  a  sufficiently  compelling 

   

 

 

 

government  interest,  the  form  in  which  the  services  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided,  but  the  interest  is  not  whether  or  not  women 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive  contraceptive  services.  The  Petitioners  do  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

object  to  the  fact  that  the  people  who  work  for  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  have  these  services  provided.  They  object  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  them  provided  through  the  mechanism  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  set  up  because  they  think,  you  know,  whether  you  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  or  anybody  else  thinks,  they  think  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicity  is  sinful. 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  understand  that,  Mr. 

    

 

 

 

Chief  Justice.  I  understand  that  that's  their  position. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let  me  engage  with  you  on  the  question  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  that  constitutes  a  substantial  burden.  We  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  it  doesn't  constitute  a  substantial  burden  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  that  this  accommodation  is  structured,  although 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  quite  right,  it  seeks  from  the  perspective  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  to  ensure  that  the  employee  gets  the  protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  designed,  that  from  the  perspective  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer,  that  this  is  provided  through  a  separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

program. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you're  saying,  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

worry,  religions,  you're  not  complicit.  That's  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're  saying? 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  We're  saying  that

the  judgment  about  complicity  is  up  to  you,  but  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  an  objective  limit  that  RFRA  recognizes  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope  of  what  is  a  cognizable  burden,  that  that  was  true 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  pre­Smith  case  law  before  RFRA,  and  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  in  Lyng  and  in  Bowen,  and  those  are  cases  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  there  was  no  doubt  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  seems  to  me  then  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  has  to  be  whether  or  not  there  are  less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictive  alternatives  and  if  ­­ is  this  the  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictive  alternative? 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  as  I  said,  Your 

   

  

 

 

 

Honor,  if  RFRA  scrutiny  applies,  then  this  certainly  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  least  restrictive  alternative. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  let  me  mention  one  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  Suppose  that  it  were  possible  for  a  woman  who 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  get  contraceptive  coverage  under  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grandfathered  plan  or  under  a  plan  offered  by  a  church 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

or  under  a  plan  offered  by  a  religious  nonprofit  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

obtain  a  contraceptive­only  policy  free  of  charge  on  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Exchanges.  Why  would  that  not  be  a  least  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  restrictive  alternative? 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  It  has  precisely  the 

  

 

 

 

 

problem.  It's  not  a  less  restrictive  alternative 

   

  

 

 

 

because  it  has  precisely  the  problem  Congress  was  trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  overcome  in  the  preventive  services  provision.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  ­­ what  type  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  does  that  impose?  Is  it  because  these  ­­ these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchanges  are  so  unworkable,  even  with  the  help  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

navigator,  that  ­­ that  a  woman  who  wants  to  get  free 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptive  coverage  simply  has  to  sign  up  for  that  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ on  one  of  the  Exchanges? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  she'll  have  two  insurance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cards  instead  of  one.  She'll  have  one  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer,  and  she'll  have  one  from  this  plan,  just  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  people  have  one  insurance  card  for  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services  and  one  for  prescriptions  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes,  of  course. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ for  dental  or  vision. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  For  the  very  reason  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  employee  has  to  go  out  and  get  a  separate  policy, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  in  the  world  that  doesn't  exist  now,  because  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policies  can't  be  sold  on  Exchanges  now  ­­

achieving  the  government's  interest,  because  the  whole

And  I  think  ­­ think  about  ­­ consider  this,  please, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  perspective  of  the  woman  employee.  She  has  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  plan  from  her  employer.  She  goes  to  ­­ she  goes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  her  doctor,  her  regular  doctor.  She  may  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical  condition  that  makes  pregnancy  a  danger  for  her. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

She  may  be  one  of  the  women,  and  this  is  about  15 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  of  all  prescribed  contraception,  who  needs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraception  to  treat  a  medical  condition,  or  maybe  she 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  wants  the  contraception  that's  appropriate  for  her. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  happens  under  this  ­­ under 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners'  regime  is  the  doctor  has  to  say  to  her  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her  regular  doctor  has  to  say  to  her,  Sorry,  I  can't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

help  you.  It's  not  just  that  you  don't  get  paid  ­­ the

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  But  the  whole  point  here, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito,  is  that  Congress  wanted  to  eliminate  ­­

that  even  though  small  barriers  ­­ even  when  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  it  as  part  of  your  regular  coverage,  even  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small  barriers  work  as  a  sufficient  disincentive  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

many  fewer  people  use  contraception  than  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise,  and  that  ­­ and  the  barrier  ­­ and  the  system

broader  context  matters  here. 

 

 

 

            

This  is  a  transitional  device.  The  number 

   

  

 

 

 

of  people  who  are  in  grandfathered  plans  has  dropped  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  percent.  There  is  no  reason  to  think  it's  not  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  continue  to  drop,  and  if  it  does  continue  to  drop,  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  pace  of  the  last  four  years,  we'll  be  at  zero  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

soon. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But,  you  know,  in  the  long 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

run  we're  all  dead.  But  what's  going  to  happen  in  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ in  ­­ in  the  interim? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

What  was  the  reason  why  Congress  did  not  require 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptive  coverage  right  away  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

grandfathered  plans?  It  required  coverage  right  away 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  grandfathered  plans  for  25­year­olds  so  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  could  get  coverage  under  their  parents'  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  plan.  It  would  have  been  no  great 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  difficulty  for  the  grandfathered  plans  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  in  contraceptive  coverage,  preventive  care  coverage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  away,  just  as  they  did  for  the  25­year­olds.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet  Congress  said,  for  the  really  important  things,  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covering  the  25­year­old  graduate  student,  yes,  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  that  right  away.  But  for  these  other  things, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including  what  we're  talking  about  today,  you  can

passed  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  it  made  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  didn't  impose  an  immediate  requirement  that  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

building  be  retrofitted  so  that  access  to  the  disabled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  possible.  What  it  said  was,  in  that  context,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it's  feasible  to  do  so,  buildings  shall  retrofit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  new  buildings  shall  have  these  access 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements.  No  one  would  say  that  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lacks  a  compelling  interest  in  enforcing  the  Americans 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with  Disabilities  Act  because  Congress  decided  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transitional  system. 

 

            

This  was  a  big  program.  There  were  reliance 

   

  

 

 

 

 

interests.  Congress  decided  on  transition.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

understood  that  this  number  was  going  to  drop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dramatically  over  time.  You  want  ­­ a  good  place  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  why  it's  going  to  drop  dramatically  over  time,  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  declaration  from  the  Dioceses  of  Pittsburgh  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  86  of  the  Joint  Appendix  where  they  say,  we  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sticking  with  our  grandfathered  plan  now  because  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  want  to  trigger  the  contraceptive  coverage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  but  it's  costing  us  a  fortune.  We  have  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

change.  And  that's  the  reality,  and  that's  why  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  go  down. 

 

 

 

            

And  with  respect  to  contraception  itself,

Your  Honor,  the  grandfathered  plan  says  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Institute  of  Medicine  and  its  study,  which  is  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  said  that  contraceptive  coverage  is  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  now.  And  we  cited  a  study  that  said  86  percent 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  all  plans  have  contraceptive  coverage.  So  most  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  women  are  going  to  have  contraceptive  coverage. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now,  they  are  not  going  to  have  it  cost  free,  and  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  difference.  But  the  idea  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  but  to  ­­ to  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  ­­ to  come  back  to  the  point  that  you  were  making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  is  a  good  point  for  the  Americans  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Disabilities  Act.  It  can  be  very  expensive  to  retrofit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilities  to  accommodate  people  with  disabilities. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  are  you  saying  that  the  burden  of  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instituting  coverage  for  preventive  care  as  it  was  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  coverage  for  25­year­olds  is  comparable  to  making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

architectural  changes? 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  But  what  I'm  saying, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  is  that  this  is  ­­ unlike  the  exemption  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small  employees  under  Title  VII,  which  exempts  17 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

million  people  from  these  fundamental  protections 

 

 

 

 

 

against  race  and  gender  and  religious  discrimination, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  does  so  permanently,  this  is  a  transitional  device 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  over  time  you're  going  to  get  down  to  a  situation

where  virtually  nobody  has  ­­ is  in  the  situation,  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  grandfathered  plan,  and  most  of  them  are  getting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  form  of  contraceptive  coverage  anyway.  So  I  don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  undermines  a  compelling  interest  one  bit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  General,  can  we  go  back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  substantial  burden  question?  And  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer  has  been  talking  about  how  to  draw  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line.  When  is  it  that  government  has  to  act  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accommodate,  and  when  doesn't  it  have  to  act  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accommodate?  There  is  some  amici  that  have  suggested  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  that  at  least  to  me  helps  draw  some  clarity  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  our  cases,  which  is,  if  what  your  religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belief  is  asking  the  government  to  do  is  to  change  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behavior  with  respect  ­­ its  regulatory  behavior  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  others,  then  it  can't  be  a  substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden,  because  we  live  in  a  pluralistic  society  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  government  has  to  function. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  hence,  you're  a  military  objector.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

can't  tell  the  government,  no,  you  can't  draft  someone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else.  You  have  to  ­­ you  can't  spend  your  money  on  war. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  don't  have  to  use  you  to  promote  the  war.  But  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  use  others  to  promote  the  war,  you're  entitled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  that  as  government.  Does  this  line  make  any  sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  you?

that's  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Because  here,  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

religious  groups  I  understand  are  asking  is  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government  not  to  use  its  regulatory  power  with  third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  who  don't  have  a  religious  objection,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

forcing  a  burden  on  the  women  who  its  trying  to  help, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third  parties  that  don't  have  the  same  religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection,  and  burdening  them  to  do  other  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  think  that  is  the 

    

 

 

 

 

essence  of  our  position  on  substantial  burden,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  and  I  believe  that  trying  to  answer  Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer's  question  about  where  that  comes  from,  I  believe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  comes  from  Lyng  and  Bowen,  which  both  recognize  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  an  objective  limit  in  Lung. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  example,  the  Court  said  that  the  ­­ it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  not  doubt  that  the  ­­ the  government  actions  were

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  This  is  ­­ this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  a  case  of  the  government  dealing  with  a  third 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  based  on  the  Petitioners'  objection.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

objection  is  that  the  government  is  hijacking  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process,  their  insurance  company,  their  third­party 

 

 

 

 

 

administrator  that  they  have  hired  and  set  up  to  provide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  services.  I  understand  the  distinction  between

yes,  you  can  do  what  you  want,  but  you  can't  compel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  people  to  take  actions  that  are  consistent  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  religious  beliefs. 

 

 

            

But  that's  not  what's  going  on  here.  It  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  relationship  between  the  insurer  that  the  Little 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sisters  have  hired  or  the  third­party  administrator  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  other  ­­ other  entities  that  is  being  used  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  to  provide  these  services.  It's  not  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  third  party  that's  being  compelled.  They  want  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  that  they  want  third  parties  to  take  certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action. 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  would  agree  with  you  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

this  limited  extent,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  that  that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  in  which  the  government  action  occurs  here,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  the  ­­ there  is  this  relationship  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners  and  their  employees  is  the  occasion  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  acting.  But  there  is  two  points  that  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical,  I  think,  and  go  to  why  we  shouldn't  consider 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  to  be  a  cognizable  burden. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  the  first  one  is  that  what  we  are  doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  we  act  here  is  trying  to  make  an  alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangement  that  comes  as  close  as  we  can  to  ensuring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  employees  who  may  not  share  the  Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious  beliefs  get  what  the  law  entitles  them  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while  at  the  same  time  ensuring  that  the  employer  does

not  have  any  legal  obligation  to  pay  for  the  coverage, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  provide  the  coverage  in  any  way.  I  mean,  I  think 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ the  practical  features  of  this  are  critical. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

The  employer  cannot  be  charged  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

co­pay,  even  insurance  ­­ insurance  plan,  self­insured, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  way,  cannot  be  charged.  The  insurance  company  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third­party  administrator  has  got  to  use  separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segregated  funds.  It's  got  to  provide  separate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

segregated  notices.  In  many  instances,  it  provides  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  insurance  card  to  the  employees  for  this  part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  coverage.  So  what  ­­ so  in  that  respect,  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  independent  arrangement  with  third  parties.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ we  may  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  They  are  ­­ they  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  third  parties.  They  are  the  insurance  company  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Petitioners  have  hired.  It's  the  third­party 

  

 

 

 

 

 

administrator  that  they  have  hired. 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Right. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It  seems  to  me  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  balance  is  pretty  clear.  You  want  the  coverage  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptive  services  to  be  provided,  I  think  as  you  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  it  said,  seamlessly.  You  want  it  to  be  in  the  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  package.  That's  done.  That  is  the  compelling 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

government  interest. 

 

            

And  on  the  other  side,  the  question  is

the  government  has  satisfied  its  burden  under  RFRA  to

that's  exactly  what  I  have  found  difficult,  exact.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  read  the  briefs.  Neuborne  said  that.  Your  brief

burden  that  counts  for  purposes  of  RFRA  or  the  ­­ or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First  Amendment.  Where  the  burden  is  of  a  certain  kind. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  what  kind?  And  would  you  say,  well,  a

their  congregation  from  coming  even  if  they  want  to  meet

I  can  think  of  a  lot  of  counter  examples. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

But  maybe  you  couple  that  with  what  we  have  in  the  tax

widespread,  administrative.  You  see?  So  I'm  ­­ I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  get  the  thinking  of  the  people  who  have

here  on  what's  the  best  way  to  treat  that  burden.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  hard  to  find  in  religious  writing.  And  the  people

urging  a  more  incremental  approach  that  recognizes  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  principles  articulated  in  Lyng  and  Bowen  apply  in  a

in  the  Little  Sisters  facility  that's  not  being  used  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything.  They  don't  interfere  at  all.  They  even  pay 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rent.  And  they  come  in  there,  and  they  establish  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Title  X  clinic,  and  they  are  distributing  contraceptives

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes.  We  think  that  would

their  premises.  And  in  this  situation  ­­ and  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  back  to  what  I  was  discussing  with  you,  Mr.  Chief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  ­­ Aetna  is  a  ­­ is  a  different  entity  from 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners.  Blue  Cross  is  a  different  entity  from 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Petitioners.  The  government  makes  its  arrangements  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Aetna  or  with  Blue  Cross,  and  we  make  arrangements  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Aetna  and  with  Blue  Cross  and  other  insurance  companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  TPAs  to  provide  contraceptive  coverage  to  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third  parties,  the  employees. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  you  say  in  your  brief, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  admit  in  your  brief  that,  at  least  in  the  case  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  self­insured  plan,  the  ­­ the  notice  or  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form  or  the  notice  becomes  part  of  the  plan.  This  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  health  insurance  plan  established  under  ERISA,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  are  putting  a  new  objectionable  element  into  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan.  Isn't  that  correct? 

  

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  don't  think  that's 

    

 

 

 

quite  right,  Justice  Alito.  I  think  there's  been  some 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusion  on  that  on  the  Petitioner's  side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  are  two  separate  notices  that  operate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  on  the  self­insured  plan.  The  first  is  the  notice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  employer  provides  to  the  government.  That's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA  plan  document,  but  what  that  ­­ what  ­­ the  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  of  that  document  is  to  exempt  the  employer  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  obligation  to  provide  contraceptive  coverage.

There  is  a  second  document,  a  different 

   

   

 

 

document,  that  the  government  then  sends  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third­party  administrator.  That  document  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

document  that  has  a  legal  effect  that  creates  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

obligation  on  the  part  of  the  third­party  administrator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  provide  the  coverage. 

 

 

 

            

So  it  is  not  the  case  that  the  document  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  to  us  is  an  authorizing  document.  That's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exempting  document. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  it  ­­ it  is  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  plan,  and  you  admit  that  you  are  putting  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  their  plan  that  they  object  to  on  religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grounds. 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  I  ­­

   

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  the  difference  between 

  

 

 

 

 

that  and  Mr.  Clement's  hypothetical  is  that  one  involves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  tangible,  physical  property,  and  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involves  something  that's  intangible. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  That's  the  distinction. 

  

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  it's  not  just  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  like  intangible  property.  The  ­­ the  plaintiffs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  have  a  set  of  rules,  and  the  third­party 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrator  becomes  ­­ for  purpose  of  administering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  it  becomes  the  plan  administrator,  the  sole  plan

administrator,  for  this  portion  of  the  plan.  But  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  one  thought  that  there  was  ­­ that  ­­ that  this  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create  a  legally  sufficient  reason  to  find  a  substantial 

   

   

 

 

 

 

burden  for  ­­ for  third­party  administrators,  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  about  the  situation  with  insurance  companies.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  true  about  church  plans.  And  so  then  it  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  is  whether  switching  from  having  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­insured  third­party  administrator  situation  to  an 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  company  situation  would  ­­ whether  this  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  substantial  burden. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  in  the  case  of  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  plan,  isn't  the  insurance  policy  part  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan?  Isn't  the  insurance  policy  the  way  in  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  employer  provides  the  benefits  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  under  the  plan? 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes.  And  then  ­­ and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

then  the  government  makes  an  arrangement  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  company  that  operates  in  parallel  to  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan.  And  so  ­­ but  ­­ but  it  isn't  through  that  plan. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  in  parallel  to  that  plan.  So  I  think  there's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  difference  there,  but  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what  is

Erie? 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  this  gets  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  the  church  exemption,  Your  Honor.  And  let 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  try  to  explain  that. 

 

 

 

 

              

 

I  think  it's  helpful  to  understand  how  it 

 

 

 

 

 

came  about.  The  church  ­­ initially  HHS  decided  that  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  create  an  exemption  for  churches.  And  then  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  some  back­and­forth,  regulatory  proceedings. 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners  participated  in  that,  created  the  exemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  churches.  And  then  the  religious  nonprofits  came  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  said,  well,  the  exemption  ought  to  be  extended  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us. 

            

The  government  made  a  judgment  that  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  matter,  it  wasn't  willing  to  extend  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  to  all  religious  nonprofits,  as  was  requested, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  it,  instead,  would  use  this  accommodation,  which  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  was  the  best  way  that  we  could  both  protect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  religious  liberty  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  difference,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

course,  is,  as  you  ­­ it's  properly  phrased  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing,  is  the  accommodation  is  the  way  in  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organizations  comply  with  the  mandate.  With  respect  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Catholic  Charities  of  Erie,  though,  they  don't  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply  to  the  accommodation  or  any  other  way.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  They  are  exempt. 

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  The  reason  we  drew  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

line  is  because  we  think  ­­ and  I  think  Professor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Laycock's  brief  is  quite  instructive  on  this  point  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  while  there  ­­ no  line  is  perfect,  and  I'm  sure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  line  isn't  perfect,  and  there's  going  to  be  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overlap  between  entities  that  maybe  you  think  of  ­­ or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  closer  to  being  on  one  side  of  the  line  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.  But  the  line  is  a  valid  line.  And  it's  a  valid 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

line  largely  for  the  reasons  Justice  Kennedy  identified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier,  because  in  that  category  of  religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonprofits  may  be  some  entities,  like  the  one  Your  Honor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  identified,  that  appear  very  close  to  entities  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  an  exemption.  But  there  are  also  going  to  be  lots 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  other  entities  whose  connection  to  that  core 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious  mission  is  much  more  attenuated  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  have  to  draw  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

line?  Is  it  ­­ could  you  apply  the  same  requirements 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  apply  to  the  Little  Sisters  to  the  church  entity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself? 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  so  I  ­­ I  think  we 

   

   

  

 

 

 

could,  Your  Honor,  yes,  under  ­­ I  think  under  ­­ I

accommodation,  and  I  think  if  we  had  the  same  compelling 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest,  and  we'd  make  the  same  narrowly  tailored  means

argument.  But  we  have  constrained  ourselves.  We've 

  

  

 

 

 

 

tried  to  be  especially  careful  with  houses  of  worship. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  a  normal  thing  that  governments  do  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  houses  of  worship. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No.  But  you 

  

  

 

 

 

understand  the  argument.  It's  ­­ and  we've  said  this  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  like  O  Centro  and  others,  that  if  you  have  a  lot 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  exemptions,  it  undermines  your  argument  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  a  compelling  interest. 

   

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Right.  And  let  me  try  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

walk  through  this  carefully,  because  I  do  think  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

important. 

            

They  have  identified  three.  First  is 

  

 

 

 

 

grandfathered  plans.  We've  had  a  lengthy  discussion 

   

  

 

 

 

about  that.  I  think  I've  tried  to  show  you  that  that  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  think  you  can  argue  that  that  exemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermines  the  government's  compelling  interest. 

 

 

 

 

            

They  claim  that  there  is  an  exemption  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employers  who  have  fewer  than  50  employees,  but  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  wrong.  In  fact,  there's  no  reason  to  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

virtually  anybody  in  the  ­­ in  that  category  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  of  those  small  employers  isn't  getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptive  coverage  as  part  of  their  regular  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care  from  the  regular  doctors.  And  let  me  explain  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is.

employees,  and  they're  asking  for  the  ­­ and  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking  for  the  ­­ and  they're  ­­ and  they've  raised  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RFRA  claim  here.  So  ­­ and  that's  because  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employers  in  that  group  provide  coverage,  they  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meet  the  contraceptive  coverage  requirements  so  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  get  the  coverage  from  their  regular  doctor  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  their  regular  health  plan. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Then  also,  if  your  employer  is  not  providing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  coverage  in  that  group,  then  you  go  on  an  Exchange, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  then  you  purchase  a  policy  on  the  Exchange.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  policy  provides  you  with  contraceptive  coverage  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  your  regular  health  plan  from  your  regular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctor,  or  you  ­­ you  ­­ if  you  are  eligible,  you  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  Medicaid.  And  Medicaid  gives  you  contraceptive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

coverage  as  part  of  your  regular  health  plan  from  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regular  doctor. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  for  the  employees  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  buy  the  plans  on  the  Exchange  because  they  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  small  employer  and  the  employer  doesn't  offer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  insurance,  does  that  arrangement  frustrate  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  compelling  interest? 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  Because  in  that

circumstance,  Your  Honor,  the  only  option  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  has  is  to  buy  an  individual  policy  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange.  And  that  individual  policy  will  contain  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptive  coverage  from  your  regular  doctor  as  part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  your  regular  health  care. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  difference  is  with  ­­ when  somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

works  for  a  grandfathered  plan,  for  example,  in  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

category,  or  for  a  church,  the  ­­ those  people  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  getting  insurance.  And  ­­ and  so  for  them, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­ it  is  an  obstacle  because  you're  forcing  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  purchase  a  second  insurance  policy.  And  ­­ and  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  becomes  a  financial  penalty  for  them,  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  their  compensation  is,  of  course,  the  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  they're  getting  from  their  regular  doctors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That  just  underscores  that 

  

 

 

 

 

the  church  plans  here,  religious  organization  plans 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  are,  in  effect,  subsidizing  the  conduct  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deemed  immoral. 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So,  Your  Honor,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

the  answer  to  that  is  that  they're  not  subsidizing  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  way  in  which  this  plan  is  structured,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  in  which  the  accommodation  is  structured,  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  not  to  ­­ employers  are  not  to  bear  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  burden  for  the  contraceptive  coverage  that  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  provided  without  charging  the  employer,  and  funds

have  to  be  segregated,  and  all  activity  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

segregated.  So  there  ­­ it's  ­­ it's  quite  carefully 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed  to  avoid  the  existence  of  any  subsidy  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  them.  And  then  ­­ and  so  we  talked  about  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  If  it's  so  easy  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provide,  if  it's  so  free,  why  can't  they  just  get  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  another  plan? 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  because  they  have 

  

 

 

 

 

to  sign  up  for  a  second  plan  and  pay  for  a  second  plan, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  And  that's  precisely  the  kind  of  obstacle 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  is  trying  to  insure  did  not  exist  when  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed  the  Preventive  Services  provision  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  The  whole  idea  here  is  to  ensure  that  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  get  the  health  care,  get  this  covered,  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  care  from  their  regular  doctor  as  part  of  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regular  health  care  without  these  added  obstacles  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  need  to  go  out  and  sign  up  for  another  plan  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  the  doctors  who  are  going  to  provide  coverage  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  plan.  All  of  those  are  precisely  the  kinds  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obstacles  that  Congress  was  trying  to  eliminate  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  ­­

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  it  comes  down  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  question  of  who  has  to  do  the  paperwork?  If  it's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  that  has  to  do  it,  that's  ­­ that's  no  good. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  it's  the  religious  organization  that  has  to  do  it,

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  But  ­­ but,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

put  yourself  in  the  position  of  this  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  They're  not  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  a  falsehood.  The 

   

  

  

 

Exchanges  require  full­service  health  insurance  policies 

 

 

 

 

 

with  minimum  coverages  that  are  set  forth  that  are  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comprehensive. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  that  true  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  We're  creating  a  new

respect  to  every  policy  sold  on  the  Exchanges?

pediatric  dentistry. 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  But  that's  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you  could  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  health  coverage  product  sold  on  the  Exchanges. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You,  in  fact,  do  it  already. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  You  couldn't  do  it  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

current  law,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  the  way 

  

 

 

 

 

constitutional  objections  work  is  you  might  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  current  law. 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  But  in  this  circumstance, 

  

 

 

 

 

I  think,  you  don't  need  to  get  to  that  question  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  there  is  an  obligation  to  change  current  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  even  if  you  did  have  a  second  contraceptive­only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  available  on  an  Exchange,  that  would  be  precisely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  kind  of  barrier  that  Congress  is  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eliminate. 

            

You  have  two  policies  instead  of  one  policy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  creates  the  disincentives.  A  lot  of  women 

    

 

 

 

 

 

employees,  I'm  certain,  will  reach  the  conclusion  that,

well,  you  know,  I've  got  this  coverage  over  here  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  no,  no.  But  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

guess  that  substantiates  the  point  I  was  trying  to  make, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  a  question  of  who  does  the  paperwork. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  said,  yes,  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  hassle  to  go  to  the  Exchange,  although  it's  ­ you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  I've  heard  about  how  easy  it  is.  You  get  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exchange,  you  get  it,  or  you  allow  your  infrastructure, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  Petitioners  have  said,  to  be  used  as  the  vehicle  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ for  providing  it. 

 

 

 

            

I'm  not  saying  it  comes  out  one  way  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  from  your  perspective.  I'm  just  trying  to  focus 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  exactly  what  is  at  issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Right. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  It's  a  question 

   

  

 

 

whether  you  want  the  employee  to  sign  a  paper  or  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  the  Little  Sisters  to  sign  a  paper.  In  the  one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  it's  an  administrative  burden  as  you've  said.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  case,  it's  ­­ it's  a  violation  of  a  basic 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle  of  faith. 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  I  think  that  the 

    

  

 

 

 

point,  Your  Honor,  is  that  Congress  and  the  Institute  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Medicine  ­­ Congress  made  a  judgment  here  that  this  does

requirements,  result  in  significantly  less  use  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medically­necessary  services. 

 

            

And  it's  not  ­­ it  doesn't  just  come  down  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  Your  Honor  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That's  why  it's  necessary 

  

 

 

 

 

to  hijack  the  plans. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  It's  ­­ Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ it  is  why  the  ­­ it  is  why  the  government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  is  advanced  in  the  ­­ in  the  least  restrictive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manner,  in  the  most  effective  manner. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  this  right?  Is  it  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  I  get  that  you  don't  want  to  have  the  women 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  to  ask  for  the  coverage  is  because  vast  numbers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  women  will,  quite  a  few  who  have  religious  objections 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't,  and  then  there  will  be  that  middle  set  of  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  are  inertia  bound.  And  since  they  are  inertia 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bound,  we  can't  say  so  what,  because  poor  people  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  object  religiously,  if  they  get  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptives,  that  lowers  the  cost  of  health  coverage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later  on. 

 

            

So  the  government  has  an  interest  in  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  therefore,  there  is  an  interest  of  some  kind  in  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowing  a  system  ­­ in  not  having  a  system  where  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

inertia  bound  have  to  take  initiative. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Have  I  got  that  right?

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  Do  I  have  the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

other  part  right,  which  is  this  is  not  hijacking  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  Federal  regulation  that  says  the

the  insurance?  Am  I  correct  about  that? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  that's  all  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

all  correct,  Your  Honor.  And  that's  why  when  I  say  when

with  the  problem  of  what's  available  on  the  Exchanges  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  present  time  in  this  way:  Policies  are  available 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  provide  comprehensive  coverage.  Could  the

discretion,  we  are  not  going  to  take  any  action  against

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  it  ­­ I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

it  would  be.  But  even  if  it  were,  it  presents  the  same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  of  creating  the  obstacle  which  creates  the

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Right.  I  think  that's 

    

  

 

 

exactly  the  point  here,  is  that  the  ­­ the  woman

It's  not  just  about  filling  out  paperwork;  that  if

the  interest  on  one  side  of  the  equation.  What  do  you

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  The  ­­ I  understand  the 

   

  

 

 

 

interest  to  be  avoiding  complicity  in  what  they  consider

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  think  RFRA  cuts,  in 

    

 

 

 

 

this  situation,  quite  decisively  in  favor  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  here  because  the  interests  are  compelling. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  ­­ and  as  we've  tried  to  explain,  none  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternatives  that  the  Petitioners  have  proposed  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  anywhere  close  to  being  equally  effective  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensuring  that  women  get  this  coverage.

can't  even  counsel  you  about  this.  And  ­­ and  numerous

our  ­­ our  insurance  will  not  cover  even  any  counseling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  contraception.  So  you've  got  to  go  out  and  find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  doctor.  And  then  you've  got  ­­ and  ­­ and

then  you've  got  to  find  a  way  to  pay  for  the

serious  obstacles.  It's  not  just  about  signing  a  form. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  gets  to  the  heart  of  the  problem  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  do  you  assume  that  the

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  that  would  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  do  you  make  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  that  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happenstance.  Somebody's  got  to  offer  that  separate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

plan,  and  that  separate  plan  has  got  to  ­­ and  then  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctor  that  she  goes  to  as  a  regular  doctor  has  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  ­­ has  to  be  under  the  same  plan.  There's  no

we've  tried  to  ­­ the  ­­ the  way  I've  tried  to  explain

of  this  is  to  exempt  the  employer  from  providing  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptive  coverage,  to  exempt  them  and  to  provide  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  separate  means  through  separate  funds  without  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involvement,  and  therefore,  it's  not  hijacking. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  I'd  like  to  do,  if  I  could,  I  want  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  one  point  about  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Maybe  if  I  could 

   

  

 

 

 

follow  up  on  your  answer  before  you  do.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contraceptive  services  would  be  provided  pursuant  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  plan? 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  When  you're  hired  by  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  religious  organizations,  you  get  a  brochure  or  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

package  with  all  your  insurance  coverage  and,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  it  is.  And  where  would  the  contraceptive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

services  be  listed?  It  won't  be  in  that  brochure,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  be  in  that  brochure,  there's  got  to  be  a  separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communication  from  the  insurance  company  to  the  employee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling  the  employee  you're  getting  this  separately  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us.  That's  how  it  works. 

  

 

 

 

            

Now,  there  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Francisco,  I  think, 

   

  

 

 

earlier  said  if  Aetna  offers  a  separate  policy  giving 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance,  that  he  thought  that  that  would  be  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate  ­­ an  adequate  accommodation. 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  I  think  that  that

raises  all  the  problems  identified. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  no.  I  meant  ­­ I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

meant:  He  says,  generally,  if  Aetna,  under  some  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy,  offers  it  on  the  Exchange  to  women  who  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  go  on  the  Exchange  and  buy  that  policy,  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay  if  they  ­­ if  that's  the  ­­ what  they  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What's  different  from  that  from  what  happens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here?  It's  basically  the  same  thing,  isn't  it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  Two  policies  instead 

  

  

 

 

 

of  one.  You  have  got  to  pay  for  that  policy. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  it  is  two  policies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instead  of  one  because  the  contraceptives  are  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided  by  government  regulation.  The  only 

  

 

 

 

 

seamlessness  is  that  I  think  the  woman  doesn't  have  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  and  pay  separately  or  something  else. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

if  it's  a  separate  policy,  you're  going  to  have  to  apply 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  pay  separately.  There  is  a  whole  separate  regime. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  do  want  to  make  one  point  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice,  because  my  friend  on  the  other  side  raised  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea  of  notice,  that  it's  not  just  about  us  using  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan,  but  the  notice  they  provide.  That  notice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  I  think,  can't  constitute  a  substantial  burden 

   

   

 

 

 

because  it's  entirely  derivative  of  the  objection  to  us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

setting  up  this  third­party  arrangement.  And  I  ­­ I

think  Mr.  Clement  told  you  that  this  morning  because  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  if  government  didn't  take  this  step  of  providing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  coverage,  we  would  be  happy  to  provide  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  they  want  on  a  form. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  so  I  think  that  ­­ what  that  tells  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  the  objection  here,  the  focus  of  the  objection, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  ­­ is  the  arrangement  to  provide  the  separate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coverage  and  not  the  notice,  per  se;  that  on  its  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms,  it's  unobjectionable. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Before  you  sit  down,  General 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Verrilli,  could  I  just  ask  you  this  informational 

   

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  this  particular  situation  of  the  Little 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sisters? 

            

Their  regular  third­party  administrator  also 

 

 

 

 

will  not  provide  ­­ has  said  it  will  not  provide  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coverage  if  ­­ even  if  they  were  to  comply  with  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  form  of  the  notice  requirement.  And,  therefore,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  they  probably  cannot  be  ­­ there  is  probably  no  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  ERISA  to  obtain  contraceptive  coverage  for  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  unless  you  can  find  another  third­party 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrator  that  you  could  deal  with  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  that  situation,  would  the  Little  Sisters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  be  subject  to  fines  for  failing  to  comply? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No,  we  don't  think  so.

do  is  to  weigh  the  alternatives  that  have  been  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  you  here  on  this  case.  On  the  one  side,  you've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  a  serious,  thoughtful  effort  to  respect  Petitioners' 

   

 

 

 

 

 

religious  beliefs  by  creating  a  system  that  allows  them 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  exempt  themselves  from  the  requirement  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straightforward  manner  and  that  protects  the  fundamental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights  and  liberties  and  dignity  of  the  ­­ of  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees,  many  of  whom  may  not  share  their  religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beliefs  about  contraception. 

 

 

            

On  the  other  side  of  the  scale,  what  you've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  is  a  demand  that  those  rights  or  those  employees  who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  not  share  Petitioners'  beliefs  be  extinguished  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extinguished  until  such  time  as  Congress  creates  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacts  a  different  program  that  will  require  a  separate

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  What  I  would  say  to  that, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  is  that,  I  think,  essentially  what  eight 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  of  appeals  have  said,  which  is  that  RFRA  requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  sensible  balance.  A  sensible  balance  is  essential  in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  pluralistic  society  like  ours,  in  which  people  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  faith  on  earth  live  and  work  side  by  side,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  has  got  to  administer  rules  that  are  fair  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone. 

            

The  accommodation  ­­ the  accommodation 

 

 

 

 

achieves  that  balance.  Petitioners'  position  is  very, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

very  far  from  that  balance  and,  therefore,  the  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  should  be  affirmed. 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you.

Justice  Kennedy,  because  I  don't  think  it's  the  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  just  because  Congress  exempts  churches,  that  it  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  exempt  the  universities.  What  it  needs,  though,  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale  for  drawing  the  line. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

Now,  my  friend  on  the  other  side  says  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  doesn't  have  to  be  perfect.  Well,  under  compelling 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  and  least  restrictive  alternatives,  it  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  pretty  good.  And  the  line  that  they  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawn  here  is  absurd,  and  I  would  urge  you  to  look  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  amicus  brief  filed  by  the  Dominican  Sisters  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authored  by  a  former  head  of  the  tax  division,  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  explains  the  line  they  have  picked,  using  6033  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tax  code,  makes  no  sense.  That's  an  informative  filing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  but  there  is  no  substantive  difference. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  my  clients  filed  the  form,  they  get  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  tax  exempt  status  as  the  churches.  The  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  in  that  provision  is  whether  you  filed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form.  The  substantive  treatment  is  exactly  the  same. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To  use  that  line  to  draw  a  distinction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

between  churches  and  universities  or  the  Little  Sisters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Poor  is  a  terrible  line  to  draw.  And  if  you  go 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  thinking  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  going  back  to  that

Committee  ­­ our  leading  proponent  of  RFRA  discusses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  line­drawing  problem.  Do  you  just  say  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong? 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  No,  I  would  say  that  that  gets 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

me  to  the  next  point.  But  if  I  could  just  finish  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  for  one  second. 

 

 

 

            

Their  original  justification  for  the  line 

 

 

 

 

 

they  drew,  Justice  Kennedy,  was  that  the  exempted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organizations  would  be  more  likely  to  hire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co­religionists  and,  therefore,  less  likely  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  who  would  use  the  products. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

My  clients  equally  enjoy  the  Title  VII 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  which  gives  them  the  right  to  hire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co­religionists  so  their  original  rationale  applies 

 

 

 

 

 

equally  to  my  clients.  You  have  to  draw  a  sensible 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

line. 

            

Now  as  to  the  exemptions,  I  mean,  I  will 

   

   

 

 

 

 

respectfully  disagree  with  Professor  Laycock. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Would  it  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

better  to  say,  churches,  you've  got  to  tell  us  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  claim  an  exemption,  because  not  every  church  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious,  has  the  same  religious  tenets.  So  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  you  would  have  preferred?  Is  that  the  ­­ the  sort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  incentive  you  want  to  put  out  there?  Is  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

message  you're  giving,  which  is,  there  is  lots  of  rules

that  apply  differently  to  churches  because  we  recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  special?  Others  may  be  special  like  them,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  clear  to  tell  what  a  church  is. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  CLEMENT:  Let  me  answer  both  questions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

together.  First  of  all,  the  exemption  is  not  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  to  churches.  It  applies  to  religious  orders. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  my  clients  would  have  just  stuck  to  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knitting  and  not  helped  the  elderly  poor,  they  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualify. 

            

But  to  answer  both  of  these  questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together,  not  all  exemptions  are  created  equal.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Professor  Laycock  is  a  great  scholar,  but  even  he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted  he  didn't  understand  the  details  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  plan.  He  didn't  get  into  that.  He  left  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  parties. 

 

 

            

And  I  think  he  subsequently  said  that  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there  really  was  a  requirement  for  these  entities  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract,  and  there  is,  then  even  he  would  recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  substantial  burden.  But  the  important  point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  all  exemptions  are  created  equal.  If  you  create 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  exemption  for  small  employers,  that's  a  rationale 

   

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  with  enforcement  discretion.  If  you  create  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  for  ­­ take  the  O  Centro  case.  If  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemption  for  peyote  had  been  for  a  Schedule  5  substance 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  less  dangerous,  maybe  the  government  would  have

won. 

            

Their  problem  there  was  that  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  already  exempted  the  sacramental  use  of  peyote,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Schedule  1  substance.  So  of  course,  they  had  a  hard 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

time  arguing  why  they  couldn't  provide  an  exemption  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  different  Schedule  1  substance. 

   

 

 

            

 

All  of  these  exemptions  have  to  be  treated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same,  Justice  Breyer.  There  is  no  excuse.  There  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  other  way  than  to  do  the  hard  work  of  looking  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemptions  and  seeing  whether  they  make  sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One  of  the  cases  that  Congress  clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  embrace  in  RFRA  was  Yoder.  Now, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yoder  was  a  relatively  hard  case  because  there  basically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  no  exemptions.  If  the  State  of  Wisconsin  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  provided  an  exemption  for  the  Mennonites  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  provided  an  exemption  for  the  students  upstate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  schools  are  farther  apart,  Yoder  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  an  easy,  easy  case.  You  can't  make  an  exemption 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  all  these  grandfathered  plans.  And  please,  it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  a  sunset  provision.  If  you  look  at  Joint 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix  page  956,  they  link  the  grandfather  provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  idea  that  if  you  like  your  plan,  you  can  keep  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  that's  not  going  away. 

 

 

 

 

            

Just  in  closing,  my  clients  would  love  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  conscientious  objector,  but  the  government  insists
