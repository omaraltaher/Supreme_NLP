ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

22 

may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress provided extensive substantive and 

 

 

 

 

procedural protections for aliens whom the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wishes to remove, but at the same time, addressed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

real concerns about recidivism and flight risk by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing for mandatory detention during removal 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings for certain categories of criminal aliens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and aliens arriving at our shores. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Ninth Circuit undid that legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

balance, invoking principles of constitutional avoidance 

 

 

 

 

 

to require the government to release those aliens unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government can prove by a preponderance of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence every six months that detention remains 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

necessary. 

24 

25 

            

The Ninth Circuit's decision is a serious 

   

 

 

 

 

misuse of the constitutional avoidance canon.  With 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

respect to arriving aliens, there is no constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

problem to avoid.  As even the Ninth Circuit recognized, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute is constitutional in the vast majority of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applications, and any concerns about outlier cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving lawful permanent residents can be dressed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

as-applied challenges. 

 

7 

            

And with respect to criminal aliens, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

text of the statute forecloses the Ninth Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach, and in any event, the statute is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional as written under this Court's decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

Demore. 

12 

            

The net result of the Ninth Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

one-size-fits-all rule is -- is a regime that's at odds 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the text that Congress enacted.  It undermines 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

DHS's enforcement priorities, and it creates incentives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for individual aliens to delay their removal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

proceedings. 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about 1225(a), that 

  

 

 

 

 

is, aliens who don't fit in either of the categories 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you discussed?  They are not entrants, and they are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not people who have committed qualifying criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses.  So they are the 1225(a) people. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  That's right, Your 

  

 

 

 

Honor.  So for those individuals, they have had bond 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearings, or at least they often have had bond hearings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

And -- and so we're talking about individuals who either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had bond hearings and had them denied or have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

unable to post bond. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

5 

            

With respect to those -­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What would be the 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

constitutional entitlement to keeping those people, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're not a flight risk or a -- a risk to the safety 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the country? 

 

 

9 

            

10 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So -­

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or to others?  However 

  

  

 

 

 

11 

you want to define that danger element. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

So what's the constitutional entitlement, 

 

 

 

 

13 

just arbitrarily, to keep someone who's neither of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

two things? 

 

15 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So with respect to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

1225(a)(1) individuals that Justice Ginsburg was talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about, those are individuals who have had bond hearings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and had them denied or have been unable to post bond. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the requirement that we are concerned about there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the government bears the burden of proof to show by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear and convincing evidence every six months that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not a flight risk or not a -- or not likely to -- to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

recidivate. 

24 

            

And -­

 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Clarify two things.  One, 

  

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

what are the -- what have the people in that category 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

done that would make them subject to removal; and two, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does the government read the bond specification in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1225(a) as discretionary? 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, the -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

I think the government's practice with respect to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

latter question is to provide bond hearings consistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the -- consistent with the statute is my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding, and that -- and so those are people who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have had bond hearings and we do provide them there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

question? 

13 

            

14 

            

And, I'm sorry, Your Honor, your first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who would -­

  

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So they may be 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

individuals who have -- who have entered illegally but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have not committed the kinds of crimes that would make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them inadmissible under 1182(a)(2) or -- or deportable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under -- that would subject them -- the types of crimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would subject you to 1226(c) for the mandatory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention there.  And so, again, for that class, we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objecting principally to the clear and convincing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence standard which we think the Ninth Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really had no basis in the statute for adopting.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are -­

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Am I right that in -- in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

bail hearings, it's clear and convincing to show that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a public danger, but only by a preponderance of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

the evidence to show flight risk in regular bail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

hearings? 

5 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, it 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

does vary by the type of crime.  In some cases it's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alien who has to -- I'm sorry.  In some cases it's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal who has to show by a preponderance that he is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not likely to -- to recidivate or to be a flight risk. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In some cases the government bears the burden by showing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in clear and convincing evidence. 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I ask a -­

   

   

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I think -- I'll check it. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

14 

I think not for flight risk. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

Your Honor. 

 

17 

            

18 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  That might be right, 

  

 

 

 

 

Yes.  I'm sorry, Justice -­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Clarifying question. 

  

 

 

19 

20 

21 

For an alien who is found in the United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegally, has not been admitted, are they held under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1225(b) or are they held under 1226(a)? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So they are held 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

under -- if they are not -- if they are not detained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within 100 miles of the border or within 14 days, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've been there longer than those two things, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

they are under 1220 -- 1226(a) and not 1226(c). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what happens to -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

3 

4 

5 

don't know how many of these would exist, but an alien 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who has resided within 14 miles of the border, not 14 -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how many miles? 

 

 

6 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Within a hundred miles 

   

  

 

 

7 

of the border and 14 -­

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Hundred miles from the 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

border, that's possible, who has been there for 20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, they would still be held under 1225? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So I'm sorry, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

Honor.  They would be held under 1226(a).  So this is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on -- on -- they -- if they hadn't committed other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes, and -- and so, therefore, were not subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mandatory detention under 1226(c). 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

alien. 

18 

            

19 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm assuming no criminal 

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm talking about an 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

alien who has come into the United States illegally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without being admitted who takes up residence 50 miles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the border. 

 

 

23 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  The answer is they are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

held under 1226(a) and that they get a bond hearing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under -- and this is at page 156a of the appendix.

1 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let me finish my -- your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

question.  Earlier you said you were objecting to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden of proof. 

 

 

4 

            

5 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you objecting to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

concept that prolonged detention without reason is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate for these aliens? 

 

 

 

8 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, we 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

believe that they -- and I don't think -­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And the reasons being 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

flight risk or danger. 

 

 

 

12 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  We believe that the -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

whatever due process rights that they have are met by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statutory scheme which gives them an initial bond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing and then allows them, if there are changed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, to seek a redetermination.  And we 

   

  

 

 

 

believe that that satisfies -­

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except that that bond 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

hearing, that additional regulation says that the length 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of detention is not one of the factors that justifies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

reconsideration. 

22 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  That's correct, Your 

  

 

 

 

23 

Honor, under our -­

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so if these are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

people who have been here for decades, let's say, don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

10 

1 

2 

you think due process would require some periodic review 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to ensure that these people are properly being held? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, we 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

don't think that.  But two things:  First of all, the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit went beyond that and -- and -- and imposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a clear and convincing evidence standard which we think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really does materially change the calculus and change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government's burden there; and, second, we do think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the initial bond hearing in conjunction with the -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the opportunity to bring forth changed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances -- and that may be -- that could be -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except that regulations 

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

are saying that you don't consider the length of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention.  But that's what a judge does in bail 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

hearings.  That's what a judge does in almost every 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

other detention, which is, at a certain point, your -­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your calculus changes, the balance changes when the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention becomes unreasonable. 

 

 

19 

            

20 

can -­

 

21 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, so if I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The length of detention 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

becomes unreasonable. 

 

23 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Yeah.  If I could step 

   

  

  

 

 

24 

25 

back.  We do think that the way to think about the case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for -- for the people who are not in the arriving aliens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

category is that the -- as long -- what -- what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

Court said in Demore, and I think this is the focus of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Demore, that if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of detention is being served, that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government is moving reason -- reasonably quickly to -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to accomplish removal, and so that we are not in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zadvydas situation where the end of the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention can't be observed, then the -- then absent -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absent very unusual circumstances, that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention is constitutional.  And so we do think that -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we do think that the scheme we have in place for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1226(a) individuals that Your Honor is identifying is

constitutional. 

14 

15 

              

I will say that hasn't -­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  May I ask, General -- I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

16 

sorry. 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  No, Your Honor, I was 

   

  

 

 

 

going to shift to something else. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I was going to shift to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

something else too. 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Let's do it. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let's -- let's shift to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

1226(c). 

24 

25 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And not focus on the statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

so much but focus on the constitutional question, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

think your brief indicates that you think that there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some constitutional bounds, and so I'd like you to talk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me about what those constitutional bounds are and -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and when a judge would find them. 

   

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, we 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

think the constitutional bound is -- is the standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Justice Kennedy's concurrence set forth in Demore, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we think it is that where there be, as -- as he said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there -- were there to be an unreasonable delay by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government -- he said the INS, but by the government in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuing and completing deportation proceedings, it 

 

 

 

 

 

could become necessary, then, to inquire whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of detention is not to facilitate deportation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but for some other reason. 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

So it seems to us that the analysis that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

court would undertake is, has there been some sort of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusual situation or misconduct on the part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government or delay on the part of the government that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests the purpose of detention was not to effectuate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal, but as long as -­

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What happens if -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

happens if you can't point to any particular evidence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government misconduct, but that you're in a situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where the government just has very, very big backlogs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

and everything is taking a long time?  So let's say the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

average would be that the government wouldn't make a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision for three years.  Could the Court simply say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, three years is too long?  It doesn't really matter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

what kind of evidence you have; three years is too long. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

think our position in that -- in that situation would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that as long as the government was diligently -- we -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, if it were 20 years, I mean, we could go on, then, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of course, that might be a concern that, in fact, we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were no longer trying to effectuate removal.  I think we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would make the argument in the three years Your Honor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was hypothesizing, but that's not the situation we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  It's been steady -­

  

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  That's -- that's -­

  

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

right there you said, of course, 20 years, dot, dot, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dot, dot.  As soon as you utter words like that, you are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside.  And it's in conceding, I take it, that where 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it says, the AG may release an alien described in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph 1, these are the criminal ones. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  This is 1226(a). 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  This is 1226(2).  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

23 

(c)(2). 

24 

25 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  I'm sorry -­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The words that are 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

14 

1 

 

strongest for you, in my opinion, are those words, "only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

if." 

3 

            

4 

            

5 

            

6 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  "Only if." 

  

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Correct, and -­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Only if the witness 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9

11 

12 

13 

14 

program.  Now, you're saying, well, it's not really only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if.  There are exceptional circumstances where he has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been there for 20 years and we haven't started the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal proceeding, or let's say he has an emergency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operation, has to be in the hospital, we all can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise our wonderful legal imaginations and think of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weird instances where it's going to prove that "only if" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't literally "only if" witness. 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I want 

   

  

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

to be clear about what I'm saying there.  I don't think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Attorney General has discretion to release in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation I was just discussing with Justice Kagan. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

that. 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  I knew that.  I know 

    

    

  

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  I think that's a 

    

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

constitutional requirement.  In other words, due process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would be implicated at that -- at that point.  So I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not saying that at some point the Attorney General has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion to release.  The statute is mandatory, and we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

read the statute -­

 

 

 

15 

2 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It says "only if."  Only if 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

you go to the witness program. 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

5 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But my point was, and you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

did it accidentally but on purpose.  You said, well, 20 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years would be different, and -- and -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  I did it -- to be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

9 

clear, Your Honor, I did it as a matter of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

10 

constitutional law. 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Why do it as a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

matter -- why not just say -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Because we don't -­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- like all -- many type 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

same things in the law, words like "any" or "only if" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are always interpreted in light of unusual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, not being absolute and you get something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

unusual. 

19 

            

20 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, why not do that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

rather than appeal to the Constitution?  That may be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picky point, but -- but one -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

24 

important. 

25 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  But I think it's 

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The one -- that's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

            

2 

            

3 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Justice Kagan -­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- I asked about it. 

   

  

 

 

 

16 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  I was just going to

12 

13

15 

say, Justice Kagan had asked me to set aside the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, so it really was a constitutional analysis. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  And we don't -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

really think that Congress -- this was a deliberate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical judgment by Congress based on experience 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over a long number of years where Congress had tried to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deal with the concerns about recidivism and flight for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal aliens through a number of different 

   

 

 

 

 

mechanisms.  And what Congress found was that -- that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was very hard to predict and it had very serious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences, and Congress opted for a categorical 

   

 

 

 

 

16 

judgment. 

17 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose it's an 

    

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

area where your safety valve, the availability of habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corpus might come into play.. 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Absolutely, Your 

  

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Honor.  And I think that goes into the interpretation of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional avoidance, both with respect to criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aliens and arriving aliens.  What Congress understood 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was that it was legislating against the backdrop of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas, which provides the kind of failsafe that Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Kennedy had identified in Demore.  And, therefore, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

Congress legislated on an absolute -- with absolute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text, and that doesn't admit for the kind of exceptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I think Your Honor is pressing.  I understand -­

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if I could go back, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

General, to the constitutional point.  Because if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

put Demore aside, I think we would all look at our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent and we would say, you can't just lock people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up without any finding of dangerousness, without any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding of flight risk, for an indefinite period of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time, and not run into due process.

10 

11 

12 

            

Now, you have Demore, but Demore was based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

on the assumption that it was going to be a brief time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was based on statistics that have now proved to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inaccurate.  And the question is, why the Constitution 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself -- and you can do it through habeas proceedings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or whatever the procedure is -- but why the Constitution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself does not set an outer bound in the way that we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistently required in, for example, civil commitment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

cases? 

21 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  All right.  So, Your 

  

  

 

 

 

22 

23 

Honor, you've packed a lot in there, and I'd like to -­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd like to take on a number of things there. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

But the answer to your last question is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

I don't think it's the focus on the amount of time

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

that's really the way the Court should look at it here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And this, I think, was the insight in Justice Kennedy's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrence in Demore.  The amount of time increases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here in part precisely because, as I indicated at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

start, Congress has provided a substantial number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

substantive and procedural protections for individuals: 

 

 

 

 

 

They have the right to lawyer at their own expense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They have the right to an interpreter.  They have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to present evidence and to gather evidence and to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use subpoenas to get evidence.  They can appeal to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

BIA.  They can appeal to the Court of Appeals. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

But with that process comes time.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

think a focus on just the length of time without the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons for the delay, without looking at the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aliens routinely and understandably file for 

 

 

 

 

 

continuances, and to impose a rigid six-month rule like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court of Appeals did is really a mistake. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

With respect to Demore, I really would like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

to address Your Honor's concern there on a number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations.  Your Honor is right that the statistics we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided to the Court were inaccurate, and we apologize. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I wasn't even blaming 

   

  

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

you, because I think it was partly the statistics that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were provided and partly what the Court did with them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It doesn't really matter who was to blame or who wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

to blame.  I was just suggesting that, in fact, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Demore -- Demore says that the average is five months; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

it turns out that the average is more like a little bit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

over a year. 

   

5 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, so 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

I -- the reason why I think Demore still is good is this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason:  I think Demore rested on two pillars. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

First was the judgment that flight risk and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

recidivism are real problems and that IJ's are really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad at predicting, and that, therefore, Congress could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make a categorical judgment in this area of immigration 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

law that mandatory detention was appropriate. 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

And, second, that unlike Zadvydas, the 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

purpose of the detention was still being served.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of the detention was to effectuate removal, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the detention was not going to be permanent and it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not going to be indefinite.  Those are true. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

It is true that this Court assumed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

incorrectly that the length of detention was five and a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half months.  But in Kim -- in Demore itself, the alien 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had already been in -- had been detained for more than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

six months, for 197 days, and the Court was sending that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual back for an IJ hearing and a BIA appeal.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so even under the Court's erroneous assumption that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was going to be five and a half months tacked on, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

we're talking about a detention for a year. 

   

   

 

 

 

20 

2 

            

Now, with respect to the time limits, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

are not trivial.  These are serious -- these are serious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters, and we recognize that.  The current median time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for -- for the Demore figures is around 233 days now, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it's gone from seven to nine months over the years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the average time, which is not what we think the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So when is it, in theory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  -- it's more like 10 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

to 12 months. 

 

 

13 

            

I'm sorry. 

 

14 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- when it's not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

alien's fault, and you seem to suggest that if budgetary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters or personnel matters are what are inflicting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay that that's okay.  Is there any -- you said 20 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years is the end point.  But given that we have a due 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process right not to be held indefinitely, even though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it may have a distant point of release somewhere in an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unknown period, because the government now, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand, if a alien asks for an adjournment, BIA 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges who are overbooked are sometimes taking months to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give them another date. 

 

 

 

25 

            

At what point does the government's behavior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

come into this analysis? 

 

 

 

21 

2 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

think the government's behavior -­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Intentionally or not.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

mean, I would assume that if the government was just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delaying because it wanted to, you would say that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

unconstitutional. 

8

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Absolutely, Your 

  

 

 

Honor.  And that is -­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  But at what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

point does indefinite, albeit with a lengthy, far-off 

   

 

 

 

 

 

detention date, become unconstitutional? 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, we 

  

 

 

 

 

don't think that the mere date itself is what makes it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional.  But to be clear -­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  What makes it 

  

  

 

 

 

unconstitutional in my mind is the unreasonable delay or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

detention. 

19 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Right.  The -- so a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

20 

couple of points on that, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

First of all, the -- it is not our view that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

most of the delays that we are talking about here in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lengthy cases are situations that are resulting from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government-resource problems or things of that nature. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A lot -- the record indicates that aliens routinely seek 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

22 

1 

2 

3

6 

continuances and they seek multiple continuances.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they do that for good reason, which is to build a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record.  What most of the aliens here are seeking is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary relief.  And if they're seeking 

  

 

 

 

 

discretionary relief, then they're going to want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

build the record. 

 

 

7 

            

So I don't think the record is -- is that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

most of the delay is IJ, lack of immigration judges or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

BIA resources.  And, indeed, UR expedites the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings that involve detained aliens.  And so that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a -- a government policy to deal with Your Honor's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

question. 

13 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Assuming -- assuming that 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

there is a constitutional limit of the type that's been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussed, is that -- do you think that can be addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a class action, or is it something that can be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed only in individual habeas cases? 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, we 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

think it's clearly the latter, and we really think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is one of the major flaws of the Ninth Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision, is that it adopted a class-wide rigid rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that applies to aliens no matter what is the cause of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the delay, no matter whether the alien is a criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alien or arriving alien, no matter whether the alien is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking discretionary relief or not discretionary 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

relief.  That one-size-fits-all approach is not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

right way to do it.  The way to do it is in individual, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as-applied challenges through habeas proceedings, which 

 

 

 

 

 

is what the Court -­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I don't quite 

    

   

 

 

understand that.  Why couldn't a court, whether it's the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit or whether it's this Court in reviewing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth Circuit, say, here are the constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines.  Here's the way to -- it might -- it might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be a one-size-fits-all.  It might be a presumptive 

   

   

  

 

 

 

limit, but the ability to go beyond that in individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, but to set those -- to set those guideposts and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then let the individual determinations take place.

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So in theory, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

Honor, the short answer is the Due Process Clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't usually permit that kind of broad-based approach 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that doesn't take advantage -- take cognizance of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various differences between the aliens on the ground.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, for example, the difference between -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, wouldn't it be better 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

to set some guideposts that everybody in the country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would know to follow rather than having one suit pop up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here and one suit pop up here and another in another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place and everybody would be treated differently?  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not seem like a good immigration system. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So the first thing I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

would say, Your Honor, is that the one thing that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know shouldn't be the case is what the Ninth Circuit has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done, which is the opposite of that, which is apply a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single standard to everybody regardless of -- regardless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the cause of the delay.  I mean, this gets at the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very concern that the Court -- that the dissent in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zadvydas, Justice Kennedy's dissent, and then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority in Demore highlighted, which is that kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rigid rule creates an incentive for an alien to delay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we wouldn't adopt the clear-and-convincing standard, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

which -­

 

13 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I wasn't -- I wasn't 

   

   

  

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

suggesting a rule that was quite as rigid as that.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I was suggesting more that the Court, say, pick up some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of your language in your brief and say that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention has to serve the purposes for which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention is meant.  And, presumptively, that is -- pick 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a number -- nine months, a year -­

   

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

21 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor -­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- six months, whatever, 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

something pretty reasonable, but only presumptively if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is some exceptional circumstance that could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

extended. 

25 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, I 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

think it would be within the Court's power to do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

We don't think that's the way we would approach.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think our -- our -­

the way we would advise the Court to approach -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no.  I'm sorry -­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  We think the Court

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Sorry. 

  

  

 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  -- but we don't think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's the way the Court should do it.  But what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court is -- what the Court has generally done in a due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process situation is have as-applied challenges, and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that's the sensible way to go -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In a class action, the 

   

  

 

 

 

Court has to grant or deny relief.  And I don't know. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What would be the relief if -- if the Court says, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not going to say, you know, what the situation is

here are our thoughts about how individual determination

should be made.

Your Honor, and that is why we don't think that's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the courts should do.  I think -- and so -- I mean, to 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be clear, I think the Court has the power to give 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance, but we don't think that that is the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach that's most consistent with the Due Process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause or the way to think about these categories of

cases.

brief that there are -- there are indicators, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that 90 percent of the IJ hearings are done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within 14 months, and 90 percent of the BIA proceedings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are done within 19 months.  And what I think those -- we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would -- those -- we would offer those to the Court, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as -- as indication that the Due Process Clause has been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated, but those are situations in which one might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably, in a -- in a as-applied challenge take 

   

   

 

 

 

 

advantage of -- take Justice Kennedy's opinion up on its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard and -- and do the kind of searching inquiry

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We are in an upended 

  

 

 

 

 

 

world when we think 14 months or 19 months is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

reasonable time to detain a person. 

   

 

 

 

5 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, what I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

-- I totally understand -­

   

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- understand that. 

  

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  But what I'm trying to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

suggest to Your Honor is that that is part and parcel of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an overall scheme that offers tremendous process to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual alien, and that part of the reason for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay is the government -­

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you would think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

that process, at least with respect to 1226(b), is to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensure that the person is not a flight risk or a danger. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Your Honor, it is -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

it is to effectuate Congress's categorical judgment that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those -- either that there -- that they -- is a risk, a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flight risk, and a risk of recidivism, and that it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very hard to predict those. 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I have a couple of 

    

   

 

 

22 

23 

24 

questions I'd like to ask, actually, because it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated statute.  And you can correct me.  I think 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

you have some extra -­

 

 

 

 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I'll -- I'll 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

give you extra time to answer the questions if -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  We're -- we're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

28 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

about three categories.  The first category is people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

who show up on the border.  That's mostly 1225.  I've 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked at that.  I don't see any words there that would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent interpreting the statute from saying, of course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have a bail hearing after six months, and under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever standards.  I'm not going with the Ninth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit standards, et cetera.  I don't see the words. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

So put that in your mind, because you're going to tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me the words in a minute. 

   

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the more important 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

part, I think, is the criminal part.  And there I have 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

divided my mind into three -- three stages. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

Stage one, the person is released from jail, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

let's say.  And the statute says, Attorney General, pick 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him up.  And then there is a period of time where he 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, I have a right to stay in the United States, and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the AG says you don't.  And during that period of time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have the "only if" language. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then we go to the period of there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final removal order, and that's a 90-day order.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there I see no way around the statute.  I agree with 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you.  That 90 days, you cannot get out of the statute. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

I mean, it's definite. 

 

 

 

29 

2 

            

Then the removal period ends, and we are in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

Zadvydas.  And unlike you, I don't think Demore 

   

  

 

 

 

 

overruled Zadvydas.  Demore was talking about a brief 

   

  

 

 

 

 

period of time. 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

8 

            

So now, let's start with the criminal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's look at that statute. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

As you would like to interpret it, during that first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period -- remember, the second period I'm with you, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

90 days.  The third period settled.  That's Zadvydas. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

You got to let him go after six months.  So we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about the first period. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

If there's a -- I think -- take my word for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

it.  I might be wrong.  I go back and did it.  I wrote 

    

    

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Zadvydas thing.  I think it said six months. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

(Laughter.) 

18 

            

19 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  I trust you on that. 

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I might be wrong.  I'm 

    

  

 

 

 

20 

often wrong in what I think I said.  All right? 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

21 

            

(Laughter.) 

22 

            

23 

first part. 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so we are in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now, on that first part, it's a pretty odd 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

statute that can say you don't have -- you -- we can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

keep you for two years, you know, or three, or four. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

You've just been out of jail, hey, your term is over. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your punishment's over, but you've got four more years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here of punishment while we try to get to stage two, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is called the removal order.  That's what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

bothering me. 

 

7 

            

It is bothering me that, as a lawyer, it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

produces an odd statute.  As a person who tries to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret the Constitution, I'd say what happened to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notion that you do let people out on bail when, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're not a flight risk.  And how can they be punished 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for four more years?  Maybe it's the Constitution. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maybe there is a way around that "only if" language. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But the concern is the same. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

So now -- now you have all my questions out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

there, and I -- I know they're -- they're -- do what you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

can. 

18 

            

(Laughter.) 

19 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Okay.  And I'll try to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

be -- I'll try to be brief because I'm cognizant of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief Justice's generosity here. 

 

 

 

              

I do think that the statute squarely 

 

 

 

 

 

forecloses it at both stages, Your Honor.  If we're at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 156(a) -­

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  -- of the appendix to

the petition, the statute starts out 1226(a) that, "The

8 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  May.  May. 

  

  

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  -- "from the United 

  

 

 

 

 

But then -- it does say "may" there, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

then it says, "Except as provided in Subsection C of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section and pending such decision, the Attorney General 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may continue" -­

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  May. 

  

 

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  But it says "except 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

for Subsection C," and then Subsection C is the one that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, unambiguously, "Shall be taken into custody and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

released only if." 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  C is the criminals.  C is 

    

    

 

 

 

18 

the criminals, isn't it? 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I agree.  Criminal 

    

  

  

 

21 

22 

is a different matter.  I'm just talking about -- go 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ahead.  Go ahead. 

  

 

23 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  All right.  Thank you.

I'll reserve the balance of my time.

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I actually think the dispute between the 

 

 

 

 

 

parties is narrower than it seems based on what my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend, Acting Solicitor General, has just said, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we agree that length by itself doesn't make detention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional.  We agree that there doesn't need to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a hard cap on detention.  We're just talking about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the need for an inquiry, that is, the need for a hearing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is individualized rather than a categorical 

   

 

 

 

 

presumption that someone is a danger and flight risk. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you making a statutory 

   

  

 

 

 

16 

17 

argument?  And the Ninth Circuit's decision was based on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- an interpretation of the statute, wasn't it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes.  And what -­

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So are you making a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

statutory argument or are you making a constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

21 

argument? 

22 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  We are making both. 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

Section one makes the constitutional argument.  But I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

still think the dispute is -- is narrower, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really, the primary focus, Your Honor, is about whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the mechanism for implementing that, whether it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional or statutory constraint, has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

habeas, or instead, as Justice Kagan suggested, it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be as I understood -­

   

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand that. 

   

  

 

 

6 

7 

But to me, at least, it makes a difference whether we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting the statute or whether we're interpreting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

the Constitution.

20 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  It -- it -­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And I'll tell you, on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

language of the statute, I think you have a pretty 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

tough -- you have a pretty tough argument. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Your Honor, we concede 

  

 

 

 

 

that as to 1226(c), the -- what you're calling the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal or mandatory detention subclass, we have to win 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there is a serious constitutional problem because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

their interpretation is not -- I mean, they're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

completely unreasonable -­

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you can't -- you're -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that a constitutional argument or a statutory 

   

   

 

 

 

21 

argument? 

22 

            

23 

-­

24 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Well, if there's an alien 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Constitutional avoidance 

  

 

 

25 

isn't just sort of, well, we really don't think we can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

interpret the statute this way, but we don't have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

guts to say that it's unconstitutional.  So we're going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to put the two things together and say, well, by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional avoidance -­

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

6 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Well, I think -­

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- is what it means -- this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

is what it means. 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Understood, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

But we think that the constitutional -- the statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation here is no less plausible than the one in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zadvydas.  I mean, Zadvydas, you've got a 90-day 

    

   

 

 

 

mandatory detention period followed by a requirement for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

release and then an exception.  And the exception says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you may -­

 

 

15 

            

16 

if"? 

17 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you do with "only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Well, "only if" applies 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

to the initial detention.  It authorizes people to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

released even immediately after they are being picked up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they are in the Witness Protection Program.  But it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still doesn't speak clearly to what happens when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention becomes prolonged. 

 

 

23 

            

And as I said, in Zadvydas, the statute said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

you can detain beyond the removal period.  But the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found that that wasn't clear enough to authorize

Zadvydas turned on the "may," you see.  It gave him 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permission.  And as -- as he just pointed out, there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may, may, may, may, may, but then in the criminal side,

people on the border.  I -- you -- pretty strong

"only if" -- and then it's the Witness Protection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

Program. 

13 

            

14 

            

So he says, how do you get around that one? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Understood, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

I -- I only want to say one more thing about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, because I -- I don't want to belabor the point. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But five months -- four months after the Zadvydas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision, Congress passed the Patriot Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

The Patriot Act didn't only -- it clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

authorized long-term detention in six-month intervals; 

 

 

 

 

 

it said six months.  It did it not only in post order 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, which was speaking directly to Zadvydas, but also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in pending cases, that is, cases like this one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

So Subsection (a)(7) of that statute 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

authorizes long-term detention, six-month intervals 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

while the case is pending.  And it authorizes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

substantive review over whether the detention should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue, whether the certification remains valid, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only in national security cases, and that's the rest of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our statutory argument.  I mean, that provision that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

specifically authorizes long-term detention, it is 

 

 

 

 

 

limited to national security cases, in pending cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really makes -- makes the government's interpretation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard to make sense of, because why -- you know, under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their view they actually have more authority to detain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people with simple possession offenses or with petty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thefts than they have people who are accused of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terrorism grounds.  And they actually have even more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority in terrorism cases under 1226(c), under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)(1)(D), than they have under the Patriot Act that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress gave them four months after.

JUSTICE ALITO:  So are you saying that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

1226(a), the Patriot Act provision, makes the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's interpretation of 1226(c) superfluous? 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes, as to terrorism 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

cases, as to all the terrorism cases, that is cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where a person is inadmissible or deportable on a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

terrorism ground, they already had on their view more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority in 1996 than Congress gave them -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there -- there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

different -- there are quite noticeable differences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the two provisions, so I don't know how far this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument can go. 

 

 

37 

4 

            

For one thing, the -- the list of -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

1226(a) -- (a) -- (a)(3)(A), there are listed one, two, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three, four, five, six categories, and four of those are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not included in the Patriot Act provision; isn't that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

right? 

9 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  That's true, but the 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

terrorism grounds are invoked. 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's one thing -­

  

 

 

 

 

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  And the Patriot Act 

  

 

 

 

 

13 

presumably did -- meant to focus on terrorism. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

15 

thing. 

16 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.  Okay.  That's one 

  

  

  

 

 

Under 1226(c)(1), the Attorney General shall 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

take any -- shall take into custody any alien who under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then sub (d) of that is inadmissible or deportable.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the person must be inadmissible or deportable.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under 1226(a), the Attorney General -- (a)(1)(A), the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney General -- well, what is it, (a)(3)(A), the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney General has reasonable grounds to believe.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a different standard. 

   

 

24 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes.  Although the 

  

  

 

 

25 

government interprets the language you read about in --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

2 

is it admissible just to mean that they believe whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not it's been charged. 

 

 

 

 

38 

3 

            

But I don't want to belabor the point, Your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

Honor.  We have to establish there is a serious 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional problem.  There's no question about that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask about your 

   

  

 

 

 

7 

statutory interpretation on 1225? 

 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes, please, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's the one where it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

says, the alien shall be detained for, and then one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision says, for further consideration of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application for asylum, and the other says, for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal proceeding.  And you say that -- that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies only until the relevant proceedings starts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

What applies after that, in your view, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

where would we find it in the statute? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  It's 1226(a) which says 

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

the Attorney General may detain or may release pending a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision on whether the alien -­

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's really not 

  

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

interpreting.  It says, "for the proceeding."  If I tell 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

my children I'm going to visit them for Christmas, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't mean I have to leave on Christmas Eve. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  It does not, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I would hope --

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's your 

  

 

 

2 

interpretation. 

39 

3 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  No.  Because sometimes 

  

  

 

 

4 

5 

6 

"for" is read that way.  Other times "for" means for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of.  And the way you know that in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision, Your Honor, there is two ways you know it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

First, if you are denied a credible fear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

interview, when Congress rewrote this whole statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, they wrote the word "pending" rather than "for" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into a different subsection, a neighboring subsection, 

   

   

 

 

and that's the subsection for people who lose the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credible fear interview.  They're not in our class.  Our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

class is only people who pass the credible fear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interview, are found to have a significant possibility 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of prevailing in their asylum -­

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As I under -- as I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

understood, here the -- the authority ends once the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding begins, then you go to 1226. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  That's right, then you go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

to 1226(a).  You still had detention authority.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

here's the other thing -­

 

 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

very odd interpretation for the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Well, Your Honor, the 

  

 

 

 

 

25 

other argument for that interpretation is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

government already provides bond hearings to people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

detained under cover of that same statute that you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about, the one that says, you shall be detained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for further consideration of the asylum application.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you cross the border in the desert, and then are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrested, and then pass your credible fear interview, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government -- you're still under that same statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall be detained for consideration of the asylum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application -- the government gives bond hearings to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those people, and it doesn't wait for six months.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives it to them as soon as they are in the immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, and, therefore, pursuing the removal proceedings.

10

So here we have a very straightforward 

   

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

application of Clark v. Martinez.  You've got the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  It applies to two groups.  One are our class 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

members who present themselves at the border.  The other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the people who cross in the desert.  The government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is already providing bond hearings to people who cross 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the desert.  And that statute doesn't distinguish 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the two people. 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

happens if they present themselves at the border -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

24 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Then -­

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- or the desert, and they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

say, I have a right to live in the United States? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

You've made a mistake in respect to me.  What happens to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

that person? 

 

3 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  If you're -- if you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

41 

4 

5 

6 

crossed in the desert, you get a bond hearing at -­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming that you establish -- I mean, you could be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summarily moved, but if you -­

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But, of course, I say I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

8 

don't want to leave.  I'm a right -- I have a right to 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

live here. 

 

10 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Right.  Then -- then you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

get a bond hearing under 1226(a).  If you establish that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have a credible fear -­

   

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens if you're at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

the border and you come up and you -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  You don't get a bond 

   

  

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

hearing.  Instead you're only subject to the parole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

process under which you never get a hearing on danger 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and flight risk.  The deportation officer, the jailer, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the one deciding whether you can be detained even for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

years. 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And what's the language of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

the statute that you believe the government points to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say you never get a bond hearing? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  I mean, it says, shall be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

25 

detained for, as Justice Kennedy said.  It's -- that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

42 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

what the statute said.  The bare reading of that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language to permit bond hearings for one set of people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who are detained under them, and if you can read it for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, you can read it for the other people.  This is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

BIA's decision in the matter of XK. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

Now, going back to the constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

question we were discussing earlier and habeas, and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor, I think it's actually critically important 

   

 

 

 

 

 

whether the enforcement mechanism for the right we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about here is available to -- to immigrants and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration court directly or instead has to come via 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas, and the reason why -- there is two reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

The first, this is a class of mostly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

unrepresented people who are obviously not familiar with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our legal system.  The vast majority are -- and we know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both from this record and from experience for years in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lower courts on this, that most of them cannot file 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas petitions.  So if you make the only enforcement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism habeas, you are -­

 

 

 

 

20 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You mean cannot as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

a -- as a practical matter as opposed to a legal matter? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes, Your Honor, no 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

suspension problem here.  As a practical matter, they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

cannot, and we know this as a matter of experience. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

In addition, the habeas cases take months to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

decide.  There's a particular -- and in the Eleventh 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

43 

Circuit they take about 19 months.  In the Third 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit, which is the fastest circuit, they still take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost six.  So as a practical matter, it's not a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningful remedy for prolonged detention, if that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim that you're bringing. 

 

 

 

            

The second serious problem with it is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has never before held that a due process 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right can be vindicated simply by the availability of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas.  I mean, think about it.  Pretrial detainees, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

they have habeas.  Why do they get a bond hearing in a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of days?  Civil commitments.  They -- they have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas.  Why is there a requirement that you have a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing at the outset of civil detention?  So it would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a -- a fundamental shift. 

   

   

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I missed 

    

  

 

 

 

your -- your argument.  They have hearings, why do they

19

22

24 

25 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  No.  Excuse me, Your 

  

  

 

 

 

Honor.  I apologize for that. 

    

 

 

            

This Court has held that there is a hearing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement as a matter of due process for people in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretrial detention, for people facing civil commitment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

et cetera, and that is not dependent on their filing a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas petition.  The Due Process Clause gives that

right, and so the hearing has to be provided whether or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not you file a habeas, and so similarly here, if the Due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Process Clause requires a hearing at some point in time, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it should require that hearing whether or not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detainee has a lawyer who they can get to file a habeas 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

petition. 

7 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But suppose the Due Process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

Clause requires something a little bit more complex than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a simple date.  Suppose that it does require a little 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit of individualized determination as to whether it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be six months or, in a particular case, a little 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit longer, how does that get decided and what vehicle? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Well, I still think the 

   

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

vehicle would be this case, and I don't think the fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's a class action is a barrier to that.  We 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have -- we have sought relief on behalf of people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detained for years, and if this Court said, for example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a detainee who is engaged in dilatory tactics is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not entitled to a danger and flight risk determination 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in their case, that's relief that would then be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available because you'd still get the inquiry, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because somebody has to look at the case at some point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and see, is this a case where there's dilatory tactics, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or is this a case where the person didn't spend even a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day in jail or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that seems to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

45 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

me to be a strong argument against using the class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action as a vehicle to resolve these questions.  I mean, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

if the nature of relief depends upon peculiar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, it seems to me that the commonality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement is lacking. 

 

 

7 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  So let me give a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

procedural and a substantive answer to that, 

   

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

10 

            

The government did not seek cert on class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

cert.  They litigated it.  They lost it in the Ninth 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit.  They actually re-raised it in the summary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment.  They didn't seek review of it.  So they have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceded both typicality and commonality for purposes of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

this proceedings. 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, but the decision of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

the Ninth Circuit was based on interpretation of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, and you want to go -- you want to -- you want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to affirm on an alternative ground, which is that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional, so I don't know how far you can get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with that argument. 

 

 

22 

            

But we could -- if you want to be very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

strict about what's before us, we could simply say the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the statute is wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and remand for further proceedings to the Ninth Circuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

46 

1 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think 

    

  

 

 

 

2 

3 

that -- that -- that would be consistent with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class -- the way the government has litigated the class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

certification. 

5 

            

But let me also give a substantive answer to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

Your Honor -­

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- and it would also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

be consistent with the way the Ninth Circuit interpreted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case and the case that's here.  We do not have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional issue before us. 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  We've argued it in 

  

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

Section I of our brief, but you're correct that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit didn't rule on a constitutional ground. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Absolutely, Your Honor. 

 

 

15 

            

The second point I want to make, though, is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

everybody in the class, in our view, is entitled to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry.  Someone has to look at the detention and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide, is this a detention which remains reasonable? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Does it continue to be reasonable in relation to its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose?  That's our argument. 

  

 

 

21 

            

Many of the people under the injunction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

don't get out.  About 30 percent of them don't even get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a bond set.  And even of those who do get a bond set, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another 30 percent don't actually get out under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bond.  So --

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does that represent 

  

 

 

 

 

47 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

a typical remedy in habeas to require inquiries in every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case?  Perhaps I'm wrong, but I would have thought 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

habeas is either you can be detained or you can't be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detained, as opposed to a procedural across-the-board 

   

 

 

 

 

requirement of a hearing. 

   

 

7 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  No, Your Honor.  For 

  

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

example, the Hamdi decision, the Court requires 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearings.  That particular case was a habeas, but it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

sets a due process rule that then applies in other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  The Court has to determine the conditions under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the detention would be lawful.  And, as I said, to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confine individual detainees here to habeas petitions is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively to close the house door. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So tell me why the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

regulations under 1226(a) are inadequate.  There is an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement -- Zadvydas is an administrative -- or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response by the BIA or the INS, whatever they're calling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it today, was to create an administrative process.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why is the one here inadequate? 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  I mean, we have very few 

    

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

quarrels with the 1226(a) regulations that govern people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who are entitled to bond hearings.  I mean, obviously, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

as they're promulgated, now they wholly exclude people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who have certain criminal convictions and --

own -­

 

3 

            

4 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, standing on its 

  

 

 

 

 

48 

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Right.  But -­

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- those aliens -- those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

aliens who have been here for a long time but didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

commit a crime. 

   

7 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

our view, it said on the briefs we believe the burden of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proof should be on the government by clear and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convincing, because that's the standard used in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant deprivations of liberty and for periodic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearings and such. 

 

 

13 

            

But the most important thing to us is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

it be a meaningful hearing.  So there has to be a way 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the detainee to raise, I was not -- spent even a day 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in jail.  I was not sentenced to even a day in jail, and 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet I've spent 10 months in immigration detention. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

Or like Mr. Rodriguez, I came here at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

age of one.  I don't know anybody in the place I'm from, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so I'm not a flight risk.  Or I'm going to win my case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because I'm eligible for cancellation of removal, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is true of more than half of the mandatory subclass. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There has to be a way where they can make these kinds of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

arguments. 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why are those arguments 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

not available in the administrative process? 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

2 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  They are available under 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

1226(a).  If we could get everyone onto that statute, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then they would be available and -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

6 

statute. 

7 

            

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm looking just at that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know you want to look 

    

 

 

 

 

 

9 

at 1225 and 1226(c), but I'm looking just at 1226(a). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes.  So our position is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

all of the class should properly be understood -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive the benefit of the 1226(a) procedures.  And our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only disagreements with those are in Section III of our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, as I said, the burden of proof, and that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearings be periodic, because sometimes people get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detained for, you know, three, four years.  I've had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients detained seven years.  And so there has to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some kind of periodic -­

 

 

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Periodic review of 

  

 

 

 

20 

long-term detentions under 1226(a). 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're not -- you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

not arguing that they have to be, like the Ninth Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, a court review.  It can be simply an

4 

5

7 

has to be by a neutral decisionmaker, which, you know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we draw in parts from Morris v. Brewer, which Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy cited in the -- in your defense against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zadvydas, that there has to be a neutral decisionmaker. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

The ICE officials who are making these decisions are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially the jailer.  They're local detention 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

officers. 

9 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're not -- you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

not -- you wouldn't be quarrelling if it was an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

immigration judge. 

 

12 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yeah, absolutely not.  An 

  

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

immigration judge is all that we are seeking with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to that, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's not what 

  

 

 

 

 

16

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Correct.  For -- it 

  

  

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

exists for people detained under 1226(a) as they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand the statute, but it doesn't apply to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people with criminal convictions or -­

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm trying to 

  

 

 

 

22 

concentrate on 1226(a). 

 

 

23 

            

24 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Okay, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's wrong with the

10

15 

16 

17 

18 

proof, in our view, should be clear and convincing on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government and that there should be a periodic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing, or, as Your Honor had suggested, if you take -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make them say the length of detention is a relevant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor so that you can get a new hearing just based on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that the time has passed, that would help. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But to be clear, Your Honor, well over half 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this class is not under 1226(a) now; right?  So we'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to win -- for it to be meaningful relief for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vast majority of people, we'd also have to win that when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention becomes prolonged, the regulations that govern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1226(a) then come to govern the -- both the arrivings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the people who -­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that's pretty 

  

 

 

 

 

hard to do with 1226(c) -­

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  So then -­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- when 1226(a) says 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

this applies to everything but.  The statute is pretty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear on that. 

 

 

23 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Okay.  So in that case, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

Your Honor, let me go back to, then, the constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion that we were having earlier.  My friend had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

suggested that that hearing that's available, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

perhaps only as a matter of the Due Process Clause, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's sufficient for it to focus on whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government has engaged -- you know, has run proceedings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very quickly so that if a person is engaged in good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faith litigation of a substantial defense that, in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's view, as I understand it, that's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient justification for detention.

And that is actually the most serious

problem with their view on the Due Process Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because if a person has a substantial defense and they 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

are litigating that in good faith, that does not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily mean that their detention is serving a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable purpose.  In fact, it's almost inversely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

correlated to it; right?  I mean, if a person has a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial defense, then it's far more likely that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are not a flight risk because they're going to want to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go to immigration court to maintain their immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

status. 

20 

            

And similarly, if a person has a substantial 

   

   

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

defense, that means they're not in a class of people 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress wanted to mandate the deportation of, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which probably means they have a less serious crime.  If 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are an aggravated felon, for example, you're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible for LPR cancellation of removal.  Most of the

mandatory subclass is eligible for that. 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that the flight 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

53 

3 

risk and danger to the community are both continuums? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes, Your Honor, but I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

think it has to be reasonably related to the detention. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So -- excuse me, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, so if you have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

situation where the person is litigating in -- for -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- there has been lengthy litigation, but the judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't say this is done in bad faith or it's dilatory, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's just very lengthy and it keeps going on and on and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on and on, and then you have a flight risk that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someplace on this scale and you have a risk to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

community that's someplace on this scale, how can you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address how something like that can come out -- should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come out with any kind of a categorical role? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  So we don't advocate how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

that person -- releasing that person on a categorical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  We're only talking about getting the inquiry.  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we agree:  That is a very individualized judgment that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the judge has to look at:  How serious is the criminal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history here?  How strong are the equities as to flight 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

risk? 

24 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You do say -- or the Ninth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

Circuit says there has to be clear and convincing

evidence which is higher than the flight risk standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a standard bail case. 

   

 

 

3 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  It is, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

Although, remember, these are only hearings happening 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after six months.  So, you know, you got that bail 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing in a matter of days in the criminal context. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

But -­

 

8 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is this -- is this -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

right.  I'm focusing now right on the people who want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come into the United States.  If they're in the desert 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they say, I won't go back because I have a right to 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

live here, they do get a bail hearing.  So if the whole 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is taking a long time, they'll at least have a bail 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

hearing. 

15 

            

If they're at the border and they're coming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

in under the same statute, 1225, they say, I'm not going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back.  I have a right to live here.  And then there is 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

no hearing? 

 

19 

            

20 

Honor. 

21 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  That's correct, Your 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, how can that -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

don't get that, because what it says is "may" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout, until you get to the word "shall be detained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a proceeding under Section 1229(a)"; is that right? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I look up 

   

  

 

 

55 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

Section 1229(a).  And Section 1229(a), which I've been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading, doesn't say anything about keeping them in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention.  So why isn't it the simplest thing in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world once that person's at the border and they say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're going to detain you for 1229(a).  You say, have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 1229(a) tomorrow.  And if they don't have it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tomorrow, then you say, but I'm into the 1229(a); it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just hasn't been scheduled yet.  And therefore, you get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bail after six months? 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

13 

            

14 

            

Have you tried that one? 

 

 

 

 

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  I mean, that's -­

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What did they say? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  That's our statutory 

  

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

argument.  The government says that the regulations, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

even though -- even though the person is in front of an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration judge, the government says that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations prevent the immigration judge from having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the power to release the person on bail.  So even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

though -­

 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So it's the regulations; 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

it's not the statute.  So we could say -- I mean, I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just saying -- you're going to agree with this, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the problem.  I need a disagreement. 

    

   

 

25 

            

But the -- the -- you could say they do it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

56

4 

for the desert.  The language doesn't forbid it.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

throws you into 1229(a).  It's possible to interpret the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute as saying for purposes of a bail hearing, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1229(a) starts tomorrow. 

 

 

5 

            

6 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes, sir. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So we could do that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

one on the statute if it is correct that you should not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold a person for years in the United States without 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving him a chance to get back to his freedom through a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bail hearing, if appropriate. 

 

 

 

11 

            

Okay.  (c).  Now, I'm still stuck on (c). 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

And the reason, the value of a statutory interpretation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that we're dealing with tens of thousands, hundreds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of thousands, or millions of people, possibly.  And it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an administrative agency organization, and they need a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  They need a rule.  And if we can interpret the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, you can give them a rule.  And that rule, then, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can have lots of discretion in it through bail hearings, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

et cetera. 

 

20 

            

21 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I haven't heard from 

   

  

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

you yet what I -- I see no way -- if you want to tell 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me -- I see no way of getting around the 90 days.  That 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

90 days, it seems to me to be they don't get a hearing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around the 90 days.  The removal order is there.

Those people are not in our class.  If you are -­

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  We are not worried.  If 

  

  

 

 

 

 

10 

the government -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then after, we've

got Zadvydas.  And then before -­

  

 

 

 

 

13 

            

14 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the 90 days starts, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

say, well, gee, shouldn't we -- shouldn't there be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception here so that the period between the time they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are released from their punishment to the time we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hearing, if that goes on for 10 years, you know, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't -- the person was supposed to be punished for six 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months, not for 10 years.

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  That's right.

I do with the language?

2 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Right. 

  

 

58 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- and -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

the -- the -- you know, language counts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

5 

            

6 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I -­

   

  

 

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes.  Two -- two thoughts 

  

  

 

 

 

 

7 

to work on the language, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

First, assuming nobody is willing to accept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

1226(c) can be interpreted, every court of appeals said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it could be interpreted, at least to have some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonableness limit in it, whether a six-month rule or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

another one. 

 

13 

            

But if -- if I can't persuade Your Honors of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

that, the Due Process Clause often -- the court does use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules of administrability where they are needed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create uniformity of practice and -­

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the court

below didn't reach your constitutional argument, right?

20 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  It did not, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, do you expect

us to do it in the first instance? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  There's a voluminous 

   

  

 

23 

24 

record, and it's entirely briefed, but certainly the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court could.  But the Court could also remand for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

consideration --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm a little bit surprised 

   

  

 

 

 

59 

2 

3 

4 

5 

that you answered the question that way, because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me that it's quite obvious what the court below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinks as to the constitutional question where did they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get this from, except as an understanding of what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

Constitution required.

8

11

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

court, I think -­

   

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, maybe they 

  

 

 

 

 

didn't have the courage of their convictions.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they do think it's unconstitutional, they could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said so rather than stretching the principles of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional avoidance to the length they did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Your Honor, I won't 

   

  

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

pretend to understand what was in the heads of the -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth Circuit judges, except that they had seen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prolonged detention problems for years.  They had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

decided in 2005 that mandatory detention applied only to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expeditious removal proceedings, and there continued to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be cases floating up, individual habeas cases, four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

years. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

              

I had a client four and a half years 

   

   

 

 

 

detained by the government, was appealing seven years, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that was part of why the court thought we needed a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- a system, whether -- I would suggest even if it's on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review

due process grounds, you need a system that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

administrable. 

3 

            

And, you know, the person doesn't even know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 

4 

5 

6 

7 

-- the judge doesn't know when to pull the case off the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shelf and look at whether or not to conduct the inquiry, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito, that you were talking about, unless you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have some kind of trigger that allows them to do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

And the time periods -- and if you look at, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

say, the Third Circuit experience, right, they said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2011 that it had a reasonableness limit as a statutory 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

matter, and that then there should be an inquiry into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not the detention remains permissible.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they say we reject the time period because of Demore -­

lot further than Zadvydas did.  Zadvydas just created a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption, or did away from -- with a presumption. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here the court is actually requiring -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  But, Your Honor, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

requiring -- Zadvydas requires release.  This is just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the inquiry.  So it's actually quite similar. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

You know, what we're saying is unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

removal is imminent -- okay, it's just a presumption -­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless removal is imminent, there -- there's a two-week

window to conduct the hearing under the injunction, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should look into conduct an inquiry to see whether or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not danger or flight risk actually justifies the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continued detention of this person.  It's not -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a cap on detention at all.  And as I said, many 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

people don't get out.  So I think it's quite consistent 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the approach that the Court took in Zadvydas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But you know, going back to the question of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas, you know, versus the constitutional rule, Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor, in the Third Circuit, four years later, they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still seeing individual habeases.  There's massive 

  

 

 

 

 

disagreement in the lower courts, and amongst the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration judges, about, you know, how you count this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or how you count that.  And then they say, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe it would be good to have a nine-month, 12-month

The Eleventh Circuit does the same thing in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the supra decision.  They say, we want to give some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance, because it can't be that you have to file a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas petition just to get the inquiry that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes -- whether -- and it might even -- the Due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Process should require. 

 

 

            

And so having some kind of guide, even if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not as fixed as you have to do it within two weeks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or six months, you know, some kind of temporal limit so

that the person can go directly to the immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge, not to try to get to Federal court, which most of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them can't do, go directly to the immigration judge and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, can you please now conduct an individualized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62 

5 

inquiry -­

 

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course, the 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

problem is that that looks an awful lot like drafting a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute or a regulation.  And it -- it seems to me that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's quite a leap. 

   

 

10 

            

We -- our job is to read the statute, and if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

it presents -- if it's unconstitutional, that's our job. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But we can't just write a different statute because we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it would be more administrable. 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Your Honor, I think it's 

   

  

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

not that different from what the Court did in a number 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of cases, in Riverside v. McLaughlin, in Schnackenberg, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the Court said six months is the maximum time that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can go to prison without a jury trial. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

Now, here, it's just a similar kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

20 

administrable rule.  You know, even Zadvydas -­

  

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  An administrable 

  

 

 

22 

constitutional rule, you're saying. 

 

 

 

23 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Yeah.  And these are 

  

  

 

 

 

24 

constitutional cases. 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  We're not making up a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

statute; we're devising a constitutional limit. 

   

 

 

 

63 

2 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

3 

These are all administrable -­

 

 

 

 

4 

            

5 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So we're beyond -­

  

 

 

 

 

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  -- rules of the 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

Constitution I'm talking about.  McNeil, and the civil 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

commitment context, is a constitutional rule that 

   

 

 

 

 

touched some -­

 

 

9 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, just let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

make sure.  So we're now in the context of deciding the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional question, and we put the statute -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know you want us to, and that's -- that's fine.  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just saying it's pretty unusual for us to do that in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first instance.  But when you're talking about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrable rule, that argument is being made on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption that it's otherwise unconstitutional. 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  The -- the cases that we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

cite in our brief are all constitutional administratable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules that have been -- got into effect, the ones that I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

was mentioning. 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

              

I actually thought that there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

colorable claim that, because Congress specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized six months of detention, prolonged detention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in national security cases, you could actually read the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that way.  But obviously, that doesn't seem to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

be particularly persuasive. 

 

 

64 

2 

            

The last things I'll say, Your Honor -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

 

know my time must be limited -- on the relevance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

what -­

 

5 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you get a few 

   

  

 

 

 

 

6 

extra minutes too. 

 

 

7 

            

(Laughter.) 

8 

            

MR. ARULANANTHAM:  Thank you.  Thank you so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

9 

much, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

 

10 

            

You know, if you -- the record is replete 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

with examples where the immigration judge makes such a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

big difference because they're just a hearing where you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can second-guess -- excuse me -- not second-guess, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assess the decision of the jailing authority. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

So, you know, the Merida Declaration at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

Joint Appendix page 518 is one such example.  If a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person with a nonviolent criminal history who is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

detained for three years, he finally gets the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized assessment, he gets out on $5,000 bail. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

You know, Exhibit 73 to my declaration -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

this is this Ethiopian asylum-seeker.  He has passed the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background check.  He has passed the background check, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and he is found to have a significant possibility of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asylum.  And now he is going in front of the deportation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer who is conducting his parole review.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

1 

deportation officer just chooses not to believe him. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

When he finally gets in front of an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

immigration judge who grants him asylum, the immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge says, but you've already passed the background 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

check, and there -- there's no question from here.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have a witness now because we are having a hearing, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this person is who he says he is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

And that's all we are talking about, just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

the minimal requirement of a hearing in front of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neutral decisionmaker for people who have been -- had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very, very long periods of incarceration.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimal requirement we think is available under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute and also under the Due Process Clause.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

Justice.  I'll be brief. 

  

 

 

              

I wanted to make first a short point on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patriot Act to shore up the construction of 1226(c). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

There are two, as Justice Alito suggested, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

two fundamental differences with the Patriot Act.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first is that it allows for a certification.  It has to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be by the attorney general or the deputy attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

general.  It can't be delegated, but then that is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66 

reviewable.  It's very different from the 1226(c) where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the alien gets a Joseph hearing and it's subject to -­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to BIA review. 

 

 

            

The second piece of the Patriot Act that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes it very different is that it overrides Zadvydas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and actually permits the attorney general to provide for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detention, even when there's no foreseeable likelihood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3

9 

of relief. 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

            

And so it's -- it is a situation in which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is, of course, some overlap, as one would expect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a situation -- in a series of statutes dealing with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

terrorists, but the -- there is no superfluity, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're dealing with very different things.  It gives 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary powers to the attorney general for a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

limited group. 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

              

I also wanted to touch base on -- to address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some of the statutory arguments with respect to 1225.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't believe that -- for the reasons Justice Kennedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, I don't believe that the statute really is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous.  It says, and this is on page 152(a) of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix to the petition, "The alien shall be detained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for further consideration of the application for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asylum."  And then on 155(a) it says, "The alien shall 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be detained for a proceeding under Section 1229(a)."

What Justice Kennedy said -­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I wasn't -- I wasn't 

   

   

  

 

 

67 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

thinking of necessarily asylum seeker.  I was thinking 

    

 

 

 

 

 

of a man who goes to a foreign country who is an alien. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He has a family in the United States.  He comes back, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and he says, I want to go home.  And the immigration 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer says, no, we're going to keep you locked up for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five years because there was something wrong with your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initial application.  He says, no, there wasn't.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

say, yes, there was. 

 

 

 

11 

            

So I'm simply asking, if that human being, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

who has a family in the United States is, in the view of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government, locked up for five years without any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing whatsoever, without any opportunity for bail, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even though he can get out of it simply by abandoning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his family and returning to another country, is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position of the government as to what this statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

means? 

19 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  So, Your Honor, the 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

position of the government is that that individual would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an individualized as-applied challenge in a habeas 

   

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding, but that is not what should drive the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory interpretation, which is principally what we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are talking about here. 

 

 

 

            

And not only is it correct -- is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

correct for the reasons Justice Kennedy suggested about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68 

his -- his Christmas visit, but that has been the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of the statute -- of -- of that language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the statute since 1917.  The "shall be detained for" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formulation exists -- was in the original statute in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1917.  It was in the statute that was enacted in 1952. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It has always been understood -­

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's odd language, though, 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

General.  I mean, easy enough to say pending a removal 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

decision, or pending an asylum decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  And that's the -­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And they didn't say that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

They said for the consideration of an asylum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application.  Like, why would you say that, to say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pending an asylum decision? 

 

 

 

16 

            

GENERAL GERSHENGORN:  And that's precisely, 

  

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

Your Honor, why I wanted to invoke the history.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that is how it's been understood for a hundred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, for literally 100 years or 99 years, and -­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and it has always been understood that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive way to get into the country while those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings are pending is through parole. 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

Now, the government does use parole for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

lot of these individuals, and so they do -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government is not saying that these individuals don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

get any process.  They actually get process.  They have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an IJ look at their -- their credible fear

separate parole authority, and the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's -- I'll just finish up with this.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's position on parole is at JA44, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explains how the government applies parole in these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations.  Thank you.
