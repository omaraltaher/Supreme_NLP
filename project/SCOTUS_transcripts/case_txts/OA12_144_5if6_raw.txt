Mr. Cooper? 

 MR. COOPER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 12-144, Hollingsworth v. Perry. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9 
New York's highest court, in a case similar 
10
11  to this one, remarked that until quite recently, it was 
12  an accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived in 
13  any society in which marriage existed.  Marriage --
14
15
16  best if you could begin with the standing issue. 
17
18  Mr. Chief Justice. 
19
20
21  that measure before this Court as representatives of the 
22  people and the State of California to defend the 
23  validity of a measure that they brought forward. 
24
25

Proposition 8, the initiative, have standing to defend 

jurisdictional and merits issues here.  Maybe it'd be 

standing to proponents of ballot initiatives? 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Cooper, we have 

 MR. COOPER:  I'd be happy to, 

 Your Honor, the official proponents of 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Have we ever granted 

3
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. COOPER:  No, Your Honor, the Court has 

not done that, but the Court has never had before it a 

clear expression from a unanimous State's high court 

that --


1
2 
3 
4 
5
is -- the concern is certainly, the proponents are 
6 
interested in getting it on the ballot and seeing that 
7 
all of the proper procedures are followed, but once it's 
8 
passed, they have no proprietary interest in it.  It's 
9 
law for them just as it is for everyone else.  So how 
10
11  are they distinguishable from the California citizenry 
12  in general? 
13
14  Honor, because the Constitution of the State of 
California and its election code provide, according to 
15
16  the unanimous interpretation of the California Supreme 
17  Court, that the official proponents, in addition to the 
18  other official responsibilities and authorities that 
19  they have in the initiative process, that those official 
20
21  responsibility to defend the validity of that 
22  initiative --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess the attorney 
23
24  general of this State doesn't have any proprietary 
25

 MR. COOPER:  They're distinguishable, Your 

proponents also have the authority and the 

Official 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, this is -- this 

interest either, does he? 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

it, can't he --

can defend it. 

Official 

 MR. COOPER:  No, Your Honor, nor did --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but he can defend 

 MR. COOPER:  -- nor did --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- because the law says he 

 MR. COOPER:  That's right, Your Honor.  Nor 
did the legislative leaders in the Karcher case have --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could the State --
9
MR. COOPER: -- any particular enforcement --
10
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- could -- could the State 
11
12  assign to any citizen the rights to defend a judgment of 
13  this kind? 
14
15
16  the question before the Court because -- because it 
17  isn't any citizen.  It's -- it is the -- it is the 
18  official proponents that have a specific and -- and 
19  carefully detailed --
20
21  on the hypothetical:  Could a State just assign to 
22  anybody the ability to do this? 
23
24  well might.  It very well might be able to decide that 
25

 MR. COOPER:  Justice Kagan, that would be 
a -- a very tough question.  It's -- it's by no means 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I just -- if you would 

 MR. COOPER:  Your Honor, I think it very 

any citizen could step forward and represent the 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

interests of the State and the people in that State --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that would 

be -- I'm sorry, are you finished? 

 MR. COOPER:  Yes, Your Honor. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  That -- that 

may be true in terms of who they want to represent, 
but -- but a State can't authorize anyone to proceed in 
Federal court because that would leave the definition 
under Article III of the Federal Constitution as to who 
can bring -- who has standing to bring claims up to each 

1 
2
3 
4
5
6 
7 
8 
9 
10
11  State.  And I don't think we've ever allowed anything 
12  like that. 
13
14  the point I want to make is that there is no question 
the State has standing.  The State itself has standing 
15
16  to represent its own interests in the validity of its 
17  own enactments.  And if the State's public officials 
18  decline to do that, it is within the State's authority 
19  surely, I would submit, to identify, if not all -- any 
20
21  certainly those, that that very clear and identifiable 
22  group of citizens --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the Chief -- the 
23
24  Chief Justice and Justice Kagan have given a proper 
25

hypothetical to test your theory.  But in this case the 

 MR. COOPER:  But -- but, Your Honor, I guess 

citizen or at least supporter of -- of the measure, 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. COOPER:  But of course it is, and I 


think the key --


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But can you tell me --

proponents, number one, must give their official 

address, they must pay money, and they must all act in 

unison under California law.  So these five proponents 

were required at all times to act in unison, so that 

distinguishes -- and to register and to pay money for 

the -- so in that sense it's different from simply 

saying any citizen.

10
11  that's a factual background with respect to their right 
12  to put the ballot initiative on the ballot, but how does 
13  it create an injury to them separate from that of every 
14  other taxpayer to have laws enforced? 
15
16  before the Court, I would submit, is not the injury to 
17  the individual proponents, it's the injury to the State. 
18  The -- the legislators in the Karcher case had no 
19  individual particularized injury, and yet this Court 
20
21  State's interests -- the State's injury --
22
23  amici have suggested that it seems counterintuitive to 
24  think that the State is going to delegate to people who 
don't have a fiduciary duty to them.  That it's going to

recognized they were proper representatives of the 

MR. COOPER:  Your Honor, the -- the question 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  At least one of the 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company

proffered the question of the Attorney General.  The 

Attorney General has no personal interest. 


 MR. COOPER:  True.  No --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He has a fiduciary 

 MR. COOPER:  The Attorney General, whether 

MR. COOPER:  Well --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- Justice Scalia 


delegate the responsibility of representing the State to 
individuals who have their own views.  They proposed the 
ballot initiative because it was their individual views, 
not necessarily that of the State.  So --

11  obligation. 
12
13  it's a fiduciary obligation or not, is in normal 
14  circumstances the representative of the State to defend 
the validity of the State's enactments when they are 
15
16  challenged in Federal court.  But when that officer 
17  doesn't do so, the State surely has every authority and 
18  I would submit the responsibility to identify 
19  particularly in an initiative -- an initiative context. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't the fiduciary 
20
21  duty requirements before the State can designate a 
22  representative an important one? 
 MR. COOPER:  Your Honor, I would submit to 
23
24  you that I don't think there's anything in Article III 
or in any of this Court's decisions that suggest that a 
25

 MR. COOPER:  And the California Supreme 

Official 

representative of a State must be -- have a fiduciary 

duty, but I would also suggest --


 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, generally you 


 MR. COOPER:  And Your Honor --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Here these individuals 

don't need to specify it because generally the people 

who get to enforce the legislation of the government are 
people who are in government positions elected by the 
people.

18  case a constitutional amendment, was brought forward by 
19  the initiative process.

officials, to take issues out of their hands. 


 And if public officials could effectively 

veto an initiative by refusing to appeal it, then the 

initiative process would be invalidated. 


MR. COOPER:  In California --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, that's the kind of 

think, 40 States, many States have what was called a 

public action.  A public action is an action by any 

citizen primarily to vindicate the interest in seeing 

that the law is enforced.

And of course, if that kind of action is the 
15
16  very kind that does not lie, well, then to say, but they 
17  really feel it's important that the law be enforced, 
18  they really want to vindicate the process, and these are

brief which takes the other side of it is making a 
strong argument, well, they aren't the State.  They are 
really no more than a group of five people who feel 
really strongly that we should vindicate this public

changing and changing rapidly in this country as people 
throughout the country engage in an earnest debate over 
whether the age-old definition of marriage should be 
changed to include same-sex couples. 

The question before this Court is whether 

 The issues, the constitutional issues that 

the Constitution puts a stop to that ongoing democratic 
debate and answers this question for all 50 States.  And 
it does so only if the Respondents are correct that no 
rational, thoughtful person of goodwill could possibly 
disagree with them, in good faith, on this agonizingly

19  that gender-based classifications get any kind of

 MR. COOPER:  That is --
21
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the same-sex intimate 
22
23  conduct was considered criminal in many States in 1971, 
24  so I don't think we can extract much from Baker against

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Cooper, Baker v. 

heightened scrutiny. 

Official 

 MR. COOPER:  Well, Your Honor, certainly I
 
acknowledge the precedential limitations of a summary 

dismissal.  But Baker against Nelson also came fairly 

fast on the heels of the Loving decision.  And, Your 

Honor, I simply make the observation that it seems 
implausible in the extreme, frankly, for nine justices 
to have -- to have seen no substantial Federal question 
if it is true, as the Respondents maintain, that the 
traditional definition of marriage, insofar as -- insofar 
as it does not include same-sex couples, insofar as it is 

1
2 
3 
4 
5
6 
7 
8 
9 
10
11  a gender definition, is irrational and can only be 
12  explained -- can only be explained, as a result of 
13  anti-gay malice and a bare desire to harm.  That would 
14  have been --
15
16  treated as a gender-based classification? 
 MR. COOPER:  Your Honor, I --
17
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's a difficult question 
18
19  that I've been trying to wrestle with it. 
20
21  not.  We do not think it is properly viewed as a 
22  gender-based classification.  Virtually every appellate 
23  court, State and Federal, with one exception, Hawaii, in 
24  a superseded opinion, has agreed that it is not a 
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you believe this can be 

MR. COOPER:  Yes, Your Honor.  And we do 

gender-based classification, but I guess it is gender 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

But we -- we agree that to the extent that 

the classification impacts, as it clearly does, same-sex 
couples, that -- that classification can be viewed as 
being one of sexual orientation rather than --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Outside of the --

-based in the sense that marriage itself is a gendered 

institution, a gendered term.  And so in the same way
 
that fatherhood is gendered or motherhood is gendered, 

it's gendered in that sense.

outside of the marriage context, can you think of any 
10
11  other rational basis, reason for a State using sexual 
12  orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits 
13  or imposing burdens on them?  Is there any other 
14  rational decision-making that the government could make? 
15
16  sort, any other decision? 
17
18  have any -- anything to offer you in that regard.  I 
19  think marriage is --
20
21  if that is true, then why aren't they a class?  If 
22  they're a class that makes any other discrimination 
23  improper, irrational, then why aren't we treating them 
24  as a class for this one benefit?  Are you saying that the 
interest of marriage is so much more compelling than any 
25

Denying them a job, not granting them benefits of some 

 MR. COOPER:  Your Honor, I cannot.  I do not 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  If that --

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

other interest as they could have? 


Official 

 MR. COOPER:  No, Your Honor, we certainly
 

are not.  We -- we are saying the interest in marriage 

and the -- and the State's interest and society's 

interest in what we have framed as responsible pro --
procreation is -- is vital, but at bottom, with respect 
to those interests, our submission is that same-sex 
couples and opposite-sex couples are simply not 
similarly situated.

But to come back to your precise question, I 
10
11  think, Justice Sotomayor, you're -- you're probing into 
12  whether or not sexual orientation ought to be viewed as 
13  a quasi-suspect or suspect class, and our position is 
14  that it does not qualify under this Court's standard 
15
16  suspectedness.  The -- the class itself is -- is quite 
17  amorphous.  It defies consistent definition as -- as the 
18  Plaintiffs' own experts were -- were quite vivid on. 
19  It -- it does not -- it -- it does not qualify as an 
20
21  sense. 
 Again, the Plaintiffs --
22
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you -- so what -- I 
23
24  don't quite understand it.  If you're not dealing with 
this as a class question, then why would you say that 
25

accident of birth, immutability in that -- in that 

and -- and traditional tests for identifying 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

the government is not free to discriminate against them? 
 MR. COOPER:  Well, Your Honor, I would think 
that -- that -- I think it's a -- it's a very different 
question whether or not the government can proceed 
arbitrarily and irrationally with respect to any group 

of people, regardless of whether or not they qualify 

under this Court's traditional test for suspectedness. 

And -- and the hypothetical I understood you to be 

offering, I would submit would create -- it would --

unless there's something that -- that is not occurring 

1

6 
7 
8 
9 
10
11  to me immediately, an arbitrary and capricious 
12  distinction among similarly situated individuals, 
13  that -- that is not what we think is at the -- at the 
14  root of the traditional definition of marriage. 
15
16  understand your argument.  As -- in reading the briefs, 
17  it seems as though your principal argument is that 
18  same-sex and opposite -- sex couples are not similarly 
19  situated because opposite-sex couples can procreate, 
20
21  interest in marriage is in regulating procreation.  Is 
22  that basically correct? 
23
24  essential thrust of our -- our position, yes. 
25

same-sex couples cannot, and the State's principal 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Cooper, could I just

 MR. COOPER:  Your Honor, we -- we go further 

in -- in the sense that it is reasonable to be very 
concerned that redefining marriage to -- as a genderless 
institution could well lead over time to harms to that 

have sort of a reason for not including same-sex 
couples.  Is there any reason that you have for 
excluding them?  In other words, you're saying, well, if 
we allow same-sex couples to marry, it doesn't serve the 
State's interest.  But do you go further and say that it 
harms any State interest?

 What harm you see happening and when and how

That is reason enough, Your Honor, that would hardly be

12  you don't mention some concrete things.  If you redefine 
13  marriage to include same-sex couples, you must -- you 
14  must permit adoption by same-sex couples, and there's --
15
16  sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a 
17  child in a -- in a single-sex family, whether that is 
18  harmful to the child or not.  Some States do not -- do 
19  not permit adoption by same-sex couples for that reason. 
20
21  California does. 
22
23  answer to that.  Do you know the answer to that, whether 
24  it -- whether it harms or helps the child? 
25

14  five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years 
15
16
17  legal injury or legal -- what could be a legal injury, 
18  and that's the voice of these children.  There are some 
19  40,000 children in California, according to the Red

this issue is being debated and will continue to be

married who can't have children.  And so take a State 
that does allow adoption and say -- there, what is the 

or accept Justice Scalia's version of your argument and 
that distinguishes California.  Now, let's look at 
California.  What precisely is the way in which allowing 
gay couples to marry would interfere with the vision of 
marriage, as procreation of children, that allowing 
sterile companies -- couples of different sexes to marry

imagine I wall off California and I'm looking just 
20
21  there, where you say that doesn't apply.  Now, what

23  marriage as a tool towards procreation?  Given the fact

is that redefining marriage as a genderless institution 
will sever its abiding connection to its historic

marriage away from the raising of children and to the

conduct outside of that marriage.  Outside of that

officers in different States to thwart the initiative

California Supreme Court saw it with respect to

of the State of California.  They made a professional

other people out there with individual personalized 
injury that would satisfy Article III.

different case.  I don't know about this case.  If there 
6 
was, for example, this was an initiative measure that 
7 
allocated certain resources of the State of California 
8 
and the people -- maybe it was a binary system of people 
9 
got resources and other people didn't get resources, 
10
11  there could be standing.  Someone would show actual 
12  injury. 
13
14  the Supreme Court -- this Court, decided in 
Raines v. Byrd that Congress couldn't specify members of 
15
16  Congress in that context even where the measure depleted 
17  or diminished powers of Congress --
18
19  bottom line --
20
21  the same separation of powers doctrine that underlies 
22  the Federal Constitution.  You couldn't have a Federal 
23  initiative, for example.  They're free of all that. 
24
25

 So start from the proposition that a State 
has standing to defend the constitutionality of a State 

 The point, I guess, at the bottom of this is 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Olson, I think the 

JUSTICE ALITO:  The States are not bound by 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

law -- beyond dispute.  The question then is, who 

represents the State?
 

 Now, in a State that has initiative, the 


whole process would be defeated if the only people who 

could defend the statute are the elected public 
officials.  The whole point -- you know this better than 
I do because you're from California -- the whole point 
of the initiative process was to allow the people to 
circumvent public officials about whom they were 
suspicious.

 So if you reject that proposition, what is 
11
12  left is the proposition that the State -- State law can 
13  choose some other person, some other group to defend the 
14  constitutionality of a State law.  And the California 
Supreme Court has told us that the Plaintiffs in this 
15
16  case are precisely those people. 
17
18
19  the California Supreme Court thought.  The California 
20
21  proponents, whoever they were, and this could be 
22  25 years after the election, it could be one of the 
23  proponents, it could be four of the proponents.  They 
24  could have an interest other than the State because they 
have no fiduciary responsibility to the State.  They may 
25

 So how do you get around that? 
 MR. OLSON:  The only -- that's exactly what 

Supreme Court thought that it could decide that the

Official 

be incurring attorneys' fees on behalf of the State or 
on behalf of themselves, but they haven't been 
appointed.  They have no official responsibility to the 
State. 

And my only argument, and I know it's a 
close one because California thinks that this is the 
system.  The California Supreme Court thought that this 
was a system that would be a default system.  I'm 
suggesting from your decisions with respect to Article 
III that that takes more than that under --

12  you're not answering the fundamental fear.  And so --
13  and -- and the amici brief that sets forth this test of 
14  fiduciary duty doesn't quite either. 
15
16  executive officials who want to defend the law.  They 
17  don't like it.  No one's going to do that.  So how do 
18  you get the law defended in that situation? 
19
20
21  built into the system where it's an officer of 
22  California or --

12
13  pointed out at the -- at the outset, this is a measure 
14  that walls off the institution of marriage, which is not 
society's right.  It's an individual right that this 
15
16  Court again and again and again has said the right to 
17  get married, the right to have the relationship of 
18  marriage is a personal right.  It's a part of the right 
19  of privacy, association, liberty, and the pursuit of 
20
21
22  right to get married under the Constitution, you've 
23  described it as marriage, procreation, family, other 
24  things like that.  So the procreation aspect, the 
25

responsibility or ability or interest in procreation is 

happiness. 

 In the cases in which you've described the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not sure, 

counsel, that it makes -- I'm not sure that it's right 
to view this as excluding a particular group.  When the 
institution of marriage developed historically, people 

didn't get around and say let's have this institution, 

but let's keep out homosexuals.  The institution 

developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, 

didn't include homosexual couples.

It is -- yes, you can say that it serves

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's really -- that's a

23  broad argument that you -- that's in this case if the 
24  Court wants to reach it.  The rationale of the Ninth 
Circuit was much more narrow.  It basically said that

 It -- it is -- it is not an answer to say 

procreation or anything of that nature because 

 MR. OLSON:  But what I have before you now, 

their characteristics, their distinguishing 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

That's a very odd rationale on which to 

sustain this opinion. 

 MR. OLSON:  This Court has always looked 

into the context.  In, for example, the New Orleans case 
involving the gambling casinos and advertising, you look 
at the context of what was permitted, what was not 

California, which has been more generous, more open to 
protecting same-sex couples than almost any State in the 
Union, just didn't go far enough and it's being 
penalized for not going far enough.

12  in that case the advertising, in this case prohibiting 
13  the relationship of marriage, does it make any sense in 
14  the context of what exists? 
15
16  if California provides all the substantive benefits of 
17  marriage to same-sex domestic partnerships, are you 
18  seriously arguing that if California -- if the State --
19  if the case before us now were from a State that doesn't 
provide any of those benefits to same-sex couples, this 
20
21  case would come out differently? 
22
23  out differently because of the fundamental arguments 
24  we're making with respect to class-based distinctions 
with respect to a fundamental right.  However, to the

talks about child-rearing or adoptions or -- or of
 
rights of people to live together and that sort of 

thing, those arguments can't be made on behalf of 

California because California's already made a decision 
that gay and lesbian individuals are perfectly suitable 
as parents, they're perfectly suitable to adopt, they're 
raising 37,000 children in California, and the expert on 
the other side specifically said and testified that they

part of the reason, that we've recognized marriage as a

respect to the number of people, with respect to -- that 
could get married -- the incest laws, the mother and

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Verrilli, I could 

understand your argument if you were talking about the 
entire United States, but you -- your brief says it's 

that warrants exacting scrutiny is present in this case. 
And Petitioners' defense of Proposition 8 requires the 
Court to ignore those warning flags and instead apply 
highly deferential Lee Optical rational basis review as 
though Proposition 8 were on a par with the law of 
treating opticians less favorably than optometrists, 
when it really is the polar opposite of such a law.

that in a situation in which the -- the State interests

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I have four points I 

would like to make to that in response to that, 
Justice Alito, and I think they are all important. 

Proposition 8, do what my friend Mr. Cooper said and 
push a pause button.  They pushed a delete button.  This 
is a permanent ban.  It's in the Constitution.  It's 
supposed to take this issue out from the legislative

Our position is -- I would just take out a

12  When that is true, then the Equal Protection Clause

22  marry the ability to marry, and it denies to the

have a position about whether it's required in the rest 
of the country. 

GENERAL VERRILLI:  It -- if, with respect to 
a State that allows gay couples to have children and to 
have families and then denies the stabilizing effect --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's got to 

happen right away in those States where same-sex couples 
have every legal right that married couples do.

me that your position that you are supporting is 

think this is significant, is that the principal 
argument in 1967, with respect to Loving and that the 
Commonwealth of Virginia advanced was, well, the social 
science is still uncertain about how biracial children 
will fare in this world, and so you ought to apply 
rational basis scrutiny and wait.  And I think the Court 
recognized that there is a cost to waiting and that that 
has got to be part of the equal protection calculus. 
And so -- so I do think that's quite fundamental.

 That's what this question really boils down 

here, whether or not it can be said that for every 
legitimate purpose of marriage, are opposite-sex couples 
and same-sex couples indistinguishable? 

patently obvious, is that the colors of the skin of the 
spouses is irrelevant to any legitimate purpose, no more 
so than their hair colors, any legitimate purpose of 
marriage, that interracial couples and same-race couples 
are similarly situated in every respect with respect to 
any legitimate purpose of marriage.

19  those heterosexual, procreative -- procreative
