Transportation v. McBride. 

 Mr. Rothfeld. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

 In this case we find ourselves in the happy 

situation of having to try to convince the Court that 

its prior decisions were correct.  Just 5 years after 

the enactment of FELA, the Court declared that it was 

obvious that the statute contained a proximate cause 

requirement.  The Court went on to repeat that 

conclusion over and over again in almost two dozen 

decisions over the next 40 years.  Our submission this 

morning is that the Court when it made these statements 

got it right. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How did it happen that in 

FELA we have proximate cause light?  It's just a 

different proximate cause than we see in other -- in 

other torts cases.  How -- how did that come about?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, we -- we -- our 

3
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

submission is that that is not correct, that that is not 

what FELA provides for at all.  And in the Court's 

initial decisions, the ones that I referred to, it 

stated very clearly that the ordinary proximate cause 

rule applies.  The -- the proximate cause test that the 

Court stated in cases like Brady was the traditional 

proximate cause standard. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you read the cases as 

9 

indicating that more deference is given to juries in 

10

11

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

FELA cases than in other cases? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, that -- that's -- is a 

separate one from the one we have here.  I mean, we are 

talking here about the nature of the -- the elements of 

the cause of action that have to be demonstrated by -­

by the plaintiff; and so there -- the question of how 

much of that evidence there has to be to get to the jury 

is a separate question that's not presented here. 

 Our submission, since you posed the 

19 

question, is that there is no different standard; that 

20

FELA was not intended to depart from the ordinary common 

21 

law procedural approaches in that respect, either. 

22

23

 But on the question that's presented -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But juries usually find 

24 

against railroads anyway, right?

25

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I wouldn't want to 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

commit myself to answering that question affirmatively, 

Your Honor. 

 The Court has said that -- that FELA was 

4 

enacted to address particular problems in the 

5

6

7 

8 

9 

administration of the common law prior to 1908. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It also said that there's 

a relaxed standard of causation.  I think that's what 

Justice Kennedy is referring to when he said "proximate 

cause light."  But we have said in more than one case 

10

that there is a relaxed standard of causation in FELA 

11 

cases.  Was that wrong? 

12

13

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I think there are two ways to 

respond to that, Justice Ginsburg.  The first is that up 

until the Rogers decision, which is -- which is one of 

the ones which has created I think some confusion in 

this area, the Court was quite clear and unambiguous 

that proximate cause in FELA applied in the ordinary 

sense. 

 As I say, in cases like the Brady case the 

Court stated what proximate cause means; it stated in -­

in entirely traditional terms that -- that the plaintiff 

had to demonstrate that the injury followed in a 

natural, probable foreseeable way from the wrongful 

conduct, and so that -- that was the standard.

 The Rogers case, which was the source of 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

some of the confusion in this area, in our view, as -­

as we think Justice Souter correctly demonstrated in his 

opinion in Sorrell, and as we explain at some length in 

our brief, Rogers we think did not address causation at 

all.  The Rogers case was a situation in which there 

were a multiplicity of causes, and the question was what 

-- what should -- should the rule be when there are a 

number of -- of entities that contribute to the 

accident.  It had nothing to do with remoteness or 

10

directness of the cause, what we usually think about 

11 

when we talk about proximate cause. 

12

13 

14 

15

 In -- in the years since Rogers was decided, 

when the Court -- got out of the business of deciding 

FELA cases on the facts, it had not had occasion on -­

in any case to address specifically what proximate cause 

16 

meant in the FELA context. 

17

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we have used that 

19 

language.  You -- you have not responded to -- to the 

20

21 

22 

23

question where -- where did this language that does 

appear in our -- in our cases about the relaxed 

standard, where -- where does that come from? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that comes from, W 

24 

submit, from sort of a loose description of what was 

25

going on in the Rogers case, which involved a 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

multiplicity of causes rather than directness and 

remoteness of causes, and so the cases in which that 

language appears, which are the Crane case and the 

Gottshall case, did not involve causation at all.  The 

question of causation was not presented to the Court in 

6 

those cases. 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It has nothing to do with 

the line of cases I think in the '40s in the FELA cases 

where the message of this Court seemed to be quite 

clear, FELA cases go to juries?  There are a number of 

cases with reverse dissents that seem to -- to say just 

that. 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, that -- that goes to 

14 

the question that Justice Kennedy raised at the outset, 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

which is how much evidence, whatever the standard of 

causation is, how much evidence must there be to go to 

the jury?  And our presentation here is that FELA did 

not change the ordinary standard on -- on that question. 

But that -- but that is not the question that's 

presented in this case. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what -- can you 

explain to me -- I mean, here the judge charged in the 

words of the statute, and they are also the words used 

in the model Federal instruction:  Did plaintiff's 

injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's 

7

negligence?

24 

25

 You would say:  Was plaintiff's injury 

proximately caused.  And as you no doubt know, 

Mr. Rothfeld, that term "proximate cause," it just loses 

juries.  So considering that these cases go to the jury, 

what do you say to the instruction that's now given, 

based on the words of the statute, "Did plaintiff's 

injury result in whole or part from the railroad's 

negligence"?  What should the judge charge instead of 

that? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think there are -­

there are two parts to your question, Justice Ginsburg. 

One -- one is, what's wrong with the instruction that 

was given here; and the other is can juries understand 

proximate cause as a concept. 

 On -- on the first point, we have no 

objection to the instruction containing the language of 

the statute.  The problem is that to be comprehensible 

and intelligently applied by jurors, it has to say more 

than that.  Proximate cause we submit is an element of 

the cause of action and that has to be explained to a 

jury.  It couldn't be the case in a Sherman Act case, 

for example, that a judge could simply charge the jury: 

You are to determine whether there has been an 

unreasonable restraint of trade; now go to the jury room 

8

and answer that question.  There is a lot more that has 

to go into that cause of action, including, as it 

happens, proximate cause. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Rothfeld, could you 

explain to me how it would have made a difference in 

6 

this case, that instruction?

25

 MR. ROTHFELD:  It -- it would have made a 

difference I guess in two respects.  One is that the 

plaintiff's theory has never at any point been that 

there was proximate cause in this case.  He did not 

contend that there was before the -- the district court 

and he does not contend in his brief before this Court 

that there was proximate cause made out.  And so -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, maybe explain the 

difference.  I mean, you were answering my question, and 

I asked how would you tell the jury?  You said it's okay 

to say:  Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in 

part from the railroad's negligence, but the judge must 

say something more.  So what is the something more?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  The something more is what 

this Court said in its Brady decision, in which it 

described -- the decision in Brady, which is cited and 

discussed in our opening brief in -- in some detail. 

Brady described what proximate cause means in the FELA 

context; and it means, the Court said, that there must 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6

be a demonstration that the plaintiff's injury resulted 

from the wrongful conduct in a way that was natural, 

probable, and foreseeable.  That -- that was a 

traditional statement, is still today a traditional 

statement of proximate cause. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Natural, probable, and 

7 

foreseeable? 

8

 MR. ROTHFELD:  And foreseeable.  That -­

9 

that language was taken in the Brady case directly from 

10

11 

12 

13

the Court's decision, 1876 decision in the Kellogg 

decision, which we also cite in our brief, which states 

-­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me -- there 

14 

is an article that suggests that juries don't actually 

15

16 

17 

18

19

20

understand what "proximate cause" means; and I think, 

and Justice Ginsburg can correct me, that what does that 

mean to a jury -- natural, probable, and foreseeable? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are the three phrases 

different?  And how much more detail do you have to get 

21 

in to describe that difference in a comprehensible way? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, that -- that was the 

second part of Justice Ginsburg's question, and I got 

distracted, and I'm happy to address it.  I think most 

of the criticism of proximate cause as being confusion 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

9 

to the jury has actually been directed at the word 

"proximate," that commentators and some courts have said 

that's a confusing word, it suggests immediacy, it 

suggests closeness in time, it sounds like 

"approximate," and so juries find it confusing. 

 But there is -- once it's spelled out, I 

mean, the fact is juries have been applying proximate 

cause, which has been a fundamental, settled, universal, 

universally accepted part of common law of torts, in the 

10

medicine context in particular, and it has been settled 

11 

for 150 years. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Apparently only FELA juries 

13 

cannot understand it; all other juries find it okay. 

14

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- it is our 

submission that FELA juries would have no more 

difficulty applying it than do juries under the Sherman 

Act or RICO or the securities laws or, the other 

statutes that this Court has said include a proximate 

cause requirement, or that juries apply every day in 

courts across the country in court cases. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I just don't -- and 

maybe this has already been asked, but I'm not sure from 

a juror's perspective that it makes terribly much 

difference the exact formulation of this instruction.  I 

think a juror who sees an employee is suing the 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4

8

railroad, and it turns out that what the railroad did 

had very little or nothing to do with what happened to 

the employee, they don't need an instruction about 

natural, foreseeable causes.  They're just not going to 

give the awards, or they're going to give the awards 

even though the railroad didn't do anything that 

affected the employee. 

 It's a -- it's a nuance that I just don't 

9 

think has any practical significance.

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, we have to assume that 

juries follow jury instructions.  That's the fundamental 

premise of the system, and there is no reason to doubt 

that in the ordinary case, in which the contents of 

proximate cause are -- are explained to the jury in an 

intelligent -- in a way that -- that people can 

16 

comprehend.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your client is entitled to 

have the jury disregard a proper instruction, right? 

That's what you're arguing?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  If the -- if the jury -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Juries disregard 

instructions on probable cause, on proximate cause. 

They probably do it in non-FELA cases, too. 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I -­

them disregard the correct instruction rather than an

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I will endorse that. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  My point is that I 

don't see much practical difference between what you 

argue is the correct instruction and what your friend 

argues is the correct instruction. 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, certainly, in terms -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, law 

students, professors, and some judges have had trouble 

defining the concept of proximate cause for centuries. 

I don't know why we expect a juror to be able to 

navigate through those nuances, either. 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- the -- the 

principle of proximate cause, the idea that there has to 

be some limitation beyond but-for causation on 

liability, has been universally recognized.  Recognized 

by -- by courts, by this Court, by commentators, by the 

Restatement.  The Third Restatement, just published, 

clearly endorsed it.  They use -- they quibble about the 

terminology, but they clearly endorsed the absolute 

necessity of a proximate cause limitation on liability. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think that over the 

24 

last few decades, there's been an increasing emphasis on 

25

foreseeability as a component of proximate cause?

23

 MR. ROTHFELD:  There -- there probably has 

been.  I mean, I'll defer again to the Third 

Restatement, which has a very useful summary of the 

course of the law in this area.  And the principal tests 

that are now being used by courts are foreseeability and 

directness, which are closely related, I think.  I mean, 

clearly, as this Court stated just this month in the 

Stout case, it stated a test of proximate cause in terms 

of whether -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you give some 

examples of what causes would be proximate and what 

causes would not so qualify?  Something that's -- you 

said but-for is no good.  So what would be a but-for 

cause but not a proximate cause?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  A but-for cause in this 

context would be, there's a defective brake on -- on the 

locomotive and it comes to a sudden stop.  If the 

conductor, standing in the locomotive when the train 

stops, is thrown to the floor and injured, clearly that 

is proximate cause.  It -- it is -- it is an injury that 

is related to the risk that made the conduct actionable 

in the first place. 

 The reason that having defective brakes is 

24 

negligent and gives rise to a cause of action is because 

25

it can cause an accident that will cause people to fall, 

14

cause the train to hit something, will cause derailment. 

That's why it is negligent, and if the kind of injury 

that follows from the accident is related to that risk, 

that clearly is proximate cause.

 The kind which is not would be, train stops 

because of the defective brake.  No one is injured. 

Conductor gets off the train to walk along and see 

what's going on, trips and turns his leg, or is bitten 

by a snake.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Rothfeld, are there any 

cases like that in the FELA world?  You know, I take it 

that this basic instruction that was given in this case 

is the instruction that's given in most cases.  If you 

look across the range of cases, do you find jurors 

awarding damages in the kind of situation that you're 

talking about?  In other words, is this a real-world 

problem? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  They did in precisely the 

19 

case I just described, a case called Richards from the 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

Sixth Circuit, which is cited in the amicus brief 

submitted by the Association of American Railroads.  The 

train stops because of a defective brake, the conductor 

gets off, walks along, turns his ankle and sues. 

 Clearly, the risk of someone getting off the 

train and having a fortuitous injury is not the kind of 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

risk that gave rise to the negligence.  I mean, it's 

negligent to have a defective brake, but not because 

there's a bystander who might be bitten by a snake or 

turn -- turn his ankle.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there a case like that? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  As I said, the Richards case. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but I mean somebody 

might think that having to go off and patrol a thing in 

a rough area is something that happens with a sudden 

stop:  You run a risk of turning your leg. 

 I agree with you about the snake.  Is there 

1

10

11

any case about the snake?

14 

case directly, but -­

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So the furthest -­

the furthest -- the furthest that you go is the case of 

sudden stop in the wilderness, gets off, rough area, and 

twists his ankle. 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Or I'll -- I'll cite you -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know.  Is that 

21 

proximate cause or not?  Maybe it isn't. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I'll give you two answers to 

that, Your Honor.  First of all, there are other cases. 

Another case, for example, cited in the amicus brief 

that I referred to is the Schlumpert case from Georgia,

in which there's a defective coupling device lying on 

the ground.  If it had -- if it had fallen off the train 

because it was defective and fallen on someone's foot, 

clearly that's proximate cause.  But it's on the ground. 

The employee comes along, picks it up, throws off -­

throws off his -- throws out his back, and sues.  That 

is not the kind of -- of injury that one would foresee 

comes from having defective couplers. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And do you want -­

what instruction would you give that would tell the jury 

to allow damages in one of those -- the first of the 

coupling cases, but not in the second? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  The instruction we ask for is 

14 

the one this Court gave -- said should be given in the 

15

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well -- well, I'm just 

quoting the Court's language to you, Your Honor.  But -­

but certainly, foreseeable and probable, one would say 

that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not foreseeable 

that if you drop a coupling where it's not supposed to 

be, somebody will come along and try to pick it up and 

move it? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, but it's not 

foreseeable in the sense that it is unrelated to the 

risk that gave rise to -- to the cause of action in the 

first place.  I mean, it's foreseeable in the sense that 

anything is foreseeable. 

 If I give the classic example:  I drive -- I 

drive you to New York, from Washington to New York, and 

I drive too fast, exceeding the speed limit.  That's 

negligent.  It's negligent because I run the risk, if I 

drive too fast, of hitting somebody, of hitting another 

car, of driving off the road.  And so if I do that and 

you're injured as I drive you to New York, you can sue 

21 

me. 

22

23 

24 

25

 But that doesn't happen.  I drive -- I get 

to New York safely, you get out of the car, and as soon 

as you get out, you are struck by lightning.  It's a 

but-for cause of your being struck by lightning that I

Avenue too fast. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Rothfeld, your 

instruction actually used the term "probable cause." 

Are you -- "proximate cause."  Are you saying now that 

that's not necessary, that as long as you say 

"reasonable and foreseeable," you would be satisfied? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think that it should 

include the term "proximate" simply because that has 

traditionally been the requirement.  That's what this 

Court has said in cases like Brady.  It's what the Court 

has said in cases applying other proximate cause -­

other elements of proximate causation in other 

circumstances.  But it is the concept. 

 I mean, as I said, "proximate" is a 

24 

confusing word.  That has been recognized sort of across 

25

the board.  So it has to be spelled out and unpacked. 

19
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So why use it at all?  If 

you think that "reasonable" or "foreseeable" are less 

confusing words, why shouldn't we just tell the jury to 

use those words instead?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- again, I don't think 

that it is essential that it use the word "proximate" if 

it spells out what is meant by "proximate" in -- in -­

as -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the spelling out is 

natural, probable, and foreseeable? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Again, that is the term that 

this Court used in Brady, and that is -- is closely 

related -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Although your proposed 

instruction didn't use the word "foreseeable"? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  It did not use the word 

"foreseeable."  It used "natural and probable."  But 

we -- we endorse, again, the test that this Court has 

stated in the FELA context very clearly in the Brady 

case.  There are -- as has been noted in some of the 

questioning, there has been discussion between courts 

and commentators over the years about what the best way 

is to define proximate cause and explain it to the jury. 

 I mean, in terms of the question posed by 

the Chief Justice, does it actually make any difference,

I think not only do we have to assume that it makes a 

difference, because juries are presumed to follow their 

instructions, but the kind of instruction that was given 

here was essentially a but-for instruction, that if you 

find that -- that in any respect, the injuries 

essentially would not have occurred but for the 

misconduct, for the -- for the negligence of the 

railroad -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you explain how it 

might have made a difference in this particular case 

based on the facts of the case?  As I understand it, 

Mr. McBride's theory was that as a result of having to 

use the independent brake extensively over a long period 

of time with this wide-bodied cab, his hand got tired 

and it fell, and it hit the independent brake. 

 Is that -- that's the theory? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well -- that -- that -­

that's his explanation of the accident.  The theory of 

negligence, as I understand it, as it was presented to 

the jury by his expert was that the configuration of the 

train that he was driving was unsafe because it -- it 

could lead to derailments, it could lead to breaking of 

the couplers. 

 As explained by his expert, the -- the 

theory was not that there was something unsafe about the

arrangement of the braking system, and so, I think that 

the -- the way in which a proximate cause instruction 

properly given here could have made a difference is that 

the jury could have found, well, yes, it was negligent 

to have these five locomotives arranged in the way that 

they were, but that had nothing to do, except in a but­

for sense, with the fact that the -- the -- that 

Mr. McBride's hand was injured; that the jury could have 

made that determination and so it could have made a 

difference. 

 Now, I mean, the fact is there was no 

proximate cause argument made below because the 

instruction that was given by the district court 

excluded it.  And so, as I said before, the -- the 

theory of the case advanced by Mr. McBride below simply 

16 

didn't take account of proximate cause. 

17

18 

19 

20

 Now, if the -- if we prevail here and the 

case goes back, he will be free to argue under a proper 

instruction that there was proximate cause, that somehow 

the configuration of the train affected his -- his 

21 

handling of the brake. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're really suggesting 

that the defense attorney here wouldn't have argued the 

concept of proximate cause in saying the negligence had 

nothing to do with him just deciding to hit the brake?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  The -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- I -- I -- I -- it's 

farfetched, don't you think, that because the judge 

refused to give a proximate cause charge that the idea 

of it wasn't argued to the jury:  What we did didn't

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, there -- there is no 

question that what the railroad did caused in the but­

for sense.  Mr. McBride would not have been in the cab 

operating the brake system had it -- had it not been for 

the configuration of the -- of the locomotives.  And, so 

if we assume that the configuration of the locomotives 

was negligent, then but for the negligence of -- of the 

railroad, this would not have occurred.  And that in 

fact is -- is the terms in which the case was argued to 

the jury by Mr. McBride's lawyer, who said, in so many 

words:  But for the negligence of the railroad, this 

would not have occurred. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the -- but the question 

is, what was your argument?  What was your side's 

21 

argument?  Did you argue, in effect, proximate cause? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Our side argued that there 

was no negligence at all, that -- that -- that the 

configuration of the railroad was perfectly proper, and 

that -- the -- the -- there was a contributory

negligence component to what was going on here.  In 

fact, the jury found that Mr. McBride was contributorily 

negligent in part, and that was part of the -- of the 

defense presentation, too.

 But just two or three -- to take a step back 

to first principles, on the assumption that proximate 

cause -- that there is a difference between instructing 

the jury on proximate cause and not, because the court 

-- it has been a part of tort law, you know, for time 

immemorial on the assumption that it does make a 

difference and it has been an important part of tort law 

because it has been universally recognized by courts, by 

academics, by the Respondent that there has to be some 

limitation on liability beyond but-for causation.  If 

there is not, there is the danger of sort of infinite 

liability, of limitless liability, and particularly of 

fortuitous liability, because there is no way that the 

defendant in a situation like this can anticipate that 

it's going to be held liable for this kind of injury.

 So proximate cause has been regarded as an 

essential component of the tort law.  And that being so, 

FELA creates a Federal cause of action for negligence, 

it creates a Federal tort.  It -- a fundamental 

principle of statutory interpretation, this Court has 

applied many times, most recently just this month in the

Staub case, that when Congress creates a Federal tort, 

it means to adopt the general background of tort law, 

and Congress -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are there any -- any 

negligence-type statutes?  I mean this one, I mean, it's 

odd to say that the judge erred in reading to the jury 

the words of the statute, did plaintiff's injury result 

in whole or in part from railroad negligence.  All that 

Federal statutes, negligence statutes that use the word 

"proximate" -­

 MR. ROTHFELD:  There are -- there are 

Federal statutes that use the word "proximate."  I don't 

know that there are any negligence statutes.  So far as 

I understand from our review of the law, at the time 

that Congress enacted FELA in 1908, there -- there were 

16 

no such statutes that made use of the term "proximate." 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

 And the presumption then, as now, is that 

when Congress creates what amounted to a Federal tort, 

the assumption is that it intends to adopt a background 

of tort law.  That was true in the Sherman Act, it was 

true in RICO, it was true in securities laws, it was 

true just as earlier this month in the Staub case, a 

statute which did not use the term "proximate." 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you said your defense 

at trial was not about causation, it was no negligence,

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, that's -- that's right. 

Given the instruction that the jury received, which does 

not -- did not include a proximate cause requirement, 

and given that if one assumes that there was negligence, 

there is no doubt that the -- that the injury here was 

the but-for product of that negligence, there sort of 

was no room for negligence to be argued to the jury on 

the defense side.  I mean, for proximate -- for -­

for -- for causation to be argued on the defense side. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Assume you could talk to the 

jury and the jury says to you:  We found negligence, so 

we don't want to hear about that; and we've found but­

for causation and we don't want to hear about that; now, 

explain to us why there isn't proximate cause here?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  In -- in this case we would 

say the negligence that is being presented to you and 

that you have presumably found is that the configuration 

of these locomotives was dangerous because it could lead 

to derailment, it could lead to breaking of the couplers 

between the cars.  That is the negligence.  And 

proximate cause, properly understood, means that the 

injury on which the plaintiff is suing has to follow in 

a probable, natural, foreseeable way from that -- that

negligence.

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But wasn't the theory 

different, Mr. Rothfeld?  Wasn't the theory that the 

configuration of the train made the braking and the 

switching much more difficult for the person in this 

6 

position? 

7

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, if I may, I'll answer 

8 

that and then sit down. 

9

 That, as I say, was not the theory that was 

presented by the plaintiff's expert.  To the extent that 

that is -- is a viable theory, it could be presented on 

remand.  The argument can be made.  I think it's a 

difficult argument, but -- but it was not presented to 

the jury here because there was no proximate cause 

instruction, so there was no opportunity for the 

16 

question to be -- be -- be vetted.

a non-existent problem, because there are no real 

reported cases where there have been problems arising 

under the Rogers instructions that have become the model 

instructions under the Federal Rules for over 50 years.

 And if could I just begin, Justice Kennedy, 

with your question which opened this up, proximate cause 

serves two principal functions.  One is to limit the 

scope of the persons to whom the tortfeasor owes a duty; 

and the second is to limit the kinds of injuries that 

that person would be liable for. 

 The innovation in FELA that is so important 

to understand about why the relaxed causation standard 

became the accepted standard under FELA was that FELA, 

by its plain terms, did away with the first concept of 

proximate cause because it limited the duty to the 

employee by the employer.  There is no one outside of 

that relationship that can bring an action under FELA. 

 And the second thing that it did was it put 

19 

into what is now section 51 that if the negligence 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

results in, quote, "in whole or in part" from the 

negligence of the railroad, that is enough for injury. 

At common law the proximate cause standard required that 

the railroad's negligence be the sole cause.  So the 

innovation that created the relaxation in the causation 

standard was the inclusion of these words in part, and 

28

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, the other side 

says that what that meant, and -- and -- and the 

language of our cases seems to support that, "in whole 

or in part" simply eliminated the common law doctrine of 

contributory negligence, whereby if the plaintiff also 

had been negligent, the plaintiff could not recover, 

and -- and FELA uses a -- a -- a comparative negligence 

standard.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And this Court has rejected 

that kind of approach almost from the beginning of the 

statute.  In Campbell in 1916, the Court asked whether 

FELA has completely eliminated the idea of proximate 

cause.  The Court has eliminated and the plain language 

precludes the sole cause, immediate cause, direct cause, 

16 

last cause, substantial factor -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why doesn't "in whole or in 

part" apply to the elimination of contributory 

negligence?  Isn't that an adequate explanation for the 

language? 

 MR. FREDERICK:  It's -- it's not one that's 

consistent with the Court's cases.  And let me point you 

back to the day Rogers was decided.  If we accept for 

purposes of argument -- and I'm only accepting it for 

these purposes -- that Rogers was only about multiple

causes, on the very same day it decided two other cases 

that arguably were only about single causes.  It decided 

a case under the Jones Act, the Ferguson case, and it 

decided another case under FELA, the Webb case.  In both 

of those cases, there were no multiple causes, there was 

no contributory negligence; but what the Court said was 

that on today we are announcing this standard, we apply 

that standard to overturn directed verdicts where juries 

had come to the conclusion that the railroad's 

10

negligence had played a part, even a slight one, in 

11 

producing the injury sustained by the worker.

 MR. FREDERICK:  As this Court put a gloss on

the producing aspect that provides a little bit more -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure it did.  The train 

wouldn't have stopped, the conductor wouldn't have 

gotten off, he wouldn't have been bitten by the snake. 

If the -- if the car had not traveled to New York over 

the speed limit, the -- the passenger wouldn't have been 

on 42nd Street when the lightning struck.  I mean, how 

can you say it didn't play a part?  Of course it played 

a part. 

 MR. FREDERICK:  It was certainly an element 

19 

of the existence of the condition.  But what the Court's

24

cases, Justice Scalia, after Rogers have done, and I 

think this is an important part of the history, is that 

there are a couple of outlier cases, to be sure.  Courts 

have corrected them all by saying that the judge -- that 

the jury could not have reasonably found based on common 

experience that this snake bite or what have you was

I read the statute, it insists, as interpreted in 

Rogers, that the negligence has to play a part in 

producing, and in the snake case the negligence doesn't 

matter.  It's simply the timing, et cetera.  And is -­

that's how I read it. 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And I guess that's how 

courts have read it.  I'm not sure; you know.  And I 

suspect from the answers I've gotten so far there's 

never been a court that read it differently. 

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.

anything?  How can you possibly say that negligence 

didn't play a part?  It obviously did.  It seems to me 

you're arguing for -- not the nonexistence of proximate 

cause.  Nobody in his right mind could argue for the 

nonexistence of proximate cause.  You are arguing for 

some different -- different definition of proximate 

cause, and I would like to know what that -- what that 

new definition is, as opposed to the definition that Mr. 

Rothfeld proposed.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, let me start with this 

by saying that the Court and the language of the statute 

have already eliminate six possibilities for proximate 

cause; and the question now is whether there's something 

additive to the words that Mr. Rothfeld now proposes for 

the first time, because this was not language that they 

proposed in their proffered jury instruction, which can 

be found in the red brief at page 11.  There they 

followed the Illinois proposed instruction which says 

"natural or probable sequence."  That language does not 

appear in Brady.  In Brady, a 1943 case from this Court, 

the words are used "natural and probable consequence," a 

consequence, of course, being a result, a sequence being 

an order of events. 

 Now, their instruction rests on the word 

"probable," which of course in common understanding and

most juries would commonly understand, "probable" means 

more likely than not, which is directly in contention 

with the statutory words "in part," and directly 

contrary to the way courts had universally understood 

this language since Rogers. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know if they said 

this, but I mean, as I read it, I thought the reason 

that negligence doesn't play a part is the act which was 

negligent played a part, of course; it was "but for"; 

but the fact that it is negligent is totally irrelevant, 

because it's not within the risk in any sense 

whatsoever. 

 Now as I -- you know the area.  I don't put

 MR. FREDERICK:  That is correct, Justice 

Breyer.  And in the cases -- and there really are only a 

few cases where you can find these kind of outlier facts 

and these kind of, you know, "out there" situations, and 

one of the reasons is because FELA is only a 

compensatory damages statute.  It only addresses the 

actual injury and the compensation for the worker. 

There are no punitive damages, there are no attorney's 

fees, there are no treble damages.

and a juror says:  This wouldn't have happened but for 

the wide locomotive; therefore, there should be 

liability.  What -- and assume the jury has all of the 

Federal reports in there and the judge lets them read. 

What -- what is there for another juror to say that this 

6 

is wrong? 

7

 MR. FREDERICK:  The negligence theory here, 

Justice Kennedy, if I could go back to that, was not 

stated in a way that we would subscribe to by -- by Mr. 

10

Rothfeld.  Our theory of negligence at trial was 

11 

twofold.

 One was that these wide-boded locomotives 

were not appropriate for the switching exercise that the 

train men were doing on that day, and in fact the 

supervising engineer said this was the only time that he 

was aware in his long experience where these wide-body 

locomotives were used for this specific purpose which 

required a lot of braking activity. 

 The second theory of negligence was that Mr. 

McBride was put to this purpose without proper training. 

He has complained on the day; he was uncomfortable and 

he didn't know whether he could operate that locomotive; 

and the jury was entitled reasonably to infer that that 

poor training was a -­

how did those things play a part? 

 MR. FREDERICK:  His -- let's start with his 

poor training.  There was testimony that a person who 

was more skilled in the art of dealing with a wide-boded 

locomotive would be able to manipulate the independent 

brake with the automatic brake in a way that would not 

cause the repetitive stress that Mr. McBride suffered. 

And there was further testimony that using a wide-body 

locomotive, which is more difficult to manipulate for 

the switching operations, and here we're talking about 

moving in and off main tracks to couple trains, train 

cars so that they can be used for a longer 

destination -- that that kind of equipment was not 

suited for the purpose. 

 Mr. McBride's testimony was when he had used 

the wide-body locomotive, he had done so on long trips 

over long distances that didn't require the same kind of 

ready, manipulative braking of the independent brake. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you don't assert that 

24 

that's a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of 

25

using a wide-body train?

case is because I can't believe you don't believe in 

proximate cause.  I just think you're -- you're giving a 

different definition of it, and I'm trying to figure out 

what your definition of it is.

 MR. FREDERICK:  My definition, what I think 

the Court did in Rogers was to try to end the debate 

over how confusing the word proximate cause is in these 

kind of cases by offering simple and direct instructions 

that juries could understand and apply, and that has 

been the case over the last 50 years.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do it.  I'm still waiting 

to hear your instruction, which is supposedly something 

other than "but for."  Is it just "but for"? 

 MR. FREDERICK:  I would take the words of 

Rogers.  I think the jury here was properly instructed. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  With -- what are the words? 

7 

Give me the words. 

8

 MR. FREDERICK:  The words are on page 10 of 

9 

the red brief, Justice Scalia, and it follows the model

14 

15

form instruction that's used in all the Federal courts, 

"defendant caused or contributed to plaintiff's injury 

if defendant's negligence played a part no matter how 

small in bringing about the injury.  The mere fact that 

an injury occurred does not necessarily mean that the 

injury was caused by negligence." 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't think that's "but 

17 

for"? 

18

 MR. FREDERICK:  Whether you think it's "but 

19 

for" or not I think is beside the point.

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care whether I 

21 

think.  We've got words here.  What do those words mean? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. FREDERICK:  Those words mean that "but 

for" plus a relaxed form of legal cause associating the 

negligence in playing a part in produce the injury. 

That's how Rogers understood it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Negligence is a given; the 

negligence is not what I'm asking about.  I'm asking 

about causality, and what you have just read is "but 

for" cause.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, I would disagree with 

that Justice Scalia, and I think the Rogers Court 

disagreed with that too, because after Rogers this Court 

upheld in Inman a case on a directed verdict where it 

concluded after the Rogers instructions had been used 

that nonetheless the negligence of the railroad had not 

played a part.  That's a case involving a drunk driver 

who hit a flag man at the site of where the flag man was 

operating. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I -- can I go back a 

second and perhaps follow up Justice Scalia's question 

in a slightly different way?  Do you believe a railroad 

can be held liable for a harm it could not reasonably 

foresee? 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Now, 

perhaps, we can get to why, under what formulation, if 

it didn't know harm was going to happen or could happen. 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Reasonably foreseeable.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  I think that the

concept of foreseeability is one that has alternated in 

and out of this Court's cases, but let's take the case 

of Gallick in 1963, where a fetid pool with vermin and 

rats were allowed to live by the railroad's negligence, 

and it was believed that an insect was growing -- insect 

bodies were growing in that fetid pool, and as a result 

of that insect bite, the injured worker's legs had to be 

amputated by the effect of this insect bite. 

 Now, many people would argue -- in fact, the 

lower court had concluded -- that it was not reasonably 

foreseeable that the railroad's negligence in allowing 

that stagnant pool to exist would nonetheless lead to 

the injury sustained by the worker. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It might not be 

reasonably foreseeable that an amputation would occur, 

but it was reasonably foreseeable that some injury to 

people would happen as a result of these infected insect 

bites, no?  That's what the court ultimately said. 

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.  But what 

the court had also done was to rely on earlier cases in 

which it's saying these concepts really are relaxed 

because the purpose of FELA is to provide a substitute, 

if you will, for workers' compensation, where if you can 

establish negligence on the part of the railroad and it 

causes, in part, the injury, the railroad will be liable 

40

for that.

7

11 

12 

13

 And that's why this -- these concepts of 

proximate cause really are getting at a different 

problem, which is that when these statutes are enacted, 

you're trying to guard the defendant's liability against 

the entire world.  And that's why it makes sense to 

impose some kind of restriction for foreseeability or 

for directness, because otherwise anybody could be 

liable to anybody else.  Here, that problem is removed, 

because the railroad is the only -- can only be sued, 

under FELA, by the employee, and only if its negligence 

plays a role in producing that injury. 

 If I could go back to the words that 

14 

Mr. Rothfeld's trial counsel had proposed, the "probable

sequence" word is now not even used anymore in Illinois. 

So it would be very odd to think that you would reverse 

an instruction here, where the proffered instruction by 

the railroad doesn't even State what -- the proximate 

cause instruction in the model language.

 Now the model language under Illinois calls 

for the natural and ordinary course of events.  That's 

how proximate cause is now done under the Illinois 

proposed instructions.  And it's hard to know how that 

language, Mr. Chief Justice, takes us any different from 

the common instruction that all juries are given, to use 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

their common experience and their common sense in 

evaluating the evidence.  If what proximate cause now 

means under these types of standards is the ordinary 

course of events, all we're doing is asking juries to 

apply their common sense without introducing the word 

"proximate cause," which has been demonstrated to 

confuse juries because most of them, you know, many 

think that "proximate" means something like estimate

mean that the injury results in whole or in part from 

the railroad's negligence?  What would the judge 

respond? 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Ginsburg, I'm not 

entirely sure how a trial judge would take a request for 

further clarification of this word's -- this Court's 

words that clarify the "resulting in whole or in part 

from."  I'm not aware of any cases where anyone

challenged the use of the Rogers language on the ground

 MR. FREDERICK:  I think -- and I've never 

served as a trial judge, but I think my -- my direction 

would be to go back and try again based on the words 

that are there, because the whole idea behind these 

words was to try to end the debate between this Court 

and many State courts that simply didn't grasp that FELA 

was intended to provide a remedial statute with a 

causation element that was a weaker causation element 

than in normal negligence cases.  And so this Court was 

taking dozens of cases under FELA between the 1930's and 

the 1950's in which the Court was looking at directed 

verdicts by State supreme courts that were overturning 

jury verdicts.  And the whole idea behind making this 

the language of what constitutes a jury case was to 

remove the appellate review process from a lot of these 

things and to leave these questions up to the common 

sense of the jury.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the jury says, 

Well, does it mean that but for the negligence, the 

injury would not have occurred?  Then what would the 

trial judge say?

 MR. FREDERICK:  If the jury asked a 

question, I think the judge would write back and say, 

No, that's not correct, the words -- please focus on the 

words:  The negligence playing a part, however small, in 

producing the injury.  I mean, I'm not aware if juries 

get to this but for versus what is a relaxed -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think that eliminates 

but-for cause, to tell them that negligence plays a 

part, no matter how small, in the injury?  You think 

that eliminates but-for, rather than invites it?

 MR. FREDERICK:  No, Justice Scalia, our 

position is that it is but-for plus a relaxed form of 

legal cause that's been well-recognized in the cases and 

hasn't produced a problem.  Surely the burden is on the 

railroad to come up -- I would have thought that if they 

wanted to overturn the pattern instructions that have 

been used in nearly a half a million cases since Rogers 

was handed down, that they would have more than a case 

that they cite from one of their amici.  I mean, they 

don't even cite the Richards case in their main briefs.

 And so surely -- you know, we're here to 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

debate these hypotheticals, I would suppose, but they 

don't have any relation to the real world. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose the jury asks, Is it

foreseeable?  What does the trial judge say then? 

 MR. FREDERICK:  I think the trial judge 

says, No, it is not necessary for it to be foreseeable 

in a direct -- if the negligence plays a part, however 

small, in producing the injury.

 And that's why in cases like the Ferguson 

case, which was decided the same day as Rogers -- I 

mean, that's a very out-there set of facts, where the 

ship steward -- and remember, what you decide here also 

applies in the Jones Act for sea workers as well.  But 

in that case, the Court said it was a jury question, 

whether the failure to provide an appropriate to 

implement to scoop hardened ice cream from the freezer 

on the ship was foreseeable, whether or not the ship's 

steward, in serving the ice cream, would reach for a 

butcher knife to try to chip away and lead to the 

21 

severing of two of his fingers. 

22

23 

24 

25

 I mean, we're talking about a dangerous 

situation, Justice Alito.  At the time that FELA was 

enacted, in a year prior to that, some 12,000 people 

died and there were hundreds of thousands of injuries,

and the idea behind the statute was to provide a broad 

remedy so that rail workers could be compensated, not 

get extra damages like punitive damages, but just 

compensated for their injuries.  And so the result is 

that railmen know they're going to have to go before 

juries exercising their common sense, and juries have, 

in many, many cases, ruled in favor of the railroads. 

And that system ought to be allowed to continue. 

 If I could go back to one last point, and 

that is the idea of statutory stare decisis.  We believe 

that because Rogers construed the "in whole or in part" 

language, it's entitled to statutory stare decisis where 

jury instructions have used that language. 

 And at some level, this case is not too far 

from the Hylton case, which was decided in the early 

'90s, except the difference is in Hylton, the Court had 

dealt with a case from the early 1960s called Parden. 

And that case had had many of the underpinnings of -- of 

the question there that had been discredited or undercut 

by subsequent decisions. 

 Here, there are no cases since Rogers that 

suggest doubt on the general validity of the Rogers 

rule.  You have the cases that were decided in the 

immediate proximity of Rogers; you have Gallick in 

1963 -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We have three justices of 

this Court that say Rogers is irrelevant because it had 

to do only with multiple causes. 

 MR. FREDERICK:  And my answer to that, 

Justice Ginsburg, is that after Rogers, the Court 

applied the Rogers language to single cause cases.  We 

have Webb, we have Ferguson, we have Kernan, we have 

Gallick, we have the statement in Crane that comparing 

the actions of the nonemployee, the -- the explanation 

for why the nonemployee has to go to common law is 

because there are these special features of FELA, one of 

which is no common law proximate cause and the 

elimination of contributory negligence and assumption of 

the risk.

 And then subsequently when the Court in 

Ayers and then in Gottshall says very clearly these are 

ways that FELA has departed from the common law and from 

the other statutes, in Gottshall the Court was very 

clear that it is relaxed causation and that this is one 

of the departures from normal common law standards.  It 

would seem odd to hold now that all of a sudden we're 

going to talk about common law standards for causation 

where the Court over a series of decision over the last 

hundred years has knocked out six of the prevailing 

versions of proximate cause that were then in vogue.

the word "foreseeability."

definition of foreseeable, doesn't it?  It's natural and 

probable.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Scalia, the word 

"probable" is more likely than not, which is the 

stronger standard, it's intention with the words "in 

part" in the statute.  Result in part is not something 

that is more likely than not.  For that reason, we 

believe the Court should adhere to the Rogers approach. 

It's worked, it's allowed juries to exercise their 

common sense without being confused by these elusive 

proximate cause formulations.

 The other side has failed to identify a 

problem, and there's not the slightest reason to think 

that any alternative formulation would work any better. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I just ask you this 

factual question?  Was it Mr. McBride's theory that his 

injury resulted from the repetitive use of the 

independent brake or was it that the -- as a result of 

the repetitive use his hand fell down and it hit the 

independent brake, and that was the cause of the injury?

 MR. FREDERICK:  I think it's -- both 

theories were presented, and they were both based on the 

improper equipment that he was asked to use and his 

improper -- improper training he had been given, which 

are classic jury questions concerning negligence and 

causation. 

 Thank you. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

 Mr. Rothfeld, you have 4 minutes. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Your Honor, just a 

few quick points.  First, although my friend Mr. 

Frederick has struggled valiantly, I think that he is 

unable to explain how his test is any different from a 

"but for" causation.

18

 MR. ROTHFELD:  No.  The question is whether 

or not the kind of -- the risk of -- that there would be 

an injury follows from the -- the nature of the 

misconduct that gives rise to liability in the first 

place, and it is -- common law has always recognized 

that if you're risking a particular kind of injury, that 

someone is going to be hit, you take your victim as your 

find them, and that is put -- put in a different basket 

of -- of doctrine altogether. 

 So -- so first, again I -- there is no 

19 

alternative to proximate cause, but "but for" cause; 

20

that's been universally recognized as an unacceptable 

21 

basis for liability. 

22

23 

24 

25

 Second, if I could return to our snake just 

for a moment.  It has been recognized that the -- the 

nature of the protection that's provided by the tort law 

is related to the -- to the risk of injury that gives

rise to liability in the first place.  If there -- the 

risk of injury is that a defective brake is going to 

lead to a derailment or an accident, injury that follows 

from that risk is compensable; injury that does not, 

like walking along and turning your leg or being bitten 

by a snake is in a different category, it's not 

predictable and foreseeable or natural in that sense. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why not, if you know 

9 

that there are snakes along this route, just like 

10

there's an infected vermin or insects or something else?

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, the question would be 

one for the jury if it's properly instructed.  And in 

fact in the Gallick case, as I think Justice Sotomayor, 

you -- you have recognized, the Court said that that was 

foreseeable.  And the jury -- the issue can be posed to 

the jury, the jury can determine whether it is a natural 

problem. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So it's not that it's a 

matter of law? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  No. 

That -- that's right, 

22 

that's right. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

A matter of law, there 

24 

was -- there could be no proximate cause.  You're 

25

arguing that a jury should determine whether or not they

2

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that's generally 

right.  I mean, there will be circumstances, as the 

restatement says, that -- in which it's so clear that it 

is not a -- a probable, natural, foreseeable consequence 

of -- of the wrongful conduct, that it should not go to 

the jury.  And -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't -- isn't Mr. Frederick 

9 

right in saying that asking whether something is 

10

probable is very different from asking whether it's 

11 

foreseeable? 

12

13 

14 

15

 MR. ROTHFELD:  They -- clearly they are 

closely related.  I mean the Court in Brady stated 

that -- that test, as natural, probable, foreseeable. 

If it is natural and probable, it is likely to be 

16 

foreseeable.  And -­

not probable.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, it -- but I think what 

probable means in this context it has to be foreseeable, 

not simply in the theoretical, I can foresee if I drive 

too fast in New York, maybe there will be a lightning 

strike -- I mean, I can imagine that.  But it has to

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If that's true, that -­

everything that's natural and probable is foreseeable, 

but not everything that's foreseeable is natural and 

probable, you were requesting a jury instruction that 

didn't go as far to help you as was possible, but you 

were still requesting a jury instruction that was on the 

road. 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That's -- to me the only 

9 

question now here before this Court is whether we are 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

entitled to a jury instruction that states properly the 

nature of the proximate cause test, and if the case goes 

back under that standard, then the arguments that have 

been suggested by Mr. Frederick can be presented to the 

jury.  But -- but as you say, Justice Scalia, that's 

right; and to the extent that there was anything wrong 

16 

with the instruction, we would provide it. 

17

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This case go to the jury? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I think it would be open to 

19 

argue that it's so clear that -- that there was no 

20

proximate cause that it shouldn't; but that's a question 

21 

to be posed on remand. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfeld, I 

didn't understand what you just said, because the 

requested jury instruction that -- that you gave was any 

cause which in natural or probable sequence produced the 

55

injury.  Is that right? 

2

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That was the requested 

3 

instruction. 

4

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that's essentially saying 

that the jury has to say it's 51 percent likely to 

6 

produce the injury, isn't that right? 

7

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- it was not put in those 

8 

terms.  I -- I would not think -­

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it says natural or 

probable, and probable means more likely than not, which 

11 

is 51 percent.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- again, it was not -­

unpacking those terms, and I would say it does not have 

to be -- the answer is -- is no.  The jury doesn't 

define that it is -- it is necessarily going to be the 

outcome, but it has to find that there is some 

substantial probability that it will be the outcome, 

before liability can attach, would be our -- our 

submission.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
