CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-950, the Hillside Dairy, Inc. v. William


J. Lyons, Jr., and a companion case.


Mr. Englert.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ENGLERT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


This is a case of inventive statutory


interpretation by the Ninth Circuit.  The statute at issue


directs the courts how to construe this act or any other


provision of law, yet the Ninth Circuit interpreted the


statute rather inventively as an exemption from a 

provision of the Constitution.  The statute protects


California statutes and regulations regarding two aspects


of California's composition regulation of packaged fluid


milk, yet the Ninth Circuit interpreted the statute,


rather inventively, as an exemption for all aspects of


California's economic regulation of raw milk.


Inventiveness may have a role to play in some


cases of statutory interpretation, but not when the


governing legal standard requires that Congress has made


its intent unmistakably clear.  The Ninth Circuit's

statutory holding should be reversed.


There is also a constitutional issue before the


Court involving the Privileges and Immunities Clause of


Article 4.  The Ninth Circuit should be reversed on that


issue as well, but not because it was overly inventive. 


The Ninth Circuit simply ignored, with no explanation at


all, binding precedent from this Court requiring that


courts look beyond the face of the statute to determine


whether, in practical effect, it draws a distinction based


on citizenship or residency.


The California statutes and regulations at issue


in this case draw a distinction based on where milk is


produced, and 93 percent of dairy farmers live on their


farms.  To draw a distinction based on the State of


production is, in effect, to draw a distinction based on 

the State of residency, and the distinction should be


subject to scrutiny under the Privileges and Immunities


Clause.  We do not --


QUESTION:  But as far as that clause is


concerned it wouldn't help you with the corporate, if you


had a corporate farmer.  It would only work for


individuals.


MR. ENGLERT:  Only the individual petitioners


are entitled to invoke the Privileges and Immunities


Clause, yes, and there are individual petitioners.

 QUESTION:  There are two individual petitioners


I think in this group, is that so?


MR. ENGLERT:  A -- a husband and wife, Darrel


and Diane Kuiper, yes.


Let me return to the statutory issue.  This act


or any other provision of law in section 144 means


statutory or regulatory law, not the Constitution.  Why do


I say that?  Number 1, section 144 is phrased as a


directive to courts about how to construe particular


bodies of law.  Congress doesn't have the power to tell


courts how to construe the Constitution.


It does have the power to tell courts how to


construe congressional silence or inaction, and the


McCarran-Ferguson Act is a good example of the kind of


phraseology Congress uses when it wants to enact a 

Commerce Clause exemption, but section 144 is a poor


candidate from the outset.


Number 2, the canons of construction applied in


numerous decisions of this Court, most recently the


Keffler case in February, required that a general phrase


like, other provision of law, be construed by reference to


the phrases that came before.  Federal statutory and


regulatory law is naturally paired with this act, but


would be very odd to throw the Constitution in as an


afterthought through use of the phrase, other provision of

law.


Number 3, the legislative history is devastating


to respondents' position.  The absence of a single


reference to the Constitution anywhere in the legislative


history is quite significant, but it's not the strongest


refutation of respondents' argument in the legislative


history.  Rather, the very first paragraph of explanation


of section 144 in the conference report describes it as,


quote, an exemption from the preemption provisions of any


Federal law respecting standards of identity and labeling


for fluid milk, close quote.  That can be found on page 33


of the blue brief.


Number 4, and this is merely the clincher that


builds on the first three points, the standard is whether


Congress has been unmistakably clear in passing a Commerce 

Clause exemption.  The evidence is so strongly the other


way that one might call it unmistakably clear that


Congress did not pass a Commerce Clause exemption, but


it --


QUESTION:  This argument's probably better


addressed to the respondents than -- than you, but do you


understand the respondents to argue that the percentage


of -- of milk solids which is one, and labeling, which is


the second part of the statute, simply will cease to exist


if -- if this pricing regulation is not upheld?

 MR. ENGLERT:  No, that -- I don't understand

QUESTION:  I -- I thought that that was going to


be -- when I got into the case I thought, well, they're


going to say that it's just impossible to have the


labeling, but I -- I don't understand them to argue that. 


I can ask them, of course, but --


MR. ENGLERT:  I -- I don't understand them to


argue that either, Justice Kennedy.  I think the strongest


form their argument takes is, there is a relationship


between economic regulation of raw milk and compositional


regulation of packaged fluid milk, and any relationship is


enough to satisfy this statute.


QUESTION:  Well, is it true that the pricing and


pooling laws were adopted to help the milk producers 

comply with the fluid milk content provisions?


MR. ENGLERT:  I -- I don't think that's


factually accurate, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  That was what the attorney in the


Shamrock case conceded.


MR. ENGLERT:  Not -- not --


QUESTION:  You don't agree?


MR. ENGLERT:  I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor.  He


did not concede that.  What he did concede was that the


fortification allowance --

 QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. ENGLERT:  -- which is a particular provision


of the stabilization plan, that is the pricing plan, not


the pooling plan, was adopted to help compliance with


California's composition standards.


QUESTION:  And section 7254 does use the word


indirectly.


MR. ENGLERT:  It does, Your Honor, but it's very


interesting to look at the parallel phrasing of section


144 of the Farm Bill, 7 U.S.C. 7254, and the preemption


provision of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act,


which is 21 U.S.C. section 343-1.  Both use the phrase


directly or indirectly.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. ENGLERT: 


In the preemption provision of the 

NLEA, Congress was talking about was -- what was


preempted, and it was saying anything a State does


directly or indirectly to have labeling requirements


different from Federal law is preempted.


What section 144 of the Farm Bill does is, it


unpreempts California's standards for milk.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. ENGLERT:  Now, unless California is prepared


to say that it's entire pooling and pricing plans were


preempted by the NLEA in 1990, which I don't think you're

going to hear from Mr. Urban, the entire pooling and


pricing plans weren't unpreempted by section 144 of the


Farm Bill, either.


Let me turn to the Privileges and Immunities


Clause issue.


QUESTION:  Just -- just before you get there --


well, maybe it's a part -- does -- do Nevada producers


have a -- a Federal marketing order?


MR. ENGLERT:  Nevada, yes.


QUESTION:  And Arizona as well?


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  They -- they -- do they opt out of it


if they want to sell the milk to -- to California


producers, or --


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes. 


The sales to California --

or, to California processors, excuse me, are not regulated


by those milk marketing orders.  The -- the seller and the


buyer would both have to be within the marketing order for


it to be governed by the Federal milk marketing order, I


believe.


QUESTION:  I see, and -- and so far as the


Nevada and Arizona dairy farmers are concerned, they can


sell to California without implicating any mechanisms


under the Federal marketing order?


MR. ENGLERT:  That's correct.

 QUESTION:  Now, the court below didn't deal with

O'Connor.

dismissal.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. ENGLERT:  It's on page A14 --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. ENGLERT:  -- of the petition appendix.


QUESTION:  All right.


MR. ENGLERT:  And its only reasoning was, the


statutes and regulations do not, on their face, refer to


citizenship or residency. 


The controlling precedent that 

absolutely precludes that reasoning is the Chalker case


from this Court in 1919, and respondents frankly have not


even made an argument for why Chalker should be overruled. 


Our own submission is that the 84 years since Chalker was


decided have strengthened its underpinnings a great deal,


rather than undermining them.


The Camden case from 1984 reinforces Chalker by


rejecting a formalistic approach to the threshold question


of discrimination, and the Lunding case from just 5 years


ago stresses the concern with, quote, practical effect,

Ninth Circuit's disregard of this Court's cases.


I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for


rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Englert.


Ms. McDowell.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MS. McDOWELL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Section 144 does not indicate with unmistakable


clarity that Congress meant to exempt from the Commerce


Clause any California laws, much less to exempt the 

particular raw milk pooling regulations at issue here. 


Indeed, section 144 is most naturally read as protecting


only a narrow set of California's fluid milk composition


and labeling laws from invalidation only under Federal


statutes and regulations, not under the Constitution.


First, Congress did not state or even imply that


the Commerce Clause is among the provisions of law from


which section 144 provides protection.  Section 144


directs how those provisions of law shall be construed,


and Congress ordinarily does not direct this Court and the

lower Federal courts how to construe the Constitution, and


under the canon that general words are known by their more


specific companions, the words, any other provision of law


is understood to refer to the preceding words, this act,


to refer only to Federal statutes and regulations


implementing them.


Section -- second, section 144 protects only


California laws regarding two specifically defined


subjects, the percentage of milk solids, and solid not --


solids not fat in fluid milk products sold at retail, and


the labeling of those products.  The laws challenged here


do not concern either subject.  They instead concern how


California handlers account to the California equalization


pool for purchases of out-of-State raw milk which may or


may not ultimately be processed into fluid milk products 

subject to the composition and labeling requirements.


QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell, as to the exemption


from the National -- from the Nutrition and Labeling Act,


is this -- is this a special exemption that California


has, or do a number of States have congressional


exemptions from the Nutrition and Labeling Act?


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, this specific provision,


section 144, applies only to California.


QUESTION:  Yes, but are there similar exemptions


in -- in effect in other States?

 MS. McDOWELL:  Well, the Nutrition and Labeling


Act does contain an exemption for maple syrup composition


and labeling that might have been designed to benefit the


particular States where maple syrup is produced.  I'm not


aware of the particular background of that provision.


There's also an adjoining provision of the 1996


Farm Bill that provides further indication that Congress


didn't intend section 144 to apply to all of the pricing


and pooling laws.  That's section 143(b) on page 17 of the


joint appendix, which authorizes the promulgation of a


Federal milk marketing order for California if California


dairy farmers approve of one.


Such a Federal milk marketing order would have


contained its own separate Federal pricing and pooling


provisions. 


It would necessarily have superseded the 

California pricing and pooling provisions at issue here. 


It seems unlikely that Congress intended in section 144 to


preserve the very pricing and pooling laws that section


143(b) and the Federal marketing order would supersede.


The legislative history reinforces --


QUESTION:  But there -- but there was no -- but


there is no Federal marketing order that supersedes it, or


am I wrong there?


MS. McDOWELL:  No, it authorized the


promulgation of one if California dairy farmers approved.

California dairy farmers have not asked for a Federal


marketing order at this point.


Under a Federal marketing order, by the way,


handlers are required to treat milk from sources inside


and outside the marketing order, marketing area similarly,


so the same minimum pricing requirements that would apply


to a dairy farmer within the marketing area would also


apply if milk came in from -- from outside that area.


QUESTION:  Is the Federal --


QUESTION:  Why doesn't that resolve this case?


MS. McDOWELL:  Because there -- there is no


Federal marketing order that applies to California, and of


course the --


QUESTION:  Oh, I -- I see.  In other words it


would have to be a California marketing order treating 

Nevada milk, not -- not a Nevada marketing order saying


what happens when you go to California.  All right.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, if there was a Federal milk


marketing order for California, milk from Nevada would be


treated the same as milk from California.  Of course,


Federal milk marketing orders aren't subject to the


constraints of the Commerce Clause, as are the California


orders.


QUESTION:  Has Congress ever provided a -- an


exemption for anything that looks like this California

pricing and pooling scheme?


MS. McDOWELL:  Not that I'm aware of, Your


Honor.  And this is a particularly unusual Commerce Clause


exemption because it does benefit only one State.  It


seems particularly appropriate in that circumstance to


apply the clear statement rules and -- and to require an


affirmative indication that Congress wanted to allow


California and only California to burden out-of-State


interests.


QUESTION:  I thought the only thing Congress had


ever -- maybe there's something else.  I thought it was


only insurance that Congress had performed the


extraordinary act of waiving the Commerce Clause.  Isn't


that right?


MS. McDOWELL: 


That's certainly one of the most 

familiar instances of this --


QUESTION:  It's the only one I -- only one I


know of.  Is there another one?


MS. McDOWELL:  There are other instances in


which Congress has affirmatively authorized particular


action by States.  For example, the Northeast Bancorp case


involved a -- an authorization for States to essentially


discriminate against interstate commerce to prohibit


acquisitions of local banks by out-of-State holding


companies, and when Congress enacts an affirmative

authorization one would think that then Congress is


removing any impediments that Congress can remove from


State regulation, but that's not the forum of the


provision at issue here.  Rather, it applies only to this


act and other provisions of law which are naturally


understood to be Federal statutes and regulations.


With respect to the Privileges and Immunities


Clause, we agree that the court of appeals erred in


suggesting that a statute can violate that clause only if


it discriminates on its face based on citizenship and --


or residency.  In Chalker, the Court recognized that a


statute could also violate that clause if it discriminates


based on some factor closely related to citizenship, such


as the location of a person's chief business office.  The


distinction drawn by the California regulations are 

somewhat similar.


The lower courts didn't consider whether that


distinction is closely enough related to State citizenship


to implicate the Privileges and Immunities Clause. 


Accordingly, we would ask that the judgment of the Ninth


Circuit be reversed with respect to both the Commerce


Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause question,


and that the case be remanded.


QUESTION:  May I ask just one just one factual


question?

QUESTION:  Am I correct in thinking California

MS. McDOWELL:  That's not entirely correct,


Justice Stevens.  There are portions of other States that


are not included in Federal marketing orders, either, I --


I believe, and perhaps the entire State of Maine is not. 


California is unique, however, in, to the extent that it


has its own freestanding marketing program and, of


course --


economy.


QUESTION:  Of its own, yes.


MS. McDOWELL:  -- California is the largest


QUESTION:  And my other question is, do you --


does the Government think we have to reach the Privilege 

and Immunities issue to decide the case?


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, the Court granted


certiorari on the Privileges and Immunities question. 


It's a narrow question.  Ultimately, on remand, the


Privileges and Immunities claim may not have to be decided


because a ruling in petitioners' favor on the Commerce


Clause issue would provide them all of the relief that


they're seeking.


QUESTION:  And it wouldn't take care of the --


the ruling on the statute would take care of everything,

but not Privileges and Immunities, because that covers

MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct.  What we're


saying is that the entire case needs to be remanded for


consideration of the Commerce Clause claim on the merits,


as well as the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim, and


if the Commerce Clause question is decided in petitioner's


favor, all of the petitioners would benefit from that


ruling, so there might not be occasion to consider the


Privileges and Immunities Clause as well.


If there are no further questions --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. McDowell.


Mr. Urban, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. URBAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. URBAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


There are two distinct and separate inquiries in


construing section 7254.  First, does it create a Dormant


Commerce Clause exemption for any California law, and


second, what laws are within the scope of section 7254? 


As regards the first step, it is unmistakably clear that


Congress in adopting section 7254 intended to provide a


Dormant Commerce Clause exemption for at least


California's milk content and labeling laws.

 As regards the second step, the scope of section


7254 encompasses not just the milk content and labeling


laws themselves, but also the various means that


California uses to continue those laws in effect.


QUESTION:  How do you respond to your


adversary's contention that when you use the word


construe, Congress does not ordinarily tell this Court how


to construe a provision of the Constitution?


MR. URBAN:  First of all, in the


McCarran-Ferguson Act statutes the Court found that there


was a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.  In that case


they used the term construe.  Second of all, I don't know


that Congress is aware of the niceties of the difference


between construe and interpret --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. URBAN:  -- or it would have used both of


those words.


QUESTION:  Well, certainly, looking over a large


group of statutes that Congress has enacted, there may be


something to what you say.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  But I -- I do think the -- the word


construed is simply out of place when Congress is saying


something to this Court about how to -- how to interpret


the Constitution.

 MR. URBAN:  But beyond that, Your Honor, the --


they then say, construe to preempt, prohibit, or otherwise


limit.  If they wanted to limit the scope of the


protection of section 7254 merely to preempt, they


wouldn't have added two additional phrases, and in


addition to that, many of the preemption savings statutes


use the term, this act or other -- any other act of


Congress, or lists a set of acts or regulations.  They


don't simply have the statement of one act and then a -- a


general term like, any other provision of law.


QUESTION:  Of course, Congress is sort of at a


loss for words, because it -- it's only the Commerce


Clause -- that's the only provision of the Constitution


that Congress can instruct us not to apply, so it's


understandable. 


Maybe out of respect for the rest of our 

body of law they -- they might use the word construe,


right?  I mean, we don't have any other examples of


where -- unless it was the -- the Religious Freedom


Restoration Act, which -- which we did not uphold.


MR. URBAN:  That's -- that's correct, Your


Honor.  There's two ways that Congress can act to save


State laws.  One is by a preemption savings statute, and


the other is by a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.  And


beyond that, Congress can't affect the State exercise of


authority through any means that involves the

Constitution, and that, the -- the first question then is,


does section 7254 create a Dormant Commerce Clause


exemption.


And then, as I indicated, the choice really is,


is it preemption only or something more and the statute


itself, by using the terms, prohibit or otherwise limit,


suggests that it is, or states directly that it is


something more.  If they just simply wanted to have this


as a preemption savings statute they would have stopped at


preemption.


And again, the argument was raised, well, why


didn't they mention the Constitution directly.  None of


the two areas where there have been cases in which the


Court has found a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption, one


of which is the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the other of 

which is the Northeast Bancorp case, was there mention of


the Constitution.  They -- they looked at -- at the total,


at what the statute said, at what the context was in which


those statutes were adopted, and -- and from that


concluded that Congress had intended to fully regulate in


those areas or to provide a Dormant Commerce Clause


exemption.


The petitioners have tried to use a doctrine of


adjustum generis, the laws are interpreted in the company


they keep.  I've never seen an application of that

doctrine where all you have is one statute or one item


mentioned, and then you say any others.  Usually that


doctrine's applied when you have three or four items.


QUESTION:  Mr. Urban, the problem, as I see it,


is not whether they -- you might construe the language as


broad enough to cover the Dormant Commerce Clause, but the


thing it saves is, legislation regarding milk solids and


fats and so forth, and doesn't say anything about saving


pricing legislation.


MR. URBAN:  That -- that's true, Your Honor. 


That's the second inquiry, what is the scope of the


statute, and they are distinct inquiries, and it would be


possible for the Court to determine that the statute


doesn't cover pooling and pricing laws --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. URBAN:  -- and still protect the Dormant


Commerce Clause exemption from milk content and labeling


laws.


QUESTION:  In -- although you would not prevail


if we so held.


(Laughter.)


MR. URBAN:  We -- if you so held, we would be


back to the district court on the question of whether


there's a Dormant Commerce Clause violation for the milk


pricing and pooling laws, but the core intent of Congress

in enacting section 7254, which was to protect and allow


State milk content and labeling laws to have full effect,


that would be protected, because we have the Shamrock


Farms case from the Ninth Circuit that held that there was


a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption created for those


laws.


I want to --


QUESTION:  I thought those laws weren't directly


before the court in Shamrock.  I thought the fortification


provision was.


MR. URBAN:  What was directly before the Court


in the Shamrock case, Your Honor, was a challenge to the


milk content and labeling laws, and then the -- the other


item that was before the court that was specific was the


fortification allowance, which is a small part of the milk 

pricing and pooling laws, and then there was a general


allegation involving milk pooling and pricing that, upon


which there was an admission made about the laws being --


I think it was something, interwoven.


QUESTION:  But -- but surely we're not bound by


Shamrock if -- if we consider it not to be sound, not to


have sound reasoning.


MR. URBAN:  That -- that's correct, Your Honor. 


If the Court believes that there's no Dormant Commerce


Clause exemption at all --

 QUESTION:  And I -- I -- and I must say, without


knowing many of the details of -- of the pricing scheme,


it seems to me that the labeling and -- and requirements


for fortification with, I guess, nonfat solids can exist


perfectly well without your pricing scheme.


MR. URBAN:  Your Honor, as a general matter, you


can have composition and labeling laws without a pricing


scheme.  California's composition standards are unique


because they require fortification.  That produces several


features.  One is that there's not a ready market to sell


into California with complying milk.


If you didn't have pricing and pooling laws and


you went back to the free market, you'd be subject to the


same boom-bust cycle that led to the creation of these


pricing and pooling laws in the first place, and when 

you'd reached the point where the prices were very high


and supplies were low, I think the -- the inevitable


result of that would be that the composition standards


would be undone and they'd simply revert to the Federal


standards.


QUESTION:  But -- but if that's so inevitable,


it seems to me it would have been in 7254.


MR. URBAN:  I -- I don't agree with that, Your


Honor, because I think that what Congress did in 7254, and


this goes to the scope of the statute, is that they

protected the composition and labeling laws themselves,


and they also, by using terms like, directly or


indirectly, establish or continue in effect, regarding


rather than regulating, referred to something more, and


that something more are the means that California uses to


enable the laws to continue in effect.


QUESTION:  That's an ingenious argument, but I


mean, if I understand it what you're saying is that if


we -- if you didn't have the price controls, then


competition would break out, and competition breaking out


would mean in -- if we were back in the thirties, that


eventually everybody would go out of business but for one


giant milk seller who then would raise the price so high


that the people really getting angry at him, as opposed to


only paying $18, which is considerably above the market 

level, they might have to pay $24, even more.


They'd really get angry, and this time, though


they don't get angry at the $18 price, they'd start really


shipping milk in from Arizona, and once they shipped in


milk from Arizona, maybe that wouldn't have the fortified


stuff in it and they'd -- they'd amend the law so that you


could bring it in from Arizona and down would go the


labeling requirement as it stands today.


Do I understand the argument correctly?  I've


parodied a little, but I don't think I've parodied it that

much.


MR. URBAN:  You did, Your Honor.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I did.  Yes, I did.


MR. URBAN:  The -- milk is an -- is an unusual


commodity because it can't be stored, and like any


commodity, it's subject to periods, and we have this a lot


with agricultural pricing, where you have periods of


low -- you have high supply and therefore you'll have a


low price.  People leave the industry and then the cycle


will reverse, and it's when you reverse the cycle -- and


that's -- that is what happened with -- with milk that led


to the --


QUESTION:  I thought that's --


MR. URBAN: 


-- formation of those laws, and it's 

also what occurs frequently with agricultural commodities. 


I mean, they're -- they're subject to a boom-bust cycle,


and at some point in that cycle you're going to have


prices that are very high, and we -- we've had that happen


in California to some extent for other --


QUESTION:  Like --


MR. URBAN:  -- other reasons, and -- and you --


and at that point, and it did happen in California in '99,


as we've cited in the brief, there is a lot of pressure to


undo the standards because they are -- they are more

expensive and you'll have limited supplies.  I mean,


that's -- that's the connection.


QUESTION:  May I ask, though, are the -- the


percentage of solids in the -- in the milk, is that


something -- that's something that's not determined by the


farmer.  That's determined by the processor, isn't it?


MR. URBAN:  The raw milk that comes to a -- a


processing plant varies to some extent in the amount of


fat and solids not fat.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. URBAN:  Then the processor -- this is how


California's processors are different from other


States' -- adds in solids not fat in order to meet the


standards, and they have -- you know, this is all


mechanized.


QUESTION:  And that is done even if the milk


when it left the farm was deficient in fat solids.


MR. URBAN:  Correct.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Generally speaking, what percentage


of the raw milk comes in from out of State to California,


of the total?


MR. URBAN:  My recollection is somewhere around


10 to 15 percent, most of which comes to fluid milk


plants, which are the class 1 plants.

 QUESTION:  So it's generally a small percentage. 


I'm -- I'm not sure that I think that you're dire


consequences scenario would play out.


Do milk prices tend to rise and fall over a wide


region of the United States at the same time, or does it


tend to be very spotty?


MR. URBAN:  California's prices rise and fall as


an independent market.  I don't know what happens in other


parts of the United States, and I want to -- aside from


the sort of economic theory of the boom-bust cycle, it is


a fact that California's own laws say that the purpose of


the pooling and pricing laws is to provide supply and


price stability in order to allow for adequate supplies of


fluid milk at -- at prices that are reasonable to


consumers, and that the purpose of --


QUESTION:  How -- how does the latter part come


in?  I mean, if we have to write this, as I understand it,


and I'd just as soon you correct, because I don't want to


say something if it isn't right.  This is actually a


simple system, it's not so complicated, and at the heart


of it is simply, we could pretend that they want to pay


the dairy $16 a hundredweight indefinitely.  That's


stable.


And now the problem is, although you can say to


everybody, pay, a handler is paid $16, when they do that

they're going to discover cheese coming in from Wisconsin,


and the cheesemakers are not going to be able to compete


and still pay $16, so they figured out in California,


here's how we keep our cheesemakers in business.  We


subsidize them.  We pay them $2 because they can only sell


at $14.  Where do we get the money from?  We get it from


the milk sellers.


So they pay $18 to pay the cheesemakers $14 so


that all can pay $16 to the dairies.  That way, the


cheesemakers stay in business despite Wisconsin, and the


milk sellers, unfortunately the retailers have to charge


more and the mothers have to pay more for their milk, but


that in a way helps the people who want to eat a lot of


cheese.  We don't know what happens to them if they eat


too much cheese, but --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- there we are.


But I mean, that seemed to me the essence of the


system, and since that's the model that's in my mind, and


since it could become relevant, I'd like you to correct me


if I'm not right.


MR. URBAN:  That -- that's -- that is the wrong


model.


QUESTION:  All right.

 MR. URBAN:  The --


QUESTION:  And what is the right model?


MR. URBAN:  The right model is that the -- the


prices are generally set, and they're recalibrated


regularly, based on certain free market markers, like


various cheese exchanges, et cetera, and then there are


ways for each of the prices to be adjusted, the class 1,


class 2, class 3, class 4 prices to be adjusted so that


they're -- they reflect in a sense an -- a open market,


and there's also a desire to have these prices be


comparable to the prices that are being paid on the, in


the Federal marketing orders so that that doesn't produce


problems, so there's not a subsidy from one class of use


to another class of use.


What there was was then a blending when you come 

to the producers of their revenues, and that's the pool,


and that blending of revenues, they adopted a two-tiered


system.  One was a quota system, and one was all other


prices, and that really was set up because the


quota-holders had contracts and commercial dealings with


class 1 dealers which -- for which they got a higher


price, and the goal was to protect those -- those rights


and reflect those rights in the difference between a quota


price and an everything-else price.


QUESTION:  Is it true that in-State producers of

raw milk are guaranteed a minimum price for their milk


under the California scheme, but out-of-State producers


are not?


MR. URBAN:  That -- that's exactly right.  The


in-State producers are regulated.  They get a guaranteed


minimum price.  Out-of --


QUESTION:  Yes, and the out-of-State producers


are not.


extent.


MR. URBAN:  Right.


QUESTION:  They're at a disadvantage to that


MR. URBAN:  They're at both an advantage and a


disadvantage.  They're not regulated, so they have the


disadvantage that they don't have a guaranteed minimum


price, but they have the advantage that they can compete 

on price, so if they want to be efficient and undersell


California producers they can do that, so they have both a


benefit and -- both sides have a benefit and burden.  One


is of regulation versus nonregulation.


I want to go into the legislative history of


section 7254, which was mentioned.  When section 7254 was


adopted, the Federal law NLEA preempted California milk


content standards, but that law only applied to fluid milk


in interstate commerce.  The House conference committee


report which petitioners cite not only described the

preemption issue, but it also said that the purpose of


adoption of 7254 was to allow California to fully enforce


and apply its -- its standards.


It would have made little sense, in light of


that congressional intent, for Congress to on the one hand


allow for a exemption from preemption but at the same time


allowed the exact same body of law to be subject to a


Dormant Commerce Clause challenge, which is, in fact, what


happened in the Shamrock case, yet that would occur, that


undermining of Congress' intent to have California be able


to fully enforce its own milk content standards, if


section 7254 were held to be only a preemption savings


statute.


We've touched on the issue of the scope of


section 7254, and we're not claiming that the unmistakably 

clear standard applies to the scope, and we're certainly


not claiming that it's unmistakably clear that section


7254 applies separately to pricing and pooling laws.  What


we're claiming is that section 7254 not only covers the


laws themselves, but the means to keep those laws in


effect, and in answer to questions --


QUESTION:  Who's your authority for that, for


the extension of the unmistakably clear principle?


MR. URBAN:  That it doesn't extend to --


QUESTION:  Yes.

 MR. URBAN:  First of all, we couldn't find a


single case where the Court has come back, after it's


determined there's a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption,


for example with the business of insurance, come back and


each time it decides what is the business of insurance,


that it says this is a Dormant Commerce clause exemption


so we have to use an unmistakably clear standard.


The Court has interpreted, after it's found a


general area of law that -- in which there's a Dormant


Commerce Clause exemption, that it's interpreted then what


is within that area of the law using standard rules of


statutory construction, and -- and --


QUESTION:  And the cases would be what,


Benjamin, something like that?


MR. URBAN:  Yes. 


Yes, Prudential Insurance v. 

Benjamin, but then when the Court's come back, for


example, in Royal Drug to look at what's the business of


insurance, they've used standard -- you've used standard


rules of -- of statutory construction.


And you know, that -- that makes a certain


amount of sense here, because you know, you have both a


preemption savings statute and a Dormant Commerce Clause


exemption in the same statute, which is the case -- if you


have a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption you'd have to


essentially have two sets of rules as to how you interpret

the, what is being affected by that -- that exemption, one


for preemption and one for a Dormant Commerce Clause


exemption.


That -- that doesn't -- doesn't seem logical. 


They should -- whatever Congress intended be covered by


the law should be interpreted the same, whether it's a


Commerce Clause exemption or a preemption exemption.


The second issue before the Court is the


Privileges and Immunities Clause, and when this issue was


considered by the Ninth Circuit they ruled that because


the out-of-State dairy producers were not being regulated


based on their residency, but that the regulatory scheme


involved place of production, that the -- that the


Privileges and Immunities Clause didn't apply.


That is fairly unexceptional, because the 

purpose of the Privilege and Immunities Clause is that it


applies when a State law deprives a nonresident who enters


a State to engage in some protective privilege, that


they're entitled to the same privilege and immunities as a


resident of that State.  There's no entry into the State


by -- by the dairy farmers from Arizona -- if they came


into the State to produce milk, they'd be treated exactly


the same as --

into the State.  There was a tax if you did business in --


you came into Tennessee and did business.  There, the


question was, they -- they didn't say residency per se. 


They said --


QUESTION:  Chief office.


MR. URBAN:  -- place of -- yes, chief office of


business, and I think the Court correctly found, based on


their common experience and knowledge, that that was


simply a pretext or a surrogate or a proxy for residency. 


That's not the case here.  Here, it's a shipment of goods,


milk into a State.  It's -- it's a State regulatory --


economic regulatory scheme, essentially, that's affecting


the goods themselves, and that's nothing like what's


happened in Chalker.


QUESTION:  Well, do you support the Ninth


Circuit's view that to be covered by the Privileges and


Immunities Clause it has to be facially discriminatory?


MR. URBAN:  In the -- in the context of the


statutes that they had before them, yes.  Whether that is


a --


QUESTION:  I -- I would have thought that broad


statement was not accurate in light of Chalker, that it


doesn't have to be facially discriminatory to be covered.


MR. URBAN:  The distinction in Chalker, what was

the discrimination was facial.  It was based on where your


place of -- of business was.


If the Ninth Circuit opinion is being


interpreted, or would be interpreted to say that if you


had some transparent proxy for place of residence, like


they did in Chalker, that that would somehow be foreclosed


by the Ninth Circuit's decision, I think that would be a


misreading of what the Ninth Circuit did.  They took a


statute that, as they indicate, merely regulated based on


place of production, not on residency.


QUESTION:  The two sentences -- I hadn't


understood that.  They wrote two sentences on this in the


opinion, and you're saying it's really the first sentence


that is the holding, that there is no violation with


respect to the individual dairy owners because the 

classifications the pooling plan amendments create are


based on the location where milk is produced, and the next


sentence is sort of a throw-away, and there's nothing in


the statute to the contrary.


MR. URBAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  That's how you -- I see.


MR. URBAN:  In -- in summation, there -- the two


issues involving the section 7254 before the Court are


first whether it establishes an exemption and second, its


scope.

 On the first issue we believe it's unmistakably


clear that there is an exemption established by 7254 to


the Dormant Commerce Clause.  As to the second issue, we


believe that California's milk pooling and pricing laws


are within the scope of section 7254.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Urban.


MR. URBAN:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Englert, you have 11 minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


QUESTION:  It -- it seems to me, Mr. Englert, it


make -- does make a certain amount of sense to say that


you should have one rule of construction for preemption


and for Dormant Commerce Clause, and you don't have two 

different rules for interpreting congressional intent with


the same statute.


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, Justice Kennedy, the Court


has said very consistently in its Dormant Commerce Clause


jurisprudence that the intent of the Congress must be


unmistakably clear.


QUESTION:  Were -- were those statutes


preemption statutes as well?  You see, here you have a


preemption statute --


MR. ENGLERT:  In -- in some instances, they

were.


QUESTION:  -- and -- and the argument is that --


but let's say that it was simply a preemption case that,


well, directly or indirectly Congress doesn't want have to


spell out everything, so it says indirectly, so this -- so


this is not preempted.  Then you have a Dormant Commerce


Clause and you say, well, we have a different rule for


that.  That seems a little odd.


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, that's what the Court did in


New England Power Company v. New Hampshire, and the


statute being construed, the provision of the Federal


Power Act being construed in that case, like the statute


being construed in this case, was not so much a preemption


clause as an unpreemption clause.


The typical statute that comes before this Court 

alleged to be a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption is one


that says certain State laws are protected, or are


allowed, and in many of those cases the Court has said,


and New England Power v. New Hampshire is a good example,


the Court has often said yes, those State laws are not


subject to preemption under Federal law, but there is no


unmistakably clear Dormant Commerce Clause exemption.


So the -- the Court's jurisprudence as I read it


is really rather consistent in setting a higher standard


for exemptions for the Dormant Commerce Clause, and

there's a reason for that, and the reason for that is that


the Commerce Clause is part of the -- is one of the


structural provisions of the Constitution and, as this


Court pointed out in the South-Central Timber case, the


particularly strong rule of construction ensures that all


States know what's going on and have their say in Congress


before the protections the States have vis-a-vis one or


another -- vis-a-vis one another are altered.


QUESTION:  What is the answer to the last point


on privileges and immunities?  I hadn't taken that in, and


I -- I think it's been argued on -- on your side as if


what the Court had said was, well, the statute doesn't


create a classification on its face, doesn't create a


classification based on an individual's residency or


citizenship, which certainly it doesn't, and then you say 

quite right, but of course a statute nonetheless could do


that in effect, and -- and thereby have the same violation


that it would have had if it had been on its face, but


that isn't their point, and as I reread this they're


saying -- I think it does say what they say it said.


What the judge was saying is, wait a minute,


there -- there's no -- nobody here could say they're --


they're discriminating on the basis of residency or


citizenship.  That's not what the statute says.  It's


discriminating on the basis of where the milk is produced.

We don't care if he's a California resident or a -- or an


Alaska resident, it's where the milk is produced, and


there's nothing in the statute as I read it, says the


judge, i.e. on its face, that says anything to the


contrary.


Now, what's the answer to that argument?


MR. ENGLERT:  It's all true.  It's -- it's --


but it was just as much of a sin for the Ninth Circuit to


ignore the 93 percent correlation between where dairy


farmers reside and where milk is produced as it was to


say, we don't look beyond the face of the statute.


QUESTION:  I see, you're saying it might violate


the Privileges and Immunities Clause even if -- or, why?


MR. ENGLERT:  It's -- it's exactly --


QUESTION: 


The -- what -- it's a violation of 

the Privileges and Immunities Clause for a State to


discriminate against out-of-State commerce, because after


all, out-of-State commerce is mostly produced by


out-of-State residents?


MR. ENGLERT:  I -- I'm not making that broad an


argument, Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  Then what is --


MR. ENGLERT:  I'm saying that in this case, as


in the Chalker case, there is an extremely high


correlation between place of business and residency or

citizenship of individuals, and just as this Court said,


we don't care that someone from Alabama could have a


principal place of business in Tennessee, because most


people from Alabama don't have a principal place of


business in Tennessee --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. ENGLERT:  -- so too, here, the Ninth Circuit


should not have cared that Nevadans could have -- could


produce milk in California when 93 percent of all dairy


farmers do produce milk in the State and, indeed, on the


very farm where they reside.


QUESTION:  So if Massachusetts passes a


statute -- you know this area better than I at the moment,


but if Massachusetts passes a statute and it says, we're


fed up with nectarines from California, they're too 

woolly, and therefore no more nectarines from California


coming into Massachusetts, it's absolutely true, every


nectarine farm down there is owned by a California


resident, none by Massachusetts residents.  That violates


the Privileges and Immunities provision, in your opinion,


as far as individuals own the farms?


MR. ENGLERT:  I -- I certainly suspect it's a


violation, but we're we're not asking this Court actually


to hold that there's any --


QUESTION:  No, no, I know that.

Privileges and Immunity Clause argument.  I'm less


familiar with how courts in this area --

location is not the same as residency or citizenship, and


we need not look behind location of production to ask


whether it is so closely correlated with residency or


citizenship as to create an improper -- a classification


that must be scrutinized under the Constitution.


Mr. Urban pointed out that the McCarran-Ferguson


Act uses the verb construe, and rightly so, but what it


says the Court is not to construe as forbidding State


regulation is Congress' silence.  It is not a directive


how to construe the Constitution.  It is a very proper


statute, perhaps the model for how a Dormant Commerce


Clause exemption should be written.  Don't construe our


silence to mean we want to stop the States from doing


something.  The statute here is very different.  The


statute here says, construe this act or any other 

provision of law in particular ways.


Mr. Urban, in talking about section 7254, said


at one point, the use of three different verbs, only one


of which is preempts, suggests that Congress' intent was


something more than merely to negate Federal preemption. 


I respectfully submit that suggesting that Congress had


more in mind is not enough to meet the unmistakable


clarity standard.  Under Gregory v. Ashcroft, an


unmistakable clarity standard means it would be plain to


anyone reading the act what Congress had in mind, and

merely saying the use of three verbs suggests something


does not make it plain to anyone reading the act.


I do think -- Justice Stevens asked Ms. McDowell


if the Court needs to reach the Privileges and Immunities


Clause claim.  I -- I believe the Court does need to reach


the Privileges and Immunities Clause claim in the limited


way we have suggested and that is because, although


Ms. McDowell correctly said the petitioners might prevail


on remand under the Commerce Clause and, indeed, I hope we


will, and if we do that will give all of my clients the


relief that they need, we also might not prevail under the


Commerce Clause, and I think we're entitled to pursue both


the Commerce Clause claim and, with respect to the


individual petitioners, the Privileges and Immunities


Clause claim on remand.


The -- Justice Kennedy asked me some questions


in my opening argument about the Federal marketing orders


in effect in Nevada and Arizona, and I -- I perhaps didn't


speak with sufficient clarity about two aspects of that. 


The Federal milk marketing orders cover parts of Nevada


but not other parts.  Some are and some are not covered by


Federal milk marketing orders, but in any event, it's


worth making clear that the marketing orders fundamentally


operate on the processors of milk, not on the producers of


milk, so when we say the Federal milk marketing orders

operate in parts of Nevada, we're really talking about


Nevada processors.  If you ship your milk to a California


processor it -- it is at no point governed by a Federal


milk marketing order.


Whatever -- with respect to the unmistakably


clear standard, Mr. Urban made the argument that once


you've found an unmistakably clear Dormant Commerce Clause


exemption, the unmistakably clear standard has no more


role to play and it's just a matter of ordinary statutory


interpretation.


This Court's cases, I believe, do not support


that proposition, but he spoke specifically about the


McCarran-Ferguson Act cases in which the Court has


construed the phrase, business of insurance, without any


particular thumb on the scale. 


Well, that is how the 

Court must construe the phrase, business of insurance,


because Congress has delegated authority over an entire


business to the States.


That's very different from this very precisely


drawn statute that speaks about two particular aspects of


California's compositional regulation of raw milk and


saying, well, let's just resort to ordinary principles of


statutory interpretation to determine whether that also


reaches economic regulation of fluid milk.  The


unmistakably clear standard is still in effect, and

ingenious arguments about the relationship between


economic regulation of fluid milk and composition


regulation of raw milk are not enough to meet that


standard. 


In particular, it cannot possibly be the case


that the 1997 amendments to California's pooling plan are


somehow necessary to effect composition regulation.  The


main thing the 1997 amendments did was not negate the


possibility that out-of-State milk would flood California


to such an extent that there would be price effects that


ultimately would have -- would have sanitary effects. 


What the 1997 amendments did essentially was say, we're


going to intercept some of the revenue that would


otherwise go to out-of-State processors at California's


border and redistribute it just to in-State interests. 

We're going to take some of the money that they would


otherwise get in their milk transaction and say, it must


go to Californians, not to you out-of-Staters.


That's the essence of the Commerce Clause


violation in this case, and it's also inconceivable that


that kind of regulation could be protected by this


statute.  If that kind of regulation is protected by this


statute, then a regulation that says 100 percent of every


milk check that would be written to a Nevadan must instead


go to a Californian is protected by this statute, i.e., no


47 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

out-of-State milk, and that can't possibly be the


unmistakably clear intent of Congress in section 7254.


One last detail, and it is just a detail. 


Mr. Urban said that 10 to 15 percent of the milk that


comes into California is from out of State.  I understand


from a publication that's cited at page 39 of our opening


brief called Dairy Profit Weekly that the actual number is


closer to 3 percent.  When Congressman Bill Thomas spoke


at a field hearing -- thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Englert.  The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
