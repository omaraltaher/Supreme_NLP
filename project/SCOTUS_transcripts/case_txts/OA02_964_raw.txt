CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument now


in No. 02-964, George Baldwin v. Michael Reese.


General Myers.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. HARDY MYERS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. MYERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


When a state prisoner decides to attack his


conviction on the basis of a claimed violation of Federal


constitutional right, your cases have held that he must


first alert the state courts he is raising a Federal


claim, if that claim is to be exhausted for Federal habeas


purposes.  But what the prisoner must say to the state


courts to tell them he is raising a Federal claim


continues to be a - a troubled area of Federal habeas law. 


It is one that has divided the circuits and is producing


very different analyses and results.


Some cases are holding that the prisoner must


make some explicit citation or reference to the Federal


source of his claim.  Some cases are holding that a


Federal claim has been fairly presented even when - even


though what the prisoner is saying to the state courts


could as - as - as reasonably be interpreted as stating a

state law claim.  And some courts have held that a Federal


claim is fairly presented even when the statement of the


claim is clearly a claim under state law only.


This continuing - and in this - in this case -


QUESTION: Well, we're reviewing a Ninth Circuit


holding, which seems fairly open-ended.  How would you


characterize the Ninth Circuit rule?


MR. MYERS: Your Honor, I was about to describe


it is a transformation of the responsibility of the state


prisoner to present his claim, a transformation of that


into a responsibility of the - of the state court - state


courts to, in effect, step into the shoes of the state


prisoner and complete or try to complete an incompletely


presented claim.


This - this overall division among the circuits


and this case from the Ninth Circuit, we think, Your


Honors, illustrates or confirms very strongly the need for


further clarification by this Court as to exactly what


must be said by -


QUESTION: Well, do you agree with your opponents


here on at least some of the ground rules that would


suffice?  I mean, is it enough to cite a Federal


constitutional provision or a Federal statute or other


provision describing the right as Federal?  You're both in


agreement that would do?

 MR. MYERS: Yes.  We believe that is so, so long


as -


QUESTION: How about if you cite at least a - a


reported case that has decided the claim on a Federal


basis?  You make your claim and cite a case that -


MR. MYERS: Yes -


QUESTION: - clearly has decided the claim on a


Federal basis.  Is that - you're both in agreement that


would do?


MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honors, so -


QUESTION: And what if a - a claim is spelled out


that necessarily must be based on a Federal right to exist


at all?


MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor, that is part of the


test that we propose -


QUESTION: Why yes?  I don't understand that. 


I 

mean, why is it necessarily a Federal claim?  It's


necessarily a Federal claim only if it's a valid claim. 


It might be an erroneous state claim.


MR. MYERS: Well, we are referring to


necessarily, Your Honor, in the sense that the - the


source of the claim, that is its Federal source, is -


QUESTION: Who -


QUESTION: But the - the -


MR. MYERS: - is unmistake -

 QUESTION: He hasn't read the state constitution. 


He - he makes a due process claim.  Now, you're - you're


going to say, since there is no Due Process Clause in the


state constitution, but there is in the Federal


Constitution, we must assume it's a Federal claim.  Why? 


It may be an erroneous state claim.


MR. MYERS: Your Honor, we think that the state


court -


QUESTION: And I don't want to have to go through


the trouble of figuring out whether there's a valid state


claim.  I - I mean, this is going to require a Federal


court every time there's such a claim to go through state


law and determine whether there is anything to this under


state law.  Why should - why should we do that?  Why, I


mean, why aren't your first two requirements enough?  Look


at - cite a Federal case, cite a Federal provision.  Is -


is this an enormous burden?


MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor, and we would be quite


content -


QUESTION: So why do you want to add anything to


it?  I - I don't - I don't really understand going beyond


that.


QUESTION: Let me ask you the other - the


contrary question.  Suppose the - the prisoner alleges, I


had a lawyer who didn't even graduate from law school, and

because I had such a law - lousy lawyer, I lost the case


and I'm in jail, and I would be innocent if I were not in


jail, but he doesn't cite any cases or any constitutional


provision.  Would that have - present a Federal claim?


MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor.  Inasmuch as -


QUESTION: You don't think so?


MR. MYERS: Not - not necessarily -


QUESTION: Yeah, but if he added, and therefore,


it violated the Federal Constitution, then it would be a


Federal claim?


MR. MYERS: Your Honor, it would - the - a


Federal source of the claim would have been identified,


but, of course, whatever further clarification the Court


might consider adopting or adopt, the balance of the


statement of the claim also has to meet the requirements


of fair presentation.


QUESTION: But why - why doesn't the state judge


know he's raising a claim of inadequate assistance of


counsel that violates the Federal Constitution?  Doesn't


that give the state judge a fair opportunity to decide the


Federal question?


MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor, because the


description of the claim that you just gave, apart from


whether it's factually adequate or whatever could as -


could equally address, or state a claim under state law.

 QUESTION: Well, certainly -


QUESTION: But that anybody knows -


QUESTION: - but the question is whether it


states a Federal claim that has been exhausted.  Doesn't


it also state a Federal claim?


MR. MYERS: Not necessarily, Your Honor.


QUESTION: I - I thought the Federal standards -


and I was going to get into this, but let's do it in


relation to Justice Stevens' hypothetical - I thought the


Federal standards and the state standards for adequate


assistance of counsel were - were in substance the same,


and in, you know, in Oregon.  And - and if they are the


same, why is it unfair to the state or to the state courts


to construe a - a - a statement like the one Justice


Stevens just read, as stating a Federal as well as a state


claim?  The court is going to do the same thing no matter


how it construes it.


MR. MYERS: Your Honor, when state judicial


authority is invoked to address a claim before it, it's of


paramount importance for that court to know whether it is


addressing a state claim -


QUESTION: No, my -


QUESTION: Well, we - we need to lay down a rule,


I think, that is - can be applied generally and not just


to Oregon, so that, of course, a peculiarity of Oregon law

ought not to control what we're trying to do in making a


more general statement.


MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor, and I would like to -


QUESTION: May - maybe I didn't make my - my


point.  My - my point was, if a claim is stated as a


matter of fact, which under the law of the state and the


law of the United States is governed by identical


standards, what is unfair about construing that as a


Federal as well as a state claim, regardless of what label


is put on it?


MR. MYERS: And, Your Honor, as I was saying a


few moments ago, it - the answer to that goes to the fact


- or rests on the fact that the state court's authority to


address a state law-based claim is very different, of


course, from its authority to address a Federal law-based


claim.  It has the ability to judge and decide the state


law claim any way it - it thinks is correct under state


law.  It must, of course, in the relation to a Federal


claim, follow the precedents faithfully of this Court -


QUESTION: No, but I'm - my - the - the - my - my


question assumed that the - that the substantive law


governing the claim was the same under - under the state


system and under the Federal system.  So my assumption is


that you're going to get the same result, and the result


is going to be equally right or equally wrong, regardless

of - of - of whether you construe it as a state claim and


a Federal claim.


MR. MYERS: But, Your Honor, the - the - the


authority issue is crucial, because if the state court


does not know whether it, in fact, has a state law claim


before it, it does not know whether it has the prerogative


in that case to change the rule.


QUESTION: Suppose -


QUESTION: Well, it -


QUESTION: - Oregon had said in prior decisions,


as states sometimes do in dealing with constitutional


provisions, we interpret inadequate assistance of counsel


in our state to be strictly in tune with the way the


Supreme Court interprets inadequate or ineffective


assistance of counsel.  That is, our state standard is the


same, identical, to the Federal, so there isn't any doubt


about there being a difference between the state law and


the Federal law.  The - the state supreme court has said,


we take our lead from the Federal definition.


MR. MYERS: Your Honor, I - I would still assert


respectfully that the - the - the clarity with which the


claim is presented in terms of making clear whether there


is a state claim or a Federal claim present is still of


great importance, because the state court can still change


its decision with respect to the state claim if it is a

state claim.


QUESTION: Sure it can, but the question is, what


does it know when it sets out to adjudicate the case?  Is


it fairly on notice at day one on a premise like Justice


Ginsburg's that the claim is equally state or Federal? 


And it seems to me that on a premise like hers, of course


the state can fairly say the law is the same, doesn't


matter at this point whether - whether I call it state or


whether I call it Federal, so it's fair to assume it's


both. 


If the state court, let's say the state supreme


court, later on says, we think we'll change our rule, then


all the state court has to do is to say, the claim is


either good or bad under Federal law and this - the result


is now going to be different under state law.  But the


state courts at each stage on a premise like Justice


Ginsburg is fairly on notice of what it has to decide. 


There's no unfairness to it.  That's the point that we're


getting at, and I - and I don't understand your answer


when you say it's important for them to know the source if


there's no unfairness.


MR. MYERS: Well, Your Honor, with respect, we do


think that there is unfairness if it is not absolutely and


explicitly clear to the court that a Federal claim is


being presented by a state court.

 QUESTION: You mean because it's just nice to


know?


MR. MYERS: No, because it -


QUESTION: It doesn't make any difference in the


law.  It doesn't make any difference in - in the standards


by which they would go about adjudicating it.


MR. MYERS: But it could, in the sense that they


might want to change their position or interpretation with


respect to state law.


QUESTION: Yes, but that - the change in position


to allow the claim.  But we're only concerned with cases


in which the state has denied relief.  If you could - if


the state grants relief, there's no exhaustion problem. 


He got the relief.


MR. MYERS: That's true, Your Honor.


QUESTION: And so if he's denied relief without


knowing whether it's Federal or state, is there any


possibility that if it were refiled, and clearly named


Federal Constitution as the background, he would then


grant relief?


MR. MYERS: I'm not sure, Your Honor.  I don't


think so.


QUESTION: I don't see how it could possibly


happen.  If the rules are the same, he made a


conscientious examination, they claim, and said, you lose.

If he came back and added the words, cited some Federal


case, he'd still lose.  So why hasn't the state had a fair


opportunity to consider that claim and the interests of


Federal is in par not, why are they not accommodated by


that - by just saying, if you - if you made a claim that's


clearly Federal on its facts and you've had a chance to


decide it, why - why shouldn't that - that not count - be


sufficient exhaustion?


MR. MYERS: Well, because we think at - again,


Your Honor, we think - not only do I still feel the


authority issue, very respectfully, is important, but also


our whole approach toward fair presentation of Federal


claims places a choice on the petitioner to make as to


whether or not to assert a Federal claim.


QUESTION: General Myers, doesn't the burden on


the habeas court have anything to do with this?  If - if


this hypothesis is adopted, the habeas court will have to,


I suppose, consider the facts and determine whether that


statement of facts makes out a Federal claim or not, thing


one.  Thing two, the Federal habeas court will then have


to examine state court, a state law, to assure itself that


state law and Federal law, with regard to this matter, are


exactly the same.


And all of this is in order to save the habeas


petitioner what burden?  The burden of saying Federal

claim when he files his - his complaint.  What - does it


seem to you a close question who should bear that burden?


MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:  - petitioners represented by counsel


in Oregon?  Is this - are - is counsel regularly appointed


for Federal habeas petitioners?

alone?

QUESTION: Was that done here?


MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor.


QUESTION: And did the state point that out


MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor.  In the - in the


habeas proceedings in the district court, we focused


solely on the issue of the adequacy of that - of the


identification of the claim as Federal in nature.


QUESTION: Well, but if the petition contains no


facts, you wouldn't point that out?  I - I don't


understand.


MR. MYERS: Your Honor -


QUESTION: Why wouldn't you say, but there are no


facts? 


MR. MYERS: Your Honor, in this case, we made a


choice to concentrate or focus on the issue of the - of


the sufficiency of the - of the identification of the


claim as Federal, and we maintained that as the focus and


that was the - the focus of the petition, of course, for -

the assumption that facts were presented when indeed none


were?


MR. MYERS: In this case, yes, Your Honor,


inasmuch as we have not appealed from - we have not made


that an issue below and appealed from it. 

We have asked


for review solely confined to the issue of the adequate -


the adequacy of the - of the sufficiency of the - of the


identification of the claim as Federal in nature.  If I


could -

QUESTION: May I - may I go back to the question


QUESTION: Just to make it clear where - where


your - what your rule is, the very asset Justice O'Connor


said, does it suffice if you cite a constitutional


provision, a case, a - a formulation.  And then we had


another discussion, but that was only part of your test,


because you also, I take it, assert that you - that the


petitioner must set forth the factual basis for its claim


- for his claim? 


MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: So that that's a two-part test.  It -


and it seems to me that in some cases it's going to be


fairly obvious what the facts are and in some cases it's


fairly obvious what the legal standard is, and depending. 


In the case that Justice Stevens puts, where he alleges

just the facts that his - that his lawyer was not even a


lawyer and - and indicates why it was ineffective, but -


but doesn't cite a Federal provision, it seems to me any


judge knows you have to have adequate assistance of


counsel under the Sixth Amendment, and that in the case


put by Justice Stevens, it is simply a formalistic


requirement.


Now, it may be that you're going to say,


although it's formalistic in some cases, it's necessary to


run the habeas system that we have this rule.  Is - is -


is the latter your position?


MR. MYERS: It - well, Your Honor, we don't -


yes.  We don't believe that it's formalistic inasmuch as a


claim so described could equally describe a violation of,


conceivably, I suppose, state statute, but certainly a


state constitution.  And I think it's at the very heart of


the whole notion of - of - of Federalism or comity, as


applied in habeas, that this Court enforce the reality


that we have state constitutions that are offering


protections -


QUESTION: We certainly enforce it with respect


to people raising claims in our Court.  We require very


specifically that they refer to a specific source of


Federal law before we will even decide it.


MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.  I would -

 QUESTION: How does the case decided, the


Fitzgerald case, which is cited in page 34 of the red


brief, it was just last term, when - when this Court said


that the Court would consider a state court decision as


relying on Federal grounds sufficient to support this


Court's jurisdiction, if under the state's decisional law,


the state and the Federal constitutional claim are treated


identically, the content of the right is treated


identically.


That - that decision from just last term says,


you've got a claim out there and it's a constitutional


claim and the Federal law and state law are identical, the


content of the law is identical, we will treat it as


Federal.  That was a decision just from last term.


MR. MYERS: I - I may have misunderstood the -


that interpretation, Your Honor, because I thought this


was still a very much open question as to whether -


QUESTION: This was not in the habeas context.


MR. MYERS: Yes, I understand.  And in the habeas


context -


QUESTION: And it - what I read to you is - is


from the decision itself.  The Court will consider a state


court decision as relying upon Federal grounds sufficient


to support the Court's jurisdiction.  That is, when the


state courts have in other cases declared that they will

apply the same analysis in considering the state


constitutional claim as the Federal courts would, I think


in that case it was equal protection.  But the - the Court


- that was critical to the Court's deciding that case last


term.


MR. MYERS: Well, if I am understanding it


correctly, Your Honor, I would very much advocate for the


Court not extending - I'm understanding it correctly - not


extending that - that doctrine or view, if you will, into


the habeas context. 


QUESTION: It had to do with jurisdiction, not


with pleading.  There was pled in the case a violation of


Federal law.  There was no doubt that the person before


the Court was claiming a violation of Federal law.  What


the case held was that there is jurisdiction because the -


we will assume that the state court made a ruling on a


question of Federal law where it relies on state law that


looks to Federal cases.  That's quite different from the


pleading question that you have before you.


QUESTION: May I ask you what you understand to


be the purpose of the exhaustion requirement?


MR. MYERS: It is, Your Honor, to assure that the


states have a meaningful first response - opportunity to


consider Federal attacks on their convictions, and to -


QUESTION: Do you - do you think the hypothetical

that I gave you would give a state court a meaningful


opportunity to decide the Federal question?


MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: Then it would seem we would follow the


exhaustion requirement is satisfied.


MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: May I go back to the question of


appointment of counsel?  Is counsel routinely appointed


for state petitioners in the state courts of Oregon -


MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor, by statute -


QUESTION:  - for state habeas -


MR. MYERS: In the post-conviction relief


process, yes.


QUESTION: Okay.


MR. MYERS: Always, by statute.  There is one


further reason also I'd like to mention to the Court for


not adopting a view that generally says, if a state


court's interpretation of a particular assertion of - of a


- of a right, and the Federal interpretation are the same,


therefore the Federal claim has been presented


automatically.  And that is that I think that represents a


very transitory rule for the Court to adopt inasmuch as


the state interpretation of its own law could change at a


given point in time, and thus, in a given jurisdiction,


what was congruent ceases to be congruent.

 This Court's interpretation of Federal law could


change so that, again, where there might have been


congruencies before, they - they have now become


incongruent, and -


QUESTION: Don't you think it's likely that


Federal judges sitting in the state would be aware of


those changes?


MR. MYERS: Yes, I think they would be aware of


them, Your Honor.  But also to come back to a point that


Justice Scalia made, it - there could be also renewed and


further issues as to whether there has been a change,


whether they are congruent or not congruent -


QUESTION: But are you thinking of changes that


are favorable to the claimant or favorable to the state?


MR. MYERS: Well, I think it could go either way,


Your Honor.


QUESTION: But certainly if it's favorable to the


claimant, it couldn't cause any harm.  It's only if you


make it narrower that it would make a difference.


MR. MYERS: Yes.


QUESTION: I guess in every case where the


Federal habeas court has some doubt whether a Federal


claim was raised, the Federal habeas court, that is, where


it is not explicitly stated, the Federal habeas court will


have to inquire into state law to see whether it is indeed

congruent with Federal law.  Isn't that right?


MR. MYERS: Yes, that's correct.  Any event, with


the present state of the law within the circuits, and in


light of the Ninth Circuit's decision, Your Honors, we


very much hope that this Court will take the opportunity


in this case to both reaffirm that it is the petitioner's


responsibility to set forth, to choose and to set forth


his Federal claim as Federal, and that you will provide


further guidance as to how that must occur.  That furthers


clarification can certainly work to serve all the


interests that are at stake here, a true meaningful


opportunity for the states to be able to - to have the


first opportunity to decide the Federal questions.


It can reduce the amount of litigation that is


occurring around the exhaustion issue, and, I think - and


- and save precious resources, and I think, Your Honors,


that a clear, further - a further clarification of the


rule will actually serve the interests of petitioners by


make - bringing meritorious Federal claims to - to


decision more - sooner and more consistently.


QUESTION: What was wrong with the Ninth


Circuit's position, at least with respect to the


intermediate appellate court?  That is, it's reviewing a


decision of a court below.  That court below has Federal


written all over it.  Why isn't that a - a reasonable

assumption that the - that the intermediate appellate


court where there is jurisdiction as a matter of right,


it's reviewing a decision, it's bound to read that


decision?


MR. MYERS: Actually, Your Honor, in the petition


for review in Oregon, the decision of the court below is


included, but that in this case was a summary affirmance


of the - of the trial court's decision.


QUESTION: Well, you're talking about the court -


the Supreme Court of Oregon.  I think Justice Ginsburg was


asking about the Oregon Court of Appeals.


MR. MYERS: Yes, that's -


QUESTION: The - the appeal from the trial court


to the court of appeals.


MR. MYERS: I beg your pardon, Your Honor.  Well,


insofar as that stage is concerned, the - the - the papers


that were submitted to the court of appeals did not advise


or tell that court that a Federal question was being


raised, a Federal claim was being raised.  There was


simply a claim of inadequate assistance of appellate


counsel, but there was no indication that - whether that


was a state claim, state law-based claim or a Federal law-


based claim.


And both state and Federal law-based claims of


inadequate assistance of appellate counsel had been - had

QUESTION: Very well.


Mr. Balske, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS BALSKE


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. BALSKE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


We have a narrow question of fair presentation


here, and it isn't a great effort for the courts, I don't


believe, in Mr. Reese's case, to go searching to find that


he did fairly present.  We start out by going to the PCR


petition itself, which alleges the violation both under


the state and Federal Constitution.  It mentions the Sixth


and Fourteenth Amendments.  And then, when the -


QUESTION: You're talking about the trial court,


correct?


MR. BALSKE: Yes, I am.  And when -


QUESTION: You have to - you agree you have to


present the claim all the way up through the state?


MR. BALSKE: I do, I do.  And when the trial


court decides it, we go right into the Oregon clear

statement rule.  Oregon post-conviction is designed to let


the appellate courts know the basis of those trial court


rulings, so we have the clear statement rule under


138.640.


QUESTION: Well, there were - there were two -


there was a petition and an amended position, as I recall. 


MR. BALSKE: Correct.


QUESTION: Correct me if I'm wrong.


MR. BALSKE: You're right.


QUESTION: And the - the original petition did


not recite the - the factual basis to support the claim. 


That was only in the amended petition, and the amended


petition was not - the amended petition, I - I take it,


please correct me if I'm wrong, was - was the one in which


the allegation of conflict of interest and the precise


reasons for it was cited.  That seems to drop out of the


case because then it's not - that amended petition, which


contained the factual basis, is - is not incorporated or


cited to the court of - the state court of appeals.


MR. BALSKE: Well, well the - the way it works in


PCR is the court, under the pleadings, decides the case


based on the first amended petition.  That's the one that


states the legal basis of the claim under the Federal and


state Constitution.  That's the one that the judgment of


the state trial court made and - and relied on.

 So under the clear statement rule, then, when it


made its decision and cited a Federal ground, under


Oregon's clear statement rule, we have a decision on


Federal grounds at that -


QUESTION: No, you're - you're - you refer to a


clear statement rule.  Is that a rule of Oregon law -


MR. BALSKE: Yes.


QUESTION: - or a rule of Federal law?


MR. BALSKE: That is a rule of Oregon law, and


that -


QUESTION: And what does - what does it - what


does that - what's the case for it, and what does it say?


MR. BALSKE: It's not a case, it's a


statute. 


QUESTION: Okay.


MR. BALSKE: It's 138.640.  It's at the state's


brief in the appendix at page 4, and it reads as follows,


quote, the order making final disposition of the petition


shall state clearly the grounds upon which the cause was


determined, and whether a state or Federal question, or


both, was presented and decided.


And in Mr. Reese's case, the trial court


followed that rule and filed a memorandum of opinion that


cited that its decision of the ineffectiveness claim was


on Federal grounds only.  And then Mr. - then Mr. Reese

appeals.


QUESTION: Did - did - did the order of the


Oregon trial court specify the facts upon which the


Federal claim was -


MR. BALSKE: No.


QUESTION: - was based?


MR. BALSKE: No.  But again, that's not before


the Court in the issue presented, and that issue was


waived by the state in the Ninth Circuit.  They abandoned


any position that Mr. Reese's claim wasn't sufficiently


factually based, and we're presented with the question of


fair presentation, whether or not he indicated -


QUESTION: Well, all right, but it wasn't, okay? 


I mean, I'm in an appeals court, I've a lot to do -


MR. BALSKE: Right.


QUESTION: - thousands of cases.  There are


judgments of all sorts below. 

I don't read the judgments


when I have thousands of cases.  I look and see, what is


this individual complaining about?


MR. BALSKE: Right.


QUESTION: So I look to see what the arguments


are that he's making that the lower court made a mistake. 


Now, if I was in the Supreme Court of Oregon, and I


thought, but I lost this, that you shouldn't have to


present it in the Supreme Court of Oregon, but the rule is

you do.


MR. BALSKE: Right.


QUESTION: All right?  Well, I'm there as a busy


judge, I look at it, he makes no mention of the Federal


claim, goodbye, that's the end of it.  I don't look up at


the Federal claim.  So - what - what - why - how could we


hold to the contrary?


MR. BALSKE: There - let - let me help you there. 


If you will turn to the - page 44 of the joint appendix,


what you're going to find there is the petition for review


to the Oregon Supreme Court.  And when you get to page 44,


and 44 and 45 across, what you see is it follows the


standard form, it's in proper form, nothing more.


But when you turn the page, as a busy judge


you're scanning, as you're talking about, and you look and


you say, what's it about, is this a state case or a


Federal case, look on the first page, 46, index of


authorities, constitutions.  Only one, the Federal


Constitution, four constitutional amendments cited, Fifth,


Sixth, Eight, Fourteenth -


QUESTION: But all that tells me is that


somewhere in this brief they're cited, that's the table of


authorities they cite.  That isn't what the argument is. 


MR. BALSKE: And - well -


QUESTION: So if I'm going to look to see what

the argument is, I'll try to turn the page and -


MR. BALSKE: A judge -


QUESTION: - where does it say he's making the


argument -


MR. BALSKE: You're not going to look for an


argument because you're an Oregon Supreme Court judge, and


under the Oregon Supreme Court rule, I'm - yeah,


9.05(4)(A)(v), the petitioner only presents a brief


argument if he wants to, it's optional.  You don't put


argument into a petition for a review, so -


QUESTION: Do you have to have your reasons why


they're wrong and so on?


MR. BALSKE: Yes, and in -


QUESTION: Where is that?


MR. BALSKE: - that's where we turn to the next


page, 47, statement of legal questions presented on


review.  We - we see on the page across from the Federal


Constitution, ineffectiveness - ineffective assistance of


both trial court and appellate court counsel.  The next


paragraph, statement of reasons for reversal of court of


appeals.  Again we see ineffective assistance of both


trial court and appellate court counsel.


So, it - we're scanning it, we're busy, we're


just trying to decide whether we're going to review the


case.  We're not deciding it on the merits.  We've got a

Federal case.  We've got a Federal issue.  It's presented


by Mr. Reese.


QUESTION: I see.


QUESTION: I - I couldn't possibly tell from this


what - what the case was about, other than some free-


floating ineffective assistance of counsel case.


MR. BALSKE: And that -


QUESTION: And - and are you saying that Oregon


rules make it optional as to whether he's going to tell me


what the case is about?


MR. BALSKE: Yeah, what - well, whether you're


going to brief it, whether you're going to present legal


argument.  It's optional under -


QUESTION: But there are no facts.  I mean, if


you're in the Federal habeas court, why aren't you just


out right there for having no facts?


MR. BALSKE: Because the state waived that


defense in this case.  I'm - I - that's just the way -


QUESTION: But it - but the point is -


MR. BALSKE: I'm sorry.


QUESTION: - as I understand my colleague's


question, if the judge sees that there are no facts set


out, why doesn't the judge just say, you're out of here?


MR. BALSKE: The judge might say that, but the


judge would say that in the context of a Federal question,

a Federal issue presented of ineffective assistance of

QUESTION: But think he would say that on the


basis of Oregon procedural law that -


MR. BALSKE: Well -


QUESTION:  - you - you just haven't said


anything.


MR. BALSKE: Well, I don't - well, it's


conjecture what they would have decided or thought. 


What's critical here is what was presented, the question


today is what was presented versus -


QUESTION: Okay.  What - what - what is the


hardship for a - for a petitioner in PCR Oregon -


MR. BALSKE: Sure.


QUESTION: - to either say, I'm relying on


section, you know, article XIV of the United States


Constitution, or I'm relying on some Federal case.  I


mean, that - that just seems a very minimal requirement.


MR. BALSKE: Well -


QUESTION: What's - what's hard about that?


MR. BALSKE: Well -


QUESTION: Could - can you answer that?


MR. BALSKE: I - I can answer it by saying that


the prisoners are pretty ignorant.  Their lawyers in the


state post-conviction system, bless their souls, are not

the sharpest lawyers in the world.


QUESTION: Well, you - how sharp do you have to


be to figure that out?


MR. BALSKE: Well, tell you what, let me give you


the perfect example in this case.  Turn to page 42 of the


state's brief for its application of the rule.  Here's how


sharp you have to be.  Now, I think if you read the cover


of the brief, we see that five lawyers, including the


attorney general of Oregon have -


QUESTION: No, where - are - are you reading from


some - in the brief?


MR. BALSKE: Yes.  I'm sorry.  Please look at the


top and then look at number IIA and read their language,


alert the state court to the Federal legal source of the


claim by, A, citing to the Sixth Amendment, quote, my


appellate attorney violated my right to effective


assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment.  I'm


sorry, you didn't pick that up.  It's page 42 -


QUESTION: Go ahead.


MR. BALSKE: If Mr. Reese followed the formula


written by the attorney general, he would fail their test,


because the right to ineffective assistance of appellate


counsel comes under the Fourteenth Amendment, not the


Sixth Amendment.  But the state's attorney generals, who


are writing the test for you, can't even get it right.

How is a poor indigent prisoner going to know how to say


the right number?  I mean -


QUESTION: Touche.


(Laughter.)


MR. BALSKE: I - I think, Justice O'Connor -


QUESTION: I - I think it's - it's - it's common


to, you know, you've heard of the incorporation doctrine,


which is that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates and


applies to the states the first ten amendments, or at


least portions of the first ten amendments. 


MR. BALSKE: But -


QUESTION: So it is not inaccurate to say that -


that it's a Sixth Amendment right, which has been applied


to the states via the Fourteenth.


MR. BALSKE: I thought when we're talking about


appellate counsel, though, the Sixth Amendment doesn't


cover it, because the Sixth Amendment doesn't give you the


right to effective counsel on your appeal, only at trial. 


And the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and due


process are what actually cover them.  So, if - if you're


claiming ineffective assistance of appellate, not trial,


appellate counsel, it is Fourteenth Amendment, it's not


Sixth Amendment.


QUESTION: What would happen if the Oregon


constitution happened to contain the right in the same

number amendment, like the Sixth was - they were both


Sixth Amendment.  Then you have to say Sixth Amendment of

MR. BALSKE: Well, the - it - the trouble here,


the heart -


QUESTION: Or is this - is this one of the ones


that it doesn't contain it in the Oregon constitution


Sixth Amendment so this is one of the ones that, by


necessity, must refer to.


MR. BALSKE: No.  This isn't one of those,


because that's at article I, section 11, it doesn't.  So


this isn't the easy case, this is a -


QUESTION: But the - the court of appeals -


MR. BALSKE:  - tougher case.


QUESTION: - thought that the only way in which


this claim was properly presented was if they adopted, the


court of appeals adopted the rule, that the state court is


deemed to have read and understood the proceedings in the


trial court.  Am I - am I right about -


MR. BALSKE: I think they said that and -


QUESTION: - that formulation of the rule?


MR. BALSKE: I think they said that, and I don't


think you have to go that far to find that Mr. Reese


fairly presented his claim.


QUESTION: Well, do you defend that as the test?

QUESTION: - articulated test?


MR. BALSKE: I do not defend the Ninth Circuit's


test.  I only defend the judgment.


QUESTION: In your -


MR. BALSKE: I only say to you he fairly


presented the claim in this case.


QUESTION: Right.  In - in your opinion, as a


lawyer who, I take it, is involved in these things -


MR. BALSKE: Yes.


QUESTION: - is there really a big problem of


differences among the lower circuits - among the lower


courts?  To what extent do we have to find a rule?  I take


it the rule now is called fair presentation?


MR. BALSKE: Correct.


QUESTION: And there are dozens of ways it could


be done.  And so the court is just like - supposed to look


at the individual circumstance, say was it done, was it


not done?  Here you think it was done because the whole


thing's two pages, they refer to the Federal Constitution


in the - in the citation of authorities, and they have no

particular, et cetera.  All right.  Now, is there a


problem or isn't there a problem among the circuits in


applying this fair presentation test?


MR. BALSKE: Well, if the - the - there are


differences in the circuits, so I can't disagree -


QUESTION: Is it - are they real differences in


terms of what counts or -


MR. BALSKE: Well, I -


QUESTION:  - are they just differences in -


MR. BALSKE: - I don't think they are in the


sense of, although I know this Court likely views the


Ninth Circuit as quote, unquote, a liberal circuit of


sorts, when you read their opinion here, they were being


very conservative.  They're saying Duncan v. Henry


applies.  Under Duncan you must state it at every level of


the proceedings.  I mean, they -


QUESTION: But that - that's a Ninth Circuit


case, isn't it, the - Duncan against Henry?


MR. BALSKE: Yes, it is.  It is.


QUESTION: It's not a case from this Court?


MR. BALSKE: No, I was talking about -

sustain their judgment was to adopt this rule of - that


the appellate court has the duty, or is presumed to have


understood what happened in the trial court.  You seem to


agree that your case doesn't have to turn on that.  The


Ninth Circuit, I thought, said that the case turned on


that proposition.  Otherwise, it was not going to make it.


And - and I just have to - I can't speak for my


colleagues -


MR. BALSKE: Right.


QUESTION: - but the - the petition that you read


me at the appendix, where that just cites the Federal


constitutional provision and then says ineffective of


counsel - ineffective assistance of counsel - does not


give the court any clue as to what it's supposed to do -


MR. BALSKE: Well -


QUESTION: - other than to review a record.


MR. BALSKE: Well - sorry.


QUESTION: And - and - and I had thought the


exhaustion requirement was designed to give the court some


assistance in determining whether or not it showed -


should spend more time with the case in order to review


the record, in other words, said that counsel had a


conflict of interest because of marriage or something.  It


would have been - it would have - it would have been


triggered - a - a - a more specific review by the district

court.  And it just - by the - by the state appellate


court - and it just didn't have that information.


MR. BALSKE: Well, what the purpose of the


exhaustion rule is to give him a fair opportunity to


decide it.  And when you're talking about petitions for


review, it's a little different because it's not your


brief on the merits where they're actually deciding -


QUESTION: But we get thousands of cases around


here that just says Fifth Amendment, ineffective


assistance of counsel.  That gives us very, very little


help.


MR. BALSKE: Well -


QUESTION: Sixth Amendment.


MR. BALSKE: - here - here we're talking about


ineffective assistance of counsel.  We're talking about it


with an Oregon statute that required the Oregon court to


even tell the appellate courts whether it had been decided


under the state or the Federal Constitution.  And here


they said this was decided under Federal.  And then when


he uses ineffective, I know that that's less than


satisfying, but in Oregon too, if you look in the state's


brief, I think, at page 4, footnote 5, what you're going


to find there is Oregon's - the State of Oregon's position


on what a inmate means when he says ineffectiveness.


There it says that in applying article I,

section 11 of the Oregon constitution, quote, Oregon


courts often refer to inadequate assistance of counsel


instead of ineffective assistance of counsel, the term


usually employed by the state and Federal courts in


applying the analogous provision of the Federal


Constitution.


So as the Oregon courts are reading the


pleadings, the definition we're looking at, ineffective


assistance of counsel, the term usually employed by the


state and Federal courts.  We're giving, factual parts


aside, which aren't with this case at this point, legal


only, the Oregon courts were fairly presented with the


Federal question because -


QUESTION: Well, it seems to me that argument


that you're making now that inadequate is the buzzword for


a state claim, ineffective for a Federal claim, is at


least in tension with your argument that - that in - with


respect to ineffective assistance of counsel, the state -


the content of the state standard and - is identical to


the Federal.  So these labels don't mean anything if the


content is identical, so how -


MR. BALSKE: Right.  Well, I - all I'm, I guess I


inartfully stated it.  I - the position I wanted to


convey, and I didn't, is that we started out with a clear


Federal claim, and when he used ineffective twice more in

his appeals, he did nothing at all to dispel anybody of


the fact that it was a Federal case.  It started out


Federal and he had allegations under state and Federal


Constitution.  It got decided Federal and then he said


ineffectiveness.  He gave no indication that he was


narrowing the case at all.


And a good contrast is another Ninth Circuit en


banc case, Peterson, because Peterson raised it just like


Mr. Reese initially, under both constitutions.  He raised


it again that way in the appellate court.  But when he got


to his petition for review, he indicated that, to the


Oregon Supreme Court, that he was going on the state


constitution, because he only said in his petition for


review that this violated article I, section 11 of the


Oregon constitution.


That's a contrast, and much - and he, as the


Ninth Circuit held, did not exhaust his state remedies,


because he didn't give the Oregon Supreme Court the fair


opportunity, because what he did was he took their eyes


and led them over to the state constitution.  And Mr.


Reese didn't do that.


QUESTION: Well, if you - you say that the Ninth


Circuit approach to this was wrong, which - which seems to


be anchored in, if it's clear that the court of first


instance relied on the Federal ground, that stays with the

case all the way up.  You - you reject that, or you say,


you - you are asking us to affirm the judgment, not that


reasoning.  What is your reasoning?  What is enough?


MR. BALSKE: Sure.  My reasoning is that it's


fairly presented when a state inmate clearly articulates


it under the Federal Constitution, and then continues to


appeal that judgment without indicating in any way


whatsoever that he's relying on anything but the Federal


Constitution.


QUESTION: But may I -


QUESTION: Then I don't see how that differs from


the Ninth Circuit -


QUESTION: That's the Ninth Circuit.


QUESTION: - because you have to start with the


court of first instance, and you seem to be saying that


the court of first instance relies on a Federal ground


that stays with the case.


MR. BALSKE: That - I - that's true.  I agree


with that portion of it.  I guess maybe I -


QUESTION: I thought you said before that you


were not defending the - the Ninth Circuit's approach.


MR. BALSKE: I -


QUESTION: Now you tell me you are.  I thought


you were relying upon the statement in the - in the brief


to the supreme court that he was relying upon - upon the

Federal Constitution.


MR. BALSKE: That's correct.


QUESTION: And I was going to ask you if you're


relying on that now, why didn't you rely on it in your


brief in opposition?  The question presented by the state


was, does a state prisoner alert the state's highest court


that he is raising a Federal claim when, in that court, he


neither cites a specific provision of the Federal


Constitution nor cites at least one authority that has


decided the claim on a Federal basis?  Why - why didn't -


MR. BALSKE: I did -


QUESTION:  - you respond to that -


MR. BALSKE: I did, but I -


QUESTION: - by simply saying the question is not


presented because, in fact, he did cite a specific


provision of the Constitution? 


MR. BALSKE: I did, but I didn't -


QUESTION: I mean, we're wasting our time here if


- if you want us to decide whether this brief -


MR. BALSKE: It's -


QUESTION: - you know, contains the - the Sixth


Amendment or not.  The question we granted cert on is,


does he alert it when he neither - neither cites a


specific provision of the Federal Constitution nor cites


at least one authority?  I - I mean -

 MR. BALSKE: I understand.


QUESTION: What - we're just spinning our wheels


QUESTION: You - you said you did raise that in


MR. BALSKE: But, yeah -


QUESTION: Where?


MR. BALSKE: - it's argued in -


QUESTION: I need to go back to it.


MR. BALSKE: It's in section III of my brief.


QUESTION: I've just looked at it.  I - I didn't


see it.


MR. BALSKE: Okay.


QUESTION: I didn't see it presented very


clearly.  It seems to me -


QUESTION: All right.  Anyway, what you're asking


is - that's why I started at the beginning.  I thought the


question was - I thought what the Ninth Circuit did was


cite a case called Lyons, and in Lyons they say you do


have to either cite a particular provision of the Federal


Constitution or a case that's clearly a Federal case.  And


then they held that the brief you pointed out to me did


not do that.  Then they said, but anyway, that brief is


good enough because in the lower courts or other courts


they had cited the Federal Constitution explicitly.

 Now on that question, I would think they're


wrong, aren't they?  Because, as I started out, you can't


expect judges to start going back and filing - looking


through all the briefs they filed in the lower courts, or


the opinions below.


MR. BALSKE: Well, I -


QUESTION: That was, I thought, the question.


MR. BALSKE: Well -


QUESTION: And on that question, do you - what do


you want to say?  I mean, if you're -


MR. BALSKE: Well, I guess what I want to say is


this.  I think - if the rule that I'm - I'm not


necessarily espousing a rule, I'm trying to say that my


client, Mr. Reese, fairly presented.  But in saying that


Mr. Reese fairly presented, I don't think that our


approach is going to place a great burden on the courts by


any stretch, because all you have to look at is his


pleading in the state court that started it, where he says


Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment.  Then you just look at his


brief in the court of appeals and his petition for review,


and the answer is there.  And -


QUESTION: So - so - so now you're - you're -


what you - in order to win your case, you're going to have


to give us a standard, and your standard is, it seems to


me, that state appellate courts are bound to look at the

pleadings in the lower courts.


MR. BALSKE: I guess you're seeing my focus being


back in the state courts, and I'm looking at Federal


court.  I'm looking at when the petitioner files his


petition and the state steps forward and says failure to


exhaust.  Petitioner's counsel then has the burden of


coming forward and saying, take a look at what was in the


briefs and what was presented, not what was in the minds


of the state courts when they looked at them -


QUESTION: No, but the exhaustion rule -


MR. BALSKE: - but what did he present?


QUESTION: - depends upon whether or not the


state appellate courts had fair notice of the claim.


MR. BALSKE: Yes.


QUESTION: And that's - that's what we're trying


to discuss here and -


QUESTION: That sounds -


QUESTION: - and it - and - and the - and the


only way you can save your case, in the posture that comes


to us, as I see it, is that that state appellate court is


bound to look at the pleadings in the - in the court of


first instance.


MR. BALSKE: Well, what we have here -


QUESTION: And - and that is a rule.  I mean -


MR. BALSKE: Well - well, here's -

 QUESTION: - you - you - if you're going to save


your judgment, we're going to have to do it with a rule. 


MR. BALSKE: Well, and I think with the rule,


here's - here's the caveat to the rule, so to speak, and


it's that comity goes both ways.  In other words, we're


respecting the state courts have given him the


opportunity, but we're also going to respect the state's


courts own rules and statutes that they use when they're


looking at petitions and appeals.  And here we're looking


at Oregon.  When you look at Oregon, we turn the page to


Oregon, we have the statute that I read early - earlier,


the plain statement, clear statement rule.  So -


QUESTION: But that just goes to the trial


court's judgment, doesn't it?


MR. BALSKE: Well, that goes to the - the -


specifying the basis of the judgment in the trial court -


QUESTION: Yeah.


MR. BALSKE: - whether it's a state or a Federal


issue.


QUESTION: Yeah.


MR. BALSKE: And in this case, in his written


opinion, he does that.


QUESTION: But how does - how does that bear on


the appeal process?


MR. BALSKE: And then in the appeal process, I'm

Court was on notice by his petition, I mean, the petition


for review itself -

confused now, because I think I just -

know whether you are.

Circuit if you're saying the following.  Let me tell you


what I think you're saying and you tell me -


MR. BALSKE: Yeah.


QUESTION: - whether I'm right.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: At the court of appeals level, we


don't need the Ninth Circuit rule because the court of


appeals was reviewing a trial court judgment including


findings and statement of law and there it was right in


the statement of law referred to, Federal.  Number two, we


don't need the Ninth Circuit rule when we get to the


Oregon Supreme Court because we've got a petition and the


petition says Federal, refers specifically to four Federal


amendments, doesn't refer to any state court, any state


law or any state constitution.  So you don't need the


Ninth Circuit rule for that purpose.  Is that what you're


saying?


MR. BALSKE: That's what I'm saying.


QUESTION: Okay.

between the state rule on inadequate assistance of counsel


and the Federal rule on the ineffective assistance of


counsel?


you want -


MR. BALSKE: Well, yes, in this sense of - did


QUESTION: Well, if there's a difference, would


your client not have had the obligation to - to exhaust


the state rule as well as the Federal rule?  Because that


was a remedy for the basic wrong you're complaining of.


MR. BALSKE: I guess I didn't follow your


question.  Could I ask you to repeat it?


QUESTION: Are inadequate assistance as a matter


of state law the same as -


MR. BALSKE: Right.


QUESTION: - ineffective assistance as a matter


of Federal law?


MR. BALSKE: Well, at the trial level, trial


ineffectiveness, they are different clearly.  They have a


test that's called inadequate for state counsel.  They


call it ineffective under Strickland -


QUESTION: It is just a difference in names or a


difference in substance?

MR. BALSKE:  - now we're talking about appellate


ineffectiveness.


QUESTION: Yeah.


MR. BALSKE: They've got one test that was


discussed during earlier questions, and what they do is


they interchangeably use the words ineffective and


inadequate.  They don't use any one term all the time, but


there's just one test.  That's Oregon law.

 QUESTION: Where -


MR. BALSKE: Well, I think it will be in - I did


it in three parts, and the third part would have been that


-


QUESTION: This is the brief in opposition -


QUESTION: The brief in opposition -


QUESTION: - to certiorari.


QUESTION: - to the petition for cert.


MR. BALSKE: Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.  I'm not even


thinking.


QUESTION: Once I've granted -


QUESTION: It's orange.


QUESTION: - on - on this question, it's too late


to tell me the question is irrelevant.


MR. BALSKE: I'm sorry.


QUESTION: I - I like to know it's irrelevant


before I vote to grant cert.


MR. BALSKE: Right.  I - I, you know, I honestly


don't remember what I argued at all in that brief.  I


haven't looked at that in preparing for this and I


apologize, but I -


QUESTION: If - can you tell - tell me, if I were


to accept your position about the Ninth Circuit rule, how


does it differ from what I wrote in dissent when I thought


that we - you - you shouldn't have to go to the supreme

court of the state, if you - if you remember? If you don't


remember, that's all right.


MR. BALSKE: I mean, I know that -


QUESTION: I mean, what's bothering me about it


is it sounds like a reasonable position, but it also


sounds like a position I agreed with in dissent, which


means it isn't the law, the opposite is the law.


MR. BALSKE: Well, at - I don't disagree that


O'Sullivan says that it's got to be presented to the


highest court of the state. 

And my position is simply


that he did so in this case.


QUESTION: If there had been an - an objection


preserved in the Ninth Circuit that whatever else, this


doesn't tell us what the facts were, would not that have


been a - a ground for saying you didn't exhaust?


MR. BALSKE: That would have been a bigger


problem for me than this problem, yes, because although he


said, and part of his saying was under the Oregon Balfour


procedure when he didn't have a lawyer, he said, my lawyer


and I disagreed on what issues to raise.  One thing that


Mr. Reese didn't say factually was what those issues were,


and that would be my problem if their position were that


factually it wasn't clear enough.


QUESTION: So - so they - they have abandoned an


objection one - one would think would be the logical first

one, he doesn't have any facts, out the door. 


MR. BALSKE: Yes, I - that's true.  They did


abandon it.


QUESTION: Do we have to ignore that too?


MR. BALSKE: I think you should, and I've argued


in my brief that you should because they dropped it from


the case and abandoned it, and because the only issue


presented is the issue of whether or not he fairly


presented it.  So I would espouse that, whether you have


to or not, obviously your decision.


QUESTION: But if this - if this Court is going


to give any guidance, certainly that should be the - the


first one, shouldn't it?


MR. BALSKE: Well sure.  The first piece -


QUESTION: So, what your case is about -


MR. BALSKE: - and - and I think that is fair


presentation law.  You have to supply sufficient facts and


the law upon which you rely.  Here they didn't object to


the insufficiency of facts, but the rule wouldn't be any


different than it was before under Picard.


If there are no more questions, thank you very


much.


MR. CHIEF JUSTICE: Thank you, Mr. Balske.


General Myers, you have three minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. HARDY MYERS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. MYERS: Your Honor, so two quick comments or


points.  First, this case illustrates the fallacy of any


kind of doctrine which says that a appellate court can


tell what issues have been chosen to be asserted to it,


put before it, by going back and looking at the decision


of a - of a lower court.  Here, the trial court in Oregon


disposed of one of the Federal inappellate assistance of


counsel claims, citing Jones against Barnes, but it had


before it state law claims of inappellate - ineffective


assistance of counsel, as well as Federal.  The trial


court didn't mention the state claims, but they were all


dismissed as well by the judgment that was ultimately


entered at the trial court level.


So both state and Federal claims were dismissed. 


You couldn't tell by looking at the trial court judgment


what the - what the prisoner was choosing to actually


assert among those dismissed claims at the court of


appeals level.  He could as well have been asserting his


dismissed state ineffective assistance of counsel claim.


QUESTION: General Myers, do you have any


response to the - to the new point raised - it was new to


me anyway - that - that this in fact, the Federal claim


was raised in the petition?

 MR. MYERS: No.  Yes, I do, Your Honor. 


QUESTION: What - what is that?  I'd really like


to know that.


MR. MYERS: It - at page 47-48 of the joint


appendix, which you may have already been referring to -


QUESTION: Yes.


MR. MYERS: - the petition for review is set


forth.  And if you go to the argument portion, Your Honor,


which is at the very - second paragraph of the argument


portion, I think that's going to be on page 48.


QUESTION: Yes.


MR. MYERS: You'll see the last - second sentence


of the second paragraph: Moreover, since petitioner


asserts he was coerced and threatened by counsel to waive


his right to trial by jury, petitioner believes his Fifth,


Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights have been -


QUESTION: I see, I see.


MR. MYERS: - have been violated.  So - so the


ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim was


specifically Federalized, if you will, and that's the -


that's the only place where those Federal citations


appear.


QUESTION: Okay.


MR. MYERS: Your Honors, again, the - the state


of the law in this area, we think, can fairly be described

as still disturbed, a term I used earlier, and we very


sincerely hope that this Court will use this case both in


relation to the Ninth Circuit decision to reaffirm that it


is the state petitioner, not the state courts, who have


the responsibility to assert - fairly present the claim,


and secondly, to go for further - and further clarify


specifically what state prisoners must do in order to


clearly indicate the Federal source of their claim -


QUESTION: If you prevail, I hope you're not


unhappy with what you get, because you're going to have


petitions in which there's a huge laundry list of cases. 


We have to then qualify that by saying there has to be a


fair and concise statement of the legal and the factual


basis for the claim.


MR. MYERS: Your Honor, indeed, the fact that


Federal - or that the Federal source of the claim is used


is not the end of the fair presentation issue, because


there's still going to be the ongoing requirement of


adequately identifying your substance of your claim, to


use the terminology of this Court, the - the legal theory


as well as the adequacy of the fact.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General


Myers.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
