 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next this morning in Case 07-512, Pacific Bell 
v. LinkLine Communications.

 Mr. Panner.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON PANNER
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. PANNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's 
decision because it asserts that this Court's holding in 
Trinko and principles regarding unilateral pricing 
decisions as explained in Brooke and elsewhere.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You are probably 

feeling pretty good about your chances since your 
opponent has given up, right?

 (Laughter.)
 MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, it is correct 

that this Court observed in Roberts that the 
Respondents' agreement that the legal position of the 
court below is incorrect, certainly should provide this 
Court great comfort in reversing the decision in the 
Ninth Circuit.  And, indeed, a decision on the merits 
here is important because the Ninth Circuit's decision

is harmful to consumers, deterring beneficial price cuts 
and sufficient particle integration.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Any question should 
we have about the Article III status of this aspect of 
the dispute?

 MR. PANNER:  No, Your Honor.  The parties' 
agreement on a point of law does not deprive this Court 
of jurisdiction in any way, and the parties remain 
adverse in this case.  The Respondents continue to 
pursue a section 2 claim, and the same intend to --
evidently intend to pursue the same relief.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you might be 
right, but, you know, with respect to standing we have 
held that that is an issue-by-issue inquiry, not a live 
case broadly conceived.

 MR. PANNER:  Well, in Laidlaw the Court said 

that it was for a particular type of relief, that the 
plaintiff had to establish standing, but that's not at 
issue here.  The Respondents continue to pursue a 
section 2 claim and pursue, evidently, the same type of 
relief based on the same course of conduct.

 I would also like to point out that 

Respondents, while conceding that the position of the 
Ninth Circuit was incorrect, have not clearly stated 
that they would not take advantage of a decision by this

Court affirming the Ninth Circuit.  And I think that 
that's important, because there really would be no 
reason for these Respondents to say that if for whatever 
reason the Court decided that the Ninth Circuit is 
right, that they would not go ahead and take advantage 
--

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought they asked to 
have the Ninth Circuit decision vacated.  They didn't 
ask us to affirm it.  They said vacate that decision is 
wrong.

 MR. PANNER:  That is right, 

Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that if this Court 
were to disagree -- for example, it is well established 
that the Solicitor General's confession of error, for 
example, or a State attorney general's confession of 
error does not bind this Court.  Indeed, a party's 
position with respect to the proper disposition of the 
case never binds the Court.

 So the Court certainly has the power to say, 
now that the case is properly before it:  We think that 
the Ninth Circuit got it right.

 Obviously, we don't think that that's what 

we think the Court should say; but, given that 
circumstance, if the Court, for whatever reason, were to 
affirm the Ninth Circuit, there would be nothing that

would bar the Respondents from taking advantage of that. 
Even though they said that that was a legal error, if 
that were the established law, there would be no reason 
for them not to pursue it.

 And I think that that's relevant, again, to 

the question whether the parties remain adverse for 
Article III purposes.  As a jurisdictional issue, the 
adversity of the parties with respect, even to the 
section 2 claim, even if intended to pursue it 
differently, the theory is sufficient.

 But the point I am making is simply to 
illustrate that adversity even with respect to the 
narrow legal issue remains, even though they are not 
contesting the proper -- contesting the proper 
disposition of that legal issue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When this comes up, we 

usually, if a -- if a party abandons a position in 
support of a decision, the court of appeals decision, we 
have appointed -- as you noted in your brief, we have 
appointed a friend of the court to represent the 
position of the circuit.

 And here we don't have that.  We don't have 
anyone that we have appointed and say you presented the 
position.  You defend the position below.

 MR. PANNER:  Well, that's true, Your Honor,

but there is an amicus arguing before the Court today 
defending the Ninth Circuit's decision.  And there were 
two amicus briefs filed on that.  Had those not been 
filed, the Court could have sought additional help.  But 
the positions -- the arguments in favor of the Ninth 
Circuit decision had been put forward in the amicus 
brief, and there will be argument in support of the 
Ninth Circuit's decision today.

 And I think -- I think that the 

jurisdictional issue is answered by your question.  That 
is to say, the fact that the Court could appoint amicus 
shows that this Court retains Article III jurisdiction. 
And it's very important in this case for the Court to 
reach the merits of the decision and clearly to rule 
that there is no independent price-squeeze theory under 
Section 2 because recognition of such a theory, as in 
the Ninth Circuit's, decision is very -- very harmful to 
consumers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there any way in 
which the resolution of their price-squeeze claim would 
affect their Brooke Group Section 2 claim?

 MR. PANNER:  I think it could, Your Honor. 
In their brief they refer to the possibility that the 
wholesale price that was charged could be in some way a 
proxy for costs.  And this Court clearly stated that

there's a different issue as to whether a single 
economic unit is charging prices below cost; that the 
wholesale prices that may be charged are not an 
appropriate proxy.

 But I -- so, in that respect, I think that a 
clear declaration with respect to what is required -- I 
guess the distinction between the predatory-pricing 
theory of liability and a price-squeeze claim as 
recognized by the Ninth Circuit could have an impact.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I just clarify:  Are 
you arguing there is never a price-squeeze claim under 
Section 2?  In other words, are you challenging Judge 
Hand's reasoning in the Alcoa case?

 MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, I believe, I 
am challenging Judge Hand's reasoning in Alcoa.  I think 
that I would not go so far as to say that there would 
never be a situation in which a price squeeze, that is, 
an insufficient margin between wholesale and retail 
prices to allow a competitor to compete -- that that 
course of conduct could never support a claim under 
Section 2.

 But the basis for the claim would have to be 
that there was a -- a duty to deal -- or a duty to deal 
under Section 2, an antitrust duty to deal that was 
effectively being debased through that sort of pricing

conduct.  But --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Was there such a duty in 

the Alcoa case?

 MR. PANNER:  Well, I think that the Alcoa 

case was wrongly decided, Your Honor, in several 
respects.  The critical point about -- the first point 
about Alcoa is that the conduct that was at issue was 
said to be unlawful because it was an abuse of the power 
in the ingot market and not monopolization of the 
downstream market in sheet.

 And so what Judge Hand said was that that 

was unlawful.  But he expressed some doubt as to whether 
it was appropriate to treat it as an independent basis 
for -- or an independent wrong under section 2.

 But the notion that the abuse -- that 

charging too high a price at the wholesale level could 
be an independent section 2 wrong is quite inconsistent 
with what this Court said in -- in -- most recently in 
Trinko where it recognize --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So there is regulation 

involved there.  I mean, suppose you had no regulation 
at all involved.  Why couldn't you have a monopolist at 
the primary stage, say, ingot, and what that monopolist 
wants to do is to extend its power into the secondary 
stage, say, fabrication, in order to make it less likely

that there would be a new entries to attack its primary 
monopoly?  That would -- suppose you have those 
circumstances?  Perhaps they would be rare, but if you 
have them, wouldn't that set forth a Section 2 
violation?

 MR. PANNER:  It -- it -- it wouldn't, Your 
Honor, for the following reason:  That I think it is --
it is true that the -- the key point of the -- the basis 
upon which the question -- the question presented has 
been granted and upon which the analysis has to turn is 
that there is no duty to deal at all at the wholesale 
level.

 So that the ingot monopolist has no 

obligation to provide an ingot to a downstream rival. 
And that judgment is a judgment that it is not worth 
protecting downstream dependent competitors in order to 
promote the competitive process.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, that may be the 

assumption on this case, but that may not be the 
assumption on the next case.  And I understood you to be 
arguing that you wanted us to hold that at -- well, you 
wanted us to hold whether we are dealing with a 
regulatory case or in Justice Breyer's example, where 
there is -- where there is no independent regulation, 
that the greater includes the lesser; that A, there is

no duty to deal and therefore there is no obligation 
that can be violated under the antitrust laws by a price 
squeeze that does not rise to the level of predatory 
pricing.

 Is that your position?
 MR. PANNER:  Well, Justice Souter, trying to 

be clear about the relationship.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, the best way to do 

that is to start with a yes or no answer.  That way, so 
I know where you are going.

 MR. PANNER:  Thank you, Your Honor.  And I 

think that's not precisely our position.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. PANNER:  Our position is that in the 

absence of a duty to deal, one does not look at an 
allegation of insufficient margin as a potential section 
2 --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  But what I think we 
are trying to get at is, should we foresee a situation, 
with or without the regulatory participation of 
something like the agency here, in which there would be 
a duty to deal, which would support a price squeeze 
theory that did not amount to predatory pricing?

 MR. PANNER:  Your Honor, I don't think that 

the Court has to anticipate that.  I think what the

Court should say is that there are narrow circumstances 
as recognized in Trinko, where there may be a duty to 
deal under section 2.  And in that circumstance there 
may be conduct that constitutes a refusal to deal, even 
a constructive refusal to deal.  There is really -- to 
give a simple example, if a widget, if the downstream 
product costs $10 and a widget is made available for a 
million dollars, that is not really dealing at all.

 But the point is that the section -- the 
price squeeze piece of the allegation really does not 
add to the underlying question of what is the section 2 
duty that needs to be enforced.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's it -- I mean, 
now maybe you can get me off what I am thinking, but now 
it sounds that the answer to Justice Stevens's question 
is yes.  Now, I have, yes, overruled Judge Hand's 
opinion in Alcoa.  I always thought there were 
circumstances, whether true of Alcoa or not, where that 
did make out the claim, namely, the one I suggested.

 Well, it's quite a different battle if, in 
fact, the person whose injured, namely, the fabricator 
who is complaining, has a place to go, such as the FCC 
or the Alcoa regulatory agency, because under those 
circumstances, he has a place to complain that these 
prices are out of line.

But if there is no place to go, well, I'm 

suddenly -- I'm a little hesitant to overturn Alcoa 
under those circumstances, and the reason the duty to 
deal doesn't deal with it is we could come into an 
existing world where duty or no duty, there have been 
independent fabricators who for a long time have bought 
their ingot from this monopolist.

 MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, the answer to 

that is two-fold.  First of all, because there is no 
duty to deal, by assumption the producer of ingot, the 
alleged wholesale monopolist, has the privilege to 
withdraw the supply of that.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Then I would say that 

shouldn't be the law.  The reason it shouldn't be the 
law is because that ingot may, by either withdrawing or, 
in fact, raising his price way above a competitive level 
and charging just no room to remain in business, is 
trying to drive out possible new entrants into the ingot 
stage of the business.  And the fabricators are a number 
one out there as possibilities to break down the 
monopolist in ingot.

 And if that is the motive, as shown by the 

behavior, there should be a section 2 claim.  If you 
want to argue that straight on the merits, what's the 
answer to that argument?

MR. PANNER:  The answer to that argument, 

Your Honor, is the one that Trinko offers, is that it's 
very important in establishing the antitrust rules to 
recognize the incentive that those rules will create for 
investment and for innovation.

 If the monopolist is forced to share the 
benefit of the monopoly with downstream rivals on the 
basis there is potential entry, that is going to be a 
significant disincentive to innovation at the upstream 
level.  And the establishment of clear rules, ones that 
recognize that in the general run of cases there is not 
going to be harm and recognizes that the very scrutiny 
of that conduct will deter beneficial conduct and 
beneficial innovation and beneficial investment by the 
upstream monopolist, that recognition is the one that 
argues in favor of saying, in the absence of a duty to 
deal, where -- where the wholesale input could be 
withdraw from the market and where, therefore, the 
incremental harm from a price squeeze is really quite 
hard to identify.  But that in that circumstance it is 
inappropriate to recognize any sort of a duty under 
section 2.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Just out of curiosity, is 
there a place where in this case the plaintiffs could 
go, a place which has a label "regulator" under it?

MR. PANNER:  Yes, there is, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And that place is --
MR. PANNER:  The Federal Communications 

Commission.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So we needn't reach the 

issue in this case?

 MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, I think that 
the -- significant regulation is not necessary.  I agree 
with Your Honor that that is a factor that the Court 
could allow to be placed somehow on the scale.  But the 
analysis that took place in Trinko is, first of all, 
whether there is an antitrust duty there at all and 
whether to extend it in light of the regulatory scheme 
that existed.  And so, in this case, even in the absence 
of regulation, there should be no duty under section 2.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  With respect to your 

argument that there is going to be an upstream 
disincentive to investment in the monopolist if we do 
not come up with a clear rule that you want, are we at a 
stage or is the fashion of economics at a stage where we 
can say that there is a clear consensus supporting your 
argument?

 And if the answer is no, then isn't the only 

sensible thing for this Court to do to is leave it to 
rule of greedy?

MR. PANNER:  Your Honor, I think there is a 

consensus in all of the scholar literature that was 
cited by the American Antitrust Institute, there wasn't 
anyone who supported, there was no scholar who supported 
the recognition of a price squeeze claim under section 
2. 	 I do think that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  For the reasons you gave, 

in effect, the investment disincentive?

 MR. PANNER:  Well, I think the scholarly 

literature that explains the recognition of price 
squeeze duty would be harmful does indeed rely on the 
sorts of reasons that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is that, in effect, 
uncontested within the profession except for the 
margins?

 MR. PANNER:  I would assume as in any 

academic discipline, there would be those who are trying 
to find counterexamples.  But I think the point there 
and one for example Professor Carlton stresses in his 
article and stressed another scholarly works is that the 
search for the rare case itself can cause very grave 
harm in the conduct that is following.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I follow the argument.  The 

trouble I have that I have is I don't know whether, in 
the practical sense, that argument is a significant

argument or not.  I don't know what's going on out 
there.  And unless we reach the point in which the 
economic literature makes this a kind of slam dunk 
decision, then it seems for me the only thing for a 
Court to do is leave it for reasoning and analysis.

 MR. PANNER:  Well, I think that the Brooke 

decision -- and as reaffirmed the answer to that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is there --
MR. PANNER:  There is a certain kinds of 
conduct where it is possible to create a model where 
there would be some negative consequences of the 
conduct, but that the very search for it risks deterring 
conduct that is of obvious benefit to the consumers. 
And that's true here.

 The recognition of an independent price 

squeeze duty would deter retail price reductions that 
are immediately beneficial to consumers, and it deters 
entry into the downstream market by a vertical -- by a 
wholesale monopolist who may then encounter a duty to 
protect downstream rivals; and, of course, it would 
deter voluntary dealing.

 And I think that that you know, discussions 
with my client reflect that this is a real effect, that 
they are on the margin, the concern about the potential 
for litigation makes investment and certainly

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MS. MAYNARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 If a retail level rival can state a section 

2 claim against a vertically integrated company by 
alleging nothing more than a margin-based price squeeze, 
one of two outcomes will result.  Either the vertically 
integrated company will have to raise its retail prices 
to its consumers or it will be forced to share the 
benefits of its lawful monopoly with its rivals by 
lowering its wholesale price.  Either outcome is 
inconsistent with this Court's antitrust jurisprudence.
 As we know from Trinko, in the absence of a 
duty to deal, a monopolist cannot be forced to share the 
benefits of its lawful monopoly with its rivals at any 
particular turn.

in your colleague's suggestion that we should overrule 
the Alcoa case?

 MS. MAYNARD:  I do think -- the government 

believes the Alcoa case is wrongly decided, 
Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you think it's 

necessary to do so to decide this case?

 MS. MAYNARD:  I mean if -- I mean, one could 
say that Judge Hand didn't necessarily recognize a price 
squeeze claim standing alone, because he has some 
language about, to the effect of perhaps this isn't an 
independent wrong, but the way that he analyzed it 
separately and the way courts have ruled -- have relied 
upon it, to suggest that a mere margin-based price 
squeeze without more, does state a section 2 claim, is 
incorrect.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  My question is really, you 
think it's necessary to overrule that decision in order 
to decide this case correctly?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, I don't think 

technically it needs overruling.  It's a Second Circuit 
decision, and I think it is -- has in effect --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do we have to say it was 

decided incorrectly?

it was decided incorrectly.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's not my question.
 MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, Justice Stevens, I think 

it's incorrect.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I know you think it's 

incorrect.  I am asking whether you think we have to say 
it's incorrect in order to decide this case correctly?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, unless you're willing to 

say Judge Hand didn't hold that a price squeeze claim 
without more is an independent theory that supports the 
section 2 claim.  As long as you think that's what he 
did hold, and many people do think that is what he held, 
then, yes, you do need to say that it was wrongly 
decided and the government believes it is wrongly 
decided, and that it has already been overruled.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why -- why can't we 
just say Trinko is a case, as is this case, where there 
is a regulator?  So, in fact, if you, Mr. Plaintiff, are 
upset about this, and feel you are being very badly 
treated and squeezed out under circumstances where 
competition might be hurt as a result, then you go to 
the Commission, and you say:  "This is an unreasonable 
price. " All right?

 Now I thought Trinko was a case where that 

was involved.

MS. MAYNARD:  The regulation, 

Justice Breyer, in Trinko was relevant for two reasons 
that are not relevant to the question before the Court 
here.  First, the Court looked to the regulations, the 
regulatory duty, and made a decision whether the 
regulatory duty itself created an antitrust duty to 
deal, and the Court held it did not.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.
 MS. MAYNARD:  That holding is relevant here, 

because it means that Petitioners' regulatory duty to 
deal -- duty to deal does not create an antitrust duty 
to deal.  But then the Court went on and looked at the 
Court's existing antitrust jurisprudence, to decide 
whether or not the Court's antitrust jurisprudence 
recognized a duty to deal in that circumstance, and 
concluded it did not.  It only looked to the regulation 
that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But it -- it -- it said 

that the issue in that case was a duty to deal.  That's 
not the issue in this case.  And it was about Aspen, and 
whether you had a duty to deal.  And the Court said no, 
you don't have a special duty to deal.

 Here we are dealing with quite a different 
thing.  We are dealing with someone who has chosen to 
deal in the past, and they are setting a price such that

the plaintiff thinks he is being squeezed out.

 Now I can't find anything in Trinko that 

tells me I can't say, we're at least not worried about 
this where there is a regulator that you can go and 
complain to.  And if that's so, I don't have to reach 
the question of whether Judge Hand is right or wrong. 
What's wrong with what I just said?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, a couple of things.  To 
me, this case, as the case comes to the Court there is 
no antitrust duty to deal.

 And the -- the Petitioners here, the 

district court determined weren't dealing voluntarily, 
Justice Breyer; they were dealing as a result of 
regulatory compulsion; but be that as it may, the -- the 
important point from Trinko that is relevant here is 
that a lawful monopolist without an antitrust duty to 
deal has no duty to deal on any particular terms; and 
Trinko specifically says that a lawful monopolist is 
entitled to charge the monopoly price.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But --
MS. MAYNARD:  In that case --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, I didn't -- I didn't 

want to interrupt your answer, go ahead -- just go 
ahead.

 MS. MAYNARD:  I'm sorry.  That takes the

wholesale price and possibility of lowering that, 
Justice Breyer, off the table; and without the top 
pincer as it were, there is no price squeeze; and that 
leaves the Respondents with only a claim that the 
Petitioner's prices are too low.  And whenever a party 
claims that its rival's prices are too low for it to be 
able to compete, that triggers all of the concerns that 
this Court expressed in Brooke Group.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't it -- isn't it the 
case that if in effect, we -- we refuse to come down 
with a -- the kind of blanket answer, with a rule that 
you want, that the parties here can go out -- the 
complaining party here can go back to the FCC and say 
there's something wrong with your wholesale pricing 
order; look what's happening; and the FCC may adjust the 
wholesale pricing order as a result of that.

 And if that is true, if they can do that, 

and the FCC can act, isn't that a good reason for us not 
to be developing new antitrust doctrine, if there is no 
need of it?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, the government's view is 

that the current antitrust doctrine already forecloses 
this claim for the reasons that I was explaining.  Now 
if the Court were going to consider this as whether were 
you going to reach out and extend the antitrust law --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you're certainly 
asking us to -- at the very least -- to clarify the 
significance of Alcoa.  You're -- you are asking for an 
articulation of something -- of the significance of 
Alcoa today, which we have not done.  So in that sense 
you are asking for something more than we've got on the 
books now; and my question is, if the agency in effect 
can deal with -- with -- with what the -- the monopolist 
is concerned with, and what the entrant is concerned 
with, why do we have to take -- why is it wise for us to 
take the step of making or clarifying new antitrust law?
 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, the -- the Respondents 

here were attempting to press, and the Ninth Circuit has 
allowed them to go forward on, a treble damages claim 
where they seek $40 million under a pure margin-based 
price squeeze theory.  And in the government's view, 
that -- such a rule would protect only competitors, and 
doesn't allege any harm to the competitive process, 
which section 2 requires.

 Whether or not the FCC has regulatory 

authority or not over the basic question -- over its own 
issues -- isn't relevant to the antitrust question 
before the Court here, which is, does the Court's 
current antitrust jurisprudence foreclose such a pure 
margin-based price squeeze.

And the government is not saying that there 
might not be some exclusionary conduct, Justice Breyer, 
that could someday be alleged, if there was an attempt 
say, to claim an attempt of the upstream market, as you 
were positing.  That's not the claim here, nor in most 
price squeeze claims of which I'm aware; the claim is 
that they are attempting to monopolize the downstream 
market.  The government does not mean to foreclose; at 
this point it has recognized there are myriad ways in 
which companies can engage in exclusionary conduct.  So 
the government's position is a narrow one, which is that 
a pure margin-based price squeeze, in the absence of a 
duty to deal -- that is, this person who is dealing with 
me is -- is charging me too much, so that I can't 
compete against it at retail -- that is nothing more 
than proof that they can't compete.

 That doesn't show any harm to the 

competitive process, which is what this Court has 
repeatedly held is required for liability under section 
2, and for good reason.  And Justice Souter, in response 
to your question, the government is not saying that it 
is not plausible that there isn't some anticompetitive 
conduct that will go unchecked as a result of such a 
rule, but the Court's analysis in Brooke Group is the 
proper one, which is that ultimately what you will be

doing is telling a retail level competitor that it must 
raise its prices in order to prevent liability.

 That really isn't, as Mr. Panner said, worth 

the candle, and it creates the risk of chilling 
legitimate price cutting, and it puts the courts in the 
role, essentially, of being a regulator, maybe not just 
at one level, but at two.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you are saying in 

practical terms that if there is a squeeze, it's highly 
unlikely it's going to be anything but a Brooke Group 
kind of squeeze, and therefore it's --

MS. MAYNARD:  That if there is something 

anticompetitive going on, that section 2 cares about --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.
 MS. MAYNARD:  -- they would need to allege 

that the Petitioners' retail prices are below some 
appropriate measure of the Petitioners' costs; and what 
they want to do is essentially what Alcoa does, which is 
why it's mistaken, is it attributes -- it would 
attribute to Petitioners the wholesale price they are 
willing to sell their upstream input to others, and what 
Brooke Group makes clear is that the relevant cost is 
the internal cost to the Petitioners.

-- everything you said is applicable to a predatory 
price claim as well as a price squeeze?

 MS. MAYNARD:  We believe that if they can 
allege the elements of a predatory pricing claim under 
Brooke Group, then they would still have that claim even 
in the absence of a duty to deal, and then labeling it a 
predatory price squeeze doesn't add anything.  The court 
just clarified that there isn't a separate price squeeze 
liability.  But there would remain a predatory pricing 
theory under Brooke Group if those allegations could be 
met.

 Does that answer your question?
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.  Thank you, 

counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAXWELL M. BLECHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. BLECHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I don't have a white flag and I don't think 

we particularly have given up, but let me start by 
suggesting that you don't need to decide the totality of 
Alcoa.  I think you need to vacate the decision of the 
Ninth Circuit -- not because it's erroneous, but because 
it's incomplete.  Just send the case back to the

district court to consider Judge Gould's suggestion that 
we file an amended complaint.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't understand what 

you just said.  Judge Gould dissented.  He said the 
Ninth Circuit majority was wrong.  And you're urging us 
to accept Judge Gould's position.

 MR. BLECHER:  Not -- yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How can we do that 

without saying that the majority was wrong?

 MR. BLECHER:  There is a difference between 

being wrong and being incomplete.  The Ninth Circuit 
decision responded to a very narrow question certified 
by the district judge, which was whether or not price 
squeeze taken as a generic violation was subsumed or not 
subsumed by the Trinko decision.  It answered that 
question correctly; but in doing that, it did not 
consider whether or not price squeeze survived -- the 
living margin part of price squeezing survived Brooke.
 And to that extent, Judge Gould picked up 

the -- the -- the argument and said, in effect, 
especially in a regulated industry where the wholesale 
price is -- is regulated, the offense of price squeeze 
becomes predatory pricing, just as in a primary 
Robinson-Patman case, the offense becomes predatory 
pricing.

There is no more Robinson-Patman primary 
line law.  It's -- it's -- like it or not -- I'm not 
saying we like it; I'm not saying we agree with it, but 
the state of the law is that when you are challenging a 
monopolist price under section 2 of the Sherman Act, 
Brooke and its predecessors determine the legality of 
the conduct.  And that's -- and that's what we are 
recognizing here.

 Now, understand that when the issue was 

framed to the Ninth Circuit, the district judge, in a 
footnote, said he thought that they ought to consider 
the Brooke issue, but he did not decide that question, 
and he did not certify it.  So when the Ninth Circuit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you don't certify 

questions; you certify orders.  And in the certification 
of this order, I take it, your position was in support 
of what the district court did and in support of what 
the court of appeals did, correct?

 MR. BLECHER:  Partly, Justice Kennedy.  What 

-- in part what we said was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You made -- you made --

you made an argument, or did you not, that is consistent 
with what the court of appeals did hold in this case?

 MR. BLECHER:  Well, I question whether 

that's what they held.  I view what they did is answer a

question:  "Does a pure price squeeze get subsumed by 
Trinko as it involves the question that we heard 
articulated, the duty to deal?"  Now --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was the court of appeals' 
decision consistent with the argument that you made to 
the court of appeals?

 MR. BLECHER:  It is consistent, but it 
didn't say, we endorse Alcoa, and it didn't say we 
require a -- a -- predatory pricing.  It was silent on 
the elements of the offense of a price squeeze.  It 
answered this very narrow question:  Does price squeeze 
generically -- is it an existing kind of antitrust 
violation that is not subsumed by the Trinko rule?
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I am 

confused --

MR. BLECHER:  That's all that was decided.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I am confused about 

what you mean when you say "the price squeeze claim."

 MR. BLECHER:  A non-predatory --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that any 

different -- is that any different than a Brooke Group 
claim?

 MR. BLECHER:  A non-predatory price squeeze 

case.

prices --

MR. BLECHER:  No.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- somehow violate 

Brooke Group?

to file an amended complaint purely under Brooke for 
this no games --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you -- you agree 

that that requires --

MR. BLECHER:  We would --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That requires 

below-cost retail pricing?

 MR. BLECHER:  Yes.  We have below-cost 

pricing.  I have no concern about that, because, unlike 
what Mr. Panner told you, this is not proxy pricing. 
This is a case in which AT&T is mandated by the FCC to 
sell the DSL transfer to itself, to its own affiliate 
and to outside independent companies like the plaintiffs 
at the same price.

significant or partial element of your Brooke Group 
claim, or is it totally irrelevant?

 MR. BLECHER:  More or less irrelevant.  Only 

-- it only sets the benchmark for the costs that the 
retail affiliate is selling below.  There -- there is no 
question the retail affiliate, in many of the time 
periods covered by the complaint, sold below -- just the 
DSL transport; and in addition to that, they threw in a 
modem, installation, and online services.  So, if you 
put those into the cost bundle, they will be below cost 
for the -- substantially the entire damage period that 
we are complaining about; and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the first -- is the 

first time that you indicated that you were in agreement 
with the Gould dissent in your -- the brief that you 
filed here in this Court?

 MR. BLECHER:  Yes, directly, but we did 

have --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it --
MR. BLECHER:  -- a predatory pricing --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- it seems to me that, in 
that instance, you seriously prejudiced the Petitioners 
here, and that that should be weighed heavily against 
you when you ask to -- for permission to amend your 
complaint in the district court.

MR. BLECHER:  No --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, there have --

there have been costs and time --

MR. BLECHER:  See, see-- Justice Kennedy, 
you granted certiorari and agreed to review a decision 
that was essentially moot, because the complaint that 
you are talking about in this case has been superseded. 
Judge Wilson said it was superseded by a complaint 
charging predatory pricing, and he said, generously 
construed, you have pled predatory pricing, and let's go 
forward.

 Judge Gould said he didn't think the 

complaint under Twombly's standard which intervened 
satisfied the Brooke standard; And so he said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess it 

would have been nice if you thought the case was 
essentially moot, to hear about that in the cert 
opposition.

 MR. BLECHER:  I'm sorry?
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You didn't argue 
that the decision below was essentially moot in your 
opposition to certiorari here.

the Petitioners' attorney that that was your position so 
you could have asked for a stipulation on the point.
 MR. BLECHER:  Well, I think what you are 

overlooking, though, is when we went to the Ninth 
Circuit, we endorsed Judge Wilson's suggestion that they 
decide the Brooke issue, so that, when we went back, we 
would have guidance as to what the appropriate standard 
was.  They elected not to deal with either Alcoa or 
Brooke.  They just decided the very narrow question he 
certified.

 In the Ninth Circuit, AT&T said, to the 

Ninth Circuit, don't reach the Brooke issue; you don't 
need to reach the Brooke issue to decide this case, even 
though the complaint you are ruling on has been 
superseded by an allegation in an amended complaint that 
states a Brooke violation, or purported to or attempted 
to state a Brooke violation.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So can we write this 

following, we say:  In the district court, as of this 
moment, there is no complaint that alleges the price 
squeeze theory of the majority of the Ninth Circuit. 
There is a complaint that alleges a price theory under 
Brooke -- a predatory pricing under Brooke Group.  That 
is what is there.  Nothing else is there.  Therefore, 
that issue which the Ninth Circuit decided has no

bearing on this case.  We therefore vacate their 
decision, leaving it up to the district court to proceed 
as it believes appropriate under the law with the Brooke 
Group claim?

here, because the Ninth Circuit did not endorse Alcoa.

MR. BLECHER:  It was allowed.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, it was?
 MR. BLECHER:  Judge Wilson ruled that it 

was, a, quote, "generously construed," we stated a 
Brooke claim, and he would review it again at summary 
judgment stage.  Judge Gould disagreed with that, and he 
said, if you want to state a Brooke claim, you should go 
back and amend the complaint and do it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Breyer's 

draft judgment said we would vacate the decision below. 
Shouldn't we reverse it, because if we think on the 
price squeeze claim, as distinct from the Brooke Group 
claim, the Ninth Circuit was wrong.  You don't just 
throw it out and let everybody go home.  You say whether 
it was right or wrong.  And if you are saying it's 
wrong, we would reverse.

 MR. BLECHER:  That's certainly as an option, 

but I think it would be more appropriate to vacate it 
because I don't consider that they did a direct frontal 
assault on Brooke.  They didn't consider Brooke because 
AT&T suggested that they didn't need to read it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Ninth Circuit had a 

precedent that it thought it was following.  Was it 
Anaheim?

 MR. BLECHER:  Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So isn't it important 

that if you think that they were wrong and we agree with 
you, that we get -- not just vacate but say you were 
wrong on the law; you were wrong in this case, and you 
were wrong in Anaheim.  And then the Ninth Circuit will 
not follow those decisions anymore.

 MR. BLECHER:  Well, that's if you want to 
approach the rules and decide that there can only be a 
price squeeze claim if the price is predatory.  You may 
want to get there.  I'm saying you don't need to get 
there here.

 You could simply say the Ninth Circuit 

decision, I think, correctly decided the very narrow 
question that was presented by the certification order. 
They abided AT&T's suggestion not to go outside that 
order, and, therefore, their decision can be viewed as 
incomplete because they didn't go on to discuss what the 
elements of a price squeeze claim were.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You are saying we 

don't have to cross the Rubicon because your Brooke 
Group predatory pricing claim will say that the prices 
here were below cost?

 MR. BLECHER:  Correct.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So we don't have to

MR. BLECHER:  This is not a case where we 
are confronting you with the necessity of the settings 
or the vitality of Alcoa.  You --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you are not 

going to amend your complaint to raise such a claim on 
remand?

 MR. BLECHER:  I am going to file an amended 

complaint that will be limited entirely to the Brooke 
predatory pricing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which you understand 

to require that the retail prices be below cost?

 MR. BLECHER:  And we are very comfortable 
with that.  The answer is yes, and we are comfortable 
with that.  But we haven't given up, and we live to 
fight another day on another field.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But if we follow your 

proposal, then, you could, in a case filed next week or 
the week after we decide the case, assert exactly the 
same claim that you asserted here originally, and that 
would be good law in the Ninth Circuit?

 MR. BLECHER:  The answer to that, 

Justice Alito, I think you can remand it --

I mean in another case.

the Ninth Circuit --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Either you or anybody else 

in the Ninth Circuit?

 MR. BLECHER:  I think if you abide my idea 

how to deal with this, the issue of Alcoa's vitality 
would remain open to be decided in another case on 
another day.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If we vacate, you would be 

in favor of vacating their decision?

 MR. BLECHER:  Yes, because a vacation can 

rest on grounds that the Ninth Circuit did not reach the 
issue.  They said, we are prepared to abide Judge 
Gould's view that, in a regulated industry, we can only 
have a, quote, "price squeeze" if the price is 
predatory.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the reason you 
think we should vacate is not because the Ninth Circuit 
didn't decide the question, but because you are willing 
not to press it?

 MR. BLECHER:  No.  I don't think they 

decided the Alcoa question.  That's the way I read the 
decision.  Because I know what was certified.  I know 
what they said.  They responded only to a very narrow 
question, and AT&T said don't venture beyond that.

guess that's where we are about to go.  But in answer to 
Justice Alito's question, if you think the Ninth Circuit 
was wrong and don't want to see those claims raised 
again, we need to address the merits and reverse?

 MR. BLECHER:  Or you can simply say that the 

case is remanded, the district court may decide the 
propriety of an amended complaint, except that the 
amended complaint cannot state a non-predatory price 
squeeze claim.  We are prepared to live with that.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD M. BRUNELL
 ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ANTITRUST

 INSTITUTE, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. BRUNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 We think the proper disposition of this case 

is to vacate the decision below and to remand and let 
the district court decide whether the complaint should 
be amended or not.  Vacating the judgment would amount 
to a dismissal with prejudice of the price squeeze 
claim, and, therefore, this Court would have nothing to

decide.

 The Court doesn't need to reach out to 

decide the vitality of Alcoa, the question of which is 
not even presented by the question raised in the cert 
petition.  And there are many reasons why -- and I am 
happy to address why Alcoa should remain good law, if 
the Court wishes to get into that.  However, we don't 
think it's necessary.

 On the specific issue here, if the Court 
decides not to vacate the judgment below and wants to 
examine the correctness of the Ninth Circuit judgment, 
the specific issue of whether the absence of a duty to 
deal thereby dooms any kind of claim -- a price squeeze 
claim or really any other type of antitrust claim, 
including a predatory pricing claim, if the regulators 
can address the issue.

 We think that is -- that is the case, that 
that is the incorrect view of the law, and indeed, to 
some extent we agree with the Solicitor General that the 
existence of a regulatory remedy is not sufficient to 
bar a price-squeeze claim because there is no exhaustion 
requirement under the antitrust laws, and this Court's 
decision in Trinko, as the Solicitor General suggested 
when it looked at the regulatory remedies, that was with 
respect to expanding section 2 enforcement and not with

respect to traditional antitrust claims, which Alcoa 
certainly is.

 Now, with respect to the issue of the duty 
to deal.  What does that mean, that there's no duty to 
deal?  In our view --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that means 
they don't have to deal.  They don't have to sell you 
the stuff if they don't want to.

 MR. BRUNELL:  In our view, it means that a 
court has found that there's no liability in the event 
of a refusal to deal, which is what Trinko did.  And one 
has to ask whether the rationale for finding no 
liability for refusal to deal also applies to a 
predatory -- excuse me, a price squeeze claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You mean a Brooke 

Group retail price squeeze claim?

 MR. BRUNELL:  No, I mean a traditional price 

squeeze claim.  That doesn't have to meet the Brooke 
Group standard.  Mr. Panner suggested --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this:  I'm not 
familiar on this point.  Apart from Alcoa, what are the 
cases applying a traditional price squeeze claim?

 MR. BRUNELL:  We've listed them in our 

brief.  I believe that 9 out of the 12 circuits, not 
including the Federal Circuit, have recognized an

Alcoa-type price squeeze claim.  And in the other three 
circuits, district courts -- in each of the other three 
circuits, district courts have recognized an Alcoa-type 
claim.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you agree with your 

opponent's submission that antitrust scholars uniformly 
agree that the Alcoa case was incorrectly decided?

 MR. BRUNELL:  No, I do not agree with that. 
And, indeed, our brief cites an eminent professor, John 
Vickers at Oxford, an economist who supports a 
traditional Alcoa-type claim, that is a claim based on 
what we've call the transfer price test, where one looks 
at the margin between the retail and wholesale prices 
and asks whether that is sufficient to cover the 
monopolist's downstream costs.  Professor Vickers --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Does he support --
MR. BRUNELL:  Pardon me?
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I thought somebody else was 

-- does he support recognition of that claim in the 
circumstances in which there was regulatory involvement 
like the FCC here?

 MR. BRUNELL:  I believe he does, Your Honor. 
I believe the European Commission also recognizes such a 
claim in the presence of regulation.  I believe the 
Federal Trade Commission recognizes such a claim.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why do we need to?
 MR. BRUNELL:  Why do we need to?  Because 

a -- you mean in the absence why can't regulation handle 
this or why do we worry about the anticompetitive 
effects of a price squeeze?

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why can't regulation handle 

it?

 MR. BRUNELL:  Well, in this case, regulation 

-- simply the -- the regulation that is referred to is 
simply the prospect of the complainant going to the 
Federal Communications Commission and simply asking for 
some kind of post hoc relief, as opposed to a situation 
as in Town of Concord or in Trinko where the regulation 
at issue was quite extensive.  All of the conduct at 
issue in Trinko was heavily regulated.  And in this 
case, we have wholesale rates that are lightly regulated 
and retail rates that are completely unregulated.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So why couldn't you -- why 
wouldn't you -- couldn't you go to the FCC or the other 
regulator and say:  Regulator, they are selling me this 
widget or line at a dollar.  All right.  That's 
considerably higher than their costs of producing it. 
And, in addition to that, they sell the same service I 
do for $1.20, even though it costs me or would cost any 
human being at least 60 cents to provide that added

service.  So we are asking you to tell them that if they 
continue to sell it at $1.20, they lower their wholesale 
price to us so that we only have to pay at most 80 
cents, or whatever the right number is there.

 I mean, they have someone to complain to. 

They could make the same complaint.  I'm quite surprised 
that Vickers has written that under the circumstances I 
have outlined that there is a valid price squeeze 
antitrust claim or that the British Commission has held 
that.

 I would be very interested to know the 

citation of that.  Because he may have done.  I don't 
read everything.

 MR. BRUNELL:  The European commission --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not saying the European 

Commission.  They have done all kinds of things.  I am 
saying the -- the --

(Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I am saying the British 

Monopolies or Restricted Practices Commission of which 
Vickers was the head.  I agree with you that he is very 
knowledgeable, but I would be surprised if he had 
written contrary to what I just said in that example. 
But I am often surprised and willing to read it.

relationship between the regulatory authority to address 
a question and whether an antitrust claim exists is 
normally decided on the basis of implied antitrust 
immunity.  The mere existence of a regulatory remedy is 
insufficient under this Court's precedent in Credit 
Suisse, certainly, for -- for having implied immunity.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, would you say that 
absent the regulatory regime, there would be a duty to 
deal here?

 MR. BRUNELL:  Absent the regulatory regime, 

would there be a duty to deal?  Would the Court have 
found -- in this case, the Petitioners may well have 
voluntarily dealt with the Respondents --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  No.  My question was: 

Was there a duty to deal under the antitrust laws? 
Because it seems to me the only reason that there is a 
duty to deal is because of the regulation.  So, you use 
the regulation in order to establish the duty, but then 
you don't want to go to the regulators to regulate the 
price.  And it seems to me that that's inconsistent.
 MR. BRUNELL:  Whether there is a duty to 

deal can only be answered by asking whether a violation 
-- a refusal to deal would constitute an antitrust 
violation.  And in this case, had -- had there been no 
required dealing and, therefore, no dealing whatsoever,

then the issue of antitrust duty to deal would be 
totally academic.  Furthermore --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's still seems to me 
that you, therefore, must rely on the regulation to 
establish the initial predicate of a duty to deal.  And 
You rely on the regulation that far, but you don't want 
to go to the regulators to -- to argue about the price. 
You want us to look at regulation first and antitrust 
law second.

 Why can't we just look at this case as 

purely antitrust; and then, as Justice Breyer said, if 
it's a regulatory problem, go to the regulators.

 MR. BRUNELL:  Well, the mere fact that there 

is a regulatory duty to deal does not completely oust 
antitrust.  Otherwise, there would be no predatory-
pricing claim.

 The petitioner -- the -- the respondent 

injured by a predatory-pricing claim could also go to 
the FCC, presumably.  And we don't -- and no one is 
contending that the -- that a predatory-pricing claim 
wouldn't lie and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would that lie here first? 
I mean, you don't -- you don't think -- you don't think 
that the regulatory agency would be acting properly if 
it prescribed a price that was predatory or allowed the

charge of a price that was predatory, would you?

 MR. BRUNELL:  No.  I -- I don't think the 

regulators would -- would permit predatory pricing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They wouldn't permit it. 

Then is there -- is there no such thing as primary 
agency responsibility to take care of that problem 
rather than rushing into a court and take care of it 
through the -- through the Sherman Act?

 MR. BRUNELL:  There certainly is the 

doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which arises typically 
when the agency is already dealing with a problem and 
not --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, they are dealing with 

the problem there.  They are decreeing the price that 
could be charged, aren't they?  Don't they have to 
approve the pricing?

 MR. BRUNELL:  They certainly don't approve 

the retail pricing, no.  The retail pricing in this case 
is entirely unregulated.  It purports to be in a 
competitive market.

 But let me back up for one second.  The --
the regulatory regime here is quite different from the 
one in Trinko.  In -- in Trinko you had a regulatory 
duty that essentially required the monopolist to 
cooperate with its rivals in the monopoly market in

order to dismantle the monopoly.

 In this case you have a regulation that is 
designed to ensure that the monopolist does not extend 
its monopoly power into unregulated competitive markets. 
And so the -- surely, the regulators focus -- can focus 
on the wholesale rates and ensure in this case that the 
rate that the monopolist charges itself is the same as 
the rate it charges its rivals with the object of 
ensuring a competitive downstream market.

 But that doesn't mean that that should oust 
antitrust law.  The regulators may, in fact, think that 
it's important to have antitrust law available to 
enforce claims in order for them to cut back on their 
regulations.  And indeed, in this case, when the -- when 
AT&T sought to de-tariff its wholesale offering, the 
regulators referred to the fact that one of the 
justifications for de-tariffing would be that the 
antitrust laws would be available in case there were a 
problem.

 So the -- the relationship between antitrust 

and regulation is symbiotic and complementary.  And we 
would suggest that in this case the mere fact that the 
district court determined that the complaint of 
insufficient cooperation by the Petitioner in this case 
did not state a claim for refusal to deal shouldn't

preclude a -- a price-squeeze claim any more than it 
should preclude a predatory pricing claim, which the 
government and the Petitioners seem to concede would 
still lie.

 Now, finally, this point about an 

over-deterrence and whether there is any evidence that 
any monopolist at any time has ever been deterred from 
engaging in legitimate retail price-cutting or efficient 
vertical integration, I would submit that there is 
absolutely no evidence anywhere in the literature, no 
empirical evidence, that there is a problem of over-
deterrence.

 And had there been a problem over the last 

63 years that Alcoa has existed, one would think it 
wouldn't be too hard to find evidence of that.  There is 
no evidence.

 Furthermore, in Brooke Group the Court did 

not simply rely on the risk of over-deterrence as a 
basis for holding that above-cost price-cutting was not 
actionable.  In Brooke Group it relied on two factors: 
The fact -- the fear that making above-cost 
price-cutting illegal would deter legitimate 
price-cutting, but also the fact that above-cost 
price-cutting would not eliminate equally efficient 
rivals.  Any equally efficient rival could meet an

above-cost price.  The price squeeze doctrine under the 
transfer price test protects equally efficient 
downstream rivals.

 So that issue is quite different.  The 

deterrence issue is -- is quite different when you --
when have a price squeeze.  Furthermore, the notion that 
a monopolist would respond to a price squeeze complaint 
-- thank you, Your Honors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish your 

sentence there.

 MR. BRUNELL:  The notion that they would 
respond to a price squeeze complaint by raising their 
retail price, rather than lowering their wholesale 
price, I would submit is certainly as belied by the 
facts of the Alcoa case which in the district court 
reflect that when the government started looking into 
the price squeeze and the price squeeze was ended, it 
was ended voluntarily by Alcoa lowering its wholesale 
price, not raising its retail price.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Now, Mr. Panner, you have two minutes 

remaining.

to make.  First of all, I think, in agreement with 
Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy, and others, I do 
think that the presence of a regulatory remedy here is a 
critical factor arguing in favor of reversal of the 
Ninth Circuit's decision.

 The second point that I really want to make 

is the importance of clear rules.  In the antitrust 
context where we are talking about a system of rules 
that is going to govern decisionmaking by businesses 
where most of those decisions are never going to lead to 
litigation or are never going to come before the courts, 
it is critically important to have clear rules that 
avoid deterring beneficial conduct, that avoid having 
the rules themselves harm consumers.

 I think that was the point that 

Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg were getting at in 
the questioning.  It is critical to adopt a decision on 
the merits explaining why the Ninth Circuit's price 
squeeze decision -- not just here, but in the prior 
decision, in City of Anaheim -- is incorrect and 
inconsistent with this Court's precedents.

 And, more broadly, it is critical to have a 

clear rule stating that in the absence of a duty to 
deal, an allegation of price squeeze, it doesn't stay a 
claim.

And I think that it's also -- would be very 
valuable to say that the complaint that was before the 
district court -- and the amended complaint at a minimum 
is supplying one version of the facts that might try to 
be elaborated -- fail to state a claim under this 
Court's precedents.  The clear gravamen of 
that complaint, indeed the explicit gravamen of that
