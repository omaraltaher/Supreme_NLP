CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this  morning  in  Case  15­474,  McDonnell  v.  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Francisco. 

 

           

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  NOEL  J.  FRANCISCO 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

The  government  argues  that  in  quid  pro  quo 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bribery,  "official  action"  encompasses  anything  within 

 

 

 

 

 

the  range  of  official  duties.  In  order  to  reach  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion,  it  asks  that  you  disregard  a  9­0  decision  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court. 

 

            

The  government  is  wrong.  In  order  to  engage 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  "official  action,"  an  official  must  either  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  decision  or  urge  someone  else  to  do  so.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  is  between  access  to  decision­makers  on  the  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hand  and  trying  to  influence  those  decisions  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  that's  the  Sun­Diamond 

  

 

 

 

 

case,  the  9­0  case  that  you  refer  to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Sun­Diamond  case,  the  9­0  case.  And  I  think  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Sun­Diamond  confirms  is  that  when  an  official  simply

refers  someone  to  another  official,  an  independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision­maker  for  an  objective  decision,  he  hasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crossed  that  line  into  prohibited  "official  action." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  take  it  all  parties 

    

 

 

 

 

concede  that  the  act  of  the  university  official  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undertake  or  not  to  undertake  a  research  study  would  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  "official  action." 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  And  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

question  is:  Did  the  Governor  cross  the  line  into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influencing  officials  to  undertake  that  action  and  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  properly  instructed? 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Can  you  tell  me  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

posture  of  the  case  with  reference  to  under  Virginia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  the  government  ­­ the  Governor's  authority  or  lack 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  authority  to  tell  the  university,  you  will  engage  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  research  or  you  will  not  engage? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Sure,  Your  Honor.  He  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  is  the  state  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  and  do  ­­ do  the  parties  agree  on  this  point? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  I  think  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

parties  agree  that  the  Governor  at  least  had  a  bully 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pulpit  authority,  but  he  had  very  little  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  direct  any  university  researcher  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything.  And  here  I  think  one  of  the  critical  ­­ there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  two  critical  questions:  One,  was  the  jury  told  that

it  even  had  to  find  that  he  tried  to  do  that  and  here  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't;  and,  two,  did  he  in  fact  do  that.  And  we  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assert  that  he  clearly  didn't. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Would  it  have  made  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

difference  if  the  medical  faculties  had  agreed  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testing? 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  if  they  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

agreed  to  the  testing,  I  still  don't  think  it  would  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  a  difference  in  terms  of  whether  Governor  McDonnell 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

tried  to  influence  their  decision  on  that,  because  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't.  And  it  still  wouldn't  have  made  a  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  on  the  jury  instructions  because  the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  wasn't  instructed  that  it  had  to  find  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Governor  McDonnell  tried  to  influence  a  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

governmental  decision,  because  it  wasn't  so  instructed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Francisco,  could  I 

  

 

 

 

 

ask  ­­ the  line  you're  drawing  between  exercising 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence  and  providing  access,  just  to  sort  of  test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  with  a  hypothetical,  suppose  that  somebody  knew 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  was  a  ­­ a  contractor  who  was  going  to  award 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  very  large  contract  to  one  of  two  or  three  firms  that

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ an  official  in  order  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

become  one  of  those  two  or  three  firms  from  which  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  pool  from  which  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ this  billion­dollar 

  

 

 

 

contract  would  emerge,  would  that  be  sufficient? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

probably  would  be  "official  action"  because  there  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  way  you  can  even  get  a  decision  in  your  favor  is  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  one  of  three  people  on  that  list.  So  being  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  list  is  a  prerequisite  to  getting  a  decision. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Being  denied  ­­ denied  on  that  list  is  a  denial  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  and  that's  an  official  governmental  action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here  the  jury  wasn't  instructed  on  any  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  They  didn't  have  to  find  that  Governor  McDonnell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tried  to  influence  anything.  Indeed,  it  would  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  to  convict  under  these  instructions  if  Governor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McDonnell  had  called  up  a  staff  member  and  said,  I'd 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  to  ­­ you  to  meet  with  this  fellow,  Johnnie 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Williams.  I  don't  really  trust  him.  His  product  is  a 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  hinky,  but  you're  the  expert.  So  meet  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guy  and  exercise  your  complete  and  unfettered  judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ­­

the  hypothetical  a  little  bit.  Suppose  that  a  Governor 

   

   

  

 

 

 

is  going  to  make  a  ­­ eventually  going  to  make  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  that  will  help  either  A  or  B  and  hurt  either  A 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  B,  and  the  Governor  says,  you  know,  I'm  going  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  preliminary  discussion  about  this  with  members  of  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

staff.  We're  not  going  to  come  to  any  decision,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  talk  about  it.  And  whichever  of  you  pays

meeting.  What  about  that? 

  

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Sure.  Well,  Your  Honor,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

think  I'd  want  to  know,  are  there  facts  suggesting  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  really  isn't  just  a  payment  to  sit  in  on  the  staff 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meeting?  It's  a  payment  to  try  to  influence  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

meeting? 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Just  a  payment  to  sit  in. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  To  sit  on  the  ­­ I  think  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  violate  a  whole  lot  of  other  laws,  but  I  don't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  unless  there  was  any  kind  of  indicia  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  trying  to  influence  the  outcome,  you  would  cross 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  line  into  prohibited  "official  action"  corruption. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

After  all,  these  laws  are  not  meant  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comprehensive  codes  of  ethical  conduct  as  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  Sun­Diamond.  They're  meant  to  target  the  worst 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

form  of  ethical  misconduct,  the  corruption  of  official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision­making.

facts  that  you  put  on  to  suggest  that  it  is  more  of  an

individuals  who  were  assessing  whether  or  not  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  studies  themselves  felt  pressured?  There  is  both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  and  documents  in  which  the  pros  and  cons  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accepting  these  studies  was  discussed.

good  idea.  They  were  honorable  people,  obviously.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  point  is,  what  do  we  do  with  the  fact  that  they

Honor,  a  legal  one  and  a  factual  one.  Legally,  you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

still  need  to  instruct  the  jury  that  it  had  to  find  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Governor  McDonnell  tried  to  actually  influence  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  decision.  And  here  it  wasn't  instructed,  so

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  why?  Isn't  this  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

I  thought  that  this  crime  was  taking  money  knowing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  being  paid  to  influence  an  "official  act."  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't  all  of  these  examples  of  "official  acts"  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  or  they  aren't  irrelevant?  The  question  is,

And  why  couldn't  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Yeah. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ a  jury  infer  at  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

moment  that  he  took  it  with  the  intent  to  commit  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"official  act"  the  way  Mr.  Williams  wanted  it  committed? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  So  again,  Your  Honor,  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

responses.  Even  assuming  that  the  jury  could  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

inferred  it,  you  still  need  to  tell  them  what  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"official  act"  is,  that  an  "official  act"  is  an  attempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  influence  a  governmental  decision. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Understand  ­­

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Well,  to  ­­ to  actually,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  conduct  tobacco  commission­funded  State  studies, 

 

 

 

 

 

but  you  still  need  to  tell  them  what  that  is.  But  I'll 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  directly  to  your  question.  Why  is  it  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  "official  acts"  are  relevant?  And  that's  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  the  district  court  and  the  courts  of  appeals' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinions  made  clear. 

 

 

            

Here  in  this  case,  the  corrupt  agreement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turned  entirely  upon,  as  the  district  court  case  said. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  hinged  upon  whether  the  five  specific  acts  were,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  "official  acts,"  because  in  the  absence  of  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  evidence  of  a  corrupt  agreement,  the  government's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

argument  was  that  you  could  infer  one  from  the  pattern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  actual  "official  acts"  on  the  one  hand  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pattern  of  gifts  and  loans  on  the  other  and  the  temporal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection  between  the  two. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  so  is  it  your  position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  page  60  of  the  supplemental  Joint  Appendix  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  aren't  numbered,  which  makes  it  a  little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

hard,  but  the  judge  instructs  the  jury  that  "official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions"  are  set  forth  in  the  five  paragraphs  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indictment.  And  is  it  your  position  that  at  least  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  are  not  "official  acts"? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

certainly  the  five  things  that  were  proved  in  this  case

are  not  "official  acts."  And  likewise,  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

any  of  those  things,  as  they  actually  came  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  demonstrated  "official  acts"  because  in  none 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  them  did  Governor  McDonnell  cross  that  line  in  trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  influence  the  outcome  of  any  particular  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  just  as  critically,  the  jury  was  never  told  it  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  find  that.  So  the  jury  in  this  case,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor,  could  have  completely  agreed  with  our  version 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  facts.  It  could  have  agreed  that  as  we  argued 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  vigorously  that  the  most  that  Governor  McDonnell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  here  was  refer  Johnnie  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  matter  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  this  gets  back 

  

 

 

 

 

somewhat  to  Justice  Alito's  hypothetical  about  arranging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  meeting,  and  we  ­­ and  we  can  up  the  ante  to  see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  ­­ how  close  the  meeting  came  to  be  an  ­­ an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"official  act."  But  I  ­­ I  take  it  that  at  some  point 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  position  is  that  a  governmental  ­­ that  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"official  act"  must  be  the  exercise  of  governmental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power.  Is  that  your  position? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Well,  Your  Honor,  it's

governmental  power,  trying  to  influence  it,  as  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Birdsall  case,  where  the  defendants  there  were  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persuade  the  grant  of  clemency.

But  if  you're  simply  setting  up  a  meeting  so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  somebody  can  appeal  to  the  independent  judgment  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  independent  decisionmaker  and  you're  not  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  your  thumb  on  the  scale  of  the  outcome  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meeting,  then  that  simple  referral  can't  possibly  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official  action.  After  all,  government  officials  refer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

friends  and  benefactors  to  staff  members  all  the  time  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  to  avoid  taking  official  action. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Do  you  ­­ do  you  concede 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  is  sufficient  evidence  in  this  record  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  say  we  accept  your  argument  about  the  charge  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insufficient.  But  this  could  go  back,  and  a  jury  could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  asked:  Did  the  Governor  try  to  influence  a  decision 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  part  of  the  medical  faculties? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  we  don't  concede 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  sufficient  evidence.  But  regardless,  we  ­­ we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  argue  that  the  jury  was  improperly  instructed  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  which,  Justice  Sotomayor,  goes  to  the  point,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  you  were  making.  If  the  jury  was  improperly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructed,  then  you  don't  actually  assume  all  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  in  favor  of  the  government.  The  question  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes:  Could  a  ­­ would  a  properly­instructed  juror 

   

   

  

 

 

have  been  required  to  convict? 

 

 

 

 

            

Here,  even  if  the  jury  completely  agreed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  us,  and  they  very  well  may  have,  under  these

erroneous  instructions  they  still  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  to  convict,  because  under  these  instructions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  referring  somebody  to  a  meeting  without  trying  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence  the  outcome  of  that  meeting  constitutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official  governmental  action. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  suppose 

  

 

 

 

arranging  a  meeting  could  be  official  government  action, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

if  that  were  your  job.  In  other  words,  you're  not  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  secretary,  but  your  job  was  to  manage  the  Governor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schedule.  You  decided  who  met  with  him,  you  decided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when,  and  that  ­­ that's  your  job.  That's  ­­ so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  that  individual  does,  I  suppose,  would  be  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

official  act. 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  I  think  that's  possible, 

    

 

 

 

Chief  Justice.  Of  course,  in  this  case  we  don't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  like  that.  We  simply  have  referrals  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

meetings  with  other  officials  so  that,  at  best,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged  bribe  payor  here,  Jonnie  Williams,  can  try  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persuade  them  to  his  cause. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  can  I  follow  up  on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that?  Because  what  you  just  suggested,  right,  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  could  ­­ suppose  that  there  were  a  scheduler  for  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Governor  or  for  the  President  or  whatever,  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scheduler  was  selling  meetings.  So  you  would  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  part  of  her  job?  And  if  I  just  understood  you

correctly,  that  falls  within  the  statute? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  No,  Your  Honor.  I  think 

    

  

 

 

 

that  would  be  a  very  close  case.  That  ­­ that  would  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  very  close  case,  because  at  the  end  of  the  day,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not  actually  making  a  governmental  decision  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

influencing  the  outcome  of  an  actual  governmental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  I  think  you  ­­ and  Chief  Justice,  you  might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  be  violating  a  lot  of  other  laws,  including  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  provision  in  Section  201  that  prohibits  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  undertaking  any  act  in  violation  of  your  official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duties  in  exchange  for  money,  or  5  U.S.C.  7353,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibits  you  from  ­­ from  taking  anything  from  anyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whose  interests  could  be  affected  by  the  performance  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonperformance  of  your  duties. 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  that  the  line  has  to  be,  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  line  that  comes  out  through  the  cases  is,  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  either  making  a  decision  on  because  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  or  you're  urging  someone  else  to  do  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  trying  to  pushing  them  in  a  certain  direction. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  seems  to  me  when  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"urging"  ­­ now,  wait.  See,  I  can  go  back  to  a  lot  of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  commission,  the  Brown  Commission,  the  Senate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

S1,  the  language  of  the  statute,  and  I  read  "official 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action,"  something  quite  similar  to  the  statute  here,  "A

other  conduct"  ­­ perhaps  other  similar  conduct  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"involving  an  exercise  of  discretion." 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

So  in  this  case,  the  official  action  we're 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  is  giving  money  to  a  group  of  people  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  university  to  conduct  a  study. 

   

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  Governor  didn't  do  that.  But  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  who  tries  to  influence  an  official  action  and  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  in  the  government  is  also  guilty.  But  wait. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  Indian  case. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Yes.  You're  correct. 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  wait.  The  word 

  

  

 

 

 

"influence"  is  too  broad,  because  every  day  of  the  week 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politicians  write  on  behalf  of  constituents  letters  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  parts  of  the  government,  saying,  will  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  look  at  the  case  of  Mrs.  So­and­so  who  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evicted  last  week?  And  that's  so  common,  you  can't  pick 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  up. 

 

            

But  then  you  use  the  word  "urge."  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  exactly  a  legal  word.  And  what  I'm  looking  for  is  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  of  words  that  will  describe  in  both  sides'  positions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  should  write  as  the  words  that  describe  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  activity  involved  in  talking  to  or  influencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  who  does  create  the  official  act,  like  give  a

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  say  "absolutely  not." 

  

 

 

 

 

That's  what  I  thought  that  you  would  say. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  And  I  think  that  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  I  want  to  know  ­­ but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  words  you  used  were  "attempt  to  influence."  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ though  I  don't  think  that's  the  right  word,  and  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  know  what  the  right  words  are  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ in  the  instruction  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  is  going  to  give.  Not  in  your  case  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Um­hmm. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ but  in  general. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Well,  can  I  give  you  an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

example  from  another  case  that,  although  I  do  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  are  generally  tailored  to  the  case,  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Of  course  they  are.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  have  the  standard  that  will  distinguish  the

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ from  the  one  who  does  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminally  and  the  one  who  doesn't. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  And  in  the  Ring  case,  I

MR.  FRANCISCO:  ­­ where  she  wrote  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

this  is  at  page  1083  of  the  Joint  Appendix  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Therefore,  'official  action'  includes  the  exercise  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  formal  official  influence,  such  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature's  vote  on  legislation,  and  informal  official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence,  such  as  a  legislature's  behind­the­scenes 

   

 

 

 

influence  on  other  public  officials  in  the  legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  executive  branches." 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  there  we  have  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

There  we  have  it.  All  these  letters  going  over,  saying, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  look  at  Mrs.  Smith's  eviction  notice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  And  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Mrs.  Smith,  who,  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

way,  took  me  to  lunch  last  week. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  And  I  completely  agree,  Your 

   

  

 

 

 

Honor,  which  is  why  in  our  proposed  instruction  ­­

you  just  read  won't  do  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Well  ­­ well,  and  that's  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  proposed  instructions,  I  think  it  needs  to  be

making  a  speech  are  not  standing­alone  "official  acts." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Either  you  use  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  All  right.  So  you  use 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that.  The  key  to  the  word  in  there  is  "merely." 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Because  sometimes  it  could. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  somebody  might  have  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

embarrassing  question,  merely  when  it  can  or  merely  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  can't.  Give  me  a  little  enlightenment. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  I  think  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

answer  is,  if  ­­ if  the  evidence  shows  that  there  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  hate  to  go  back  to  the  word  that  I  ­­ I  know  you 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  like  here,  but  if  the  evidence  shows  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  wasn't  attempt  ­­ an  attempt  to  try  to  push  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  decisionmaker  that  you're  supposedly  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence  one  way  or  another,  but  you  really  are  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sending  it  over  for  a  meeting,  and  ­­ and  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  decisionmaker  is  left  to  their  independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment,  then  you  haven't  crossed  that  line.  But  if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  word  ­­ the  word  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer  is  concerned  about  comes  from  Birdsall, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  intent  to  influence  their  "official  action."  So  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  hardly  fault  the  district  judge  for  using  in  Ring

the  same  words  that  this  Court  used  in  Birdsall. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  I  ­­ I  agree,  Your  Honor.  I 

    

   

  

 

 

 

thought  that  Judge  Huvelle  did  a  very  good  attempt  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defining,  because  she  actually  went  further  than  what  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  read  to  you,  Justice  Breyer.  She  continues  along 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lines  that  we  proposed  in  our  instructions  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quote,  "Mere  favoritism  as  evidenced  by  a  public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

official's  willingness  to  take  a  lobbyist's  telephone 

   

 

 

 

 

call  or  to  meet  with  the  lobbyist,  is  not  an  'official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act.'" 

            

So  I  think  that  the  idea  is,  Your  Honor  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand,  Justice  Breyer,  that  influence  itself 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  totally  solve  the  problem.  But  what  district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  judges  do  is  they  then  explain  to  the  jury  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  mean  by  influence,  and  influence  is  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Where  can  we  find  the  best 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition,  in  your  view,  of  an  "official  act"? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  I  think  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

best  definition  of  an  "official  act"  is  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  the  one  that  I  tried  to  articulate  at  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outset.  You  need  ­­ you  need  to  either  make  a  decision 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  behalf  of  the  government,  or  try  in  some  way  to  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  influence  to  pressure  or  urge  or  persuade  or  cajole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  else  who  has  governmental  power  to  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  on  an  action.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  I  ­­

   

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ­­

   

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  agree  with  Justice 

    

 

 

 

            

            

            

Breyer.  I  just  don't  see  the  limiting  principle  in  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  part. 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  I  think  in  many 

   

  

 

 

 

 

­­ in  some  cases,  I  think  the  limiting  principle  might 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  difficult;  it's  not  a  perfect  and  precise 

   

 

 

 

 

 

formulation.  But  I  think  in  this  case  it's  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

particularly  easy  principle,  because  here  the  jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  given  any  instruction  on  the  line  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  Justice  Breyer,  in  your  hypothetical, 

 

 

 

 

 

sending  that  letter  over  is  an  "official  act"  under  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions  as  given  and  under  the  theory  pushed  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor  General's  office  in  this  case  because  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  action  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  ­­ I'm  not  sure  ­­ I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  sure  that's  right.  It  seemed  to  me  the  "official 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act"  is  exercise  of  governmental  power  to  require 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens  to  do  or  not  to  do  something,  or  to  shape  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  that  can  ­­ that  governs  their  conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  I  ­­ I  completely  agree  with 

    

   

 

 

 

you,  Justice  Kennedy. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Under  your  view,  under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypotheticals  that  have  been  thrown  around,  the  janitor

who  gets  the  bottle  of  beer  in  order  to  clean  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classroom  first,  I  mean,  is  that  ­­ is  that  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governmental  act? 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Certainly  not  in  my  view, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  government  ­­

 

 

 

            

difference? 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  what's  the 

  

 

 

 

MR.  FRANCISCO:  The  difference  is,  one  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

one  is  you're  exercising  power  on  behalf  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  as  a  whole.  So  the  janitor,  for  example,  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  buying  ­­ if  he's  using  government  money  to  buy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

janitorial  supplies  and  engaging  in  government 

 

 

 

 

 

contracting,  that's  an  exercise  of  governmental  power. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  you're  simply  cleaning  out  a  classroom,  I  don't  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

you're  exercising  government  power. 

 

 

 

            

So,  too,  when  you  simply  send  somebody  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  official  for  an  independent  and  objective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  by  that  official,  but  you  don't  try  to  put  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thumb  on  the  scales  of  that  decision,  you  haven't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crossed  the  line. 

 

 

            

And  I  think  it's  very  important  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  statute  like  this,  because  if  you  really  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  a  referral,  just  simply  making  a  referral,  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

"official  action"  that  crosses  the  line  into  bribery,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  you  do  have  some  very  serious  vagueness  concerns

with  the  Hobbs  Act  and  on  a  services  question  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ask  ­­

   

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Sure  ­­ sure.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

depends  on  who's  making  the  referral  or  the  call,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  Justice  Breyer's  hypothetical,  if  it's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressperson  calling  somebody  and  saying,  could  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  into  this  matter  for  my  constituent,  the  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  look  at  it,  I  suppose,  and  then  ­­ and  that's  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing.  If  it's  the  President  who  calls  and  says,  I  want 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  to  look  at  this  matter  for  my  constituent,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  exercise  considerably  more  influence. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Two  things,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

First,  you  still  do  need  to  tell  the  jury  that  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  have  to  find.  And  here,  the  jury  was  never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told  in  any  way,  shape  or  form  that  they  had  to  find  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempt  to  influence.  So  I  think  that  is  sufficient,  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  of  itself,  to,  at  the  very  least,  require  a  new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  here. 

 

            

Under  these  instructions,  as  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  seems  to  agree,  any  action  within  the  range  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official  duties  constitutes  official  governmental 

 

 

 

 

action. 

            

So  Justice  Kennedy,  in  the  letter  being  sent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  from  a  senator,  since  that  is  within  the  range  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official  duties,  that  counts  under  the  government's

formulation,  and  under  the  jury  instruction  as  given, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  it  is,  after  all,  a  settled  practice  of  officials 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  send  these  kinds  of  letters.  That's  why  it  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbent  upon  the  district  court  to  draw  some  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit. 

            

And  here,  the  jury  could  well  have  agreed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  us  that  even  though  he  was  the  governor  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  he  did  not  try  to  influence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  actual  decision.  He  simply  made  the  same  type  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referral  that  he  made  day  in  and  day  out  during  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administration  where  he  simply  sent  a  constituent  to  the

judgment.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ if  ­­ you  said  something

think  that  ­­ of  the  five  listed  "official  acts,"  do  you

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Two  answers.  First  of  all, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

we  don't  think  that  any  of  them  meet  the  standard.

MR.  FRANCISCO:  But  secondly,  the  jury  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  agreed  with  us  on  that,  given  the  evidence  we  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further.  And  therefore,  the  erroneous  instruction  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

critical  to  this  case,  because  even  if  they  had  agreed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  us,  they  would  have  been  required  to  convict  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  erroneous  instruction  since  ­­ take  the  healthcare

was  an  "official  act"  and  that  was  the  only  basis  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convict,  and  they  could  have  agreed  with  our  evidence  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  That  ­­ that  might  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

right.  It  might  be  that  ­­ that  you  still  have  a  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

winning  argument  even  if  some  of  the  five  are  fine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  ­­ but  if  we  could  just  focus  on  them  for  a  bit.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  for  example,  the  third  one  ­­

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Contacting  other  officials

clinical  studies.  So  that's  the  one  that  seems  to  me  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  fall  within  your  own  definition.  Do  you  disagree

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  I  don't.  And  if 

   

  

  

 

 

 

they  had  actually  proved  what  was  said  in  the  indictment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  case,  I  think  that  this  would  be  a  ­­ we'd  be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  a  different  argument  here.  But  the  problem  is, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  prove  that  Governor  McDonnell  tried  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encourage  anybody.  The  one  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  on  something  like  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your  argument  is  a  sufficiency  argument? 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Rather  than  this  was  ­­ this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  an  "official  act"? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  And  ­­ and  ­­ yes,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  To  be  clear,  we  have  two  separate  arguments 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  One  is  on  the  jury  instructions  where  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  is  that  even  if  they  agreed  with  all  of  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  of  the  facts,  they  still  would  have  been  required 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  convict,  given  these  erroneous  jury  instructions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  secondly,  our  second  argument  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiency  argument.  Even  a  properly  instructed  jury, 

   

  

 

 

 

in  our  view,  could  not  have  concluded  that  Governor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McDonnell  crossed  that  line. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  just  to  be  clear, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ you  said  at  the  outset  you  don't  think  any  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  are  "official  acts,"  but  then  I  thought  I  heard

officials  as  part  of  an  effort  to  encourage  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

research  is  not  an  "official  act"? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  That's  the  indictment,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

Honor.  If  they  had  actually  proved  what  was  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  What  was  ­­ Justice  Kagan 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  asking,  is  that  an  "official  act"? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  If  it  actually  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  If  it's  true,  but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FRANCISCO:  If  he  had  tried  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

encouraged  them  to  do  it,  yes.  If  they  had  proved  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  had  tried  to  encourage  them  to  do  that,  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  an  "official  act." 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  argument  is  that,  first,  the  jury  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  properly  instructed  on  that  question;  and  second, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  never  did  in  fact  urge  university  researchers  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything. 

            

And  if  I  could  just  conclude,  before 

   

 

 

 

 

reserving  the  remainder  of  my  time  for  rebuttal,  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  event  where  he  actually  had  direct  contact  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

university  researchers,  Justice  Kagan,  this  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

luncheon  held  at  the  mansion.  The  ­­ all  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses  who  were  there  actually  testified  as  to  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  with  respect  to  the  Governor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  he  simply  asked  neutral  questions 

 

 

 

 

 

that  didn't  try  to  push  the  researchers'  decisions  one

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MICHAEL  R.  DREEBEN

MR.  DREEBEN:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Petitioner  seeks  a  categorical  carve­out 

   

 

 

from  the  concept  of  an  "official  act"  for  things  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meetings,  phone  calls,  events,  that,  in  his  view,  do  not

counsel  to  President  Reagan.  And  they  say,  quoting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  brief,  that  "if  this  decision  is  upheld,  it  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cripple  the  ability  of  elected  officials  to  fulfill 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  role  in  our  representative  democracy." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  think  it's  extraordinary  that  those 

   

 

 

 

 

people  agree  on  anything. 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  ­­ but  to  agree

MR.  DREEBEN:  It  may  be  extraordinary,  Mr. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice,  but  that  doesn't  make  it  correct.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  rests  on  several  fundamental  misconceptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  what  government  actually  does.  And  I  think  it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

important  to  pause  and  look  at  the  implications  of  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  pay­to­play  theory  of  government  really  is; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  people  can  pay  for  access,  that  they  can  be  charged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  a  meeting  or  have  a  direction  made  to  another 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  official  to  take  the  meeting. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  would  mean,  in  effect,  that  if  somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came  to  me  and  said,  you  know,  I  know  you're  having  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  college  tuition  issues.  We  can  help  you  with

MR.  DREEBEN:  Certainly  not,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

Kennedy.  And  I  ­­

   

  

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Why  certainly  not? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Because  the  critical  issue 

  

 

 

 

 

there  is  whether  the  government  can  prove  a  quid  pro 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quo.  And  now  we're  moving  into  the  realm  of  campaign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contributions,  where  this  Court  has  given  very  strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidance  about  when  a  jury  ­­

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It's  not  a  campaign 

   

  

 

 

contribution.  What  it  is,  is  he  takes  him  to  lunch,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  expensive  lunch  at  that.  Okay?  Because  the  quid 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  is  not  limited.  The  government  has  argued 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuously  that  in  for  a  penny,  in  for  a  pound.  Okay? 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

So  we  don't  have  the  limitation  on  the  quid  side.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  possible  limitation  in  frame  of  mind. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  now  we're  looking  to  the  quo  side.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  want  to  remove  any  limitation  there.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  why  do  I  think  that's  a  problem?  Two 

   

   

  

 

 

 

very  fundamental  reasons.  And  it's  not  because  I'm  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor  of  dishonest  behavior.  I'm  against  it.  And  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  just  listed  some  that  is  dishonest.  My  problem  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  criminal  law  as  the  weapon  to  cure  it.  And  if  the

criminal  law  is  the  weapon  that  goes  as  far  as  you  want, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  two  serious  problems.  One,  political  figures 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  not  know  what  they're  supposed  to  do  and  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  not  supposed  to  do,  and  that's  a  general 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

vagueness  problem. 

 

            

And  the  second  is,  I'd  call  it  a  separation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  powers  problem.  The  Department  of  Justice  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive  Branch  becomes  the  ultimate  arbiter  of  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  officials  are  behaving  in  the  United  States, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State,  local,  and  national.  And  as  you  describe  it,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better  or  for  worse,  it  puts  at  risk  behavior  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common,  particularly  when  the  quid  is  a  lunch  or  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

baseball  ticket,  throughout  this  country. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  suddenly,  to  give  that  kind  of  power  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  criminal  prosecutor,  who  is  virtually  uncontrollable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  dangerous  in  the  separation  of  powers  since.  So  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  mind  ­­ right  in  this  case,  nothing  to  do  with  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner,  nothing  to  do  with  him,  but  in  this  case,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ as  fundamental  a  real  separation  of  ­­ of  powers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  as  I've  seen. 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  I'm  not  quite  certain  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  are.  They  won't  be  perfect.  They  will  leave  some 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dishonest  conduct  unprosecuted.  They  won't  be  perfect. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They  will  put  some  politicians  at  risk.  But  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

searching  for  those  words  because,  as  I  said,  this  is  a

very  basic  separation  of  powers  problem  for  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  appreciate  your  help  on 

    

 

 

 

 

what  the  right  words  are,  and  I'll  tell  you  right  now  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  words  are  going  to  say  when  a  person  has  lunch  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  writes  over  to  the  antitrust  division  and  says,  I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  you  to  meet  with  my  constituent  who  has  just  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evicted  from  her  house,  you  know,  if  that's  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminalize  that  behavior,  I'm  not  buying  into  that,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think. 

 

            

So  ­­ so  I  want  some  words  that  will  help 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  what  I  see  as  as  knotty  and  complicated  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  and  basic  a  problem  as  I  can  think  of. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Justice  Breyer,  let  me  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argue  the  position  that  I  came  here  to  argue,  which  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  "official  action"  is  not  limited  by  some  arbitrary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litmus  test  that  was  proposed  by  Petitioner  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclude  things  that  he  calls  "access."  I  don't  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that's  the  right  way  to  look  at  it.  I  think  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  right  way  to  look  at  this  statute  is  to  recognize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  has  multiple  elements.  We're  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  statutes.  But  the  bribery  offense  has  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar  elements. 

 

            

You  first  have  to  decide  whether  someone  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaging  in  an  "official  act."  Merely  going  to  lunch  is

opportunities  to  engage  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  no  one  said  it  is.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lunch  with  the  Chateau  Lafite  wine  happens  to  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quid,  and  ­­ and  that's  worth,  like,  a  thousand  dollars, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  500,  anyway.  I  don't  go  to  those  restaurants

MR.  DREEBEN:  Justice  Breyer  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  ­­ but  you  understand

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ side.  It's  the  other 

  

  

 

 

 

 

side  of  the  equation. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  understand,  Justice  Breyer. 

    

 

 

 

But  what  ­­ I  would  think  it  would  be  helpful  for  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  if  I  could  lay  out  the  multiple  elements  that  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  issue  here  because  "official  act"  does  not  have  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  work.  You  do  have  to  have  somebody  engaged  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  official  capacity.  You  then  have  to  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  they  do  within  their  range  of  official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duties,  which  going  to  lunch  is  not  going  to  be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Third,  you  need  a  quid  pro  quo,  which  means 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  government  is  going  to  have  to  show  that  the

person  allowed  themselves  to  be  influenced  in  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  by  the  thing  of  value  that  they  received,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  say  that  somebody  is  basically  saying,  I'm  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  a  referral  over  to  another  agency  for  you  only 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  buy  me  lunch.  That  is  not  honorable  behavior, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  there  are  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Of  course  it  isn't. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  ­­ many  regulations  that  carve 

  

 

 

 

 

 

out  permissible  gift  situations  and  create  the  fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  issue  that  I  think  is  an  important  protection, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  mens  rea. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  the  problem  is,  and  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  set  forth  in  your  brief  correctly,  you  can  imply  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement  over  time.  You  can  imply  a  contract  over 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

time.  And  if  the  lunch  takes  place  first  and  there's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  precondition  on  the  lunch,  but  after  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lunch  there  is  wink­wink,  nod­nod,  and  the  contact  takes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place,  it's  clear  in  the  standard  criminal  law  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  conspiracy  there. 

   

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  I  agree  with  you  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  We're  in  agreement. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  do  agree  with  you,  Justice 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy.  I  think  that's  exactly  the  position  that  Your

pro  quo  requirement  as  an  intent  to  issue  in  a  criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  There  is  a  very  critical  protection  here.  It's  a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  of  showing  something  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

doubt  to  a  jury.  And  if  you  have  ordinary  conduct 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  fully  disclosed  and  in  accordance  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  which  do  strictly  limit  when  people  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive  lunches  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  don't  see  what  the 

    

 

 

 

 

relevance  of  those  regulations  is.  You  say  ­­ you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  certain  safe  harbors  created  by  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations.  Those  apply  to  Federal  employees  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  officers.  What  do  they  have  to  do  with  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Governor  of  a  State  or  a  State  employee? 

   

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  they  don't,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Alito.  This  case  has  been  litigated  on  the  submission 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Section  201  informed  the  meeting  of  "official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action"  for  purposes  of  the  Hobbs  Act  and  the  honest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services  statute.  And  as  a  result,  the  parties  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

engaged  very  heavily  on  the  effect  on  Federal  officials. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  that  Justice  Breyer's  question  was  primarily 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

directed  at  them. 

 

 

              

I  do  think  that  there  are  different  issues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  arise  with  respect  to  State  officials,  but  the  mens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rea  requirements  that  I've  been  talking  about  are  going

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  then  this  ­­ this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

asking  ­­

 

            

doesn't  answer  Justice  Breyer's  basic  question  and  ours. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  going  to  tell  the  Senators,  the  officials  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lunches,  that,  don't  worry.  The  jury  has  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convinced  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  and  that's  tough.

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That  was  your  answer. 

  

 

 

 

 

That  was  your  answer. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Justice  Kennedy,  I  do  think 

   

  

 

 

 

that  the  requirements  of  the  criminal  law  in  proving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  by  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  are  a  substantial 

   

   

 

 

 

 

­­

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  is  it  they're  trying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  prove?  Now,  of  course,  this  is  a  State  case,  not  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  case.  It's  a  State  official  ­­ it's  a  Federal 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

law  but  a  State  official.  I  don't  know.  I've  only  been 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

peripherally  involved  in  political  campaigns,  but  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

peripheral  convinces  me  that  a  candidate  will  go  out  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he'll  have  lunch  with  hundreds  of  people,  hundreds. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Everybody  wants  to  give  him  lunch.  Great.  And  ­­ and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  wants  to  meet  as  many  people  as  possible.  He  wants

receive  all  kinds  of  things.  And  at  some  point,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes  very  dishonest. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  that's  a  matter  for 

   

  

 

 

 

campaign  laws. 

 

            

Wait.  Now,  I've  also  been  involved  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Department.  And  we  would  receive  many,  many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

letters  in  the  antitrust  division.  Have  you  looked  into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  and  such?  I  know  perfectly  well  that  that  Senator 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  wants  to  go  back  to  the  constituent  and  say,  see,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  my  best.  That's  all. 

  

 

 

 

            

Now,  you're  saying  to  the  jury,  take  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  I  just  gave  you,  and  you  look  into  the  state  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind  ­­ the  state  of  mind  of  which  the  amounts  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  will  be  somewhat  indicative,  of  which  the  nature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  letter  will  be  somewhat  indicative,  of  whether  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

writes  in  personal  writing  at  the  bottom  will  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat  indicative,  and  we're  going  to  let  you  12 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  work  out  what  was  really  in  that  Senator's  mind. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  say  that  is  a  recipe  for  giving  the  Department  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  and  the  prosecutors  enormous  power  over  elected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officials  who  are  not  necessarily  behaving  honestly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  am  looking  for  the  line.  I  am  looking 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  line  that  will  control  the  shift  of  power  that  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fear  without  allowing  too  much  honesty  through  this  law.

You  know,  other  laws  exist  on  the  other  side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  Justice  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That  ­­ that's  what  I  want 

   

  

 

 

 

 

your  view  on. 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Justice  Breyer,  I'm  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

push  back,  because  I  think  that  the  line  that  Petitioner 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  urged  is  one  that  is  a  recipe  for  corruption,  not  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipe  for  drawing  a  safe  harbor  for  public  officials. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  he  has  basically  urged  the  Court  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold  is  that  paying  for  access,  if  somebody  does  not  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  thumb  on  the  scale  of  decision  ­­ if  I,  for  example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  the  criminal  division,  take  the  meeting,  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  recommendation  is  in  your  best  judgment,  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  the  meeting,  I  can  take  money  for  that.  And  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  message  that  would  be  sent,  if  this  Court  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  imprimatur  on  a  scheme  of  government  in  which  public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officials  were  not  committing  bribery  when  all  they  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  arrange  meetings  with  other  governmental  officials, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  putting,  in  his  metaphorical  way,  a  thumb  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scales  of  the  ultimate  decision,  would  send  a  terrible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

message  to  citizens.  What  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  what  I  think  we're 

   

  

 

 

 

looking  for  is  some  limiting  principle.  Now,  you  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

started  to  say  something  about  campaign  contributions  ­­

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ and  I  know  that  this  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  involve  campaign  contributions.  But  certainly  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

campaign  contribution  can  be  the  quid,  can  it  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Certainly. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  All  right.  Well,  gaining 

  

  

 

 

 

access  by  making  campaign  contributions  is  an  everyday 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurrence.  And  maybe  it's  a  bad  thing,  but  it's  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

widespread.  How  does  it  ­­ how  does  that  play  out? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So,  Justice  Alito,  gaining 

  

 

 

 

 

access  and  ingratiation  and  gratitude  as  a  result  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

campaign  contributions  is  not  a  crime.  When  it's  done 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  quid  pro  quo,  it  is.  And  that  is  not  the  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  ­­

  

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  That  is  not  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  what  I  want,  your 

   

  

 

 

 

view. 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  That  is  not  my  view,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But,  I  mean  ­­

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Mr.  Dreeben,  if  I  could  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

follow  up  on  that. 

 

 

 

            

If  a  ­­ a  Senator  writes  to  a  Federal  agency 

   

   

   

 

 

 

and  says,  this  union  or  this  company  is,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical  to  the  economy  of  my  State,  and,  by  the  way  ­­

biggest  contributors  to  his  campaign  ­­ would  you  please 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meet  with  them?  What  would  not  make  that  a  crime?  The 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  the  jury  might  not  find  beyond  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt  that  the  reason  why  he  was  urging  this  meeting  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  these  people,  this  entity,  happened  to  be  a  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

big  supporter?  That  would  be  the  only  thing  separating 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawful  from  unlawful  conduct  there? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  let  ­­ let  me  say  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  in  response  to  that.  First,  this  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed  that  very  issue  in  the  McCormick  case.  And  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  established  that  merely  taking  favorable  action  at  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around  the  time  of  the  receipt  of  campaign  contributions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  sufficient  to  show  a  quid  pro  quo  and  is  not  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime. 

            

Nobody  doubts  that  if  there's  a  quid  pro  quo 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  vote,  something  that  I  think  Mr.  Francisco  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

prepared  to  concede  is  "official  action,"  although  I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  sure  why  since  it  doesn't  personally  exercise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign  power  if  a  legislator  casts  vote  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

dissenting  vote  from  a  majority  action.  But  nobody 

   

  

 

 

 

 

disputes  that  that  is  a  crime.  Therefore,  this  Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  already  carved  out  evidentiary  and  instructional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

safeguards  that  prevent  against  a  jury  inferring  a  quid 

   

   

 

 

 

 

pro  quo  merely  from  the  coincidence  of  timing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  want  to  come  back  to  something  that  is

even  more  fundamental,  and  that  is  the  role  of  the  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  in  this  case.  Because  Petitioner  has  sought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  wrap  himself  in  the  mantle  of  the  First  Amendment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  because  the  gifts  that  he  received  have  nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  with  the  First  Amendment;  they  have  to  do  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal  loans  and  luxury  goods. 

 

 

 

 

            

This  is  not  a  case  about  campaign 

   

 

 

 

 

contributions.  But  when  campaign  contributions  are  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

issue,  he  relies  very  heavily  on  Citizens  United  while 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignoring  a  critical  piece  of  Citizens  United. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court,  in  Citizens  United,  looked  back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  circumstances  that  prompted  the  Federal  Election 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Campaign  Act  in  1972,  and  those  involve  circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  delineated  in  the  Buckley  decision  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  of  appeals. 

 

 

            

And  the  Court  specifically  cited  to  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practices.  And  what  were  those  practices?  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

involved  the  American  milk  producers  paying  $2  million 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  campaign  contributions,  spread  out  among  a  variety  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

committees,  to  get  a  meeting  at  the  White  House.  That's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  they  did.  They  said,  in  order  to  gain  a  meeting 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  White  House  officials  on  price  supports,  they  paid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  money. 

 

            

Other  corporate  executives  testified  that 

 

 

 

 

paying  money  was  a  calling  card,  something  that  would

get  us  in  the  door  and  make  our  point  of  view  heard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  this  Court  said,  on  page  356  of  the  Citizens  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion,  "The  practices  Buckley  noted  would  be  covered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  bribery  laws,  CEG  18  U.S.C.  201,  if  a  quid  pro 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quo  arrangement  were  proved." 

 

 

 

            

Now,  of  course,  it's  very  difficult  to  prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  quid  pro  quo  arrangement,  and  that's  why  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

campaign  finance  limitations  on  contributions  to 

 

 

 

 

 

candidates.  But  the  Court  had  no  doubt  that  paying  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access  was  a  criminal  violation.  And  so  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  And  that's  what  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ if  you  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

governor  whose  priority  is  jobs  for  his  State,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  CEO  who's  thinking  about  locating  a  plant  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

his  State,  but  he  can  only  do  it,  he  says,  if  he  gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tax  credits  from  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  governor  is  talking  to  him,  and  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  look,  why  don't  you  come  down  to  my,  you  know,

this.  And  the  governor  does  that.  He  has  a  nice  day 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fishing  for  trout,  and  they  talk  about  whether  they  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  tax  credits,  deferred  taxes  if  the  CEO  opens  his

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  ­­

    

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ accepted  an 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

afternoon  of  trout  fishing,  and  he  discussed  official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  at  that  time? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  don't  think  so,  Mr.  Chief 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Justice,  but  if  you  change  the  hypothetical  and  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead  of  an  afternoon  of  trout  fitting  ­­ fishing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll  fly  you  out  to  Hawaii  and  you  and  your  family  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  vacation,  and  during  that  time  we  can  go  over  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  I  thought  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

didn't  think  the  government  put  any  weight  on  the  amount 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  quid;  in  other  words,  you  know  ­­ okay.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  how  much  an  afternoon  of  trout  fishing  is  worth, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  ­­ I  gather  you  get  ­­ you  can  be  charged  for  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  pay  for  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  thought  that  didn't  matter.  I  thought  it 

    

 

 

 

 

was  whether  he  was  engaged  in  an  "official  act"  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  in  which  a  jury  could  find  he  did  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  the  gift. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  ­­ and  so  if  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  doing  is  talking  about  ways  to  get  jobs  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Virginia,  and  he's  talking  with  the  person  who's  going

part  on  whether  or  not  he  gets,  you  know,  tax  credits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  seem  to  me  that  under  your  definition,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governor  is  guilty  of  a  felony. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I'm  not  sure  that  he  is  guilty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  felony.  But  the  reason  why  I  changed  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  to  involve  a  larger  quid  is  because  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

implications  of  carving  something  out  from  "official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action"  mean  that  it  can  be  sold,  and  that  it's  lawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  sold.  And  when  you  change  the  trout  fishing  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trip  to  Hawaii,  it  becomes  more  nefarious,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

message  that  it  sends  to  citizens  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  that's  the  point.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

see,  what  ­­ exactly  what  the  Chief  Justice  asked. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What's  the  lower  limit,  in  the  government's  opinion,  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  quid?  What?  Tell  me  right  now.  What  ­­ if  you're 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  say  $10,000,  okay,  I  feel  quite  differently 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  this.  If  you  will  say  an  afternoon  of  trout 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fishing  or  et  cetera,  then  I  feel  quite  differently. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  pretty  hard  to  see  the  conduct  being  honest  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exempt  the  campaign  contributions  and  put  it  up

the  government's  position  that  the  trout  fishing

thing  that  really  you  could  possibly  do  to  remedy  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  is  to  shrink  the  definition  of  "official  action"

Citizens  United,  so  whatever  that  said  there,  but  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  ­­ the  ­­ but  the  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  one  I  raised  at  the  beginning  that  every  single 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  us  has  raised.  We're  worried  about  ­­ because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  any  other  organization,  the  prosecutors  too  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overly  zealous.  That  can  happen.  And  so  we  need  some 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection  on  both  sides,  even  though  the  line  won't  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfect.  And  it  will  fail  to  catch  some  crooks.  And  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  ­­ I  mean,  I  understand  that.  And  ­­ and  I  want  to 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

know  your  view.  And  it  doesn't  even  ­­ it  helps  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little,  but  not  a  lot,  to  say,  well,  meetings.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  too  specific.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

want  to  know  what  your  view  is  as  to  the  language  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

write  in  discussing  the  line. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  don't  think  you  and  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

agree  on  where  the  line  should  be,  Justice  Breyer.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  can't  write  language  that  is  going  to  satisfy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you.  You  weren't  even  satisfied  with  Petitioner's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

language,  which  requires  that  there  be  influence  on  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  governmental  decision.  You  suggested  you  thought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  too  broad. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  no,  no.  Well,  yeah, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

yeah,  yeah,  yeah. 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  You  did  suggest  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  did  ­­

    

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  think  that  it's  too  narrow. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  that  if  the  Court  is  going  to  reject  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  submission,  which  is  that  when  the  governor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calls  his  Secretary  of  Health  and  says,  take  the  meeting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  my  benefactor,  he  doesn't  disclose  it's  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefactor.  Take  the  meeting  so  that  that  person  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  preferential  opportunity  that  other  citizens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  do  not  pay  will  have  to  make  his  case  before  you.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  is  "official  action." 

 

 

 

 

            

Petitioner  says  it's  not  "official  action"

unless  he  further  sends  the  message,  which  I  think  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  facts  of  this  case  was  sent,  he's  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence  the  ultimate  outcome. 

 

 

 

            

If  the  Court  is  going  to  reject  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  position  in  this  case,  then  I  think  that  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fallback  position  for  the  government  is  when  you  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indisputed  "official  action,"  such  as  will  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

universities  of  Virginia  study  a  particular  product,  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

will  the  Tobacco  Commission  fund  it,  then  when  a  public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official  takes  action  to  direct  that  decision,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence  that  decision,  or  to  advance  his  benefactor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  with  respect  to  that  decision,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutes  the  crime  of  bribery.

MR.  DREEBEN:  Now  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Given  the  difficulty 

  

 

 

 

 

that  we're  having  in  settling  on  what  these  words  in  the

Petitioner's  brief  that  you  have  responded  to  in  yours 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  statute  is  unconstitutionally  vague. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  ­­ I  do  not  think  it  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutionally  vague.  First  of  all,  we're  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here  about  multiple  statutes.  We're  talking  about  Hobbs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act  extortion,  which  this  Court  previously  construed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  McCormick  and  Evans  to  be  perfectly  valid  upon  the

proof  of  a  quid  pro  quo  when  the  official  asserts  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  action  will  be  controlled  by  a  ­­ a  thing  of  value 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  has  received. 

 

 

 

            

And  now  we're  talking  about  the  question  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  constitutes  "official  action"  for  the  purposes  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common  law  crime  that  goes  back  centuries  and  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated  into  the  Hobbs  Act. 

 

 

 

 

            

We're  also  talking  about  the  honest­services 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  which  this  Court  in  Skilling  just  six  years  ago 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined  could  be  construed  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  yeah.  "Could 

  

  

 

 

 

be  construed."  I  mean,  there  were,  what,  three  votes  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  it  unconstitutional?  And  the  others  say,  well,  no, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  can  narrow  it  in  this  way  to  the  core 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  bribery.  And  now  maybe  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience  we've  had  here,  and  the  difficulty  of  coming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  with  clear  enough  instructions  suggests  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caution  the  Court  showed  at  that  point  was  ill­advised. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  I  think  it  would  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

absolutely  stunning  if  this  Court  said  that  bribery  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corruption  laws,  which  have  been  on  the  books  since  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning  of  this  nation,  and  have  been  consistently

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ absolutely  stunning  to 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

say  that  the  government  has  given  us  no  workable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard? 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Well,  we  have  given  you  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

workable  standard.  It's  the  standard  that  comes  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  1914  decision  in  Birdsall,  where  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  things  that  government  officials  do  under  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bribery  statute  much  like  this  are  covered  as  official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action,  and  they're  not  limited  to  things  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Perhaps  what  you're 

  

 

 

 

talking  about  is  how  evil  the  conspiracy  is.  It's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evil  to  ­­ to  fish  or  to  have  a  bottle  of  wine,  but  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  evil  if  you  up  the  ante.  Is  that  ­­ is  that  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  saying? 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  I  think  what  I'm  trying  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

say,  Justice  Kennedy,  is  that  it's  going  to  be  extremely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  for  anyone  to  really  believe  that  you  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buy  a  Governor's  position  on  a  multimillion­dollar  tax 

   

   

 

 

 

support  for  an  afternoon  of  trout  fishing.  And  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  those  cases  don't  get  brought.  No  one  thinks  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  It's  not  really  even  clear  there  is  a  quid  pro 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quo  for  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ask  you  a  narrower 

   

   

  

 

 

question,  Mr.  Dreeben?

So  one  of  the  "official  acts"  here  ­­ I'll 

 

 

 

 

 

just  read  it  to  you.  It's  allowing  Jonnie  Williams  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invite  individuals  important  to  Star  Scientific's 

 

 

 

 

 

business  to  exclusive  events  at  the  Governor's  Mansion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  that's  essentially 

  

 

 

 

hosting  a  party  and  allowing  Mr.  Williams  to  invite  some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  And  why  does  that  ­­ why  is  that  an  "official 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act,"  in  your  view? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So,  Justice  Kagan,  it  wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hosting  an  official  party.  We're  talking  about  here  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

events.  One  was  a  product  launch  hosted  at  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Governor's  Mansion  where  the  Governor  is  basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving  his  credibility  to  a  brand­new  product.  And  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

invitations  were  critical  to  Jonnie  Williams'  plan  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sign  up  the  universities  to  do  the  studies.  He  got  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pick  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  here's,  I  guess  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

mean,  I  guess,  my  question  is  this:  The  ­­ the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"official  act,"  the  statute,  the  definition,  I  mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

requires  that  there  be  some  particular  matter,  cause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit,  proceeding,  or  controversy,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  if  I  understand  the 

   

  

 

 

 

theory  of  this  case,  the  matter,  suit,  cause,

proceeding,  or  controversy  here  is  the  attempt  to  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  University  of  Virginia  to  do  clinical  studies  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  product;  is  that  correct? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  It's  narrower  than  our  whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

scope  of  the  charge,  but  it's  essentially  correct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

thing? 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That's  the  gravamen  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  DREEBEN:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  if  you  had  just  ­­ if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  indictment,  and  then  the  instructions  that  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  the  indictment,  had  said  the  "official  act"  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  the  University  of  Virginia  to  do  clinical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

studies,  right,  that  reads  very  differently  from  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  indictment  was  structured.  Because  what  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

indictment  does  is  it  takes  a  lot  of  different  pieces  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  might  relate  to  that  "official  act"  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charges  them  as  "official  acts"  themselves,  so  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  becomes  an  "official  act"  or  calling  somebody  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  talk  about  the  product  becomes  an  "official  act."  Do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  see  what  I  mean? 

   

 

 

              

I  mean,  you  know,  this  might  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly  chargeable  and  instructable,  but  I  guess 

   

 

 

 

 

I'm  ­­ I'm  troubled  by  these  particular  charges  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions,  which  seems  to  make  every  piece  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  you  had  an  "official  act,"  rather  than

just  saying  the  "official  act"  was  the  ­­ was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempt  to  get  the  University  of  Virginia  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  they  wouldn't  have  done  otherwise. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  So,  Justice  Kagan,  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

crime  was  here  was  the  Governor  accepting  things  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value  in  return  for  being  influenced  and  taking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"official  actions"  to  legitimize,  promote,  and  secure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

research  studies  for  Anatabloc  and  Star's  products. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  at  Supplemental  JA  14. 

 

 

 

 

            

It  then  alleges  that  he  would  do  this  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunities  arose  in  the  course  of  his  official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions.  And  because  he's  the  Governor  and  he  has  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tremendous  amount  of  influence  throughout  the 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  he  appoints  all  the  board  of  visitors  of  VCU 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  UVA.  He  sets  the  budget.  They  know  that  he's  an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  guy.  He  has  lots  of  opportunities  to  do  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  different  ways  over  time. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  look  at  the  pattern  of  what  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did,  directing  people  to  meet  with  Star's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representatives,  arranging  events  at  the  mansion  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  Star  could  bring  together  its  chosen  guest  list, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  doctors  who  it  wanted  to  influence  with  the  Star 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  were  trying  to  influence  it,  the  Governor  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking  every  step  he  can  do  short  of  saying  to  UVA,  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  studies,  which  his  chief  counsel  told  him  would  be

So  I  ­­ I  think  that  if  you  look  at  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

indictment  the  way  that  it's  actually  structured,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks  about  a  person  who,  as  opportunities  arose,  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  engage  in  "official  acts."  This  is  a  theory  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corruption  that  Justice  Sotomayor's  opinion  in  Ganim  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Second  Circuit  validated,  and  it  was  cited  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Skilling  as  a  perfectly  valid  theory  of  corruption. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  therefore,  the  individual  "official 

 

 

 

 

acts"  really  form  a  composite  window  into  Petitioner's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

mind.  Did  he  intend  to  allow  his  official  conduct  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controlled  by  the  things  of  value  that  he  received?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking  them  all  together,  even  if  the  Court  has  trouble 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  any  individual  one,  they  allowed  a  rational  jury  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inference  that,  indeed,  he  did. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  only  way  that  Petitioner  could  win, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  agree  with  me  on  the  sufficiency  issue,  is  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclude  that  jury  instructions  must  exempt  certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

types  of  official  actions,  like  directing  your  Secretary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Health  to  take  a  meeting,  which  is  a  very  kind  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  event  in  the  life  of  a  cabinet  member  and  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governor,  or  hosting  an  event  at  the  mansion,  can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibly  count,  because  it  somehow  should  be  viewed  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

social,  when,  in  fact,  what  the  Governor  is  doing  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowing  his  benefactor  to  get  all  the  people  in  the

room  who  he  wants  to  influence  to  do  the  studies. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  my  view,  there  was  nothing  wrong  ­­ if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  can  complete  the  sentence  ­­ in  the  way  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indictment  structured  the  crime  in  this  case.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"official  acts"  were  exemplary.  They  were  proved,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  jury  could  properly  find  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you. 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Francisco,  five  minutes  remaining. 

 

 

 

 

         

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  NOEL  J.  FRANCISCO 

 

 

 

 

 

                 

ON  BEHALF  OF  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

            

Justice. 

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

              

I  have  three  basic  points  I  would  like  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

make. 

            

First,  I'd  like  to  start  out  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  argument  that  a  lot  of  the  problems  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  theory  are  solved  by  the  quid  pro  quo  requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well,  in  fact,  the  gratuity  statute,  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gratuity  statute,  has  the  exact  same  "official  act" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  but  no  quid  pro  quo  requirement  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  that  means  is  that  if  you  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  to  a  fancy  lunch  with  a  ­­ I  can't  remember  the 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

name  of  the  bottle  of  wine  you  mentioned,  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  but  if  you  took  them  to  that  fancy  lunch  to

thank  them  for  referring  you  to  a  meeting  with  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mid­level  staffer,  even  if  there  was  no  suggestion  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  that  you  were  going  to  do  anything  other  than  call 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  staffer  and  say,  hey,  can  you  take  a  meeting  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  guy,  hear  him  out,  and  exercise  your  independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment,  that  would  be  a  violation  of  the  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

gratuity  statute. 

 

            

 

And,  indeed,  under  the  government's  broad 

 

 

 

 

theory  that  anything  within  the  range  of  official  duties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counts,  that  means  that  if  you  took  the  person  out  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  lunch  as  thanks  for  giving  you  a  tour  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Capitol  Building,  you  would  likewise  have  violated  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  gratuity  statute,  because  there,  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quid  pro  quo  requirement  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Point  two,  Justice  Breyer  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  There  is  a  difference 

   

  

 

 

between  someone  saying,  thank  you  for  a  decision  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  independent  of  the  gift  ­­ that's  the  Sun  Growers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  ­­ and  someone  buying  you  an  expensive  lunch  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  I'm  paying  for  this  lunch,  but  make  sure  I  get  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tour.  You  don't  see  the  difference? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Not  under  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

gratuity  statute,  Your  Honor,  because  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gratuity  statute  is  meant  to  prohibit  thanking  somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  giving  you  an  "official  act."  And  so  if  an

"official  act"  is,  in  fact,  a  tour  of  the  Capitol 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Building  or  a  meeting  with  a  staffer,  then  you  have,  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  violated  the  Federal  gratuity  statute  when  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  them  to  lunch  as  a  thanks  for  that  particular  act. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

Second  point,  Justice  Breyer,  in  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

figure  out  the  right  verbal  formulation,  the  first  point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd  like  to  make  is,  if  we  can't  figure  out  a  proper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verbal  formulation,  then  I  think  there  are  some  ver 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious  vagueness  problems  with  the  statute  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It's  Birdsall. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It's  Birdsall.  Look,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

can  ­­ I've  read  the  Brown  Commission  Report.  I've  read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Model  Penal  Code.  I've  read  all  these  efforts  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  language.  And  I've  looked  at  the  present  statute. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  I  can  limit  that  because  the  statute, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

itself,  seems  to  cover  things  like  voting  and  contracts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

et  cetera.  But  it's  also  true  that  a  person  who  tries 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  influence  those  things  has  committed  bribery.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  correct. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  And  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Now,  my  problem  is  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Birdsall  and  how  do  we  write  those  words  so  that  they  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

catch  people  who  are  doing  this  dishonest  thing  without,

freedom  to  go  and  do  these  ridiculous  cases.

Circuit's  en  banc  decision  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Not  saying  this  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ridiculous  one,  by  the  way. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Understood,  Your  Honor.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

think  that  the  right  answer,  you  start  out  with  the  D.C. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's  decision  in  Valdes.  You  look  at  that  listing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  words  ­­

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Uh­huh. 

  

 

MR.  FRANCISCO:  ­­ question,  matter,  suit, 

  

 

 

 

 

cause  proceeding.  And  those  are  actual  decisions  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  makes,  the  government  as  a  whole,  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereign.  And  then  you  say,  are  you  making  a  decision 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  that,  if  you're  the  final  decisionmaker,  or  if  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  final  decisionmaker,  but  because  of  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official  power,  you  have  the  ­­ the  ability  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  influence  other  decision­makers,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  ­­ are  you  doing  that?  Here  are  two

you  are  urging,  then  every  government  official  can  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  want  to  have  a  meeting?  Pay  me  a  thousand  dollars.

it's  okay  to  facilitate  a  meeting,  it's  okay  to  say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll  do  it  for  you  if  you  pay  me  a  thousand  dollars. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  your  view,  that  that  would  be  okay? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Your  Honor,  and,  frankly, 

  

 

 

 

 

this  was  leading  to  my  third  point,  which  is,  if  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  absolutely  no  way  that  ­­ if  there's  no  indicia  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  actually  trying  to  influence  the  outcome,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  is  just  a  meeting,  yes.  But  that  reflects  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  these  broad  and  vague  statutes  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comprehensive  codes  of  ethical  conduct.  There  are  lots 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  other  statutes  that  would  prohibit  precisely  what  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  suggesting,  Justice  O'Connor,  and  you  don't  have  to

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That  hasn't  happened  in 

  

 

 

 

 

quite  some  time. 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Justice  Ginsburg.  I  am

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Justice  Ginsburg,  my 

  

 

 

 

apologies. 

            

There  are  lots  of  other  statutes  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibit  that  precise  conduct,  and  you  don't  need  to

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  what  would  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Francisco,  just  take  Mr.  Dreeben's  own  example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  the  example  of  somebody  ­­ he's  running  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business,  and  he's  taking  $5,000  at  a  pop  every  time  he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arranges  a  meeting  with  the  criminal  division  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

somebody. 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  Sure.  There  is  a  statute 

   

  

  

 

 

that  prohibits  supplementing  your  public  salary  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  money.  So  if  you're  essentially  taking  outside 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  for  the  performance  of  your  official  duties, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  illegal.  That  was  discussed  in  the  Sun­Diamond 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

There  is  another  statute  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibits  you  from  doing  any  ­­ taking  anything  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  whose  interests  could  be  substantially  affected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  performance  or  nonperformance  of  your  duties.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  another  one.  It  would  prohibit  ­­ that  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibit  it. 

 

            

There  is  another  provision  of  this  bribery 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  that  prohibits  you  from  taking  any  action,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  "official  action"  but  any  action  in  violation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  official  duties.  So  I  think  that  might  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  aren't  they  any  less 

  

 

 

 

 

 

vague?  And  what  you're  saying  is  that  holding  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meeting,  taking  a  phone  call,  having  a  party  is  not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

illegal,  that  that  is  something  that  you're  entitled  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do.  So  why  would  all  those  statutes  be  any  less  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FRANCISCO:  They  may  well  be  in  certain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances,  but  I  think  that  the  ones  that  are  simply 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  ­­ for  example,  the  civil  service  statutes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  say,  you  can't  take  anything  from  anybody  who  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  covered  person.  That's  not  vague.  It  just  says  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  take  anything  from  anybody  who  is  in  your  job. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Most  Federal  government  officials  are  very 

 

 

 

 

 

familiar  with  that.  That's  why  you  really  just  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  gifts  from  anyone.  The  problem  here  is  that  we  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  State  regime  that  was  much  less  stringent  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  regime,  and  the  government  wanted  to  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open­ended  Hobbs  Act  and  honest­services  statute  to  fill 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  gap  in  what  they  perceived  is  the  State  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  would  respectfully  submit  that  that  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inappropriate  use  of  Federal  power. 

 

 

 

 

            

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Dreeben,  could  I  invite  you  to  return  to

the  second  person  to  reach  that  rare  milestone  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

century. 

              

I  distinctly  recall  your  first  argument  in 

 

 

 

 

 

January  of  1989.  Throughout  your  career,  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistently  advocated  positions  on  behalf  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  in  an  exemplary  manner. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On  behalf  of  the  Court,  I  extend  to  you  our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appreciation  for  the  many  years  of  advocacy  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dedicated  service  during  your  tenure  in  the  Solicitor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General's  Office  and  as  an  officer  of  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  look  forward  to  hearing  from  you  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  times.  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

            

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  DREEBEN:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

            

(Whereupon,  at  11:04  a.m.,  the  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
