of the time, alternative doctrines like the requirement

11  the Netherlands, I believe their juris -- their 
12  provisions enforcing the international criminal court 
13  might --

16  probably is in this case, a number of plaintiffs, they 
17  can sue in a number of different countries, right?  Some 
18  will sue in the United States, others in the United 
19  Kingdom, others in the Netherlands?
 MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, it -- it is possible 
20
21  that the plaintiffs could have sued in other places. 
22  They sued here because this is where they live.  This is 
23  their adopted homeland because of that.

7  what -- whether there's been a violation of the

9
10
11  yes, they do. 
12
13  international tribunals that have a limited 
14  jurisdiction, and they decide.  There are some ad hoc 
tribunals that decide other cases.  And the national --
15
16  national courts have always been engines of decision 
17  making on -- on international law. 
18
19  this statute comes from the founders' desire to have 
20
21
22  been the deciders when -- when the violation occurs 
23  within the nation.  But to give national courts

 MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, there is the possibility 

of exhaustion of local remedies.  I know the European 

1  international law is something else, it seems to me. 
2
 MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, it's -- it's unlikely 
3  that -- that that would come up, because the suit could 
4  be brought in the United States.  It's also unlikely, 
because, based on most forum non conveniens doctrines,

22  States says going forward at all raises those questions, 
23  that it would be able to go up on a Cohen v. --
24
25

a court would decide whether to go forward.  If the 
United States believed that -- that the case should be 
dismissed, as I understand the U.S. position in past 
cases like Doe v. Exxon, is that -- that there should be 
interlocutory appeal from -- from a denial of a 
political question doctrine decision to go forward in 
light of that.

 MR. HOFFMAN:  Well --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That would get rid of this 

1  rights violation, that the court should dismiss on 
2  political question grounds, and the courts did dismiss 
3  on political question grounds. 
4
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Couldn't you just say if --
would we have the power to say, looking at Sosa and the 
5
6  principles that narrow considerably the subject matter 
7  of this statute, to add a requirement that if the State 
8  Department says that it interferes with foreign 
9  relations it doesn't fall within the statute, can't

4  a corporation in the United States, in cahoots with the 
Government or something, should do the unusual thing of

including the ones who have submitted amici arguing --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And it provides for a 
1
2  very simple rule.  Please explain to me what's wrong 
3  with it.  It basically says you have to borrow both the 
4  substantive and procedural international law norms; that 
those norms do permit these foreign-cubed cases only so 
5
6  long as either, it appears to me, the defendant is a 
7  citizen of the country, the acts occurred within that 
8  country, or the alien has exhausted both domestic and 
9  international avenues for relief, a sort of forum by 
10
11

14  like England and The Netherlands.
 MR. HOFFMAN:  Right. 
15
16
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It seems to me like a 
17  fairly simple set of rules clearly defined and limiting 
18  the application of this statute in a way that sort of 
19  makes sense.

22  rule? 
 MR. HOFFMAN:  I don't think there is a lot 
23
24  wrong with the rule, actually.  In a foreign-cubed kind 
of case, it seems to me the EU position is, number one, 
25

 MR. HOFFMAN:  Right. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- different points, 

 MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, I think --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's wrong with the 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So answer me why is this 
not the case where on the facts there has been a failure 
to exhaust. 

1  that there is universal jurisdiction, no matter whether 
2  you consider the Federal Commonwealth cause of action 
3  prescriptive or not.  And so, the countries of the world 
4  have agreed that all states have an interest in 
5
6  international law.  And that -- that what goes with that 
7  are limits of exhaustion of remedies under international 
8  law, which guard -- safeguards the interests of third 
9  states before the United States can --
10
11 
12 
13
14  we would -- there's no record, obviously, about that. 
And one of the arguments we would make about exhaustion, 
15
16  I believe, is that it would have been futile to exhaust 
17  under international law -- under international law 
18  standards. 
19

21  and the Netherlands. 
 MR. HOFFMAN:  Right.  And I think that we --

2  of those nations said they would not entertain this 
3  case? 
4
fact, the -- you know, there is a recent Dutch decision 
5
6  that goes perhaps farther than the Alien Tort Statute, 
7  the Al Brujaj case. 
8
9  Hoffman, that if there were an exhaustion requirement, 
10
11 
12
13  how the Court frames it.  I mean, there's the exhaustion 
14  requirement under the Torture Victim Protection Act, 
there are other arguments about what that looks like 
15
16  under international law.  I mean, I think that -- to 
17  follow up on Justice Sotomayor's point, I think that if 
18  that's deemed by the Court to be a requirement of 
19  international law, then international law rules on 
exhaustion should apply, and we would either be able to 
20
21  satisfy them or not or take whatever position we would 
22  take with respect to that. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the U.K. -- the U.K. 
23
24  and the Netherlands, I -- well, I'll ask you.  Do you 
disagree that those are fair judicial systems where a

they obviously are. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if that's so, then 

 MR. HOFFMAN:  Well --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- when it has nothing to do 

1  plaintiff can get a fair shake? 
2
 MR. HOFFMAN:  Yeah.  No, I don't think that 
3  anybody disputes that -- that the legal systems in the 
4  Netherlands or the United Kingdom are fair.  I mean, 
5
6
7  what does this case -- why does this case belong in the 
8  courts of the United States --
9
10
11 
with the United States other than the fact that a 
12 
subsidiary of the defendant has a big operation here? 
13
 MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, it -- it -- from our 
14  standpoint it's here, the way I started the argument, 
really, which is that our clients are here, they're 
15
16  here.  Their -- personal jurisdiction has not been 
17  contested and no one made a forum non conveniens motion 
18  in this particular case.  Now, there was a forum non 
19  conveniens motion in a companion case.  So -- but I 
think that that's a problem that goes more toward --
20
21
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what happened to 
22  that? 
23
24  overturned the district court on forum non conveniens.
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Overturned it which way? 

 MR. HOFFMAN:  It -- the Second Circuit 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. HOFFMAN:  It said that the case -- that 

non conveniens, generally speaking, is going to deal 
with the problem -- the problems that the Court has 
raised.  If -- if the Court believes that the Wiwa 
decision was wrong or that that doctrine's wrong, that 
doctrine should be changed.

1
2  the Wiwa case could proceed and --
3
4  non conveniens.
 MR. HOFFMAN:  Rejected forum non conveniens 
5
6  in that case.  And I know that the United States brief 
7  believes that that was wrongly decided.  But from our 
8  standpoint, the -- if we're talking about the way that 
9  the ATS should be structured, our belief is that forum 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  about your reliance on the Alien Tort Statute, but if 
17  your theory is that this is a violation of a universal 
18  norm, and that Federal common law makes it a claim 
19  available in the United States, now there is 1331 
20
21
22  Tort Statute, I'm suing under 1331 Federal question 
23  jurisdiction, and I have got the -- the claim for relief 
24  is the U.S. common law implementing the international

general Federal question jurisdiction.

that were similar to those norms. 

 The history of 1350, as the historians' 
brief lays out, is that the Founders believed that 

1
2  Sosa said that its analysis did not necessarily apply to 
3  1331, and I think that's because of the history of 1350. 
4
5
6  certain law of nations norms could be implemented by 
7  common law tort actions.  And this Court in Sosa found 
8  that without further congressional action, the courts of 
9  the United States would be available to enforce norms 
10
11
 And in fact, the norms that the Founders 
12  were familiar with were very similar in kind to the 
13  universal jurisdiction norms that Justice Sotomayor --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but -- but general --
14
15
16  neither Federal law nor state law.  If that were so, 
17  every tort action, which in those days were decided 
18  under -- under a general law that was up there in the 
19  sky, would have been a Federal -- a Federal claim.
 MR. HOFFMAN:  But there were -- there was 
20
21  certain -- there were certain norms that were believed 
22  to be part of the law of nations, including piracy and 
23  attacks on ambassadors, and they were governed by 
24  universal standards.

4  at the time has become customary international law, and

11  The issue is whether when they do so they are enforcing

14  it's the Federal common law within one of the exceptions

Statute was to make sure that there -- there was a 
15
16  Federal court available to litigate law of nations 
17  claims that could have been litigated in state court, 
18  just as these claims could be litigated in State court.

6  What -- under your position, what should have been the 
7  result?  I think that was the purport of her question, 
8  and I would appreciate an answer to it. 
 MS. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.  We 
9
think the current correct result is that the ATS and 
10
11  Federal common law, which is substantive and remedial 
12  law of the United States -- and here, we agree with the 
13  United States on page 2 of its brief -- ATS plus Federal 
14  common law is the substantive and remedial law of the 
United States.  And we think, under the well-established 
15
16  canon against extraterritorial application of U.S. law, 
17  absent congressional clear indication, there should not 
18  be such an extension.  So, therefore --
19
20

22  extraterritorial application, but do you know of any 
23  other area where extraterritorial application only means

14  certainly the antecedents to the ATS, the Marbois

that does not mean that the ATS and Federal common law 

we're asking.  If, when the statute was passed, it 
applied to pirates, the question to me is who are 
today's pirates.  And if Hitler isn't a pirate, who is? 
And if, in fact, an equivalent torturer or dictator who 
wants to destroy an entire race in his own country is 
not the equivalent of today's pirate, who is? 

 MS. SULLIVAN:  Our clear -- our position on 
1
2  piracy is this.  Even if you think the ATS and Federal 
3  common law can extend to conduct on the high seas, which 
4  are stateless, a place where no foreign sovereign rules,

consequences Justice Kennedy began the argument with.

3  things contemplated.  And as soon as 
4  United States v. Palmer comes along, this Court applied 
the presumption against extraterritorial application of

French had several remedies.  The French victim could

3  the allegation is that an English and a Dutch company
 
4  aided and abetted the Nigerian Government.  That is
 
5
6  friction is at its highest.  And so if you weren't to 
7  adopt our position in full, at a minimum we think you 
8  should hold that the presumption applies to 
9  foreign-cubed cases involving aiding and abetting a 
10
11
12  first instance.  We respectfully submit the better 
13  approach is to apply the presumption as a categorical 
14  matter.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in Filartiga, why 
15
16  wasn't there an aiding and abetting?  I think it was 
17  pretty clear.  He probably was working for the 
18  government, which is even worse.

18  all the more reason to apply the presumption against

25

 It's far worse to have judges --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you're asking us to 

 MS. SULLIVAN:  We --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're -- you're 

basically saying Filartiga and Marcos, Sosa, they were

 MS. SULLIVAN:  We are not, Your Honor.  Sosa 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, how can you say 

1  all wrong. 
2
3  did not address the question we have before the Court 
4  today.
5
6  that?  Maybe the facts didn't, but certainly the 
7  reasoning of the case addressed that issue very directly 
8  and -- and basically said it does.  And then it talked 
9  about how you limit it.  That's what Sosa did.
10
11  question, you don't need to overrule, so to speak, 
12  Filartiga on Justice Kennedy's question.  You can simply 
13  say that in the intervening period, Congress did, as is 
14  appropriate in the area of applying law to foreign 
conduct, pass a specific statute, the TVPA, that applies 
15
16  exactly to the conduct in Filartiga.  That should inform 
17  your decision today, that you don't need judge-made law 
18  to address the situation in Filartiga. 
19
20
21  address, for better or for worse, the 
22  extraterritoriality argument we make today.  It went off 
23  at the first step.  No international norms, specifically 
24  universal and specific -- sufficiently specific and 
universal.  So it didn't get to the concerns about 
25

respect, Justice Sotomayor, because Sosa did not

 So we gave a stamp of approval to Filartiga 

1  friction with foreign countries. 
2
3  to read you something from Sosa, which -- it talks all 
4  about the rule that it adopts and then it says:  "This 
is generally consistent with the reasoning of many of 
5
6  the courts and judges who faced the issue before it 
7  reached this Court.  See Filartiga."  And then it quotes 
8  Filartiga:  "For purposes of civil liability, the 
9  torturer has become like the pirate and slave trader 
10
11
12  and Filartiga's understanding that there were certain 
13  categories of offenders who were today's pirates. 
 MS. SULLIVAN:  If -- the fact that the 
14
nations of the world agree on norms does not mean the 
15
16  nations of the world agree on remedies.  And what the 
17  ATS and Federal common law, as interpreted in Sosa, do 
18  is project a U.S. civil cause of action with U.S. rules, 
19  punitive damages, no attorney fee shifting, contingent 
20
21  except by Congress.  They did it in the TVPA, but you 
22  should not permit it to be done here.

should be recognized. 

1  actual perpetrator was resident in the United States. 
2
 And I do think when Congress enacted the

4  features of the Filartiga situation that justified --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What else?  What else?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  General Verrilli, the --
13  that's -- that is a new position for the -- for the

17  United States Government?  Why should -- why should we 
18  listen to you rather than the solicitors general who 
19  took the opposite position and the position taken by 
Respondents here in other cases, not only in several 
20
21  courts of appeals, but even up here? 
22
23  a case like this one, in cases under the Alien Tort 
24  Statute, the United States has multiple interests.  We 
certainly have foreign relations interests in avoiding 
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that, but --
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  It's my responsibility to 

should be, consistent with existing law. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It -- it was --
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  And we have done so. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it was the 

1  friction with foreign governments; we have interests in 
2  avoiding subjecting United States companies to liability 
3  abroad.  We also have interests in ensuring that our 
4  Nation's foreign relations commitments to the rule of

took a different position.  So, you know, why -- why 
15
16  should we defer to the views of -- of the current 
17  administration? 
18
19  they are persuasive, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, okay. 
20
21
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your successors may 
22  adopt a different view.  And I think -- I don't want to 
23  put words in his mouth, but Justice Scalia's point means 
24  whatever deference you are entitled to is compromised by 
25

the fact that your predecessors took a different 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, because we think 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  So, Mr. Chief Justice, 

1  position. 
2
3  let me be clear:  In this case our position is that the 
4  Court ought not recognize a cause of action.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose that the defendant 
5
6  in this case were a U.S. corporation, but the case were 
7  otherwise identical.  What result then? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  In that case the possible 
8
9  risk of foreign relations friction would be comparable. 
10
11 
12

20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

The risk of reciprocal exposure to American companies 
would also exist.  The difference between that case and 
this case, Your Honor, is that there'd be a much more 
substantial connection to the United States because it's 
an American company.  The question in the case would be 
whether the -- that substantial connection provided a 
sufficient justification for subjecting the United 
States company to these international law norms to avoid 
undermining the credibility of our Nation's commitment 
to those norms.  We haven't taken a position on that 
question in this case because we think that the Court 
ought to proceed incrementally here.  The case before 
the Court involves a foreign corporation in which there 
just isn't any connection to the United States at all, 
and it's our judgment that the Court should decide that 
case --

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I asked you a question 
directly.  Are you foregoing -- are you foregoing any 
forum necessity exception to the rule you've just 
announced? 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are disavowing --
1
2  you are disavowing any forum of necessity view of the 
3  ATS?  You are disavowing what other countries do or say 
4  with respect to citizens -- to aliens who are attacked?
5
6  Justice Sotomayor, is that the key determinant here, and 
7  the reason why there ought not be a cause of action 
8  here, is the absence of any meaningful connection to the 
9  United States.  And the question is --
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  nonavailability of a forum is sufficient to override the 
17  absence of any connection to the United States.

22  hypothetical case, but from your brief I really don't

in the sovereign immunity field.  Why should we walk 
back into it here?  Or do you intend to have us make

6  attacks on ambassadors, we know that those were 
7  international norms in 1789.  If one of those acts 
8  happened, you seem to be suggesting that, answering 
9  Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that if a Frenchman 
attacks an English ambassador in Switzerland, that case

risk of friction in subjecting a foreign sovereign's

acts to scrutiny in the United States, you have the 
reciprocity risk I mentioned.  You would have to make a

13 
judgment about whether those concerns are overcome by 
the countervailing concern of applying the -- finding an 
14 
ATS cause of action to apply U.S. norms.  If it's an 
15
entirely foreign corporation with no connection to the

1  you read the diplomatic materials that we placed before 
2  the Court, it's absolutely clear that what the British 
3  were concerned about was pillaging and plundering on 
4  land in the Sierra Leone colony.  They were seeking 
redress for those things, for destroying libraries, for 
5
6  destroying Freetown, not just about things that happened 
7  on the high seas and not just about things that happened

2  of Kurdish citizens.  And suppose after the Assad regime 
3  is overthrown, those -- the documents revealing that 
4  poison gas transfer to the Syrian regime was made public 
and that Iranian corporation does business in the United 
5
6  States, asylum seekers who were driven out by the poison 
7  gas attacks are in the United States, maybe living in 
8  the same communities as the plaintiffs in our case, 
9  having gotten asylum in this case.  Would it be the case 
that the Alien Tort Statute should not apply to a claim 
10
11  of aiding and abetting the Assad regime and murdering 
12  tens of thousands of its people?  It is the modern day 
13  example of I.G. Farben.  Is it the case that a modern 
14  day I.G. Farben would be exempt from the Alien Tort 
15
16  aiding and abetting in international law.  It has been 
17  accepted by the lower courts.  The lower courts have 
18  uniformly rejected the arguments that have been made by 
19  Respondents in this case.  And I would say that the Sosa 
framework is -- should be given a chance to work.  This 
20
21  Court dealt with these issues eight years ago.  It set 
22  up a historical paradigm test based on many of the 
23  concerns that have been expressed here, and there are 
24  alternative doctrines that can be applied to deal with

 MR. HOFFMAN:  One of the problems that --

1  international comity, forum non conveniens, personal 
2  jurisdiction, those have not really been litigated. 
3  Whether they have been waived or not is something that 
4  the lower courts can deal with.  Whether they apply the 
5
6
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Given the court's recent 
7  decisions on personal jurisdiction, and I have in mind 
8  particularly the Goodyear Tire case, is there personal 
9  jurisdiction in this case or in the case of your 
10
11
12  that we would have, Justice Ginsburg, in answering that 
13  question is that there is no record about the contacts 
14  between these defendants and -- and the jurisdiction in 
15
16  litigated was dealt on a factual record that went back 
17  to 1996 and 1997.  So there is no record here about 
18  personal jurisdiction because it hasn't been asserted. 
19
waived personal jurisdiction, then presumably the lower 
20
21  courts would apply the tests that this Court has -- has 
22  established or in the 2011 decisions.  And the same 
23  would be true of forum non conveniens or any of the

 The Alien Tort Statute as was applied to 

1  basic position is that the Sosa framework actually is --
2  works.  It has actually weeded out cases.  These 
3  alternative doctrines have weeded out cases, but the 
4  Court should not accept the categorical positions 
asserted by either of the Respondents, which are the
 
5
6  broadest categorical positions even rejected by the
 
7  Government, or the Government's modified categorical
 
8  position.  Those kinds of issues can be dealt with
 
9  within well-established doctrines where lower courts
 
have a body of jurisprudence that they can use to do 
10
11  this. 
12
13  human rights cases from Filartiga on is part of a trend 
14  in the world today.  The trend in the world today is 
15
16  corporations that violate these kinds of norms.  That's 
17  the trend.  In fact, the United States has been the 
18  leader in that.  Our Government has proclaimed our 
19  leadership position to U.N. bodies and around the world.
20
21  Kingdom and Netherlands don't think so. 
 MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, the United Kingdom and 
22
23  Netherlands have obviously asserted this position.  But 
24  the Netherlands have asserted that position while at the 
25

towards universal justice for people that -- and

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would rather listen to 

the Dutch Government than one, one Dutch judge, frankly. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It may have been wrong. 
 MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, it may have been but 

1  February a Dutch court gave damages to a Palestinian
 
2  doctor for wrongful imprisonment and torture that
 
3  occurred in Libya against two Libyan defendants that
 
4  were not even present in the courtroom.

5
6
7  actually it seems perfectly consistent with Dutch law, 
8  it is consistent with the exercise of universal 
9  jurisdiction in many pieces of legislation --
10
11 
12
 MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, the Dutch Government, 
13  though, and one of the significant pieces in this case 
14  is that the Nigerian Government doesn't have a position 
on this case any longer.  The United States Government 
15
16  has never asked for this case to be dismissed on foreign 
17  policy grounds.  The United Kingdom and the Dutch 
18  Government have never asked for this case to be -- to be 
19  invalidated on foreign policy grounds.  They have stated 
20
21  Statute should mean.  And if you look at the European 
22  Union brief, of which the United Kingdom and Dutch are 
23  members, the European Union says there is no issue about 
24  universal jurisdiction, there is no issue about civil 
jurisdiction that falls within universal jurisdiction.

exhaustion and in the other there wasn't. 

 MR. HOFFMAN:  I think that that's probably 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And isn't that really the 
way to reconcile the Dutch positions?  The Dutch are 

1  Their only argument is that if you accept that, you

6  objecting because they think they have a fair forum, but 
7  when the judges were faced with a case arising from 
8  Libya, they thought that there was no fair forum there. 
9  And that's the difference, that in one case there was 
10
11
12  what the basis of the Dutch position.  Our position, 
13  though, is that this -- the framework that this Court 
14  established in Sosa to -- to take the pirates of the 
18th century and deal with the Alien Tort Statute with 
15
16  the torturers and those who commit genocide in the 21st 
17  century was correct, and that doesn't need a radical 
18  re-evaluation as suggested by the Respondents and the 
19  United States.
