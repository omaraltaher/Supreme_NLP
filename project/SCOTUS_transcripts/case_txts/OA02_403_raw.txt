CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-403, the Federal Election Commission v.


Christine Beaumont.


Mr. Clement.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This Court's campaign finance cases consistently


emphasize the fundamental distinction between


contributions and expenditures.  Direct transfers of cash


to a candidate pose unique risks of the appearance of


corruption or the threat of actual corruption while, at 

the same time, imposing less significant interference with


First Amendment values.  And so this Court's jurisprudence


consistently recognizes that there is less rigorous


scrutiny on limitations on contributions relative to


limitations on expenditures.


The court below lost sight of that fundamental


dichotomy.  It held that corporations of the type that


this Court exempted from the general limitations on


corporate expenditures in Massachusetts Citizens for Life


were equally exempt from the broad prohibitions on

corporate contributions to candidates.  That reasoning


ignores this Court's decision in Massachusetts Citizens


for Life itself, which specifically distinguished between


the expenditures and contributions of nonprofit


corporations.


More fundamentally, the decision below ignores


this Court's decision in National Right to Work Committee. 


There this Court held that the broad limitations on


corporate contributions and the specific limitations on


solicitation embedded in that broad prohibition were


constitutional against a First Amendment challenge.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, the Government does --


does not challenge the exemption of this not-for-profit


corporation from expenditure limitations?


MR. CLEMENT:  That's right, Justice Scalia.  The


court below addressed both an expenditure issue and a


prohibition issue with respect to contributions, and the


Government only took up the prohibition on contributions. 


So that is the only issue before the Court.


I think it's important, though, to understand


that that is a distinction that the court below placed


insufficient emphasis on because that is a distinction


between contributions and expenditures that underlies the


last quarter century of this Court's campaign finance


jurisprudence.

 And in National Right to Work Committee itself,


this Court recognized that the broad prohibitions on


contributions applied to all corporations, including those


like National Right to Work Committee itself that were


without great financial resources.


Nonetheless, in the particular context of


corporate contributions to candidates, this Court held


that it would not second guess Congress' decision that a


broad, prophylactic approach was necessary when corruption


was the evil feared.


QUESTION:  Do you think after the decision in


Massachusetts -- the Massachusetts case, the NRWC would


have a right to make independent expenditures?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think it would, Chief


Justice Rehnquist, and I think that where I would point to 

first is your dissent in that case because in that case in


your dissent, you made the argument that National Right to


Work Committee was essentially the same as Massachusetts


Citizens for Life.  And the majority, in responding to


that argument, didn't draw any particular distinction


between National Right to Work Committee and Massachusetts


Citizens for Life, but rather drew a firm distinction


between the level of scrutiny that applies to limitations


on contributions and the level of scrutiny that applies to


limitations on expenditures.

25

 So I would read that decision as saying that the


critical distinction is not the differences among the


types of corporations with respect to contribution bans,


but is the fact that contribution bans are much more


readily approved under First Amendment analysis than


expenditure bans.


And National Right to Work Committee obviously


wasn't the last word on that subject.  This Court


reaffirmed the validity of a broad, prophylactic approach


to corporate contributions both in National Conservative


Political Action Committee and in Massachusetts Citizens


for Life itself.  Particularly, in light of Massachusetts


Citizens for Life, a ban on corporate contributions by


nonprofits does not impose significant burdens on First


Amendment interests.


In the particular context of this type of


corporation, the corporation is free to engage in


unlimited spending on elections through the corporate


form, and the individual respondents are free to give


unlimited contributions to North Carolina Right to Life. 


In addition and equally important, the individual members


of North Carolina Right to Life are free to give


contributions to the candidates of their choice up to the


constitutionally valid contribution limits.


Accordingly, this case doesn't involve the right

to associate together or the right to associate with


candidates of someone's individual choosing, but only the


right to assemble together collectively to give money to


candidates of an organization's collective choosing.  And


even that rather attenuated First Amendment interest is


only affected to the extent that a corporation must direct


its contributions through a separate segregated fund with


enhanced disclosure and reporting and bookkeeping


requirements.


QUESTION:  Why -- why is that an attenuated


First Amendment right?  Isn't that the right that enables


the formation of political parties, people forming


together in order to collectively give money to particular


candidates?


MR. CLEMENT: 


Well, certainly in -- in the first 

point, parties are subject to a different type of


regulation under the campaign finance laws.


But secondly --


QUESTION:  Well, it may well be, but -- but I --


I wouldn't shrug off as inconsequential the importance of


individuals being able to band together to support


individual candidates.  That's the whole basis for our --


our party system.


MR. CLEMENT:  And -- and I don't want to suggest


that there's no First Amendment interest on the other side

of -- of the argument in this case, but what I did mean to


suggest is that interest is less significant than the


interest in individuals banding together to make


expenditures that they might otherwise not be able to


make.


And I think even in the party context, this


Court recognized that distinction in the Colorado


Republican cases where it held that limitations on what


the -- the party can spend to support a candidate are not


subject to limitation, but what -- but there -- but there


are valid limitations on what the party can contribute to


a candidate of its choosing.


Now, in contrast to the rather minimal First


Amendment interests that are interfered with by section


441b, it plays an important role in safeguarding the 

integrity of the election process.  This Court in -- in


National Right to Work Committee already has recognized


that corporate contributions pose a risk of the reality


and appearance of corruption and that a broad,


prophylactic limitation on all corporations, including


those without great financial resources, is an appropriate


response to that threat.


All corporations, regardless of their size, also


pose risks of circumvention and of undermining the


workability of candidate disclosure requirements.

 As this Court recognized in Cedric Kushner


Promotions against King, the whole point of a corporation,


its basic purpose and fundamental reason for -- for


existing is to create legal separateness between the


individuals that form and run the corporation and the


artificial corporate entity itself.


Giving such an artificial entity the right to


contribute in its own name, independent of the individuals


that underlie the corporation, obviously poses a distinct


risk to a campaign finance system that is based largely on


individual contribution limits.  Section 441b addresses


that risk by requiring that those contributions be made


through a segregated fund subject to enhanced bookkeeping


and disclosure requirements.


Those bookkeeping and disclosure requirements, 

in turn, make the campaign disclosure forms that


individual candidates have to file work in a meaningful


fashion.  If those candidate disclosure forms simply


revealed that the candidate received money from an


artificial entity with either an ambiguous name or what


this Court in Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley


termed a seductive name that tends to conceal the true


identity and true source of the funds, then those campaign


finance forms -- or disclosure forms will not provide


meaningful information.

 If, on the other hand, 441b makes the underlying


corporations use a segregated fund that discloses the


individual sources of the contributions, then the


disclosure forms can work in a meaningful fashion.


I think it bears emphasis, as this Court


recognized in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that the


distinction between contributions and expenditures applies


with full force in the context of nonprofit organizations. 


A limitation on expenditures can prevent an organization's


members, who might otherwise not have the resources to


reach a certain audience, to pool their resources together


to reach that audience.


There is no comparable function or benefit from


the pooling of individual candidate contributions.  The


individual candidates themselves can perform that pooling 

function by assembling together candidate contributions of


whatever size in order to reach an audience or to engage


in political speech.


The intermediate pooling function that the


nonprofit corporation serves can only benefit by either


circumventing the individual contribution requirements or


assembling an aggregate contribution of a sufficient size


to potentially capture the attention of a candidate for


purposes of a quid pro quo.  To be sure, the same


provisions of the campaign finance laws allow corporations

to assemble funds in -- in aggregate amounts through a


segregated fund, but only with the additional safeguards


that are imposed, including enhanced disclosure


requirements.


Congress, in adopting section 441b, drew an


important distinction between corporations and their


ability to contribute and individuals.  In the expenditure


context, the limitations on corporate expenditures stand


in stark contrast to the general right of individuals to


engage in unlimited independent expenditures.


But no one has a right to engage in unlimited


corporate -- in unlimited contributions to candidates. 


Congress addresses the threat of individual contributions


through dollar amounts.  It addresses the distinct risks


of corporate contributions through the requirement of a 

segregated fund, higher limits, and enhanced disclosure


requirements.


Respondents effectively ask this Court to


disregard and second guess Congress' decision to treat


corporations differently from individuals for purposes of


candidate contributions.  With respect, I think


essentially respondents ask this Court to treat North


Carolina Right --


QUESTION:  Can you summarize briefly what the


enhanced disclosure requirements are?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Certainly, Chief Justice


Rehnquist.  The -- the main difference is that in the


context of a segregated fund, all -- both all incoming


contributions to the segregated fund and all disbursements


must be disclosed.


QUESTION:  You're talking about PACs.  Right?


MR. CLEMENT:  PACs.  I mean, the PACs generally


-- there are segregated funds in the particular context of


corporations and labor unions.


QUESTION:  And the donor is listed.


MR. CLEMENT:  The donor is listed.  There are


specific provisions for very small donations where the


name only goes to the FEC and is not publicly disclosed. 


But there's a -- but really, everything that comes in and


comes out of the segregated fund is traceable either by 

the FEC or through the public in disclosure requirements.


In the context of the corporation generally,


only -- only donations that are given over $200 and for


the express purpose of -- of political activity have to be


disclosed.  And that does create a significant loophole.


In the --


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, is this -- is this


section 441b related or affected in any way by the McCain-


Feingold legislation?


MR. CLEMENT:  Justice O'Connor, it really isn't,

at least as this case comes to this Court.  The


prohibitions on corporate contributions have been in the


law since 1907 and have been left completely unaffected by


the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act.


It is true that certain limitations on


electioneering activity, which is a new term introduced


into the law by the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform


Act, do apply to corporations.  So in considering


challenges to the McCain-Feingold legislation, this Court


may have to consider the restrictions on corporations


engaged in expenditures and these new electioneering


activities, but not --


QUESTION:  But at least the issue here in this


case is unaffected by that.


MR. CLEMENT: 


The issue of corporate 

contributions is miraculously unaffected by the many


reforms that are put in place by the Bipartisan Campaign


Reform Act.


(Laughter.)


MR. CLEMENT:  In the end --


QUESTION:  What is the -- what is the limitation


of the PAC?  How much can they contribute, say, to a


Senator?


MR. CLEMENT:  A -- a political action committee


or any segregated fund can give $5,000.

 QUESTION:  This -- this -- you're saying that


this particular kind of organization can't contribute


directly, but it could set up a -- what you call a


segregated fund, which I was thinking of as a PAC.  And so


if that segregated fund now wants to make a contribution


to Senator Smith for his reelection campaign, is there a


limit as to how much they can give?  I'd think so.


MR. CLEMENT:  There is indeed, Justice Breyer. 


It's $5,000.


QUESTION:  $5,000.


MR. CLEMENT:  And two points of emphasis just on


that question.  One is that respondents here don't just


have the right to set up a segregated fund, but they've


actually already done that.  They've already set up a


segregated fund. 


And I know that this Court in 

Massachusetts Citizens for Life emphasized that there are


unique restrictions and burdens on setting up a segregated


fund, and I think that's true in the context of


expenditures.


But I do think it's easy to exaggerate the


burdens that are imposed in setting up a segregated fund. 


Although a segregated fund is like a PAC, there's no


requirement that they have separate offices or separate


officers.  They have to have a distinct leadership and --


and -- but it can be the same leadership as the

corporation itself.


QUESTION:  I mean, could they have two members?


MR. CLEMENT:  I don't know of any particular


limit on -- on the members.


But the point is all that's really required is


segregation of funds and keeping it separate.  It's not an


onerous requirement.  And I think it's no accident that in


the four cases that this Court has had that involved a


nonprofit corporation, National Right to Work Committee,


Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Austin against Michigan


Chamber of Commerce, and this case, all four of those


nonprofits had already set up segregated funds before the


case got to this Court.  So I don't think, at least in the


contribution context, that those are onerous requirements.


QUESTION:  Well --


QUESTION:  In Massachusetts Citizens for Life,


there was a separate PAC?


MR. CLEMENT:  There was.  This Court in footnote


8 suggested that that wasn't dispositive of its reasoning


because other -- other entities could set -- be in a


position that were similar to Massachusetts Citizens for


Life, might not be able to afford those burdens.  But


Massachusetts Citizens --


QUESTION:  But the Court did say for that type


of -- for that type of corporation, not a commercial

corporation, that was burdensome and unnecessary because


the risk of corruption for that kind of corporation was


significantly less than for commercial corporations.  And


that would apply here as well.  If the -- if the evil is


corruption, I'm buying the candidate by my dollars, then


that risk is less for an advocacy organization.  Is that


-- isn't --


MR. CLEMENT:  I don't want to suggest that the


-- that it may not be true that the risks are slightly


less in the context of a nonprofit advocacy corporation


than in the context of something like General Motors.


But I think in the particular context of


candidate contributions by corporations, this Court has


repeatedly decided that it's willing to accept a broad,


prophylactic approach and to limit all corporate 

contributions, including contributions by corporations


without great financial resources.  The Court said as much


in National Right to Work Committee.  It repeated that


again in National Conservative Political Action Committee,


but I think most tellingly, it said that in Massachusetts


Citizens for Life itself.


And in particular, if you look at footnote 13 of


the Massachusetts Citizens for Life decision, the Court


there specifically said that it understood that


Massachusetts Citizens for Life would continue to be

subjected to the National Right to Work Committee regime


for purposes of its contributions, and it was talking


about the fact that it didn't have -- that Massachusetts


Citizens for Life, for example, didn't have shareholders. 


But it was quick to -- to reinforce that that didn't mean


that it didn't have members for purposes of National Right


to Work Committee that it could solicit, subject of course


to the overall limit that it could not give direct


contributions to candidates.


QUESTION:  That was an assumption in the case. 


You don't -- you don't -- you don't assert that it was a


holding of the case?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't think it's


necessarily the holding of the case because, obviously,


that case involved expenditures. 


But I do think that when 

this Court distinguishes a prior precedent of the Court,


that that's not a part of the opinion that a lower court


is free to ignore.  I think that part of the opinion is


critical to the reasoning of the Court and should be given


stare decisis effect.  And I don't think there's any


reason that's been brought to bear here to revisit this


Court's distinction in Massachusetts Citizens for Life


between contributions and expenditures, which after all,


is the fundamental building block of this Court's campaign


finance jurisprudence.

 QUESTION:  You think whenever we distinguish a


prior case in one of our opinions, that -- that


distinguishing has stare decisis effect.


MR. CLEMENT:  I would think that in many


respects that's the most important part of the opinion. 


It's not to say that the Court can't subsequently revisit


that part of the opinion.  I mean, that's certainly what


this Court can do, but I think for purposes of a lower


court, anyway, if -- if this Court distinguishes two cases


on the ground that the prior case involved a corporation


that had less than $10,000 and a subsequent case comes


along where there's $9,999 involved, I would think the


lower court would be well served to heed the distinction


that this Court drew.  And I think in this particular


context, obviously, this Court is free to reconsider its 

prior precedents, but I don't think there's any reason to


do so.


The distinction between contributions and


expenditures has proved workable particularly in the


context of nonprofit corporations.  As I say, this isn't


some abstract application of the contribution/expenditure


dichotomy that this Court has never considered. 


Massachusetts Citizens for Life involved a nonprofit


corporation and this Court was at pains, pretty much at


every step in the Court's reasoning, to distinguish

between contributions and expenditures.


In the end, I think respondents ask this Court


effectively to disregard Congress' decision to treat


corporate contributions distinctly from individual


contributions.  They effectively ask this Court to treat


North Carolina Right to Life Incorporated as if it were


not incorporated, but there's no reason to disregard


either respondents' decision to incorporate or Congress'


decision to subject all corporations to the same regime,


segregated funds, distinct disclosure requirements, and


higher limits, in fact, on their contributions.


If there are no further questions, I'll reserve


the rest of my time for rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Clement.


Mr. Bopp, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. BOPP:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Expressive associations play a vital role in our


democratic republic.  Because they attract financial


support due to their political ideas, not their prowess in


the economic marketplace, their participation in our


political process poses no threat of corruption, as long


as they do not serve as a conduit for business corporation

contributions.


QUESTION:  I -- I don't understand that.  If --


if I bribe somebody, a Senator, out of -- out of political


motivation because I'm an environmentalist or whatever,


that's not corruption?  It's only -- it's only if I have


some economic motive that it's corruption?


MR. BOPP:  Well, that's classic quid pro quo


corruption which is dealt with by contribution limits,


now --


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, I -- it may well be,


but I don't see that the distinction between whether it's


an economic actor or a political actor has anything to do


with whether there's corruption or not.


MR. BOPP:  Well, there has been some controversy


on this Court on -- on whether or not the -- the decisions 

of this Court in Mass. Citizens and on Austin were in


accordance with the Constitution, but in both cases the


Court distinguished between the types of corruption that


are entailed by the corporate form, which is the potential


for unfair employment of wealth for political purposes. 


This applies to economic corporations, that -- that is,


those that are not, as Mass. Citizens or North Carolina


Right to Life, formed to advance political ideas.


QUESTION:  Well, but you can have an immense


corporation formed to advance political ideas.  I -- I

don't -- this one happens to be a small one, but --


MR. BOPP:  Yes.  And --


QUESTION:  -- if you attract enough people, you


can have an immense organization.  What's the organization


for -- American Association of Retired Persons.  I mean,


that's an immense organization with -- with a large amount


of available money.


MR. BOPP:  That's right and the size of the


organization is not the issue.  The issue in this Court's


jurisprudence is whether -- is the nature of the


organization itself and not the corporate form per se.  If


the nature of --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Bopp, would you say that


the AARP, which was referred to by Justice Scalia, the


National Right to Work Committee, which was involved in 

that opinion, and Massachusetts Citizens for Life are all


in the same boat?


MR. BOPP:  I don't believe so, Your Honor.  I


think we do --


QUESTION:  Why not?


MR. BOPP:  Well, the -- the Court in Mass.


Citizens established some criteria to determine whether or


not an organization, a corporation, benefitted from the


MCFL exemption.  And those include whether or not there


are incentives to disassociate -- lack of incentives to

disassociate by, for instance, having insurance plans and


other benefits of membership that are economically


related.


Secondly, you would look to the amount of


corporate -- business corporation contributions or


business activities.  If those are too much or those are


not insignificant, in -- in comparison with the total sums


raised, then again they would not qualify.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bopp, on that point I thought


that Massachusetts Citizens for Life went further.  It


said having a policy against accepting corporate


contributions, which is one difference between your


organization and Massachusetts Citizens for Life.  They


said they would take no money from corporations.  You


accept money from corporations. 


You get very little from 

business corporations, but you don't have a policy of


turning them away.


MR. BOPP:  That's correct, Your Honor.  And the


-- all the circuits that have considered this, which have


been four of the circuits, all agree that the features


explained and -- and characterizing Mass. Citizens in --


in the Supreme Court's decision were not constitutional


requirements, but descriptions of the organization before


it.  And all of them have agreed that -- that not-for-


profit ideological corporations can still qualify for the

-- for the Massachusetts Citizens exemption.


QUESTION:  Well, would you call AARP an


ideological organization?


MR. BOPP:  I think they have a mixture of


political and nonpolitical purposes and are, therefore,


more like Austin -- the -- the Michigan Chamber of


Commerce and Austin that had a mixture of political and


nonpolitical purposes and therefore did not qualify for


the MCFL exemption.


And to complete my answer --


QUESTION:  I'll bet the members also get


benefits --


MR. BOPP:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- and -- and that criterion would --


would make it different from --


MR. BOPP:  There were also incentives that were


economic in nature that would cause people to be reluctant


to disassociate with Michigan Chamber of Commerce if it --


if it proved to be that they disagreed with their


political ideas or the advancement of their political


ideas.


And the four circuits that have considered the


question of the amount of business corporation


contributions have all said that as long as they are


insignificant, in comparison with the total revenue of the

organization, they still -- they do not serve as a conduit


for business corporation contributions and still qualify


for the exemption.


QUESTION:  But they could serve as a conduit for


a very large donor, a very wealthy person, who wants to


avoid the personal limitations on how much that individual


could give.


MR. BOPP:  Well, it is true that there are no


contribution limits to not-for-profit corporations. 


However, the intent of a donor to circumvent those limits


would be -- contributing to a not-for-profit would be a


highly inefficient and ineffective way of doing so because


the political activities of not-for-profit corporations,


both because of the major purpose test that would cause an


organization to become a PAC if political activity became 

their major purpose, and the Internal Revenue Service's


limitations on the activities of 501(c)(4) organizations,


which is what the regulations require you to be qualified


as in -- in order to quality for the MCFL exemption, all


-- all mean that a very small percentage of any


contribution to a not-for-profit corporation could ever be


used for political activity.


Furthermore, contributing to a not-for-profit


versus a PAC and a -- or a political party is also an


unfavorable prospect for a donor.  I mean, after all, the

-- a not-for-profit under the 441a contribution limits is


limited to a $2,000 contribution, where a PAC can give


$5,000 and political parties can give much more.


Furthermore, all of the money that PACs or


political parties receive in their hard money accounts can


be used for political activity, whereas I've mentioned for


not-for-profits it's really a very small percentage in


order to continue to qualify under the MCFL exemption and


continue to not be deemed a PAC for -- for the purposes of


the Federal Election Campaign Act.


Now, the disclosure interest that there -- that


there is for contributions can be readily and in a


narrowly tailored way dealt with by simply requiring that


any contribution to a not-for-profit that is to be used


for or is intended to be used for contributions to 

candidates must be reported and is -- and is thereby


subject to the aggregate contribution limits.  This is a


much more narrowly tailored way to deal with disclosure


and the aggregate contribution limits than prohibiting the


organization completely from making any contribution.


QUESTION:  What you do then -- this is what I


understand you to be saying.  The -- one of their


justifications that has been advanced for this restriction


on contributions I've interpreted as the following.  We


have five people.  These five people each write a check to

Candidate Smith for $2,000.  They get annoyed.  They think


they should be able to give $4,000, which the law forbids. 


So they form a committee, a nonprofit corporation, called


the $4,000 for Smith Corporation.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  And now each of them writes another


check for $2,000, gives it to the corporation, and the


corporation gives it to Smith.  And I think the Government


says, well, Congress wanted to stop that.  It's not


actually going to limit them to zero.  They're going to be


limited to $5,000 as a group provided they jump through


certain hoops.


All right.  Now, what's --


MR. BOPP:  Well, if they're a PAC --


QUESTION: 


-- what's wrong with that argument? 

MR. BOPP:  Well, if they're -- if they're a PAC,


then they can give $5,000 out of the -- out of the $10,000


that you posit.  If they're a not-for-profit corporation,


the most they can give --


QUESTION:  I know, but do you see what I'm


saying?  I'm saying Congress doesn't want to have groups


called the $4,000 for Smith group even if they call


themselves something different.


MR. BOPP:  I agree.


QUESTION:  They want to limit each of those

members to $2,000.


MR. BOPP:  Agreed.


QUESTION:  And that's what they do, though for a


variety of other reasons, not directly relevant to my


question, they've allowed those people to get together,


jump through various hoops called the PAC hoops, and give


up to $5,000 extra.  So if Congress wanted to, they might


say none.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, that's their --


that's basically the argument, and I want to get a


straight, you know, direct reply to it.


MR. BOPP:  Well, the -- the desire of subjecting


the aggregate contribution limit or a contribution in


excess of $2,000, one direct and one through another 

source, is dealt with two ways and can be.


One is if the contribution made to this group


that you posit is earmarked, then that contribution is


considered to be a contribution not just to the group but


also to the candidate him or herself.  So that earmarked


contribution is subject to the $2,000 limit, and the


contribution used for that would be in violation of the


act currently.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.


QUESTION:  All right.  So now -- is that --

 MR. BOPP:  That is current law.  And -- and so


that prospect is prohibited and appropriately so.


Secondly, as the Federal Election Campaign Act


previously required, that anyone contributing to a


organization, not a PAC, that contributes money for an


independent expenditure, that that contribution must be


reported by the group that does the independent


expenditure.  Congress could require the same thing here. 


They could require money given more generally, not


earmarked, but more generally for candidates to be


reported by the -- the group and thereby subject to the


aggregate contribution limits.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bopp, isn't it also the case that


the -- that the corporation that Justice Breyer posits


would not qualify as -- as a 501 exempt organization if 

the only thing it's using its money for is to make


contributions to political candidates?


MR. BOPP:  That would also be true.  They --


QUESTION:  I'm just trying --


QUESTION:  It has to be -- it has to be a


relatively insignificant part of its overall activity.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.  The Internal Revenue Service


would treat the organization that he described as a


political organization --


QUESTION:  So these five people would had to --

have to get together with maybe 100,000 other people so


that their -- their little portion is so watered down that


it's not a significant part of the corporation's business.


MR. BOPP:  That's exactly --


QUESTION:  I didn't think there was a numerical


limit.  And my question which tried to eliminate


extraneous points I think you understood perfectly well


there.  I mean a 503(c) corporation but -- et cetera.


But I want to go back to your answer.  The --


the -- because I'm trying to get clear about this.  And


the -- what you're saying is that Congress could take my


group, with whatever else they have to do to qualify them


-- they could take my group and you're saying Congress


could just say, very well, we will limit the corporation


so that it can only give money from these five people 

insofar as they haven't met their $2,000 individual limit.


MR. BOPP:  That would be an effect of what I


said, yes.


QUESTION:  And -- and moreover, it could require


reporting so we know who they are.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, is that a less


restrictive alternative than what Congress has actually


done, which is to say, proceed through a segregated fund?


MR. BOPP:  Yes, much less restrictive.

 QUESTION:  Because?  Because?


MR. BOPP:  Well, because this Court held in


Mass. Citizens and Austin that the PAC requirements, both


administrative, including record keeping, appointment of a


treasurer, filing regular reports, et cetera, and the


limits that are imposed upon PACs -- there's a $5,000


contribution limit to PACs, et cetera -- all impose an --


a constitutionally burden -- a burden on constitutionally


exercised rights that did not -- that did not pass


constitutional muster.  So -- so while it is true that you


can do it under a PAC, that imposes an unconstitutional


burden on the First Amendment activities.


And that, of course, all goes back to, you know,


is there a justification for this.  In other words, we


have a prohibited source --


QUESTION:  Well, just before you go on, I don't


see why your proposal doesn't have all of the same


administrative inconveniences.


MR. BOPP:  Well, there's a one-page report. 


There are organizations that can do independent


expenditures that are not PACs.  There's a one -- one-


page report to file, and that -- and that report would say


how much is being spent on the independent expenditure and


how much has been donated to the organization for the


purpose of that independent expenditure.

 Similarly, a report like that could be filed for


contributions so that we could capture those people who


are trying to circumvent the limits to -- to make


undisclosed or excessive contributions.  We would capture


them because then the only choice left to the donor would


be a completely undifferentiated, unearmarked contribution


that is going to be used by the organization 95, 98


percent for other purposes, for lobbying, for education,


for other charitable activity.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bopp, the Court basically decided


this issue in National Right to Work Committee case,


didn't it?  You just want us to distinguish your type of


nonprofit corporation.


MR. BOPP:  Well, we are asking you to


distinguish the Massachusetts Citizens for Life type --

QUESTION:  I think that's very hard to do.  I


mean, we dealt with this precise issue in that case.


MR. BOPP:  But there was no issue in that case


about whether or not the organization itself should not be


viewed as a prohibited source of -- of making independent


expenditures or making contributions in that case.


QUESTION:  But the organization opted for the


corporate form --


MR. BOPP:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- knowing about these limitations.

in Mass. Citizens that it's not the corporate form per se,


but the potential for unfair deployment of wealth for


political purposes and held that these types of


organizations pose no threat, no threat whatsoever.


QUESTION:  Well, it couldn't have been a holding


in -- in the Massachusetts case because there you were


talking about independent expenditures rather than


contributions.


MR. BOPP:  Well, but -- but --


QUESTION:  Certainly the Massachusetts case


doesn't control the outcome here.


MR. BOPP:  Well, we -- we believe that it --


that the holding of the Court in Mass. Citizens -- that


this organization serves no potential for corruption of 

the democratic process, was essential for the Court to


hold that no independent -- that independent expenditures


would be allowed because, after all --


QUESTION:  Mr. Bopp, at least three times in the


text of the Court's opinion in Massachusetts Citizens for


Life, at least three times, it distinguishes direct


contributions to candidates from expenditures, and each


time it explains why it reached the result it did.  It


makes that distinction.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  And I think that -- that that's so


central to Massachusetts Citizens for Life.  So if -- if


we just had this opinion shorn of all but however,


remember that this is not a contribution to a candidate


and then citing back to the -- the earlier decision that


Justice O'Connor mentioned, the National Right to Work


Committee, to distinguish it from this case, but it just


seems so all over Massachusetts Citizens for Life that it


is drawing this bright line between contributions to


candidates and independent expenditures.


MR. BOPP:  But in -- but in Right to Work, it


wasn't a prohibition on contributions.  It was a -- a


limit on the amount of contributions.  And we agree that


limits on amounts --


QUESTION: 


Yes, but I'm -- I'm talking about 

Massachusetts Citizens for Life and the line that Justice


Brennan drew in the Massachusetts Citizens for Life


between contributions to candidates.  Every time he talks


about the holding in this case, he said, remember, this is


not contributions to candidates.


MR. BOPP:  Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. 


That's what you said.  But the -- the case did not involve


-- neither Mass. Citizens nor Right to Work involved a


limit on the amount of contributions, that is, like a


$2,000 limit.  We have not challenged that.

 QUESTION:  Mr. Bopp, do you challenge the


distinction for First Amendment purposes between


restricting contributions and restricting expenditures?


MR. BOPP:  Only as to a prohibition on them. 


That is, this Court in Buckley and reaffirmed in Shrink


said that there were both speech and association aspects


of making a contribution.  That is, it's a -- as far as


speech is concerned, this is a general expression of


support that is found in the undifferentiated act of


contributing.


Well, here they are prohibited from


contributing.  They cannot -- these organizations cannot


give one cent.  Therefore, that's --


QUESTION:  So -- so you're -- you're saying


there is a distinction --


MR. BOPP:  Yes, as to a prohibition.


QUESTION:  -- for -- for valid First Amendment


purposes between the -- the contribution limit and the --


and the expenditure limit, but that distinction is not


strong enough to forbid an entire prohibition.


MR. BOPP:  That's correct because both the


speech aspects and association aspects of contributing


that are -- that remain after limits on the amounts are


imposed because the speech aspect is a general expression


of support and the association aspect is to serve to

affiliate a person with the candidate.  You have your name


now through the -- the method of the contribution


affiliated with the candidate.


When you have a zero contribution limit, then


there is no speech and no association that is allowed


through the act of contributing.  Therefore --


QUESTION:  But you can say -- you can --


QUESTION:  I don't think any of our cases have


sliced the onion quite that fine to get into these nuances


that there's a difference between prohibiting a


contribution and limiting it.  I think our distinctions


have been primarily that contributions may be quite


substantially regulated, independent expenditures cannot


be.


MR. BOPP: 


Well, that is -- that is generally a 

correct characterization of your jurisprudence, but you


have to examine why.  Why is it that contributions are


subject to a lower level of scrutiny?  And the -- the why


is is that the speech and association aspects of giving a


smaller contribution remain, but if you can't give any


contribution, then both that speech and association


aspect --


QUESTION:  But when you say can't give any, you


are overlooking or saying the PAC doesn't count.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  It isn't an absolute no contribution.

501(c)(4) organization.  You can -- you can do it but you


have to do it in a rather cumbersome way.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.


QUESTION:  So it isn't you cannot make any


contributions.


MR. BOPP:  Well, not only is it cumbersome, but


it's constitutionally -- it's an unconstitutional burden


this Court has held in Mass. Citizens and in Austin to


require First Amendment political activity to be done


through a PAC.  So --


QUESTION:  Not First Amendment activity in -- in


the Massachusetts case itself, as I just said.  I don't


want to repeat that except that Justice Brennan did repeat


it at least three times.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.  And I'm aware of that, but I'm


just asking this Court to -- to consider not -- not to


apply what is dicta in Mass. Citizens since it did not


involve contributions -- to -- to just apply that, but to


consider the rationale.


And in North -- in -- in National Right to Work,


the Court was considering not a prohibition on soliciting


contributions from members to its PAC, it was considering

a limit on what is considered to be a member.  So once


again, that case involved contribution limits, not


prohibition.


QUESTION:  Mr. Bopp, that -- that First


Amendment right that you talk about as the associational


interest, the -- the ability to give at least a dollar


will identify you with a -- with the candidate, is that


really a First Amendment interest that applies to the


association, or does it apply to the members of the


association?  And as Mr. Clement pointed out, the


individual members of the association remain free to give


a dollar, indeed up to $2,000, to the particular


candidate.


All you're really talking about here is -- is


not the ability of individuals to identify themselves with 

a candidate, but the ability of individuals by pooling


their resources to help a candidate significantly.  It


seems to me that that's the only interest at -- at issue


here.


MR. BOPP:  Well, there's valid reasons unlike


the representation -- or the argument of the Government


for people to want to pool their resources in an


association.  That those valid reasons are, in fact, why


people already contribute to PACs and the political party

 QUESTION:  But among those reasons is not in


order to identify myself with that candidate.


MR. BOPP:  Well, but the --


QUESTION:  To -- to do that, all you have to do


is reach in your pocket and give them a dollar.


MR. BOPP:  That is true, but many people choose


to pool their resources because they want the group, which


has a separate existence and has a political purpose,


unlike them as an individual -- you know, they are not as


identified with a particular point of view or political


idea like a group would be, like -- like NARAL would be. 


So if -- so they choose then to pool their resources with


the group in order to make the much more powerful


statement about the political ideas that they are


attempting to support and they want candidates to be 

associated with.


Now, in addition, the fact that the group can


aggregate these small contributions and then make a large


contribution to a particular candidate enhances the -- the


contribution that the individual would otherwise made --


be made because it is being done by the group and in an


aggregate.  So there are justifiable reasons why people


want to associate.


And then further, the association --

argument really would go just the same way to an amount


limitation as to a total prohibition.


MR. BOPP:  No, because amount limitations do


not --


QUESTION:  Everybody can just contribute $10. 


Wouldn't that -- would that be okay with you?


MR. BOPP:  You mean the -- the amount that --


QUESTION:  Say the amount limitation was very


low.  As I understand it, you're trying to draw a


categorical distinction between total prohibition and


amount limitation.


MR. BOPP:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And I don't know -- I don't see that


your argument really is directed to that.


MR. BOPP: 


Well, it goes to the source of the --

of the rights, the First Amendment rights, that are


implicated by a -- by an amount limitation as opposed to a


prohibition.


QUESTION:  But it seems to me an amount


limitation that's very, very low would have the same vice


under your argument as a total prohibition.


MR. BOPP:  Well, potentially, but that would be


a case to be a decided at that point.  And -- now, this


Court has upheld the $5,000 limit, for instance, to


political action committees.  And -- but you would have to

consider -- if it got too low, I mean, there's certainly a


potential for contributions that are too low -- as


Justices Breyer and Ginsburg explained in Shrink, there is


certainly a potential if they're too low to be


unconstitutional.


But here we're not talking about and have not


challenged the -- the $2,000 limit.  We accept that.  We


just don't accept the proposition that because the


organization poses no threat of corruption to the


political process, that they should be completely


prohibited from making a contribution.


So -- so we view this then as a source


limitation, not as an amount limitation, and as a result,


the -- the contribution jurisprudence of this Court that


have accepted greater regulation of contributions is not 

applicable.


If there are no other questions, thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Bopp.


Mr. Clement, you have 11 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Let me begin with the distinction that


respondents rely on between limits on contributions and

prohibitions on contributions.  Even if there is something


to that distinction -- and I rather doubt there is for


some of the reasons unearthed by Justice Stevens' colloquy


with -- with counsel for respondent.  Even if that were a


valid distinction, this case does not involve an absolute


prohibition.


This Court, both in Massachusetts Citizens for


Life and Austin, and in fact, much earlier in Pipefitters,


made clear that the limitations on corporate and labor


union contributions in section 441b are not a, quote,


absolute prohibition, but rather just a limitation on


contributions.  The availability of the segregated funds


to make the contributions is another way of making this a


limitation, a particular limitation designed for the


unique risks of artificial entities like corporations and 

labor unions.


And I think any effort to distinguish the


discussion in Massachusetts Citizens for Life and its


distinguished -- distinctions between contributions and


expenditures on the grounds that a prohibition might be


different just doesn't work because both Massachusetts


Citizens for Life and National Right to Work Committee


involved this very provision, section 441b.  So whatever


there might be in the case of an absolute prohibition on


somebody's right to make contributions, 441b either isn't

that or isn't that in -- in a constitutionally relevant


way after this Court's decisions in Massachusetts Citizens


for Life and National Right to Work Committee.


Some discussion was had about fine distinctions


that potentially could be drawn between the American


Association of Retired Persons, National Right to Work


Committee, Massachusetts Citizens for Life, and North


Carolina Citizens Right to Life.  The point of section


441b in the contribution context is that Congress has not


found a need to draw those kind of fine distinctions.


MCFL itself, of course, drew some of those


distinctions in the contribution context -- in the


expenditure context, rather, but drew a distinction


between contributions in light of the inherently greater


risk of corruption from contributions.


Another suggestion was made that perhaps there


is a seemingly less restrictive alternative.  As with


independent expenditures made by nonprofit associations,


perhaps contributions that are made to the association


with the purpose of them being used for contributions to


candidates could be disclosed.


QUESTION:  Have we actually held, Mr. Clement,


that in regulating contributions, the Government must find


the least restrictive means?


MR. CLEMENT:  No, and to the contrary.  This

Court has not held that.  It did not apply a least


restrictive alternative analysis in National Right to Work


Committee.  In the California Medical Association case, a


plurality of the Court, in fact, affirmatively held that


the least restrictive alternative was not required in the


context of contributions.  So I don't think there is that


requirement.


But I want to address the -- the supposed less


restrictive alternative precisely because I believe that


less restrictive alternative is illusory because the


suggestion is that -- that individuals could say -- could


disclose when they give a contribution to a nonprofit


organization for the purpose of a contribution.  Well, if


that's going to have the effect of avoiding the


circumvention rationale, I wonder whether people are 

really going to volunteer the information that the


contribution to the nonprofit is for that purpose.


And additionally, even if that is a permissible


way and would be enforceable in the real political world,


that really doesn't give you much of a different result


than what Congress has specifically provided for with the


segregated fund.


And indeed, the segregated fund actually is


responsive to the kind of First Amendment associational


interests that underlie this Court's concerns in Buckley 


43

and even going back to NAACP against Button.  The concern


is that disclosure requirements imposed on organizations


could be a backhanded way to get at membership lists.  The


segregated fund prevents that by keeping the membership


lists and the organization itself separate from the


political activity of the organization.  Indeed, if


Congress hadn't provided for segregated funds as a


requirement for all corporations, but simply made that


available, I would think that many nonprofit corporations


would avail themselves of that option precisely to avoid


the interference with associational interests as in cases


like NAACP against Button.


The last point I'd like to talk about is simply


this idea that again underlies much of respondents'


arguments that because there is no threat from 

expenditures to these types of corporations, there is


therefore no threat to these type of corporations engaging


in corporate contributions.  If that analysis were applied


across the board, it would undermine the entirety of this


Court's campaign finance jurisprudence which is based on


the fundamental recognition that contributions involve


greater risks than expenditures, and -- and expenditures,


therefore, are largely unregulated because they are --


presumably do not pose as great a risk as contributions.


If there are no further questions, I'd like the
