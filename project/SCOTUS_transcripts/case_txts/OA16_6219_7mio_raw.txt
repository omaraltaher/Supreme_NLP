CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next in Case 16-6219, Davila v. Davis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Kretzer. 

 

              

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH KRETZER 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The nature and logic of Martinez naturally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, just as it does to claims of ineffective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of trial counsel. 

 

 

 

            

Erick Davila faces execution despite having 

 

 

 

 

 

been convicted pursuant to erroneous jury instructions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that vitiated his only viable defense.  On direct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal, Davila's counsel recognized the centrality of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the intent issue, but challenged only sufficiency of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I have --

   

  

 

 

MR. KRETZER:  -- not the jury instructions. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I ask you, when do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you believe that counsel below objected?  And your brief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to assume he did, but as I read the transcript, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't find where he objected clearly.

Assuming he didn't object clearly, can you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say under any circumstance that appellate counsel was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

ineffective for choosing the route he did? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes, Your --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Given plain error 

  

 

 

 

review, if there was no objection, wasn't the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficiency of the evidence the best way to approach a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeited error? 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Well, as an initial matter, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be remembered that plain error is not the standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Texas.  Even if a jury instructional objection is not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

made, all that happens under Almanza is the standard of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review turns to -- from harm to egregious harm, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less incisive for Petitioners than plain error standard, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which prevails in Federal court. 

 

 

 

 

            

But, more importantly, the trial counsel did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

object, particularly at page 52 of the Joint Appendix --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He objected to the 

  

 

 

 

 

sequence of what the judge was saying.  He didn't argue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any transferred intent in the way that the Court later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found in Roberts.  I think it's Roberts, if I'm --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

correct. 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- if my memory is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. KRETZER:  Yes. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He didn't -- I don't see 

   

  

 

 

 

 

5 

any discussion of the Roberts transferred intent.  All 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he argued was, give the original instruction over again, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then give this new one. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Oh, no, he did not say, then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

please do give the new one.  There's no doubt the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection could have been better calibrated.  And yet 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the closing, a discrete, complete sentence said, we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

object to giving of the supplemental instruction.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately thereafter, the State trial judge said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overruled. 

            

            

oh --

 

            

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But, counsel --

  

 

 

 

MR. KRETZER:  And it must be remembered --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Sorry, counsel. 

  

 

 

Just to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, I think you argued at page 228 of the Joint 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix that trial counsel's objection was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient to cover the charging error, and I think that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal district court on habeas found the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing on page 366. 

 

 

 

            

And so that raises, to my mind, a question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether Martinez applies here.  Couldn't -- couldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

your client have brought a Martinez claim?  And isn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Martinez rule premised on the idea you get one clear

shot at bringing the issue?  And -- and maybe the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absence of one clear shot here would bring you within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

the rule of Martinez, and that would take care of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

            

            

What am I missing there? 

   

 

 

MR. KRETZER:  Yes, absolutely. 

  

 

 

The reason this could not have been couched 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a Martinez ineffective assistance of trial claim in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal habeas is, even if the objection had not been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper to preserve the issue in the Texas State court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then in the court of criminal appeals, there's still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no way that the direct appellate attorney argued the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue either way. 

 

 

            

In other words, what should have happened, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conforming, constitutionally sufficient direct 

 

 

 

 

appellate brief should have argued jury instructional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error.  And then first in the situation that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection had been preserved by the objection has harm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Almanza, or alternatively, that the objection of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trial court was not sufficient to preserve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection, and then would move to egregious harm under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Almanza.  But in no case, in no situation was there no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying error for the State direct appellate attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to argue against.

good appellate lawyer will do is pare down the issues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are presented on appeal, even if they think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some of those issues have merit.  I mean, if you have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

six issues that you think you can argue credibly before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- before the appellate court, you may decide it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be much better to focus that court on the two or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three strongest issues, that adding the others will, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, dilute from the value of that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So when you have these -- I'm not talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about this particular case.  But in general, when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, it's sometimes easy in retrospect to say, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's an issue that, you know, maybe -- the appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, in the exercise of discretion, thought it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like number 6 in the order of -- of strength.  And you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look back and in hindsight you say, well, he should have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made more of that, and it's not even mentioned at all in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appellate brief. 

 

 

              

I mean, I know there's also issues of trial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

strategy, but it seems it's more typical in an appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case that you have -- you know, you leave things off the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

table.  Is -- is that going to present a problem, in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your view, in evaluating the effectiveness of appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel? 

            

MR. KRETZER:  No, it will not.  There's no 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

doubt that appellate attorneys retain substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

discretion to not raise certain claims that are regarded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be necessarily weaker.  In fact, in a trial, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

presumably almost all appellate lawyers have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily not raise some claims.  That's why the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

backstop of our argument is substantiality. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In other words, it's not one thing to raise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an appellate claim that might have, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theoretically gotten you somewhere, and yet not likely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have gotten a reversal in the reviewing State court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appeals.  It is very difficult to raise a substantial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim, by which we mean, in this context, one that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and this is sort of a distinction that Federal district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges make all the time in habeas -- but the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here would be whether or not it was likely that that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim would have resulted in a different outcome in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewing court of appeals.  And the case --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in this actual case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't the district court hold that the ineffective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of appellate counsel argument, on the merits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was insubstantial?  And if -- if it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insubstantial, then we didn't -- we don't even have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get to the question you would like to present to us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Wasn't it an alternative holding that, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any case, this objection to the instruction was

insubstantial? 

9 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes.  The Federal district 

  

  

 

 

 

court did make an alternative holding on the merits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However, that was not addressed in the Fifth Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion, and was, hence, not a part of the judgment that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was appealed to this Court. 

 

 

 

 

            

So at the minimum, we would ask for relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the same which this Court afforded in Martinez, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a remand to the reviewing court of appeals -- in that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, the Ninth Circuit -- for a determination as to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that prejudice -- prejudice prong.  And, in fact, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Martinez was ultimately unsuccessful in Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court in Arizona on the prejudice prong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're not in Missouri --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, on the -- on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue of whether or not Martinez should be extended to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged inadequate assistance of counsel on appeal, what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the test that I'm supposed to apply?  The -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practicality of this?  The consequences?  The private 

  

  

 

 

 

 

interests of the prisoners and the public interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in finality -- is that what I'm supposed -- is there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some test you want me to apply? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KRETZER:  Oh --

stunning to me to read at page 15 of your brief that one

study indicates that although 81 percent of habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitions in capital cases raise a claim of ineffective 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of counsel, only 31 percent alleged

apply is the same that was in Martinez.  Basically, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first, was there a substantial claim?  Did -- was that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim defaulted in the initial review collateral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding? 

            

And when we say "substantial," we mean one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was likely to result in a different outcome. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's why the claims will be very rare of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial claims of ineffective appellate counsel. 

 

 

 

 

 

And yet when they do exist, they will likely be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incredibly meritorious claims --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but my question was, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was the systemic one, is -- is what are the systemic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards I look to, to see whether or not we should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extend Martinez to this kind of case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KRETZER:  Oh, yes. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then what guidance do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I have?  It looked like Mathews v. Eldridge.  I'm the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

one that -- or this Court's the one that balances? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Well, yes, in Martinez, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court particularly created an equitable rule in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise of this Court's discretion saying that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be an exception as it were to cause and the cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and prejudice inquiry, because otherwise you would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioners who would never have any forum in which this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance claim could be litigated. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The door has been opened in Martinez now for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over 5 years.  There has not been an inundation of new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitions in Federal court.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One -- one 

  

 

 

 

 

significant distinction, of course, is that these claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appellate assistance -- ineffective appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of counsel, under the logic can be raised in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every State.  Martinez, Trevino, it's only where the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State has funneled the decisions to collateral review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Appellate claims like this, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously can't be brought on appeal in every State, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so this would arise, in terms of evaluating the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statistics, it would be many, many times the numbers of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez claims that you see, and we see -- and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are now an awful lot of Martinez claims anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  In Martinez, what Arizona had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

done was said as a statutory matter, you cannot raise an

ineffective assistance contention in the direct appeal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

Instead it was deliberately channeled over to habeas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's a reason that in a claim like 

   

   

 

 

 

Mr. Davila's that the initial review collateral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity to challenge the claim of ineffective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contention is State habeas, and that is because it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impossible, physically impossible --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I've got --

    

 

 

 

 

 

I've got to -- do -- for them to raise the appellate --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes, themselves --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry to cut you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

off, but I -- I understand that, but that's going to be 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true in every State, right?  It's going to be -- you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to have the same difficulty of raising 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffectiveness of appellate counsel on direct review in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every -- every State. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes, that would be a uniform 

   

  

 

 

 

 

impossible --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah.  Martinez, one 

  

  

 

 

 

of the important considerations at least for some in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez is that it is narrow.  It's only where the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State has funneled the ineffective assistance at trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims to collateral review. 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  I would ask the Court to look 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the vantage point.  In Martinez, there was not a

mechanism by which the States were punished for removing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

the claim from what -- direct appeal to habeas.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an equitable exception in favor of the petitioner, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because if the equitable exception were not there, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioners would suffer the reality, there would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no court ever --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, you're not 

  

 

 

 

dealing with the question asked. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KRETZER:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  The question 

  

  

 

 

 

asked has to do with the burden on the courts.  Both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy and Justice Roberts are saying, if we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize this right, the courts are going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inundated with these kinds of claims because in every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't -- can't be, by definition, raised in direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review.  It all has to be channelled to collateral 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review.  So in every State, every defendant will be able 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to raise this claim and it will inundate the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system. 

            

            

MR. KRETZER:  We don't think so.  The --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you haven't 

  

 

 

 

articulated the reasons you don't think so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes.  I would --

many post-conviction ineffective assistance of appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel cases, the 31 percent that Justice Kennedy was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

pointing to, in how many of those is relief granted? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  If any, a very minute number, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

because it is so --

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Infinitesimally small. 

  

 

 

MR. KRETZER:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are there hearings 

  

 

 

 

 

in those cases --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KRETZER:  For --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- cranting the 

  

 

 

 

 

necessity for the court to evaluate the claims before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they decide not to grant the -- the allegation --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  No, very rarely are there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

actually Strickland hearings on 2254 in Federal district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, for the reason that it's very hard to, one, show 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a substantial claim, and then, two, to reach through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The court presumably 

  

 

 

 

 

has to read the -- the filings in the case to decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the claim is not substantial, correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes, it would be necessary for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so the number 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are granted really isn't the consideration we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

looking to, is it?  It's the number that are going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force the courts to review them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Well, I think if one accepts 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that for now, 4 or 5 years Martinez has been the law 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

and -- and a number of these claims have been made, at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most there might be, in a small subset of those, a very 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small number of additional ineffective assistance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate counsel claims made because it is so hard for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a petitioner to formulate such a claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

For a Petitioner such as Mr. Davila, to have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised a claim like this on his own, of course, Martinez 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talked a lot about the importance of having an effective 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of counsel to vindicate an underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffectiveness contention, Mr. Davila would have had to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been familiar with the jury charge, he would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had have been -- with the Texas law --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, are 

   

  

 

 

 

you saying it would have been hard to formulate?  Are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you suggesting that someone facing this sentence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Davila is facing would say, well, let's not do that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's not raise an ineffective assistance of appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel or somewhere and said, because it's just too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard to formulate that claim? 

 

 

 

 

            

These are situations where the defendant is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facing capital punishment where they are going to raise

every possible claim they can, and I don't know why it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be terribly different for defendants facing life 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in prison or further sentences. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Well, the -- as I said, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

there's a very difference between raising every possible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

claim that they could versus a lawyer's obligation to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

raise meritorious, not raise frivolous claims.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there may be at the margin some additional claim that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps when it's sifted through is found not to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately be successful.  We would argue a substantial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

claim is one that necessarily, when it does exist, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be one that which -- about which there does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to be a hearing about the underlying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

ineffectiveness. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What concerns me about your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

position is that it seems to blast an enormous hole in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the doctrine of procedural default.  Unlike Martinez and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlike Trevino, which were cabined, it -- it seems to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, that if we agree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with your position, then anything that -- that an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney in Federal habeas can examine the trial record, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and if that attorney finds anything that seems to be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error, it can be raised in Federal habeas, even if there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was no objection at the time of trial, it wasn't raised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on direct appeal, it wasn't raised in a State collateral

proceeding.  That's where this is going. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And if it's an -- if the underlying error is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance of counsel, well, whatever it is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

all of that will be evaluated by the Federal habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court outside of AEDPA.  That's where this is going. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So this is an enormous hole. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Am I not -- isn't that where this -- isn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that what this means?  Because the -- the argument in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal habeas would be there was cause because counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was ineffective at the collateral -- State collateral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding, and this counsel was ineffective at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State collateral proceeding because there was 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance on direct appeal.  And then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

counsel on direct appeal was ineffective because there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was an error at trial. 

 

 

 

 

            

So the Federal habeas court has to make all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of those determinations, and if the court -- the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which means the court is going to have to look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not there was an error at trial and, in doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, it is not going to be asking whether a -- whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a State court reasonably rejected the claim because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was never presented to the State court.  So it's going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be de novo review. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  It would be very difficult --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the situation is not simply -- the task for the Federal

habeas petitioner is not to simply aggregate every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

objected to or unobjected to evidentiary error or any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

downline error and simply present all of those in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal habeas petition. 

 

 

            

What they would then have to do is also find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some authority from the State court of appeals saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this type of error or constellation of errors would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitute a reversible error. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they'd have to find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

something that they can argue in the Federal habeas was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an error, but procedural default would be out the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

window. 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Well, yes, but, again, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not enough to simply say these were the trial errors. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One would have to say that these were trial errors and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's some reason why the reviewing court of appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have held differently.  That's very different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

from --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.  And the Federal 

  

  

 

 

 

habeas court is going to have to analyze that, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means the Federal habeas court is going to have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analyze all of these alleged trial errors that were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never previously raised in the State court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Our argument would simply be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's one thing to make a -- state this error or that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

error happened at the trial.  Of course, every trial has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

some error that occurred in it.  But one would have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do to create a substantial claim, in other words, not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one that would be very easily discarded by the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court would be then to say, here's a reason why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this would create a different outcome.  That would not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

be easy to do for downline claims, but when one gets to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims as important or as vital as jury instructional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

errors, those are a type of substantial claim that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Say, so what -- you started 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say this, but I guess Martinez itself, one of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns was that any mistake that the trial -- that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial attorney makes -- and normally, by the way, you --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't make ineffective assistance counsel claims on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct appeal, I don't think.  It's usually the same 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer.  You have to make it in State habeas. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Okay.  What would happen would be that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant with a new lawyer in Federal habeas would go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through every mistake that the trial court made, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- that the trial lawyer made, and say it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance of counsel.  And so the judge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have to do just what Justice Alito said, though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps a few fewer States. 

   

 

 

            

So, you started to say this.  What's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer?  It's five years.  To what extent has the

Martinez claim proved a burden on Federal court?  Is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

there any empirical information? 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  We don't think there had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been -- there may have been additional -- Martinez and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now Martinez-Trevino claims that had been made in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal petitions, but not an increase in the number or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appreciable increase in the number of Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petition --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What I -- I asked you 

   

   

  

 

 

really, is there any empirical information?  Because, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, I think you probably think no.  But the other 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

side may think yes.  And so that's what I would like to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, is there any -- anyplace I could look to find out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it has proved to be a burden or not, where there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been a lot of claims or not? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes.  We do have some studies 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

cited, and certainly I will get them to have ready to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present in the -- in the rebuttal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But our point would be that, again, if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule of Martinez is still the rule, and if it is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also applied to 

 

 

ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims, then 

 

 

Petitioners, like Mr. Davila, are actually worse off if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their trial lawyer did object than if they did not.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they did object, they -- they had not objected down at

trial court, they would already be covered by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

Martinez -- this is a very modest application of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez that we don't think will create appreciable --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But Martinez concerned 

  

 

 

 

ineffective assistance of counsel in a limited number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

States, and Trevino arguably extended it to a few 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional States.  But if we accept your argument, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies everywhere, and it's not limited to ineffective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of counsel.  It is -- it applies to every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single -- every single type of error that could occur at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial. 

            

MR. KRETZER:  No.  We would disagree. 

  

  

 

 

 

Certainly, the only issue -- Martinez and Trevino, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, were limited.  It talked about ineffective 

  

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of trial claims.  Those were the claims that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were presented in those cases.  That was different.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think that this Court necessarily, if you rule in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our favor in this case, that has application anywhere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel 

 

claims. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  But the ineffective 

  

  

 

 

 

assistance of appellate counsel would be based on any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

type of error that occurred at trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So here you have a jury instruction error. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

But if we agree with you, it would apply to the

22 

can dream of.  So whatever the statistics are on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez, this goes way, way, way beyond Martinez.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Trevino. 

            

MR. KRETZER:  I would say that, again, the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

only -- if Martinez is the rule and those -- Martinez 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims were about ineffective assistance of trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel now, have been made for at least five years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is not, as Justice Breyer said, a large number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims made contending ineffective assistance of 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate counsel.  And that's why it's so important 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Martinez doctrine do apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't think that's -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

think, as I'm gathering Justice Alito's point -- and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's an -- you know, it's an interesting point and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important, what is ineffective assistance of appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel?  I mean, I understand somewhat ineffective 

    

   

 

 

assistance of trial counsel, but it can't just be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary mistake.  It has to be something rather 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

special. 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, is ineffective 

  

 

 

 

assistance of appellate counsel the same, or is an

appellate counsel ineffective whenever the appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel fails to present a claim that the trial judge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made a mistake in the trial? 

   

 

 

 

23 

            

MR. KRETZER:  The Strickland standard for 

  

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance is the same for contentions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance of trial counsel and ineffective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of appellate counsel. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So it's very hard to see 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it would be ineffective assistance when there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't also ineffective assistance of trial counsel. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What is such a case?  I mean, I'm just probably missing 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, but what -- what is a case where -- where there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, but not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance of trial counsel?  What is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes.  Certainly evidence is 

  

  

 

 

 

seen in Mr. Davila's case, because there is, in Texas, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury instructional error is not forfeitable.  In other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, there is not some -- unless the trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer objects, there's necessarily --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So then why didn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

trial counsel -- this -- I can see that this was a very 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important matter for this particular defendant, but then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why wasn't the trial counsel ineffective?

did formulate -- maybe not the best calibrated -- but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did formulate an objection.  The -- I think the way in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

which this arose in this case is very unusual in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neither the -- the State never requested a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transferred-intent instruction. 

 

            

After the jury, which had been out for over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four hours at this point with those confessions, sent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out that jury note No. 2 asking directly about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory of Mr. --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what about saying 

  

 

 

 

 

this:  Suppose we said, yes, there is -- it's the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation, you know, you have ineffective assistance --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have ineffective appellate counsel.  Well, 

  

 

 

 

 

obviously, you can't raise it because he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective.  So you never had a shot at it.  It's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

catch-22.  Same with the trial counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

But those things, it's very unlikely that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're going to have ineffective assistant of appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel where there wasn't also the ineffective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of trial counsel.  It's very hard to think of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such an instance.  And just the bringing of an ordinary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistake is failure to bring an ordinary mistake will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlikely to be qualified. 

 

 

 

            

Suppose we wrote that into the opinion or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the equivalent.  What would you think of that?

MR. KRETZER:  I think the problem is that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

25 

the question here is not a Strickland determination as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the direct appellate attorney in this case.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may have been a strategic reason not to raise the claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I would rather be skeptical, considering the 

 

 

 

 

 

direct appellate brief specifically did not request oral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  There were no page limitations they were up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against or anything like that, but that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that would be sorted out at a Strickland 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing where this -- the first prong, the tactical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for doing or not doing something, would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pressed out in detail. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Counsel, we spent a lot of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

time talking about Martinez, but one case we haven't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussed is Coleman. 

 

 

            

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And Coleman sets out the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

general rule that ineffective assistance by counsel in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral review does not suffice to establish cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for purposes of Federal habeas.  That's the general 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  And Martinez carves out a small exception for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

when there wouldn't be any chance to raise an issue in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State court at all.  And that doesn't apply here because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial court counsel could have raised this issue.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all admit that. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

So when we -- when we overrule a precedent, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or part of a precedent, as I think you're effectively 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

26 

asking us to do with Coleman, we normally don't just ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the merits.  We also ask about the reliance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest, the workability, whether the question is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory rather than constitutional.  And I didn't see 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you address any of those factors in your brief.  And I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wondering what I'm supposed to make of that.  Help me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out. 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes.  The Coleman rule bars 

  

  

 

 

 

 

all other attorney mistakes that would be imputed to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client.  Martinez is very clear that there was not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stare decisis problem because, in Coleman, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffectiveness was missing the deadline for the appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the hearing on the habeas petition in Federal -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State court in Virginia, not an ineffectiveness in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initial collateral proceeding itself, called first-tier 

 

 

 

 

 

review opportunities at that point in time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Nothing about the relief Mr. Davila is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking will have any effect on deficient performance by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal habeas counsel.  There will be no effect that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State petitioner missed their limitations period to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file in Federal district court.  There would be no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect if that State habeas petitioner had gotten leave 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to file a successor writ, or then re-file for State

All of those situations would still be barred by the

rule in Coleman, so Coleman is very much good law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Martinez simply looked at -- at peace that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was arguing dicta in Coleman, whether or not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffectiveness was in that initial review collateral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding itself, and that's the situation we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If I may ask one question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

about your -- your bottom line.  I think you said that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if counsel had taken up -- challenged the instruction on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct appeal, it would have led to a new trial. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. KRETZER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why a new trial?  Why 

   

  

  

 

 

isn't the consequence of ineffective assistance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate counsel not a new trial of the case, but just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a new State court appeal? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Oh, yes.  Well, the remedy --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal remedy that we're seeking would be leave to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file a additional supplemental direct appeal in State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

court, at which the argument would first be made that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury instructional challenge was the harm standard

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Extending Martinez to appellate-IAC claims 

 

 

 

 

will have a huge systemic cost by opening up the entire 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial and everything that happened at trial to Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas review.  And the countervailing concern, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor noted, is there's an infinitesimally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small number of meritorious appellate IAC claims.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're going to have huge costs --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ah, but does that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

does that mean that we don't remedy that?  Assuming --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because, I agree -- Justice Breyer pointed out, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

others have, the number of cases are going to be tiny. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And as with all cases, there's an initial uptick of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims until people settle down and realize that it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small number that are viable, and that happens pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quickly.  Do we ignore that simply because there might

be that small uptick at the beginning? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Well, this is why Coleman 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is still the rule.  Martinez expressly reaffirmed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Coleman.  Outside of that narrow context at trial --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You mean the substantial 

  

 

 

 

 

claim of IAC?  This is -- no one is going to be looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at an ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim, 

 

 

 

assuming one is viable, unless there's a substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

claim, and no one will otherwise look at it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Well, and here, the 

  

 

 

 

 

question is -- the relevant appellate IAC claims to look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at here are those where the claim was raised in trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court, and the trial court did, in fact, adjudicate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide the issue.  It made a record, and then both 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate and habeas counsel have chosen not to raise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  And just -- just to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

fortify your point, I take it there are any number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense counsel objections that are overruled.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defense counsel has been adequate, but then if -- but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then the appellate counsel may very well overlook some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of those.  And that -- and so -- so the idea that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's not going to be IAC at the appellate level if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was not IAC at the trial level, it seems to me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not -- not sound. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Justice Kennedy, and 

  

 

 

 

when -- here, there -- there's no dispute that trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel was effective.  They have not raised a trial IAC 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim about the supplemental jury instruction. 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

            

And so while appellate IAC claims are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult to prevail, there -- it's going to be even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more difficult in this situation, because the trial IAC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gateway that Martinez already provides would give a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioner everything they needed if trial counsel was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective.  So if trial counsel does raise the claim, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if trial counsel does preserve it, and the trial court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does decide the issue, then both appellate and habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel choose not to raise it, it's going to be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exponentially lower chance that those claims are going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be meritorious. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you address my 

  

 

 

 

 

question to the Petitioner's counsel?  What is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard of -- we're supposed to follow in deciding this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case?  Our view of the systemic consequences?  And --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and what is -- what -- what is the case authority that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives us instruction in that regard? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Martinez itself recognized 

  

 

 

 

that what it was doing creating the narrow exception 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from Coleman was that was an equitable judgment.  And in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fashioning the rule, the Court looked at -- it was

trying to maintain a baseline where no court had ever 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicated the underlying claim of trial error, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court recognized the bedrock foundation unique right to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial counsel.  And putting together those two factors, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

plus the channelling concern, those were the three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pillars of Martinez, and none of those three pillars are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present here. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let's go through the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

three pillars here.  No one is reviewing whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate counsel has been adequate.  Do you -- although 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're not entitled constitutionally to appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel on direct appeal, I don't know that we haven't, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repeatedly, and so has every other court recognized the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

importance of counsel at the appellate level.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

virtually every State, if not every State, gives you a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer.  So that prong is, in my mind, equal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The second prong is the --

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could you respond to that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

first?  Is that okay, Justice Sotomayor? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because -- because there 

  

 

 

 

 

is -- there's no right -- there's no need to have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate process, but once the State has given an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate process, there is a right to have effective 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of counsel on appeal.  So that seems an

important right. 

 

32 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Every appellate IAC claim 

  

 

 

 

 

is necessarily going to, though, be based on an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying issue of an alleged trial error.  In other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, this is going to be a -- to use the words of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoner's counsel in Martinez v. Ryan, appellate IAC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims are a second order claim.  They are going to be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on what happened at trial.  And the trial court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will have already adjudicated that claim of underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial error in the relevant set of cases that any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extension of Martinez could apply to.  Because, again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the court --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I -- I --

    

   

  

 

 

they're only -- they're not asking the question on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial court whether appellate counsel has erred.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are asking a different question. 

   

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  That's correct.  But an 

  

  

 

 

 

appellate IAC claim necessarily says, my appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel didn't raise an issue and that issue is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that happened at trial that I thought was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

error.  That issue is --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not just error, but 

  

 

 

 

 

error likely to result in a different outcome. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Yes.  However, that alleged 

  

  

 

 

 

trial error that would have resulted in a different

outcome would have been, in fact, adjudicated in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial court already.  In --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But we already know that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

33 

even under plain-error review, because we've done it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in a number of different cases, that trial courts 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

err. 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  But if -- if the Court were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewing this under plain error, though --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The question is, did 

  

 

 

 

 

appellate counsel err in failing to raise something that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might ultimately go to the Supreme Court, as has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened. 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  The Martinez trial IAC 

  

 

 

 

 

gateway, though, that already exists, would cover any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim that was not, in fact, preserved in the trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  So what the Court is confronting now is whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to extend Martinez to situations where the trial court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has, in fact, already ruled on the case.  So really what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case concerns would be a doubly defaulted claim of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They have ruled on --

  

 

 

 

 

 

they've ruled on a question of error below, but not a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of appellate counsel error. 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  That -- that's right.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

precise ruling on the appellate counsel issue, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

claim in particular, would not have been passed upon. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

However, that claim is necessarily predicated on an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue of a -- an alleged trial error that would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been adjudicated, and that neither appellate nor habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel raised it. 

 

 

            

And in that situation, when you'd have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have three levels of error, there's going to be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infinitesimally small number of cases that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meritorious, combined with opening up the entire trial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every single issue, even State law objections to Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas review.  That would be taking the Court back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something akin to Fay v. Noia, which was overruled --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The same question that I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

had before.  I -- I mean, every -- every instance in 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which a trial counsel might have objected but didn't, in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle, could be the subject of Martinez.  I suppose 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's quite a few.  I don't know there are any more or 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any less.  So what's actually happened?  Is there any 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

information anywhere about whether -- any empirical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information about whether habeas courts, Federal habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts, have been deluged, or have -- do we know? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  The answer is yes.  In our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

brief, we've pointed out --

3,800 times in Federal cases since it was decided, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would also point the Court to the amicus brief for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Criminal Justice Legal Foundation at page 20.  What it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did was it looked at the last ten cases in the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

Circuit out of Arizona in capital cases.  Arizona was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picked because that would have been the longest standing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State that has that rule, because that was where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez came from, and seven out of the ten cases there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised Martinez claims. 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How many were granted? 

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  None.  We are -- we are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

facing all sorts of collateral litigation in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez trial IAC paradigm.  And the Court justified 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that on the basis that that right was unique.  Martinez 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was just the latest in a long line of cases where this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has treated the right to trial counsel and only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that right as unique, that would be an exception to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural bars that would apply otherwise. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it fair to say several 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundred a year have come up under Martinez out of -- out 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of, roughly, how many habeas petitions?  Out of fifty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousand?  I don't know.  Hundred thousand?  Forty

statistics. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But several 

  

  

 

 

 

36 

hundred a year.  Now, is there a reason to think there 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

would be more?  I mean, after all, you know, I grant you 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's slightly different, you're complaining here about a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial error that was raised and the judge wrongly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided it.  And the counsel on appeal should have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed that out, but he didn't.  Just like you point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out with the trial judge -- the trial lawyer should have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised, but he didn't.  Very, very few are granted, very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

few.  And here, I guess, very, very few would be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

granted.  But the burden would be to read all those. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, is it -- is it more, do you think?  Why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would it be more?  I don't see why it would be more.  It 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be.  I'm -- that's why I'm asking, though. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Well, I'm not sure more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

actual petitions would be filed, but the courts will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly see a massive uptick in Federal habeas review 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of appellate IAC claims.  As the reply brief at page 15 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noted, a third of the cases were raising appellate IAC 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims.  And it's not just will these claims be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful.  It's are courts going to have to go through 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them?  And -- and consider in briefing this case, what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the courts and the States will be presented with.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be arguing about what did appellate counsel raise, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

37 

what didn't appellate counsel raise, which claims were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stronger, and then what was the underlying trial error. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would this apply in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- wouldn't -- I mean, this would apply in every State, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not just States 

  

 

 

 

 

where Martinez and Trevino apply, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL KELLER:  That's right. 

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And wouldn't that be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pertinent in assessing the significance of the number of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times this issue is going to be raised? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  It absolutely would. 

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If it's going to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised in 50 States rather than two? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  It would.  And this goes to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the point that Martinez recognized, that there --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's an external factor.  There's a deliberate choice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

by the State to channel a claim.  That's not present 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  And it will apply in all 50 States. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, yes, that's true, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

how many are in the other?  How many -- what's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number in the other?  What is the -- what is the number? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, the norm, I thought, was that you raise an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective-assistance-counsel claim in the collateral

proceeding. 

            

So how many States, actually, does Martinez 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not apply to?  Do you know that?  I -- I doubt that 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's, you know, a small number, but I'm pretty certain 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it isn't every State. 

 

 

 

            

            

Do we have any idea here? 

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  At page 33 of our brief, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have the precise number, but we do cite various 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases that show that Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Ohio, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Oklahoma, the Martinez Rule does not apply, because, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively, what happens there is the proceedings are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stayed so that the trial-IAC claim can be raised at that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time and not --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But in -- in most States it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does apply; isn't that right? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, 

  

  

  

 

 

General, I think that your brief did the right thing in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms of thinking about Martinez to say why did Martinez 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make the exception that it did and ask whether those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same factors suggest an analogous exception here.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that that's the right way to go about thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about this question. 

 

 

            

So, I mean, it seems to me that your main 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theme here is this idea that you did get one shot; is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

is that -- is that correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Combined with the unique 

  

 

 

 

 

right to trial counsel --

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah --

  

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  -- and the -- and the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the significant --

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay. 

  

 

GENERAL KELLER:  -- systemic costs. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So the unique right, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

I mean, I think we've talked about.  It's -- trial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, for sure, is the most, most, most important, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but appellate counsel is pretty important too. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But just let's think about this you -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got one shot already.  I guess I'm just not sure I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand it, because it seems to me what Martinez said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't get a shot to make your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial -- ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your IATC claim, and only if we made the exception that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we did would you get a shot to make that trial counsel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

And here, similarly, only if we do the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing will you ever get a shot to make a claim that your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate counsel was deficient.  And people do have an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent, freestanding constitutional right to 

 

 

 

 

effective appellate counsel.

GENERAL KELLER:  But Martinez focused on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

40 

fact that there was a particular trial error and a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular type of trial error that was not being able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be raised.  And appellate-IAC claims are going to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think if you read --

    

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  -- on that trial error. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- Martinez, Martinez 

  

 

 

 

basically does not talk at all about the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error.  It talks about the ineffective assistance claim. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now, of course, ineffective assistance is important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because, you know, it's not just the lawyers there for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show, it's -- it's to remedy or prevent some underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

But the same is true here.  If Martinez was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to figure out how to ensure the fairness of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial process, this would be trying to figure out how to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensure, through effective counsel, the fairness of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate process.  And it seems to me quite analogous, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeed identical --

 

 

            

            

level. 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  But in --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- just on a different 

   

  

 

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  But in Martinez, the 

  

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance claim was a trial error.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

litigation necessarily applies --

 

 

 

41 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But here -- but here it's an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate error. 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But one thing that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

same is that the State habeas would be the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity to raise this.  You can't raise ineffective 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of appellate counsel on the appeal.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious.  So your -- the -- the State habeas is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first time you could raise it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And in considering this question, I'm sure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you anticipated this, Justice Scalia, in Martinez, said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's not a dime's worth of difference between an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance of trial counsel -- the issue in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez -- and those where Petitioner claims his direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal counsel was ineffective. 

 

 

 

            

Was he wrong in thinking there's not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dime's worth of difference? 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  He was wrong in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instance.  And the reason is because Martinez was trying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to maintain a baseline where at least some court had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicated the underlying trial error, and even as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez itself reaffirmed the general rule of Coleman. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And if this Court were to start extending that now to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate-IAC claims, it would be returning the Court to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something akin to Fay v. --

of --

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, again --

  

 

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  -- litigation --

  

 

 

 

42 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- General, you're sort 

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  -- at some point. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- redefining it so that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fits your position.  But Martinez was about having some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court evaluate the ineffective assistance of trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim, and this is about having some court evaluate the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And is there an underlying thing that we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to get at?  Sure.  In Martinez, it was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance of trial counsel to ensure that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trial process was fair.  Here, it's -- it's -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having some court litigate the ineffective assistance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate counsel claim in order to ensure that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate counsel is fair.  So the two are quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogous. 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  But under that reasoning, 

  

 

 

 

 

it would be -- the right to counsel necessarily has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end at some point.  It could always be that you could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then show ineffective assistance of State habeas counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or Federal habeas counsel. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It -- it ends, I think --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're exactly right.  And I think it ends where the

Constitution gives out.  Because we've said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

43 

although the State does not have to set up an appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process, once it sets up an appeals process, you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to effective counsel in it.  And so that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where it ends. 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  That's right as a 

  

 

 

 

 

constitutional matter.  However, State procedural bars 

  

 

 

 

 

under Coleman and Martinez still apply.  And the cost of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

federalism and comity, particularly in a situation like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this where the State trial court will have necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already decided the issue, and upsetting that is going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be precisely what the Court was trying to avoid in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Coleman.  And that's why when -- the first sentence of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Coleman is, "This is a case about federalism."  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

indeed this case is too. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  And then there was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Martinez.  And as you said, in Martinez and in Trevino, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we really went through the three factors that you talk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about in your brief:  How important is this?  Is this 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only shot?  And, you know, does the State have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something to do with this, or something.  Is that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third one? 

 

            

And, you know, I'm -- I'm suggesting it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty important, and this is your only shot.

not your only shot because the claim is going to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about an underlying alleged trial error.  Here, opening 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

up the claims for appellate-IAC --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this claim --

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  -- you're going to have --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- is not about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

underlying trial error.  This claim is about effective 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of appellate counsel.  And -- and -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's about ensuring that the appellate process has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrity and fairness attached to it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  But, Justice Kagan, at root 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here, the issue is a supplemental jury instruction which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not preserved, which was correct, and there would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been no prejudice from in any event.  And this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the type of case the Court should be worried about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are going to be these State law objections of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that came up at trial, although this is an odd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

posture because it was not preserved in fact, but that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be the case the Court would have to be worrying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about. 

            

And then we're going to be here twice over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that claim being defaulted, arguing about not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily whether there was -- did appellate counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make this decision or that decision.  It's going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collapse into an underlying review of what happened at

trial.  And that's going to apply for all errors at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial on federal habeas, which is something this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has long avoided, to undo the judgments issued by State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

courts, particularly when they are doubly defaulted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims that were, in fact, considered by at least one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court before. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, General, that assumes 

  

 

 

 

 

that a -- that some court is going to say, if there was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a trial error that we can see out there, then there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  But that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not correct for many of the reasons that people on -- I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, that everybody acknowledges.  To have ineffective 

  

 

 

 

 

 

assistance of appellate counsel, it's not because you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed to make an argument about any old trial error; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's going to be a special and rare thing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  And, Justice Kagan,

to be an infinitesimally small number of cases are going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be meritorious, that has to be weighed under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Martinez's equitable calculus against the huge systemic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cost of opening up the entire trial on Federal habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review to every little State law objection and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary objection.  Here, it's jury instructions.

an objection that should have been granted, and it might

have -- might have led to a different result at trial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it wasn't raised on direct appeal, then there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be ineffective assistance of -- of appellate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel. 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Exactly, Justice Alito, and 

  

 

 

 

 

that's why it will collapse. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Also, too --

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  That's not 

  

  

 

 

 

the test -- that's not the test.  The test is, would it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have resulted in a -- a difference on appellate review, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

not at trial. 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's -- the appellate 

  

 

 

 

 

review is on the basis of the record as it exists, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on one that should have existed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Yes, but it's going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

collapse into an analysis of what was the alleged trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error, because that would be what appellate counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should have been trying to raise in that situation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Also, if I can back out, what we're talking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about here is not just success on the merits of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  Raising a substantial claim of appellate-IAC, 

   

  

 

 

 

that standard is the would reasonable jurists debate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards that the Court is familiar with from the

certificate of appealability standard.  That is not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

high threshold to survive.  And so the number of claims 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would flood into courts on Federal habeas review 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be many.  It's --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you'd have to show, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't you, that -- that the -- any reasonable lawyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have raised this -- would have won this claim and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made a difference -- raised it, won it, and it would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have made a difference. 

   

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  You'd have to show that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

but this case --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, but that's not that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

easy to show, just as it's not that easy to show in a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the -- in the same situation in the trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  But that's analyzing 

  

 

 

 

whether the claim would succeed.  As far as --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No --

  

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  -- on court --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I accept that, and 

    

   

 

 

 

people raise all kinds of things in habeas.  You know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're -- they're -- this is a -- district judges are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kept busy with these habeas petitions, I accept that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's why I'm -- I'll read the empirical -- I -- I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curious to know just what the situation is empirically. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  And -- and they're going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

48 

be even busier and it's going to divert their attention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from claims that would otherwise be meritorious. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Extending an exception like this to an acknowledged set 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of claims that have an infinitesimally small chance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merit, that is not a good use of judicial resources. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's not why the writ of habeas corpus exists.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the equitable judgment inherent in -- in Martinez and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various other cases on habeas review have noted that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that equity must weigh in, and we would be inundated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with all sorts of claims about even State law and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The other side has been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

brought out.  I mean, there is the occasional claim 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

where let's suppose the appellate lawyer just really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't even bring an appeal.  He had a two-page brief 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the trial was rife with errors and a serious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty.  It was attached and -- and no relief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatsoever.  He can't bring that to any court.  Do you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see that?  That's the other side of it.  Even if there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are only a few. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or you could bring it on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

State collateral. 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  You absolutely -- you could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

bring it as is --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  He has to have -- he has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have failed to do that, and -- or at least the State

collateral review has to also have been inadequate.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so we have to have a couple of situations where they are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both inadequate or you don't even get into the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  So the standard for winning, which you concede 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is quite -- is very tough and -- but suppose it's met, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's -- that's, of course, what's annoying on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side.  Here is a person in jail forever or worse, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the trial filled with errors and didn't have decent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel anywhere and what a mess.  I mean, shouldn't 

    

   

 

 

 

 

there be some remedy?  And there is none.  And that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why Justice Scalia wrote that there's no way to stop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this extension. 

 

            

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Well, first of all --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  He wasn't for it.


  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.)


            

GENERAL KELLER:  First of all, the


  

 

 

 

 

miscarriage of justice -- actually in this instance, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception to overcome procedural default -- already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists.  And so that would capture any cases of actual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innocence that Your Honor would be discussing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

exist? 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where -- where does it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  McQuiggin v. Perkins. 

  

 

 

 

The -- you can overcome a procedural default for a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

miscarriage of justice.  Wholly separate from Martinez.

And in that situation you could overcome a procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

default using that -- that actual-innocence gateway. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, as Justice Kennedy noted, though, State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habeas would be the place to raise that claim.  And if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the claim was adjudicated in trial court, a record was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made for appellate counsel and the habeas counsel, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then neither appellate --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Actual innocence means he 

  

 

 

 

 

was actually innocent. 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  Well -- or actually 

  

 

 

 

 

innocent of the death penalty. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  And that would be another 

  

 

 

 

 

 

way that that type of claim --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's an 

  

 

 

 

interesting open question. 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  For a different day. 

   

  

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  But the question before the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court today is whether to extend the narrow exception 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for trial IAC claims when the court has recognized that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trial is the main event; appeals are not central due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to determination of innocence or guilt.  There's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant difference between appeals and trials, as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court has noted in Ross.  And the costs of opening

up the entire Federal trial do not warrant that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extension. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, could I just -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

51 

guess I got a little bit confused in your exchange with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito, because you had been pressing this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just going to be an infinitesimally small --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infinitesimally small, I think that that was your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

phrase.  And Justice Alito said he thought it would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen all the time, and then you said yes, and then you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went back to infinitesimally small. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So, which is it? 

 

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  The answer is, there's 

  

 

 

 

 

going to be an infinitesimally small number of claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are actually successful, meritorious at the end of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the day.  However, the courts and the States are going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be faced with a wide number of --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  Okay.  I thought 

    

  

  

 

that his point was different, that it was actually not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to be infinitesimally small.  But let's say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is going to be pretty rare, as you say.  You know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then I think it really is Justice Breyer's question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's like, okay, it will be rare.  But the alternative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that those rare, good claims, where there really has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a defective appellate process and a violation of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

the constitutional right to a fair appellate process has

been violated, and there's no way to correct for that in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

the same way that there was no way to correct for the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trial -- the ineffective trial counsel that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talked about in Martinez and Trevino. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  You'd still have the 

  

 

 

 

 

actual-innocence exception, and also Martinez reaffirmed 

 

 

 

 

 

the general rule of Coleman.  And what State procedural 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bars necessarily will do is bar certain claims that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise could have been raised.  But when a trial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

court has adjudicated the case and neither appellate nor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a habeas counsel have raised it, the universe of cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we're talking about here combined with the cost on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other side of opening an entire Federal trial up do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not warrant that extension.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It did reaffirm the general 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rule of Coleman except to the extent that this was your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only shot.  And this is your only shot to raise a claim 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a violation of a constitutional right. 

   

 

 

 

            

GENERAL KELLER:  To raise that particular 

  

 

 

 

 

claim, but that particular claim --

 

 

 

 

 

            

with here. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's all we're dealing 

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL KELLER:  But it will be predicated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on an underlying trial issue.

And that's the difference.  The trial IAC 

  

 

 

 

 

 

53 

claim in Martinez, that was the trial error.  That was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the particular trial error the court was concerned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about, and that unique bedrock right. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Here, in contrast, when the Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized repeatedly that appeals are quite different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from trials, and that an appellate IAC claim is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily predicated upon an alleged trial error, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has adjudicated that alleged trial error.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

separating it out and just saying that the appellate IAC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim itself has not been raised, that has to be seen, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though, in the context that the underlying claim has. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

If there are no further questions, we ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court to affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.

Mr. Kretzer, three minutes. 

 

 

 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH KRETZER 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  The point at which my friend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

elicited a little bit of laughter in the courtroom is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when he talked about whether or not actual innocence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would apply to actual innocence of the death penalty, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and he said that would be an issue for a future day. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think it bears to note that the error in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, in Mr. Davila's case, was a guilt/innocence

phase error.  In other words, error that arose at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilt/innocence phase.  In other words, had the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been allowed, properly instructed, Mr. Moblin -- with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Davila's theory of defense, he would not have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to get the death penalty.

we'd create a couple of strange incentives if -- if we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went down your road. 

 

 

 

            

If procedural default by State habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause, I can see a world in which State habeas counsel 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

might have an incentive not to raise it, you know, might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually be ineffective assistance of State habeas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel to raise the issue, because Federal habeas may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be more forgiving.  So what do we about that problem, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number one? 

 

            

And, number two, do we also create an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive for States to stop using collateral review to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test IAC claims?  They don't have to do that.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally thought to be favorable to defense that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do do that, because it gives defense a chance to present 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence and prepare and do things like that.  Some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

States don't permit it.  Oklahoma, my old jurisdiction, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was very hard for defense counsel.  And don't we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

create an incentive to go back to that, the bad old 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

days?  And -- and so by adding more procedure and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfecting this, do we actually wind up hurting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense interests in this case? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Any State habeas attorney who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would deliberately fault a claim from State habeas 

   

 

 

 

 

 

because they think they could get an ultimately more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable meritorious review in Federal court would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily be violating any number of rules of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

professional conduct.  As an initial matter, they would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be --

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Why?  Why?  If it's -- if 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

it's -- if it's the effective best strategy for your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

client, I would think that's exactly what you'd do. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. KRETZER:  Well, as an initial matter, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one would necessarily be perpetrating ineffective 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance on their own by deliberately defaulting a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim from State habeas.  There's very few attorneys out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there who would deliberately open themself up to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

susceptibility of ineffectiveness contention if, for no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other reason, you're kicked off the court appointments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list.  There's any number of reasons why lawyers would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a duty of candor to court not to deliberately

strategically try not to raise a claim here, so that, in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, they can get some more favorable forum later on. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

            

Outside the death penalty context, has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remember that, of course, the process goes very slowly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so one might, in a non-death case, in a general 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony case, might -- one might already be free from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

custody by the point they would have this aired in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court. 

 

            

The number of Federal courts actually having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits hearings on Strickland claims is incredibly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small.  And considering that habeas is designed --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal habeas is designed to prevent and correct severe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

malfunctions of the State trial system, that's probably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a very good thing.  And yet, in cases where the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel 

 

claim is so integrally intertwined with the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strength of the appellate claim that was not raised, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think there's serious pause, because all that Mr. Davila 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is asking is for the same standard as that which exists 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Martinez.  Bedrock principles, where the situation --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the contention has to be raised in a writ.  The -- the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two situations are exactly analogous.
