CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next this morning in Case 15-1189, Impression Products 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v. Lexmark International. 

 

 

            

Mr. Pincus. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

This case brings before the Court two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions regarding the patent exhaustion doctrine, also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

known as the first sale doctrine.  As this Court said in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bowman, under that doctrine, the initial authorized sale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

item.  And by exhausting the patentee's monopoly on that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

item, the sale confers on the purchaser, or any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequent owner, the right to use or sell the thing as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he sees fit. 

 

 

            

That principle goes back, of course, to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15th century.  The common law refused to enforce 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

restraints on alienations of chattels based on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental insight that you own the goods that you buy, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you should be able to do with them what you wish, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that clouds over Title -- hurt the marketability of

goods and intercommerce, and importantly, in the patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, allowing these downstream restrictions to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forced would preempt secondary markets with -- which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

check the patent owner's monopoly power. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let me begin with the first question, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is whether the authorized sale of an article embodying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patent exhausts patent rights with respect to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article, or whether the patentee may impose restrictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable under patent laws, such as on resale, repair 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or reuse simply by stating such a restriction in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales agreement. 

 

            

            

The courts --

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry to 

  

 

 

 

 

interrupt you, but that limitation is critical, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Enforceable under patent law? 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Enforceable under patent law. 

  

 

 

 

 

We -- there's no question here.  The contract law, with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its limitations, would allow the enforcement of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those restrictions if they were a valid contract.  This 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is all about whether the patent law remedies apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The courts' description and application of 

 

 

 

 

 

the doctrine for more than 150 years makes clear that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such restrictions cannot be enforced under the patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  A --

of really important rules that have not been codified? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why hasn't this been codified? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. PINCUS:  In the Patent Act, Your Honor? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Too busy or what? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think -- I think 

   

   

  

 

 

that -- that there were a number of -- of -- of patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law rules that Congress didn't codify it fully or either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all in the 1952 Act.  This was one.  The Court, in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the contributory infringement area, for example, has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked to pre-1952 law to flesh out the details of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contributory infringement that the -- that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't specify. 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did that -- did the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

failure to codify mean we should be somewhat cautious --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PINCUS:  I don't --

    

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- in extending -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

extending it? 

 

            

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I -- I don't think --

   

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or in -- or in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting -- you don't --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  -- there's a question about 

   

  

 

 

 

extending it.  I -- I think -- I think the Court's 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

enunciation of the rule in the cases prior to 1952 was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very clear and specific.  So I think it was -- there's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really no doubt that when Congress enacted the law in

1952, it did so with the knowledge that there was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle that I've recited, and -- and the Bowman 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recitation is consistent with -- with many, many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions of this Court dating back to the 1800s that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

say the same thing, that when there is an authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sale, the patent rights are exhausted.  The Court said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in some cases, the -- the article falls out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent laws and all that applies is State law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And most importantly, the sole -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's sole decision upholding these sort of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions, A.B. Dick was expressly overruled a few 

   

 

 

 

 

 

years later in the motion picture patents case.  So we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not only have the Court's consistent enunciation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine, we have the fact that there was this deviation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then an immediate correction.  So --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's contributory 

  

 

 

 

negligence.  What other patent ideas were not codified? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  The misuse doctrine, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

believe, was -- was codified initially, although there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been some subsequent amendments that have done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  Other patent defenses, there were -- there were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years, for example, as the government points out in its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, between the -- the late 1800s and 1952, there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no infringement; wasn't explicitly referenced in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patent Act.  But everyone knew that the common law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

rules, the rules that have been developed under prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes, continue to apply and that there was a remedy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for infringement, and what its contours were were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

specified by -- by the Court's prior decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it's an area where there is a lot of --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the work has been done by adopting and incorporating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these prior decisions. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the Fed -- Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's rule on this is 25 years old.  Has it caused a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of problems? 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, the Federal Circuit's 

  

 

 

 

 

rule is old, but it's been subject to dispute, both when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court decided Quanta and then again when the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided Bowman.  Most commentators, as we discussed in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

our brief, and some lower courts believed that the rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had been displaced.  Even at the time it was decided, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some of the -- the amicus briefs point out, commentators 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were skeptical that it could be reconciled with this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's rule.  So the practice at industry, and this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussed in the Medical Device Reprocessor's brief, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, and the Intel brief -- were counseling their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clients not to abide by -- not to take action based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this rule because it was quite suspect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In recent years, as the Intel brief --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus brief points out, there have been efforts now to

take action based on the rule, and it is causing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems in this global supply chain --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's certainly a 

  

 

 

 

 

rather risky strategy.  It seems counterintuitive that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

patentholders would pursue that.  If the court that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to get every patent case has adopted a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule and then just -- would you advise your client, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, just disregard that? 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think what we --

   

  

 

 

 

 

what -- what people are advising their clients was don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose restrictions based on the idea that they can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforced because there's a good chance that they can't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

be enforced.  So many restrictions were not being 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed; a few were.  Of course, this is very similar to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the situation the Court confronted in Kirtsaeng where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said -- there, there was a 30-year rule that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hadn't been questioned at all by decisions of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court.  And the Court said the fact that people hadn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acted obviously wasn't a predictor of what would happen 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the law was clarified by this Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think the -- the disruption that would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

occur is amply demonstrated in the amicus briefs and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would indeed expand patent monopoly rights far beyond 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything that ever -- anyone has thought possible under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court's precedents.

Let me briefly talk about the -- the lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court's decisions where it went astray.  There were two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic justifications.  One was statutory.  The Federal 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Circuit assumed that the exhaustion doctrine was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grounded in the without-authority clause in Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

271(a) and that, therefore, Congress had given the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentee a veto over the scope of the exhaustion rule. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We think that's not correct. 

 

 

 

 

            

This Court's prior cases prior to 1952 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't indicate at all that exhaustion was a question of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patentee's authority, rather, a flat rule.  And the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court's exhaustion we think is best looked at in either 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of two ways; either as a limit on the 152(a) rights, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights to exclude that are set forth, and what the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has indicated is that there are a limit on the -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope of the patentee's right to exclude. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Also, the 1952 Act included in 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 282(b)(1) a section called Defenses that set 

   

 

 

 

 

 

forth defenses that could be pled.  And one of those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defenses was absent of liability for infringement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thereto in obvious incorporation of the preexisting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion doctrine. 

 

            

The Federal Circuit's second rationale 

 

 

 

 

confused two concepts:  The ability of a patentee to set 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the terms for a first sale, and the ability to impose

just as a patentee can decide for itself who it will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sell to, it can impose as a condition of licensing, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturing and sales by others those same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions.  It can restrict who the licensee can sell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to just as who it can decide to sell to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But in either case, whether the sale by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentee or the sale by the licensee, post-sale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions are invalid as long as it's an authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sale.  Any sale by the patentee is, of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized.  In the licensee context, there's an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

additional inquiry:  Did the licensee abide by the terms 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the license?  If it did, then the sale is authorized 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and no post-sale restrictions can be enforced. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let me turn, if I may, to the second 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, the question of international exhaustion 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that this case raises.  We think that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

starting point here is, again, Congress's incorporation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this Court's statements regarding the exhaustion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  In other words, the Patent Act should be read as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if there were provisions stating the initial authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that item.  There's certainly nothing in the Patent Act 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that limits exhaustion to sales by U.S. patentees within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States.

JUSTICE ALITO:  And it's somewhat surprising 

  

 

 

 

 

11 

to me that none of the briefs in this case talk about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our cases regarding extraterritoriality.  In recent 

  

 

 

 

 

years, we've been -- we have said very -- that a statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not apply outside the United States unless it says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it applies outside the United States.  I don't see 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why that shouldn't be the same for a common-law rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like the rule here.  And if what's involved here is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application of U.S. patent law abroad, where is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear statement that the exhaustion rule applies outside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the borders of the United States?  I -- I don't see 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where that can be found. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Your Honor, I don't think this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is a question of extraterritorial application 

   

 

 

 

anything -- any more than the issue in Kirtsaeng was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of extraterritorial application of the 

 

 

 

 

 

Copyright Act. 

 

            

The question here is whether the patentee's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acts outside the United States have an impact on its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability to enforce its rights within the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So that -- no one is saying that the sales outside the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States are governed by the U.S. patent law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're obviously not, just as the sales outside the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States under the Copyright Act are not governed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the Copyright Act.

Alderson Reporting Company

But the question here is whether if there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

an authorized sale outside the United States authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the U.S. patentee, whether that should have the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion consequences as a sale within the United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

States.  And we think the rationale of Kirtsaeng and the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broad rule that the Court has enunciated dictate that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conclusion here should be, yes, the same exhaustion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule should apply. 

 

 

            

In fact, it seems to us that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences that the Court pointed to in Kirtsaeng, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only do we have an enunciation of a nongeographic rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the support of the common-law nongeographic rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Court identified in Kirtsaeng, but the adverse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences that the Court pointed to are even more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dramatic here because of the fact that patented articles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are often combined into other goods through a global 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

supply chain. 

 

            

And as a number of the briefs talk about, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just think about a situation where a phone is assembled 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

in China with patented chips sold from Taiwan, a screen 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from China, and hundreds of other patented components 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from all over.  All of the sales of those components 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consummated outside the United States. 

 

 

 

 

            

The consequence there would that -- would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that if that final phone is sold into the United States,

all of the sellers, resellers, and users of that phone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be subject to patent infringement liability if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. rights were not expressly licensed -- U.S. rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

for sale not expressly licensed for just one patent in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that huge conglomeration of patents that were embodied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that object. 

 

 

            

Same for a car assembled in Canada.  The car 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

example that the Court used in its opinion in Kirtsaeng 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies equally here.  An ignition from Germany, a brake 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

system from the United States, everything sold and put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together outside the United States, and then the car 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought into the United States, a risk of patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability. 

            

And here, the risk is even greater because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no fair use doctrine to moderate the application 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the rule.  Patent liability, as the Court knows, is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strict liability offense with no exceptions.  And we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the additional problem in the patent context of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent assertion entities that the Court has referred to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The argument the other 

  

 

 

 

 

side, which I think is the more difficult part, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely see your point.  In both instances, whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you or the other side wins, we're talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that happened where there's a lawsuit in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

United States and there was a restriction that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

patentee imposed.  He said anyone who buys my widget 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot resell it to Smith or Jones.  Or anyone who buys 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my widget, if they resell it, has to put a big red sign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on it, some kind of restriction.  If somebody fails to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that, so they sue likely in the United States, but in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any case, they're suing under American law; right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Either way. 

 

            

            

MR. PINCUS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Either way, they're suing 

  

 

 

 

 

under American law and this person has violated the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent or he hasn't violated the American patent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And when we start talking abroad, you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite right, I think, that Lord Coke and his great 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle of no alienation on chattels is being laughed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at.  All right.  That's your argument.  But on the other 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

side, they have just received money for that first sale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under, let's say, a German patent, and they have not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received any money on this American patent.  So they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, well, how could you be subjecting us to a rule that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that first sale exhausted our right to money under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American patent when we never received any money under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the American patent? 

 

 

            

Now -- so there's one thing one way and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's one important thing the other way.  So how do

you react? 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, my reaction is that in --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

in many of the contexts in which this issue arises, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really not quite right that the U.S. -- first of all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice, to - to be sure we're on the same stage --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

MR. PINCUS:  -- these are all sales that are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized by the U.S. patentee.  So at the end of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day, the U.S. patentee has control over whether --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All sales were authorized. 

  

 

 

 

 

In the one sale, it was sold in Bavaria under a German 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent.  And not only was it authorized by the American, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but he said, I love it.  And so what I want to you do is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whenever you use it, you put a big red sign with my name 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on it.  All right?  There's a condition. 

   

  

  

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  And -- and so the -- the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question here -- I -- I think what your question goes to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, do sales in foreign countries under different laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow the U.S. patentee to recoup the value of his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  I'm saying do sales 

  

  

 

 

 

 

under foreign laws in foreign countries -- that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question -- once there has been such a sale, does the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentee still have the right under his American patent

no. 

            

            

MR. PINCUS:  And our submission is no. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I know your submission is 

    

 

 

 

 

MR. PINCUS:  And -- and -- but -- but --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And I'm just trying to get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your answer to their argument --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PINCUS:  But -- but --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in saying whatever you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think of the U.S., there's a big difference here.  They 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't gotten any money back on their --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  And -- and that's why I -- I --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I was talking about there, whether or not they had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gotten -- the argument on the other side I think is we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't gotten the value we would get if we sold our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product into the U.S.  So there are a couple of answers 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that. 

 

            

First of all, in the global supply chain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, which is where most of these situations arise, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact is the sales may take place of the components 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a particular country, but they're part of a huge 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

supply chain that's flowing to produce finished goods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are then going to be distributed to a large number 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of companies. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

17 

            

Companies that sell -- that either license 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their patents or sell components into that supply chain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know full well that this is a global chain and that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they -- they are not getting value that's country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific.  They are getting a value that is essentially 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the average of the value in all the places where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent is going to be used, because that's what they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should demand because that's, in fact, the market into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which they are selling. 

 

 

 

            

The end-use product is a different 

   

 

 

 

situation.  There certainly are products, just as the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

books in -- in Kirtsaeng, that are being sold into a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular market, and I think there are a couple of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

answers to that. 

 

 

            

One is, A, there are nonpatent constraints, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

packaging, labeling, contract requirements that may 

 

 

 

 

 

ameliorate the ability of those products to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transshipped into the United States. 

 

 

 

 

            

B, there are lots of different things that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go into whether or not someone gets -- how much value 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one gets in the copyright context, for example. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Although the legal rules may be more even, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement of copyright vary -- principle varies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dramatically in different markets, as does the wealth in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different markets, and that affects how things can be

sold. 

            

And lastly, as the Court pointed out, so I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

think there are constraints that protect the U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentee in -- in being able to demand the value 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attributable to the U.S. patent.  But, lastly, as the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court said in Kirtsaeng, price discrimination may not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily be something that's guaranteed under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent laws --

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Pincus. 

  

 

 

MR. PINCUS:  -- at least as they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

currently written.  Congress could change that. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Sorry, Justice. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I've -- I've heard --

  

 

 

 

 

 

I've read and reread that argument, that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentholder is not receiving value for its German 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent.  But the value that you receive I think is in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the embodiment of the patent.  And the whole concept of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first-sale doctrine, in my mind, is that the value 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is whatever you get for that product.  And whether you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a U.S. patent or a German patent or a whatever 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

patent, you're still getting value for that idea, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that discovery, for that whatever creative moment that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have that results in this final product.  So I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite sure I understand the -- the question of this, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, you haven't received value for the German patent.

MR. PINCUS:  I agree with Your Honor.  I --

    

    

 

 

 

 

19 

I think you have received value, and because we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothesizing a situation where the U.S. patentee is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

authorizing the sale, ultimately, the U.S. patentee can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide it's not worth my while to sell my product in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Germany if the risk of transshipment outweighs the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit.  That's an economic --

  

 

 

 

            

            

patentee. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, I will say --

   

  

 

 

 

MR. PINCUS:  -- calculation for the 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that -- that there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counter arguments on policy questions here of -- on both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sides.  I mean, there are serious issues about this rule 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and its consequences. 

 

 

            

How do you address all the negative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences that your rule appears to be creating? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think the principal 

   

  

 

 

 

negative consequence that -- that -- that my friends on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other side and their amici point to is this question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of price discrimination, and I think we've talked about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

Another issue that's raised in some of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs is safety:  Food, drug -- drugs, and medical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

devices.  As -- as the briefs discuss, the -- the FDA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has full authority to prevent imports under 21 U.S.C.

381 of devices and to regulate reuses of devices and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

drugs.  So broad authority where there are those risks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the safety areas. 

 

 

 

            

Another argument that's made on the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side is that there will be a disruption of settled 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expectations for the reasons -- I don't think they're --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that those expectations are -- are legitimate.  But if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are -- because I don't think the rule has been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled under national exhaustion, but this Court --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless this Court is going to not be able to overturn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions of the Federal Circuit, the fact that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit has decided something can't be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient to tie this Court's hands in doing that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you look it the Alice case, for example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that obviously had tremendous implications for both the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentees and for people who had entered into license 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreements and were paying money for patents that turned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out to be invalid.  But that was just a consequence of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court getting the law right. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I -- I don't think on the policy level 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

there's a lot on their side, and I think Congress can 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

address those issues if -- if there are specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems. 

            

if I may. 

   

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Stewart. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 

 

 

 

 

 

        

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    

SUPPORTING REVERSAL IN PART AND VACATUR IN PART 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

I'd like to address the domestic exhaustion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue first, and I'd like to begin by responding to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy's question about why hasn't the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion doctrine been codified. 

 

 

 

            

The Court's historic cases in the domestic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion field have located the exhaustion principle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the language of the predecessors of what is now 35 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.C. 154(a)(1).  That is the provision of the Patent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act that says the patent owner has the right to exclude 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others from making, using, selling, offering for sale, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or importing the patented invention.  And in addressing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

predecessor versions of that language, this Court said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those exclusive rights in essence don't encompass the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to control resale or use of a lawfully sold 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article. 

            

For example, in Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the Court said -- addressed the proper interpretation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the exclusive right to vend, and it said the right to

vend was exercised when the first authorized sale was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

made.  The right to vend does not encompass the right to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set resale prices. 

 

 

            

In motion picture patents, the Court said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that its task was to determine the meaning of Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacting the predecessor version of 154(a)(1). 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In -- in order -- other cases, the Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred to lawfully sold articles as being no longer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the protection of the act of Congress, or that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion rule delimits the scope of the patent grant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So it's true that the Patent Act doesn't contain an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogue to 17 U.S.C. 109(a), which is the Copyright Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that specifically addresses the scope of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion, but the exhaustion doctrine has historically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been understood by this Court as a gloss on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive rights conferred by 154(a)(1) and its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predecessors, and unless Congress wanted to change the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion rule, either to get -- get rid of it entirely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or to substitute some different triggering event, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was no need for it to amend -- to -- to codify an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicit exhaustion provision by continuing in effect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and by tweaking the exclusive rights conferred by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant of a patent, Congress should be understood to have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manifested its intention that historic conceptions of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic -- domestic exhaustion would continue to have

sway. 

            

Now, the second point I make about domestic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

23 

exhaustion is that the court of appeals' err, in our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view, stem to a large extent from its misreading of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general talking pictures.  General talking pictures 

  

 

 

 

 

dealt not with a -- not with simply a restriction on the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use that purchasers could make after an article had been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawfully sold.  It dealt with the conditions on which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its patentee's licensee could sell the article in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first place.  And the -- the exhaustion doctrine is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also -- often referred to colloquially as the first-sale 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine, and I think that's a reason -- there's a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

reason for that.  It's that the presence or absence of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion turns on whether there has been a lawful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

first sale, and if the licensee departs from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction of the patentee and sells the article in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way that is not authorized, there's no lawful first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sale, and therefore, no patent exhaustion.  But once the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article has been lawfully sold, any restrictions on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resale or use that the patentee purports to impose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

downstream can be enforceable only under contract law or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial law, not under patent law. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that brings me to my third point about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic exhaustion, which is one of the arguments on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other side is -- on the Respondent's side is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

24 

application of domestic exhaustion principles here would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent parties from reaching agreements that might be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economically advantageous to both of them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so the Respondent says, well, if I have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

had particular buyer who only wants to use the cartridge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once and doesn't want to pay extra for the privilege of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reusing it, if he never intends to do that, why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't we be able to negotiate a deal under which I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge him less in return for his commitment to only use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it once?  And the answer is nothing in the exhaustion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine prevents parties from reaching those agreements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and enforcing them as a matter of contract law, if they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are enforceable under the -- the law of the relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction. 

            

The policy judgment that this Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically attributed to Congress is not a judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that these sorts of restrictions are bad or should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unenforceable.  It's simply a judgment that possession 

   

  

 

 

 

of a patent doesn't give the patentee any greater rights 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make or enforce restrictions like this than a seller 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of similar unpatented property would have under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules of -- of general contract law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so, in several of the exhaustion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions, the Court has distinguished between the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits on patent remedies and the alternative remedies

that might be available under what the Court has often 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred to as the general law, the body of contract and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial law that applies to -- to all sellers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

I'd like to turn now, if I may, to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of international exhaustion.  And the position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the United States on -- on this issue is between that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the two parties, it's our view that a patent -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. patent owner who sells goods -- patented goods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abroad should be able to reserve its U.S. rights but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need -- needs to do so expressly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I'd like to start --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can -- can they put a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sticker on -- on the -- on the products --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Well --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- "Do not sell"?  This 

  

  

 

 

 

 

would be a great boom to the sticker business, right? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. STEWART:  I -- I do want to be careful 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to -- to limit the -- to make clear the limits on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the principle that we're advocating; that is, we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advocating a rule under which simply by manufacturing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and selling overseas, the patentee could impose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continuing downstream restrictions on the use of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good once it has been legally imported and sold into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States.  That is, under our view, if -- if

Lexmark had said, we'll sell you these cartridges in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

Canada and you are authorized to import them into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States and sell them in the United States, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are still for one use only and you need to put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

labeling on the package warning your consumers "one use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only," in our view, that restriction would be no good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there would be authorized importation into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States, authorized sale in the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And at that point, the Court's domestic exhaustion cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would kick in.  And so the patentee's choice, in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view of international exhaustion, is all or nothing.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can say I don't consent to importation into the --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about 

  

 

 

Justice Kennedy's question?  I mean, Lord Coke had that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

very question in mind, I think, that -- that one of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems with restraints in alienation of chattel is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the buyer may not know, and -- and moreover, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stops competition among buyers.  Those are the basic two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that have led that as a kind of underlying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle.  Well, what about it? 

  

 

 

 

            

            

MR. STEWART:  Well, he have --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Does he have to put a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sticker on every toy?  Does he have to put a sticker --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how?  How does it work? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Again, as -- as I say, if what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

we're talking about is a sticker that warns -- if the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product is sold in Germany and the patentee wants to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warn consumers in Germany they can only use the product 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the following way, he can put the sticker on.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

whether it's enforceable, and if so, by what means is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So in other words, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer is yes.  Every widget has to have a sticker. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  No.  The answer is, as a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

matter of U.S. law, the legality of the import -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original act of importation will be governed, on our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view, by whether the patentee has explicitly reserved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its right to -- with the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You mean you don't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to -- I didn't understand.  Where does he reserve this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  It's a right that he wants to enforce against 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Joe Smith, the consumer, who bought from a German 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

grocery store 14 patented bouncing fountain pens.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that's who he wants to enforce it

United States, and that person says, I do not know what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're talking about.  You say, don't worry, there had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be an express reservation.  So the question I thought 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, where?  Is it a sticker or not?

would be an express reservation in the sense of a ban on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

importation.  And so the express reservation would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicated to the buyer.  You could additionally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

require that --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Where and how would it be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicated to the buyer? 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  Well, the -- the initial buyer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the U.S. patentee would enter into a contract with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the U.S. patentee, and presumably --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that -- and you agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're for that, but that is very much contrary to what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

300 years of restraints on alienation had in mind. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One of the problems was that people who buy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these things, namely, those who go into grocery store or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever, don't know that they can't bring it back to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the U.S., or they don't know that they can't do this or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they can't do that or have to have the red sign or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever.  And you don't have an answer to that, I take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

MR. STEWART:  Well, if you wanted -- first, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at a certain level, anyone who buys patented products 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

takes the chance that the person who sold those to him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has no authority to do so or has transgressed the limits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of his authority.  And so, if the patentee's buyer, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct purchaser was told no importation, and that

business in Germany then conveyed the goods to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumer and failed to pass along to the consumer the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restriction on importation, then that's not different in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind from the chance that the -- the consumers take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regularly that there is something wrong with the chain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of patent title that the initial authorization was not

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the basis for this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

compromised position?  Is this just a balancing of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

policy considerations on both sides? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. STEWART:  I mean, it's partly policy 

    

 

 

 

 

based, but it has -- to -- to the extent that there has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a rule in the lower courts, this has been the rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the last hundred years.  Patentees have the capacity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reserve U.S. rights, but must do so expressly.

the Federal Circuit properly looked to the statute to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find the origins and limits on the exhaustion doctrine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Patent Act defines how patent rights can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be acquired, what they cover, and how they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringed.  And as to infringement, the statute provides 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that infringement occurs when someone makes, sells, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uses, offers to sell, or imports into this country an --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a patented article without authority from the patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owner. 

            

Now there's been a lot of talk about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

authorized sales exhausting patent rights, but -- but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to ask yourself, an authorized sale of what? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When a patentee sells a product without saying anything 

   

   

 

 

 

 

about it, normally the -- the normal understanding is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, you're selling everything you have.  But there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no -- there's no decision of this Court that says that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentee necessarily has to sell everything he has. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- going back as far as the Mitchell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case in the 19th century, it's clear that there can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditional transactions, and -- and conditional in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense of restrictions on use.  The restriction there was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a temporal one.  You -- you can have this machine and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have the right to use it until the original patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term expires and then somebody else has the right and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're an infringer after that. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

There was a mention of General Talking 

   

 

 

 

 

31 

Pictures, and I think that's a good starting off point. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

There are different ways that patentees can convey their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- their exclusivity rights or authority to do what they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the exclusive right to do.  And -- and the two most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prominent ways are, of course, licenses and sales. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, it's undisputed that when a patentee 

   

 

 

 

 

conveys patent rights without an associated product, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is, in a licensing transaction, the parties are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

free to agree to buy as much or as little of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights as they want.  They can -- they can divide it up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographically, they can divide it up by field of use, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's General Talking Pictures.  They can divide it up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

temporally, that's Mitchell.  But when -- when patent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights are conveyed with a product, we're told, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties lose that freedom.  They have to -- they have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sell all or nothing. 

 

 

 

            

Now, the government adopts that position 

 

 

 

 

 

domestically, but not on -- on -- for foreign sales, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll turn to that in a moment.  But I want to -- want to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highlight why this matters at a policy level. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Conditional or limited sales in licenses 

 

 

 

 

 

play an important role in furthering the Patent Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectives of fostering innovation and disseminating 

 

 

 

 

 

innovations to the public.  And a good starting point

for that is in January, the Department of Justice and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

FTC issued new licensing guidelines, and those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guidelines say this:  Field of use, territorial, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other limitations on intellectual property licenses may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serve procompetitive ends by allowing the licensor to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exploit its property as efficiently and effectively as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible. 

            

Now, the amici gives some examples of why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is so.  The law and economics professors, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, give the example of a microchip that has a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variety of potential uses.  It could be used in powerful 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

computer.  It could be used in a video camera, could be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used in -- in other -- other applications. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, the result most consistent with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goals of the Patent Act is for that new technology to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used wherever it's useful, wherever the -- it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase consumer welfare.  But if you cannot have use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions that are enforceable downstream, that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to happen. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why -- why is normal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract law and normal State law inadequate, for your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes? 

            

MR. TRELA:  Well, here's why, and -- and, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually, I was just getting to that, Mr. Chief Justice.

the -- the logical or the economically rational outcome, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

if you can enforce these restrictions, is to sell at a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

price that makes sense for the video camera maker, at a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

higher price that will make sense for the computer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maker, because they're using more of the capabilities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- of the new technology.  But if you can't -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your only remedy is contract and you can't enforce these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations downstream, well, then what happens is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

video camera-marketed chips are going to be -- you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's going to be an arbitrage, and they're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be -- flow into the computer market --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why can't you enforce the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contract downstream? 

 

            

MR. TRELA:  Well, because you -- you don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have privity, Justice Breyer.  That's --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Then why don't you require 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the person who sells it to just resell it with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement that they promise not to, you know, whatever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is? 

 

            

MR. TRELA:  Well, and that's, in effect, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what -- what happens here.  But then you're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about down -- downstream who knows how long --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Sure.  And one of the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

reasons that it's hard to get away with that is the

is because Lord Coke said 300 years ago, you know,

it's -- you get into a lot of trouble when you start 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to restrict this buyer who's got the widget and

the kind of basic legal principle for an awfully long 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time. 

            

MR. TRELA:  Well, let me -- let me comment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on that, because it's certainly true that that's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lord Coke said in the 17th century, but there are a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of points I'd like to make about that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

One is what Lord Coke said in the quote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's in the Kirtsaeng opinion, for example, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when someone sells his whole interest, he can impose no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restraints because his whole interest is out of him. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What we're talking about here is not selling your whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  The whole interest --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  This is the reserved 

  

 

 

 

 

question.  I see your point there.  If you want to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue to make it for others, go ahead.  Go ahead. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finish, because I -- I think I interrupted you. 

   

   

   

 

 

            

of course. 

 

MR. TRELA:  Well, that's your prerogative, 

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. TRELA:  What we're talking about here,

interest in a patented article is both the -- the title, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

so to speak, to the physical material, and the bundle of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights that go with it. 

 

 

 

 

            

The other thing I would say on the Lord Coke 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue and the 300 years of common law, Justice Breyer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that the common law changed a lot after Lord Coke. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In Kirtsaeng, the important issue was, was there a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographic restraint that Congress should be assumed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have adopted or -- or have rejected, and they'd be --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the common law in the -- in the 17th century was fine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for that purpose. 

 

 

            

But as Judge Taranto's opinion for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit points out, as a number of the amici 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point out, common law evolved quite a bit after the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17th century, both in this country and in England, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular with respect to restraints on -- on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alienation of chattel, both patented and nonpatented. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  There -- there -- there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite -- I mean, I agree that there are all kinds of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions. 

            

But to go back to your basic point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying this, of course, any monopolist, including a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent monopolist, would love to be able to go to each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buyer separately and extract from each buyer and user 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the maximum amount he would pay for that particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

item.  Dentists would pay more for gold perhaps than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

someone who wants to use gold for some other thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Okay?  They'd like that.  But by and large, that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

forbidden under many laws, even though it does mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

slightly restricted output, and it also means a lower 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

profit for the monopolist. 

 

 

 

            

All right.  Now, it's against that 

  

 

 

 

 

background that I think the law and economics 

   

 

 

 

 

 

professors, who are telling what is correct, that -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the argument that you're making has to be evaluated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's what I think on the first part.  All this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent is very hard for you to get around.  And I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not talking about just Lord Coke; I'm talking about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme Court precedent. 

 

 

            

MR. TRELA:  Well, and -- and on the Supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court precedent, let me go back to General Talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pictures, which I started to talk about a few minutes 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

ago. 

            

It's clear that a patent owner can limit the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

licenses it grants.  For example, there, it was the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent owner granted a license -- basically said to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the licensee, you can have the home market; I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserving the commercial theater market for myself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And now -- now, the -- the government's and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Impression's position is, well, as long as the licensee

sold to somebody who said he was going to use it in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

home market, that's an authorized sale.  And then if --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if some -- if that person or somebody further down uses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it in the commercial market, that's -- that's not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem. 

            

But the question is -- and now -- and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this goes back now to Mitchell, Mitchell said nobody can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convey more than they have.  That's why in Mitchell the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

licensee could not convey the right to continue to use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patented machine after the expiration of that first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period, because it's not a right that he had.  The same 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is true of the licensee in the General Talking Pictures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scenario. 

            

He could -- he could convey the right -- he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could basically convey authority to use it in the home 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market, and that's what the patentee was compensated for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that sale, but he could not convey a right he didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have, which is to use it in the commercial market.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- and that right was retained by the patentee.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not compensated for it.  And yet, supposedly, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there was an authorized sale, there's no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement.  And that -- that's why I say you have to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask, an authorized sale of what?  It's -- it's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical product along with the particular rights that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may -- that the patentee has agreed to release with

respect to that particular article. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, the -- there's a concern -- and -- and, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer, you expressed it, I think other members 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Court have expressed it, about sort of the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unwitting consumer who doesn't know that they're --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're buying a -- a product that, you know, that --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, perhaps some of this authority was withheld. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's really -- that has actually nothing to do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion doctrine one way or the other.  That is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I think Mr. Stewart made the point -- that's really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a consequence of strict liability for patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement. 

            

Anytime anyone buys a product, when you buy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

a -- you buy a Samsung smartphone, to take a recent 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, you know, you are -- you are assuming maybe, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the extent anybody outside of this room actually thinks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about whether patent rights might or might not apply to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an article, maybe you're assuming that it -- to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent there are patents, nobody -- you know, everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has authority to do what they are doing, but it's only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an assumption.  You have no reason to -- to know that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are not infringing a patent.  And, frankly, I think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

most consumers don't care, because those claims are not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought against consumers.  And unlike the copyright 

  

 

 

 

 

 

area where there's at least a theoretical possibility of

criminal liability, there's no counterpart under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

Patent Act. 

 

            

So -- and that's particularly true here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because here, somebody who gets a cartridge from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Impression, a remanufactured Lexmark cartridge from 

   

 

 

 

Impression, has no reason to think it started with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lexmark.  So to the extent that their exhaustion would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enter into anybody's thinking, they have no reason to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, well, I'm -- I'm good because this -- there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first sale of this cartridge by -- by Lexmark.  It's got 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an Impression sticker on it.  And to the -- to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent they're thinking about it, they should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking the same as anybody who buys a knockoff product 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinks:  I -- I may be infringing, but it's cheap, so 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm not going to worry about it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So this -- the downstream concern, I think, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is not a practical concern because it doesn't happen. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patent litigation is too expensive, and most commercial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprises don't go -- want to go around suing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumers, and it's not a function of exhaustion law, in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any event.  The -- the risk is there and it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoidable. 

            

 

The -- let me turn to the foreign issue. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and here we agree with a lot of the premises of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government's argument.  And -- and the government

said one thing in their brief -- this is at page 27 of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

their brief.  And it's -- it's -- I think really sums it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up.  It said that U.S. patentee is entitled to one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premium for forfeiting his exclusive right under U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law to prevent the sale of his patented article in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States.  And that's really been the premise of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the exhaustion doctrine. 

 

 

            

The notion is that the authorized sale of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patented article, putting to one side what authorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sale means, lifts the legal restraints that otherwise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would limit what the owner of the article could do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, causing the article to no longer be within the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bounds of the patent monopoly, a phrase that we hear 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- in a lot of the cases.  And the proceeds of that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sale are the patentee's reward for lifting those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restraints. 

            

That reasoning doesn't work for sales 

 

 

 

 

 

outside the United States.  The sale doesn't lift any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal restraints that otherwise would have limited what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the buyer could do, because the U.S. patent has no force 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overseas.  And it's not -- the article is not coming out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from under the monopoly of the U.S. patent, because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't in it to begin with, again, because the U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent has no force overseas. 

 

 

 

 

            

And so it's in that sense -- Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

41 

Sotomayor, you asked about why isn't the patentee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receiving his reward -- that's why, because there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two -- if you're assuming patents in the two countries, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first of all, they may or may not cover exactly the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing.  Unlike copyright, there's a lot of variation. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

But there are two bundles of rights, and the patentee is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving up one in -- in Germany I think was the example, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and being compensated for that, but not giving up the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other one, because the other bundle of rights really has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing to do with that transaction. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the 

  

 

 

 

 

argument on the other side about the complexity of the, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, products with literally thousands of different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patents, and if you're allowed to impose restraints down 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the line, it just gets too complicated and the consumer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be violating patents all the time without knowing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 

            

MR. TRELA:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think, 

   

  

 

 

 

first of all, again, to the extent we're talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumers, it -- it --

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah. 

  

 

 

MR. TRELA:  -- the -- the comments I made 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

before I think apply no matter where the product 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

started.  But this -- this notion of concern about

components, it exists under -- under anybody's rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

because under -- under the government's rule, of course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- you'd have to have an express reservation, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've got to figure out whether there was an express 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reservation. 

            

Under Impression's rule, everything hinges 

 

 

 

 

on an authorized first sale somewhere of each and every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of these components.  An authorized -- a sale 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

authorized by each and every one of these supposedly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands of patentees.  So if you're -- let's not use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say consumer, but let's say you're a U.S. producer of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some sort of a product that has all these components and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you really are concerned about patent -- potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent infringement liability, well, you have to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through this tracing exercise anyway and -- and figure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out whether you have to, you know, find out whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody was licensed or what the terms of the license 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be or not. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there's a -- there 

   

  

 

 

 

a -- Nike, two things.  When they say well, people have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized dealers, and anyone who's in business knows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want to be safe, buy it from an authorized dealer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That isn't a big problem. 

   

 

 

            

On the other hand, if you are a consumer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enured to do, it isn't -- I don't think I followed quite

what you're saying.  If there is a first sale rule, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

no -- you know, first sale, no problem.  The only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem is you bought it from a guy who didn't have a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent in the first place.  So go buy it from GE, or buy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it from Amazon, or buy it from somebody you know, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust, and that's the end of that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But if there is no first-sale rule, there we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are, got to have the red sign, got to have -- can't sell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it here, can't sell it there, can't sell it some other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place.  Who knows what the -- now -- now, that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of confusion, and of course there is no sticker, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the kind of confusion that they're afraid of. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. TRELA:  Justice Breyer, I don't -- I --

   

   

  

 

 

 

I don't think that that is the real problem.  If you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- you're buying from an authorized dealer, sure.  I --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, I buy an Apple iPhone from an Apple Store. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What I know is, well, Apple is not going to sue me for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringing Apple's patents, and because I trust Apple, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

trust that they've gotten authority from the thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of other folks, but -- but it's only an assumption.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so -- so you may have -- you may have some peace of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind, but to truly have certainty, you've got to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- this tracing exercise anyway.  And that -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that actually brings up another point, and this is a

consumers and to commercial operators. 

 

 

 

 

44 

            

Of course there are a lot of protections 

   

 

 

 

 

 

against this -- this concern about infringement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability.  The UCC 2-312 basically is a -- any time a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merchant sells something, he is warranting to his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

customers that it does -- it does not infringe.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a warranty remedy there, and then also, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, the authorized dealer presumably will stand behind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

In addition, as the court of appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noted -- and I should take a step back.  This case does 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not involve any unknowing parties.  The stipulated facts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here are that every one of Lexmark's counterparties knew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the terms and agreed to the terms in a valid and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable contract, and that Impression knew that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these cartridges were licensed for single-use only, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that use had -- had already occurred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So on the facts of this case, you don't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And as Judge Taranto noted for the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit, to the extent that you're worried about

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about the point 

  

 

 

 

 

raised by your adversaries that having different rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

with respect to copyright and patents will make -- will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicate the checking because many products have both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright and patent. 

 

 

            

MR. TRELA:  There -- there is -- there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that there are different -- there -- there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a host of different rules for copyright and patent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and one point I would start with, Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor, is that the -- the scope of copyright 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection -- although the remedies may vary from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country to country -- the scope of the protection is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

virtually identical to -- on -- in all the countries of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Berne Convention, which is virtually all of them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is if -- you -- you don't have to guess about what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is or is not subject to the copyright.  You know. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Patent protection is very different.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

are inventions -- software inventions, for example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't be patented in some countries, they can in others. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The -- the scope of patent protection is very different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from country to country.  So the -- there are already 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- a host of differences. 

   

 

 

 

            

The duration, you know, copyright duration 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- well, I think it's 70 years plus the -- the --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after the death of the author, for example.  Patent

protection, of course, is much more limited in time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

It's also easier to identify because you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examination requirements, the -- you know, registration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements.  You don't have any of that with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright.  So there already are -- are a host of -- of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differences. 

            

And in the marketplace, they -- they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealt with in the same way.  What we know from the amici 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on both sides here, particularly the -- the ones with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the global supply chains, Intel and SanDisk on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Impression side, IBM and Qualcomm on the -- on our side, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they do -- they get global licenses to protect their --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves, their -- their counterparties, consumers, 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the way it's done.  It's done that way for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright, it's done that way for patent, and -- and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think IBM made this point particularly clear in -- with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to the international area, Qualcomm addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both international and domestic, you would be upsetting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled expectations, particularly in the international 

 

 

 

 

 

area, if you adopt either Impression's rule of automatic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory exhaustion that you can't even contract out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of, or the government's rule that has the express 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion requirement.  Because -- I think IBM put 

   

  

 

 

 

 

it -- there are hundreds of thousands of contracts that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been entered into based on the Federal Circuit's

ruling in JS Photo, which was -- which was unquestioned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

since 2001, and -- and even Intel and SanDisk say yes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- our -- our contracts reflect this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think that this is a particular area to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

move cautiously because what you're talking about here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are, you know, international trade matters where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Impression rule would essentially put the United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States -- basically, the United States would be saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unilaterally, blanket international exhaustion is great. 

 

 

 

 

 

Let's do it.  Do we care if other countries reciprocate? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Apparently, we don't because we're just willing to do it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because we're good guys.  That's not the way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

international trade issues like that should be decided. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On the domestic side, Qualcomm and others 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make the case that, in fact, parties have been relying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on this.  The -- in the -- the biopharmaceutical and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Pharma briefs, they point out that they rely on this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in terms of providing research quantities of new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compounds to universities and others.  There -- there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- there can be a difference between the human and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

veterinary markets for certain compounds, and allowing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditional sales and conditional licenses to -- to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable via patent law facilitates that sort of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispersion of the technology which in turn fosters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

innovation beyond that first level of innovation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

48 

            

So I think the -- this notion that nobody 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

was -- was doing these sorts of things because they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't sure this was the law, it -- it's -- it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factually true.  We -- we know that from the amici.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also as a matter of common sense, you -- you really -- I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think if you're a -- a patent owner and you really want 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to exploit your invention and you've got Federal Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedence saying you can do it, the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody -- the -- the fact that maybe later down the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

road, even if you thought there was some doubt, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later down the road that this Court might say well, no, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't do that, it -- that's not going to dissuade 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you from doing it because it's not going to make it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal.  It's just going to say, well, we thought it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would work and it didn't work.  So this notion that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nobody was doing this because of uncertainty about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the Federal Circuit precedent in this area, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, is implausible. 

 

 

            

Now, let me talk a little bit more about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's position on express reservations of U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent rights in the -- in the foreign area. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, besides disruption of settled 

 

 

 

 

expectations, what that would do is it would basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insert U.S. patent law into every transaction involving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any sort of product that might be covered by U.S. patent

rights. 

            

Under that express reservation rule, if BMW, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

a German company that has U.S. patents, wants to sell a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

load of cars to a distributor in Slovakia, well, they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to negotiate about and include in that contract, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparently, a reservation of U.S. rights, because 

   

 

 

 

 

otherwise, if those cars somehow make their way into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S., they are unprotected.  Even if they wanted to sell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one car to a buyer in Munich, they presumably would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do that, because otherwise they would be exposed if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that car makes its way to the U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So that doesn't -- there's no reason why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. patent law or U.S. patent rights should even enter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into the thinking of parties who are entering into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangements overseas with -- with no intention or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expectation that they are going to find their way to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.  And that approach would also make the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceability of U.S. patent rights dependent on --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really, on the whims of foreign governments and on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

details of foreign law. 

 

 

 

            

If the reservation of rights is a -- a term 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

of a foreign agreement, then I think that's -- that's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

where Mr. Stewart ended up, Justice Breyer, in response 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to your questions.  Well, it's going to be governed by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign law.  And for all we know, it may or may not be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

enforceable as a matter of a law in that particular 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

foreign country. 

 

50 

            

And we know that certain countries, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

India is an example that's been given, will do things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like impose mandatory licensing requirements on 

 

 

 

 

 

patent -- foreign patent owners, or require that foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

companies partner with local companies.  If -- if a new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

express reservation requirement is announced, there's 

 

 

 

 

 

every reason to think other countries may take steps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that undermine or make it very difficult for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. patentees to in fact protect their rights in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country. 

            

So the -- and, as I think some of the amici 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point out, if you announce such a rule, sophisticated 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S. companies, to the extent they can, consistent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with -- with foreign law, will -- will reflexively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably include it in their contracts, leaving only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unsophisticated smaller U.S. companies exposed, the ones 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that perhaps don't have expensive lawyers and detailed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

global sales operations. 

 

 

            

Let me finally turn to the -- return to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of why contract remedies aren't -- aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suitable or aren't adequate. 

 

 

 

            

And let me say, first of all, that in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of this Court's cases -- and it goes back to

Keeler and Hobby in the 19th century, and then picked up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in some other cases -- those -- the Court makes the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comment, after finding that a particular sale was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

51 

unrestricted, Court says:  If -- if the patentee wanted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to protect its distributors -- because these -- those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases involved exclusive geographic distributors -- they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have done so by special contract, but not as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of the inherent meaning and effect of the patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws, or words to that effect. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now as Judge Taranto explained, the point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was not that you could only do it by contract, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you did it, you would have only a contract remedy. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The point was that patent rights are conveyed by means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of contract.  And that doesn't mean that if that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract is breached, it's only a contract remedy.  A 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

license agreement is a contract that conveys U.S. patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights.  And as this Court held in Mitchell and General 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Talking Pictures and other cases, a violation of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

license term, a contract term does give rise to an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement remedy. 

 

            

So they're not mutually exclusive, and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think that's what the Court meant in those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passages.  I think what the Court was saying is:  If you 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to have restrictions, you have got to make them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express, then they can be enforceable as a matter of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

patent law. 

 

            

But in those cases, there were no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions. 

52 

            

Now, the -- the -- besides the privity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem with the contract remedy, you also can't get an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunction.  And an injunction is particularly important 

  

 

 

 

 

 

when you're dealing with large scale infringers, like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement here that gathers up the -- the used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cartridges, remanufactures them, and then sells them on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a commercial scale. 

 

 

              

A contract remedy -- first of all, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't -- wouldn't have a contract remedy against 

   

 

 

 

 

 

infringement.  We -- we never had any contact with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement other -- with -- I'm sorry -- with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Impression other than in this lawsuit.  And the -- so we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have privity.  We're not going to go suing our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual customers.  Not only is it bad business, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not a particularly efficient use of resources. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

The effective remedy, the remedy we got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, as to the foreign-sold cartridges at least, was an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunction, and that's the kind of remedy a patent owner 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs to protect its rights. 

 

 

 

 

            

If the Court has no further questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thank you very much.

buyers, because it's true, in patent law there always is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some risk that the initial sale won't be authorized. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I think the difference between the two positions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

here is once there is an initial authorized sale, that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the end of the inquiry under the test that -- that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

propose.

Under my friend's test, even if there is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

authorized sale, if there are these other restrictions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they continue to flow down, and therefore, the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

group of downstream users and buyers who are subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk becomes much, much greater. 

 

 

 

 

            

On -- on the question of -- of patent and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright, I think the critical point here is not that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the laws differ from place to place, but with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an authorized first sale, it would be very sensible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the same rule apply for authorized -- sales 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized by the U.S. rights holder overseas, for both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent and copyright, because then there would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainty that once there was an authorized sale, both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patent and the copyright rights were exhausted.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that's the -- with respect to -- to U.S. rights, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I think that's -- that's the critical point there. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think the other thing that's important 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to recognize in patents that is a difference is, while 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lexmark is a -- is a well known company that has brand 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues to contend with in terms of the suits it might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring against its customers and downstream users, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has recognized, as I said before, that in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent context, unlike copyright, we do have patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assertion activities that are under no constraint.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Intel brief identifies a number of lawsuits that
