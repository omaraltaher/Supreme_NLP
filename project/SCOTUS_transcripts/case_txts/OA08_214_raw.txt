 (11:18 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 08-214, Atlantic Sounding v. Townsend.

 Mr. McCreadie.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. McCREADIE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Mr. Townsend is a Jones Act seaman who seeks 

punitive damages for the willful failure to pay 
maintenance and cure.

 Like the unseaworthiness claim in Miles, Mr. 

Townsend's maintenance and cure claim is a general 
maritime law cause of action.  Mr. Townsend cannot 
recover punitive damages under his general maritime law 
cause of action because those damages are unavailable 
under the Jones Act FELA, and to a lesser extent DOHSA.

 This Court's decision in Miles requires 

uniformity between the damages that a seaman can recover 
under general maritime law and the damages that a seaman 
can recover under the guiding statutes.

 Those guiding statutes again are the Jones 

Act, the FELA, and the DOHSA.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. McCreadie, in this 

case, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they 
are punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act?  If 
we accept, as I think we must, Townsend's allegations to 
be true, he has said that Atlantic, as a matter of 
routine, puts in a boilerplate complaint for declaratory 
relief, reciting all the reasons why somebody could not 
get maintenance and cure, even though that is patently 
false, the allegation for example that he deserted his 
post.  He says it's false.  He said the allegation that 
he falsified his application for employment is false.
 Accepting the -- that to be true at this 

stage, isn't there some kind of punitive measure to be 
taken against a litigant who abuses the court process in 
that way?

 MR. McCREADIE:  First, Justice Ginsburg, 

those are just allegations.  There's no evidence --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but -- but now we're 
at the pretrial stage, and we're supposed to assume the 
truth of the allegations in Townsend's complaint.  We're 
assuming -- they may well turn out to be false; but at 
the threshold under 12(b)6 we accept those allegations 
as true and then determine whether a claim is stated.

 MR. McCREADIE:  Well, if -- if those 

allegations are true, there's no distinction between the

willful wanton misconduct that traditionally has been 
the subject of the dispute about maintenance and cure 
and punitive damages as opposed to those allegations.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But let's take this out 

of the maintenance and cure spot altogether.  Litigation 
generally, if a court determines that a litigant is 
abusing the court's process by filing false pleadings, 
is there a remedy; and if so, what is it?

 MR. McCREADIE:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there 

is a remedy.  And that's what Vaughan v. Atkinson 
provides.  In that case this Court looked at abuse of 
the litigation process and determined that the plaintiff 
in that case was entitled to attorneys' fees.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that all that 
was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully 
withheld maintenance and cure that was owing.  The 
allegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they 
just unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure.  They 
suggest that this litigant, as a matter practice, 
standard operating procedure, makes false claims before 
a court.  And my question to you is, isn't across the 
board there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular 
claim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?

 MR. McCREADIE:  I think there's a -- there's 
a number of potential sanctions.  I mean, there is Rule

11.  There's the natural discretion of the court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is any of them called 

punitive damages?  Do you know of any case in which a 
court has --

MR. McCREADIE:  No, I do not.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And punitive damages, of 
course, requires that you first find the guilty person 
to lose the case.  So what if a person makes these 
terrible allegations, but ends up winning the case 
anyway, and -- and -- well, you couldn't impose punitive 
damages.

 MR. McCREADIE:  I agree with --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We've got to call it 

something else, don't we?

 MR. McCREADIE:  I agree with your position 
there.  And what I was trying to answer the question is 
if someone does abuse the litigation process, that is 
what Vaughan v. Atkinson addressed.  And it -- it 
awarded attorneys' fees, which -- which are unusual.  It 
is an exception to the American rule.  And it is a 
deterrent for anyone to try to play fast and loose 
with --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many --

Atkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would

be inappropriate?  I can't quite find the negative that 
you want me to find, I think, in Atkinson.  True, they 
didn't talk about punitive damages.  They said damages 
are appropriate, and attorneys' fees in this case, which 
is what the district court gave, we are going to affirm 
it.  But there's nothing there that said punitive 
damages are inappropriate.

 MR. McCREADIE:  No.  The dissent mentioned 
that.  But you can not speak for the majority opinion. 
But up until Vaughan v. Atkinson, in the history of the 
United States there was never a holding where punitive 
damages were awarded to a Jones Act seaman for the 
failure to pay maintenance and cure.

 It was only after Vaughan v. Atkinson, after 
the dissent mentioned that concept, that the issue ever 
arose in the history of Supreme Court precedent, circuit 
precedent, in this country.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whose dissent was that?  I 

have forgotten that.  Whose dissent was it?  Do you 
recall?  Stewart?

 MR. McCREADIE:  I do -- I do not believe --

it is coming Justice Harlan, but I just -- I just cannot 
say off the top of my head who wrote the dissent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said never in the 

history.  I mean, there -- there are examples like the

ancient Nancy case, where the damages, where they were 
called exemplary -- but when you say never has there 
been before or after punitive awards.  But there is 
precedent, the Nancy case in this Court, cases in lower 
courts, there have been punitive damages awards in -- in 
maintenance and cure cases.

 MR. McCREADIE:  Justice Ginsburg, I made the 

distinction between there's no case in the history of 
the United States before Vaughan v. Atkinson awarding 
punitive damages to a seaman, a Jones Act seaman, for 
the failure to pay maintenance and cure.

 The case that you refer to, the Amiable 

Nancy, and other cases, they apply to general maritime 
law with respect to collisions, now with respect to 
pollution, and that's a broader context.  But if we look 
at the history of general maritime law, if we look at, 
for example, Calhoun, there's the critical distinction 
between non-seafarers and seafarers.  If we look at 
Latsis, there's the critical distinction between seaman 
and longshoremen.  In those status, they define the 
class of persons that we're looking at to see whether 
they can recover punitive damages.

 And this case involves a Jones Act seaman. 
And because it involves a Jones Act seaman, that's the 
class of claimant that we're looking at.  And when we

have a Jones Act seaman the primary statute that we look 
at is the Jones Act.  Of course, the Jones Act 
incorporates FELA by reference.  And the DOHSA, as Miles 
points out, also has an impact on the -- on the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did this Court ever hold 

that under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no 
punitive damages?  Do we have any holding to that 
effect?

 MR. McCREADIE:  No, there is no specific 

holding, and I would point out that if there was, that 
would answer our question today and we wouldn't be here.
 But that we do have is Miles, which is very 
clear and specific about what damages are available to a 
seaman; and those damages are compensatory damages. 
Miles is clear that the seaman can be compensated for 
pecuniary loss, the seaman can be compensated for his 
pre-death pain and suffering.  Because punitive damages 
are not compensatory damages, because punitive damages 
do not compensate for pecuniary loss, and because 
punitive damages do not compensate for pre-death pain 
and suffering, they are not available to a Jones Act 
seaman.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that -- but that was a 

common law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It was not admiralty 

maintenance and cure.

 MR. McCREADIE:  Justice Kennedy, Miles was a 
wrongful death action.  But when we look at Miles and we 
question, well, that is a wrongful death action, it is 
very clear, should Miles apply in a personal injury 
action, then we need to -- we -- first we know -- we 
look at the cases that have addressed that point.

 And first off, Miles does not say that the 

uniformity principle applies only to wrongful death 
actions.

 Secondly, Cortes, Supreme Court precedent, 

tells us that the rules are the same for personal injury 
and death actions for maintenance and cure under the 
Jones Act.

 In Cortes, the opposite argument was made: 
That the maintenance and cure claim could proceed for 
personal injury but not for a death action.  Here, the 
Respondent is making the argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, that the 

maintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the 
punitive damages claim could be made?

 MR. McCREADIE:  You're absolutely correct. 

Here they are making the argument that the punitive 
damages claim could -- can proceed under the personal

injury side of the case but not the death side.  And 
Cortes has already addressed that issue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. McCreadie, there's a 

question about this case, a troublesome feature of it.

 That is, you are saying because there are no 

punitive damages available under FELA and under the 
Jones Act, then there certainly should not be any under 
maintenance and cure.  But if we have to answer those 
questions, whether there are punitive damages available 
under FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a 
maintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much 
larger question than are punitive damages available for 
willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure.  We're 
deciding a question under the Jones Act, a question 
under the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would 
be interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that 
the law cares about particularly.  But there would be a 
larger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the 
Jones Act context and FELA.  And to decide those 
questions in a case that doesn't present any claim under 
FELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome.

 MR. McCREADIE:  I certainly agree with you, 
Justice Ginsburg, that the answer to this case answers 
the question of what damages are available under the 
Jones Act and -- and FELA.

But, again, if you look at Miles, which 
analyzing both FELA cases, Vreeland for example, and 
Kraft, which is a railroad case, it -- it has already 
specifically stated what compensatory -- that 
compensatory damages alone are available under the death 
side, admittedly, and that the compensation for a seaman 
and, therefore, for a FELA employee is limited to 
compensation for pecuniary loss and for pre-death pain 
and suffering.

 Also, if we look at another string of 

Supreme Court precedent, it's not as clear as Miles, but 
if we look at the other string, it -- this Court has 
stated over and over that compensatory damages are what 
is available under the Jones Act; compensatory damages 
are available under the FELA; and compensatory damages 
are available under DOHSA.  For example, Zicherman is a 
post-Miles case, and it's written and states the 
principles very clearly:  The Jones Act provides, 
permits, I should say, compensation only for pecuniary 
losses.  And then it discusses Vreeland, which is a FELA 
case, and it says that the FELA permits compensation 
only for pecuniary losses.

 And so, again, if we look at the history on 
the death side, which Miles summarizes, but if we look 
on the personal injury side, at the Osceola, the

Iroquois -- Peterson mentions compensatory damages nine 
times in expressing what remedies are available to 
seamen.  And so those railroad cases, those Jones Act 
cases, have been decided and have been a part of our 
precedent for 60, 70, 80 years.

 And, of course, it is important to note that 
the Congress has amended the Jones Act in 1982, with no 
tampering with this history.  It has amended the Jones 
Act in 2006 with no tampering with the history, and it 
has amended the Jones Act in 2008 without any change. 
And that's in light of Guevara, decided in 1995; that's 
in light of Roy Al, decided in 1995, and 10 years plus 
for the cases to percolate and for Congress to decide 
whether they agree with those policy determinations.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As I read your reply 

brief -- and please correct me if it's a 
misimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that 
punitive damages were available historically for the 
shipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and 
cure, or am I wrong about that?

 MR. McCREADIE:  I -- that must have been the 
Respondent's brief, because our position is -- hopefully 
was clearer than that, that punitive damages have never 
been awarded in the history of the United States for the 
willful failure to pay maintenance and cure until

after -- until after Vaughan v. Atkinson.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what about English 

admiralty, under the English precedents?

 MR. McCREADIE:  The English precedents we 
did not analyze.  We took Miles when it analyzes Lord 
Campbell's Act, and then that was analyzed in Vreeland, 
and from that point forward, Miles took that, that line 
of cases --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, in Miles --
again, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not 
maintenance and cure.

 MR. McCREADIE:  Miles was a wrongful death 
case that analyzed an unseaworthiness cause of action, 
which is brought under general maritime law.  We are 
looking at maintenance and cure, which is a claim 
brought under general maritime law.  Both existed before 
the Jones Act, unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure, 
and again both are general maritime law claims.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course, your 

friend on the other side distinguishes that argument by 
noting that death is different.  As he puts it, we're 
all going to die, so --

MR. McCREADIE:  In that case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- you have 

different considerations under the maintenance and cure.

MR. McCREADIE:  Mr. Chief Justice, that take 

us back again to Cortes, which this Court has already 
decided and analyzed.  Should we distinguish between a 
death action, maintenance and cure action under the 
Jones Act, from a personal injury action?  And the 
unequivocal answer from this Court is no, that you 
should not treat them differently.  There's no logic for 
treating them differently.  We also need to remember 
that one of the anomalies that was -- that was cured by 
Moragne -- the first anomaly cured by Moragne was an 
anomaly where the unseaworthiness action would exist in 
State territorial waters but not in -- I'm sorry, it 
would exist in State territorial waters, but not on the 
high seas.  And that troubled the Moragne Court, that 
you would have a discrepancy between personal injury and 
death, and that's one of issues that they tried to --
tried to reconcile.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought there was -- it 

was on the high seas.  They had DOHSA.  At the time of 
Moragne, there was DOHSA, but then it was when you 
weren't on the high seas that was the gap.  Wasn't that 
the case?

 MR. McCREADIE:  That's correct.  My point is 
there was a difference of what right you had under -- in 
territorial waters under unseaworthiness that Moragne

described as one of the anomalies.  And the anomaly was 
that if the person was injured, they could get an 
unseaworthiness claim; if they died, they could not. 
And Moragne was clear that distinguishing between death 
and personal injury, it made no sense.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's what the 

common law was.  That's why we had Lord Campbell's Act. 
That was if you die, too bad; if you're injured, you 
collect.

 That was fixed by statute on the high seas, 

DOHSA.  Because there was the gap, there was no Lord 
Campbell's Act, the Court effectively made one up, 
right?  That's what it did in Moragne.

 MR. McCREADIE:  Moragne did create some law, 

yes.  Let me try to answer the question in a different 
way --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I just -- and you can 

go ahead and answer that question without my 
interrupting.  But my assumption from reading the amicus 
briefs in this case is that punitive damages were 
awarded in some maintenance and cure cases (a) as simply 
part of the overall award -- they weren't separated out, 
but it was part of the measure -- and (b) that some 
American courts, American judges, including noted 
admiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages

in maintenance and cure before the modern cases Moragne 
and so forth -- and Miles -- that you're talking about. 
Is that incorrect?

 MR. McCREADIE:  That is incorrect.  If you 
read the cases cited, and they have their roots in some 
law review articles that are critical of Miles, that 
don't like the Miles decision, but if you read those 
cases --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm talking pre-Miles. 

I'm talking pre-Miles.

 MR. McCREADIE:  And I'm saying the cases 

that are cited in those law review articles -- the 
purpose of the articles is to criticize Miles.  Those 
cases do not stand for the proposition that they're 
presented for in the law review article and they do not 
stand for the propositions that they have been presented 
to this Court.  They are not holding -- they are not 
giving an award of punitive damages for maintenance and 
cure in any of those cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is -- how many -- how many 
would you say there are in a typical year, maintenance 
and cure cases?  About, roughly?  I mean, say in the 
late twentieth century, 18 -- 1980, 1990.  Have you have 
any guess at all?

maintenance and cure is so often linked to the Jones Act 
and the unseaworthy cause of action, and because of the 
leverage that seems to be brought with punitive damages, 
they are virtually included in every seaman's case --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.
 MR. McCREADIE:  -- from the get-go.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So how many would you 

guess?

 MR. McCREADIE:  And -- and I would have to 

estimate, just extrapolating from my own experience, 
thousands of Jones Act cases are filed in the country 
every year.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Uh-huh.  And they usually 

have maintenance and cure aspects.

 MR. McCREADIE:  Necessarily they do.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you get punitives under

cases -- no, I had, actually, to be honest, I thought we 
found about 12 in the period around 1980 - 2000 where 
they do give some punitive damages.

 MR. McCREADIE:  And -- and -- and I hope I 
was clear that the can of worms was opened by Vaughn. 
No one awarded it.  No one thought about it, until after 
Vaughn.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then I found 

about 10 cases in the period before the Jones Act where 
there was something given -- punitive damages being 
given for something, and there was something sort of 
like maintenance and cure in there.

 MR. McCREADIE:  There -- there are some 
pre-Jones Act cases, like the Amiable Nancy, that --
that talk about punitive damages; and there are some 
cases where some seamen have not been treated very well. 
But a specific look at the cases reveals that there is 
no pre-Jones Act case awarding punitive damages --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Over here, there is one 

called -- Unica v U.S.  The master should have put the 
-- into the hospital.  Given him $1,500.  It was partly 
punitive.  Considering -- De Troupe -- I mean, I found 
some that are sort of -- sort of -- I don't know what to 
say.  I don't know who to make of it.

 MR. McCREADIE:  The Troupe is on the list.

It is a case that we have looked at, and it is -- and 
again, it is a case that I can say that if you look at 
all of them -- it is a very tedious process; there are a 
lot of cases, and wading through each one, none of them 
hold or award punitive damages for the failure to pay 
maintenance and cure.  And --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The Troop gave them $4,000. 

Considering all the circumstances of the aggravation. 
Gross neglect, mistreatment.  "It is useless to parade 
more of the sickening details."

 MR. McCREADIE:  And our position is that 

even if there is -- and there is not; let me be clear --
but even if there was one rogue case, one individual 
case, that does not create general maritime law. 
Something more is needed.  For example, a decision from 
this Court would create general maritime law.

 The Wilburn Boat case is an insurance case. 

There's an example where there are some cases on the 
subject of marine insurance, but there's not enough for 
the court to conclude that there is a general maritime 
law on that subject.

 And so returning again to this -- this 

pocket of cases, they do not stand for the 
proposition -- even if they did, if you'll notice, two 
of them, it's the same district court judge who is

making the noise that he would have done this or he 
might have done this.  And -- and our position is that 
one district court judge does not create general 
maritime law by mentioning the possibility of punitive 
damages in one case.

 We're much more comfortable relying on this 
Court's precedents, the line of cases that builds from 
Moragne to Higgingbotham and culminates in Miles, we're 
much more comfortable looking at the history of the 
damages awarded by this Court to seamen, where it uses 
the term compensatory damages -- compensation for --
over and over and over without any mention whatsoever of 
punitive damages.

 The punitive damages problem did not crop up 

until Vaughn, even though now everyone seems to agree 
Vaughn did not hold that punitive damages were 
available.

 I would also just like to mention all the 

circuit court cases addressing this issue hold that 
Jones Act precludes punitive damages, and any circuit 
court that has addressed this issue since Miles likewise 
specifically holds punitive damages are not available 
for the willful failure to pay maintenance and cure.

 I'd like to reserve my remaining time.

Mr. Sullivan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF G.J. ROD SULLIVAN, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to start by answering the 
question that was raised by Justice Ginsburg.  This 
Court does not need to reach the question of whether or 
not punitive damages are available under the Jones Act 
or under the FELA in order to decide this issue, because 
maintenance and cure is different.  It precedes the 
Jones Act by centuries, perhaps even a thousand years, 
and it deals with a distinctly different problem.

 Maintenance and cure deals with a situation 
as what do we do with an injured seaman to get him back 
to health and get him into the workforce?  And the law 
has provided since Catherine of Aragon went to Greece in 
the 1200s that the ship owner has a responsibility, in 
its capacity as a ship owner, to provide that seaman 
with medical care and to provide that seaman with a 
living allowance so that he can get better and get back 
into the work force.

 Now in 1920, Senator Jones intended to make 
the United States merchant marine the world's greatest 
merchant marine.  He was dealing in a factual scenario

where 12 years earlier, on April 12 of 1912, the Titanic 
had sunk; 1,900 people had died.

 Virtually every member of the Senate and 

Congress knew somebody who was on the Titanic, and 
during the intervening eight years, certain points of 
law became obvious.  First of all, the people who died 
on the Titanic could not recover for anything other 
except their lost baggage.  They could not recover for 
the fact that their loved ones had passed away because 
there was no cause of action.

 Secondly, because the Titanic hit an iceberg 

and was not unseaworthy, there was no cause of action 
for negligence.  So Senator Jones set around to correct 
these two anomalies in the law, and said what we are 
going to do is we're going to create a new class of 
beneficiaries, who are dependents of people who die at 
sea, and we are going to give them the right to recover 
pecuniary damages.  That's the only place where 
pecuniary damages are mentioned in the law.  And then it 
said, and as to seamen, we're going to give them an 
additional right, a cumulative right on top of 
unseaworthiness, and that's going to be negligence.

 It never sought out to touch maintenance and 

cure.  Maintenance and cure has been something that's 
been monitored by the courts ever since its inception,

and it is a self-regulating system.  Before Guevara, 
ship owners regularly provided their employees with 
medical care without asking the question.  If there was 
a close call, they provided the medical care without 
running to the court.  They provided maintenance.

 Then came Guevara, and Guevara decided for 
the first there were no punitive damages, and now you 
have a growing problem in this country.  You have a 
problem with ship owners providing less and less medical 
care without resort to the courts.

 Now our position here is that a seaman 

should be not ever have to come before a court to seek 
maintenance and cure, and the court should never, ever 
have to award punitive damages.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, surely there will be 

some incidents in which the employer in good faith 
thinks there's no illness, that there's no basis for 
maintenance and cure.  MR. SULLIVAN:  And as --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  For you to tell me oh, 

this will just never happen, I mean, that's not the way 
the world works.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  No.  And Judge, when a --

when an employer comes to the court in good faith and 
says there's no entitlement to maintenance and cure, and 
there -- the court finds that -- or the factfinder finds

in good faith, there's no basis for punitive damages. 
Then you merely have a dispute.  But the situation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course there are 

going to be disputes, and the question is whether or 
not, just from the standpoint of filling professional 
responsibility, in almost any maintenance and cure 
action where the counsel for the plaintiff thinks 
that -- for the seaman thinks that the employer has been 
remiss, he doesn't add the punitive damages complaint if 
we agree with your position, which changes completely 
the settlement and the bargaining aspect.  But you can 
address -- you can address that.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Well -- and I agree, Your 

Honor, that is a prospect and a possibility, something 
which I personally abhor doing.  I mean, you should only 
plead punitive damages when you have a good faith basis 
for doing it; you believe you will survive a directed 
verdict.  It should not be thrown in to every single 
complaint, and I'm not denying that some counsel will do 
that.

 But what I'm saying is that today, in 2009, 

in 2006, there are actually ship owners who are, as a 
regular practice, denying their seamen medical care.  I 
don't know why that is.  Perhaps it's because it is 
expensive now, more expensive than it has ever been.

Perhaps it is because there are safety nets that will 
allow the seamen to seek Medicaid, and so the taxpayer 
will pay for it.  Whatever the motivations are, it is a 
growing trend that we are seeing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many of these seamen 
who seek maintenance and cure are represented?  I mean, 
what is the incidence of representation for maintenance 
and cure claims as distinguished from Jones Act 
negligence type claims with the -- the possibility of 
large recoveries for pain and suffering?

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Judge, I'd be picking a 
number out of the air, but I can give you anecdotal 
evidence of this.  In the Fifth Circuit attorneys who 
regularly do maritime personal injury work tell each 
other -- we talk about the fact that you can't afford to 
represent somebody who's got a maintenance and cure case 
that's not combined with a Jones Act case.  And there 
are a number of practical reasons for that.

 You have to pay all of the experts, and it 

is very expensive to bring these cases.  You have to 
hire the orthopedic surgeons, the -- the radiologists. 
You have to pay for the tests, and then, as an attorney, 
these are never recoverable as costs.

 And then you are working on a contingent 
hourly fee.  If you win your case and you prove that

they were willful, wanton, and callous in -- in denying 
maintenance and cure, then you might get a portion of 
your attorneys' fees back.

 Now, you may do that as a pro bono matter on 

occasion.  But you cannot rely upon the fact that 
attorneys will take these cases.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why -- why does 

joining it to a Jones Act case help?

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, because when you join 

it to a Jones Act case, you have the substantial 
possibility of getting either a settlement or a verdict 
at the end of the case which is going to compensate the 
attorneys for taking on the maintenance and cure case as 
a portion of it.

 And so, consequently, if somebody has a 

serious accident, it falls under the Jones Act and there 
is a maintenance and cure count, the attorney will 
handle all of those together and feel adequately 
compensated.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the -- the point 

you are making is that the recovery under the Jones Act 
can be very large, and the attorney on a contingent 
basis would get a piece of that.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Exactly, Your Honor.

swelled by the pain and suffering damages which are not 
available in maintenance and cure.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is the 
pre-Vaughan case that awarded punitive damages --
awarded punitive damages in a maintenance and cure case?
 MR. SULLIVAN:  Judge, first of all, I would 
cite to you two cases:  The Rolf case, which is a 1924 
Ninth Circuit case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I am -- what --

which --any case from this Court?

 MR. SULLIVAN:  No.  No.  This issue did not 

come before this Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It hasn't come before 
this Court under FELA or the Jones Act, either, the 
punitive damage question?

 MR. SULLIVAN:  It hasn't -- it has not, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Rolf was not a -- Rolf was 

maintenance and cure and personal injury and 
unseaworthiness.  So we don't know which aspect of the 
case led to the punitives.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  We don't, but we know that 

there was outrage on behalf of the court.  And,

unfortunately, in -- and I think, as Justice Souter 
pointed out --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it the case that we 

can't find a single pre-Jones Act case where punitives 
were awarded and what was sought was maintenance and 
cure?  I -- I found some, but they seem ambiguous to me.
 MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, Judge, I would say that 

--

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is your best?
 MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  I would say that the 

best are the Rolf and the Margharita, which were denials 
of medical care where the damages were enhanced because 
of outrageous conduct.  But to say that, Judge, is there 
a case that says this is maintenance and cure, we are 
going to award punitive damages, that's not been done.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So we have a history all 

the way back to Catherine of Aragon, and what we've been 
able to find in these pre-Jones Act cases is really two 
or three, or maybe I found ten actually, that I couldn't 
say -- leaning over in your direction, I could take 
maybe three or four.  And they show a little ambiguity. 
But give them all ten, and that's still ten out of 
hundreds of years of history.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, let me -- let me 

respond to that in a couple of ways.  First of all,

punitive damages were part of the common law until taken 
away by Congress.

 And -- and it could be asserted that 

maintenance and cure punitive damages were not necessary 
because the threat was enough to -- to require 
shipowners to go ahead and provide this.  And I would 
point out to the Court that this had not been a problem 
prior to Guevara.  Shipowners did self-regulate.  They 
didn't -- seamen didn't run to the courts every time 
they wanted maintenance and cure; whereas, today they 
have to.

 The leading scholar in this whole area is 

Professor Robertson at the University of Texas who wrote 
the AHA brief.  And his brief on pages 7 through 11 
catalogs the cases where he suggests punitive damages or 
exemplary damages were awarded for outrageous conduct 
involving failure to provide medical care.

 And I would suggest that those show that 
punitive damages were unexceptional before Vaughan. 
They were part of the common law.  They -- they were 
before this Court in the Amiable Nancy even though it 
didn't involve medical care.  There is no reason to 
assume that punitive damages are accepted in maritime 
law; as part of the common law, that they weren't also 
accepted for the willful, wanton, and egregious failure

to provide a seaman with medical care.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I thought that the lack 

of counsel in maintenance and cure cases was a pivotal 
point or a relevant point for our decision, other than 
the representations of counsel, where would I look to 
verify that?

 MR. SULLIVAN:  The existence of prior 

maintenance and cure cases?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the -- that there 
is a problem in seamen finding attorneys who will take 
maintenance and cure cases.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes, Judge.  There is not 

empirical evidence out there.  Nobody has done studies. 
I'm not aware of any.  But do we really want to wait for 
the situation where we have hundreds and hundreds of 
seamen who are -- are, you know, living homeless or 
living in their cars or unable to obtain medical care 
before this Court decides that if somebody does this, it 
is something that can be punished?

 And -- and I think that's the situation 

we're at today.  It is a growing problem.  And it is a 
growing problem because Rivera is a relatively new case, 
and it has spread to the other circuits.

maintenance and cure were as well established, why 
wasn't that mentioned in terms in the Vaughan majority? 
It only comes up in the Vaughan dissent.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, it does come up in the 

Vaughan dissent because it was not requested by the --
in the -- in the lower courts.  And this Court would not 
consider a claim for punitive damages for the first time 
on appeal.

 I -- I think what Justice Stewart was saying 

is we have a question before us where somebody is 
requesting attorneys' fees in -- in derogation of the 
American Rule.  The majority is saying we are going to 
find an exception to the American Rule and give 
attorneys' fees.  And justice Stewart is saying, I don't 
want to do that.  I think that the better --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It was just sort of off the 
top of his head that he thought there should be punitive 
damages.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  He was quoting from McCormick 

on damages amend some basic treatises.  And I think he 
was taking the position that punitive damages are in our 
quiver of weapons that we can use to deter --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They -- they normally are, 

but the question is whether there -- whether this --
this is a different quiver.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, I think that he was 

saying that this is one of the weapons we have.  Instead 
of creating an exception to the American Rule, let's 
give them punitive damages to account for this egregious 
conduct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that -- that was not 
argued by anybody.  It wasn't raised in the lower court. 
It wasn't a punitive damages case.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't. 

The first time counsel for Mr. Vaughan raised the 
question of punitive damages was on remand.  And then 
the district court said, hey, look, you didn't raise it 
before.  Just because Justice Stewart suggested this as 
-- as an alternative to attorneys' fees doesn't mean 
we're going to award punitive damages now.

JUSTICE BREYER:  With attorneys' fees there 
is a compensatory aspect.  The -- the basic obligation 
is to keep this seaman alive and well, and then you give 
him some wages if necessary, and you give him medical 
care.  And -- and now he's going to be out that 
attorneys' fees as a result of his sickness.  So I 
understand that.

 Punitives does not compensate him for 

anything.  It is a policy matter for the State.  He's a 
beneficiary of a windfall.  And it seems a more radical 
step to make something up out of whole cloth here with 
punitives than it does with attorneys' fees.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Judge, I would like you to 
look at how Congress treats this problem.  If you had, 
for example, a bridge-building project where a seaman, a 
longshoreman and a State worker all got injured 
identically in the same accident side by side, and the 
shipowner failed to provide medical care for the 
longshoreman, the shipowner could go to jail.  If the 
shipowner provided -- or failed to provide medical care 
to the State worker, he could be, again, subject to 
criminal penalties.

 On top of the criminal penalties, Congress 
has established these administrative agencies to assure 
that those workers get medical care.  On top of that, if

they don't get medical care, they lose their defense of 
workers' compensation immunity.  They lose the defense 
of assumption of risk, contributory negligence, and they 
are subject to personal liability, not just corporate 
liability.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe it would be a good 

thing.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  The -- the problem here is 
it has pros and cons.  I was quite moved by the brief --
the citation that Professor Robertson made of all of 
those old cases until we looked them up.  And -- and 
then I found they seem to stand for a little bit less 
than I had the impression they stood for.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  That --

admiralty causes of action we should be guided by what 
Congress has done in the Death on the High Seas Act and 
the Jones Act.

 Do you acknowledge that there are no 
punitive damages available in the event of death?

 MR. SULLIVAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that -- you want to 
talk about what's a sensible system and what is not a 
sensible system.  In the days when Massachusetts used to 
have a -- when I was in law school, they had a 
compensation limit for wrongful death, but to limit for 
pain and suffering, for negligence; and the line was 
back her up again -- back her up again, Sam, she's not 
quite dead yet.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. SULLIVAN:  Judge, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is -- is -- is this going 

to be the same thing, where -- where the ship owner 
says, well, you know, if -- if -- if I treat him badly 
enough that he dies, I don't get hit with the punitive 
damages?

 MR. SULLIVAN:  I would hope that would not 

be the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah, but it is invited, 

isn't it?

MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, I don't think it is 
invited, Judge.  There are reasons why that there is 
this anomaly that there are no punitive damages for 
death.  And that's because in 1920 when Congress created 
the Death on the high Seas Act there were no -- any kind 
of damages.  There was no recovery at all.

 And so, Congress preempted this field of 
death.  And it said that death cases shall be decided 
under the Death on the High Seas Act.  But Congress has 
completely stayed away from the area of maintenance and 
cure.  It hasn't enacted administrative remedies because 
the Court has always been the one who has decided what's 
appropriate.

 And this Court, as a matter of its -- as 

maintaining its court docket and maintaining these 
remedies, has the right and I think the obligation to 
say we're going to keep these cases out of court by 
awarding punitive damages when somebody willfully denies 
this right, when somebody willfully withholds medical 
care.

 And I think if you do that, you're going to 

see these cases are going to disappear.  Seamen are 
going to start getting their medical care again.  They 
are not going to be coming to the court every time they 
get injured and saying, I haven't gotten my back

surgery.  I haven't gotten my rotator cuff surgery.  It 
is sort of a matter of court administration to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not sure as 
sure -- I'm not sure I follow that.  In other areas 
where we allow punitive damages it hasn't resulted in 
the cases going away.  Quite the opposite.  It seems 
that it has given rise to a variety of claims on both 
sides.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  This is a very narrow area of 

law, Your Honor.  We are talking about are you giving 
the seaman the medical care he needs to get the maximum 
medical improvement?  And that's all it is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, but the normal 

medical malpractice area has given rise to a lot of 
punitive damage litigation.  I don't know why this would 
anybody different.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  I think this would be 

different because all we're talking about is does the 
seaman get the surgery he needs.  If he doesn't get the 
surgery he needs and he gets worse or continues to stay 
ill or he continues to stay in pain, then the ship owner 
should be punished.  But --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It certainly makes these 

maintenance and care cases a lot more attractive to the 
plaintiffs' bar doesn't it?  I mean, one of your

complaints is there's just no money in it.  The claim is 
not for that much.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  The goal here, Judge, is not 

money.  The goal here, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course it shouldn't be 

the goal.  But we're inquiring into the question of 
whether granting punitive damages will increase or 
decrease the number of lawsuits.

 I -- I -- I would think it would be 

astounding if it would decrease the number of lawsuits.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  I think it would decrease the 

incidence when medical care is denied.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There -- there wouldn't 
be any maintenance and cure claim if the system worked 
as it was intended; that is, that if you have a sailor 
who is injured, the ship owner pays room and board and 
medical expenses.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  That's all it is, Your Honor. 
Just say if the ship owner will treat the seaman fairly, 
will follow the doctor's recommendations, get him to a 
doctor, give him treatment so he gets better, there's --
I mean, you are saying there may be more claims for 
punitive damages, but there will be more awards of 
punitive damages because there won't be this willful and 
wanton, callous disregard of the seaman's rights.

And so, I would suggest that, in fact, in 

this narrow area of the law, if you impose punitive 
damages, actual punitive conduct, conduct that deserves 
punishment will go down and it will go down rapidly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wish it were as clearcut 
as that.  I mean, what if the seaman says, you know, I 
should have had this very expensive treatment?  And the 
ship owner's medical counsel said, no, this treatment is 
not necessary.

 Is that -- is that a punitive damages claim? 

I bet it is.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  I don't think so, Judge.  I 

think those kind of cases should be weeded out on 
summary judgment by the courts -- by the district court, 
because we're only talking about the willful, wanton and 
callous withholding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's going to say that was 

willful and wanton.  I obviously needed this more 
expensive treatment.  He just didn't want to pay the 
money.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  And the court is going to 

have to -- the district courts are going to have to make 
a judgment as to the bona fides of that case.  But I 
think that you are going to find that it is very rare 
when somebody is going to act callously when the

potential on the other side is that they are going to be 
awarded -- have punitive damages awarded against them.
 And that, therefore, this is going to be a 
corrective mechanism that's going to do away with the 
problem we currently have now and make the plaintiffs 
even better.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, it --
whether it gives rise to more litigation or not, it is 
still a significant and will give rise to greater costs 
on the part of the shipper which will be passed on, as 
is the case in a lot of areas where you have punitive 
damages, it will be passed on to the consumer.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  If the punitive damages are 

awarded.  But the hope, of course, is that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, even if 

they're not.  In other words, you were saying, look, to 
avoid punitive damages, the ship owner is going to make 
sure that there -- that that more expensive test is 
provided.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  It's going to err on behalf 

of the seaman.  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That doesn't mean 

there are no costs involved in ruling in your favor.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  That's true, Judge.  But here 

again, we're balancing the interest of somebody who is

injured and whose condition may become permanent and 
incurable by virtue of not getting prompt care as 
opposed to the limited costs to the ship owner of 
providing a doctor who is going to determine what the 
best care is.  And that's all we asking for, the best 
care that medical care can currently provide to get the 
seaman to maximum cure.

 If there are no further questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 MR. SULLIVAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. McCreadie, you 

have three minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. McCREADIE:  Justice Ginsburg, I wanted 

to respond first to a question that you asked that I 
think there may have been some confusion with respect to 
the answer.

 There is pain and suffering available in a 

maintenance and cure claim if the failure to pay the 
maintenance and cure causes injury, causes hurt.  That's 
what we understand from reading the Osceola and Iroquois 
as interpreted by Cortes.

 So, I didn't want you to be left with the 

impression that even if a maintenance and cure claim was

brought by itself, if there's some injury, some damage 
beyond the failure to receive the maintenance and cure, 
there is a cause of action that could lead to, I think 
as you put it, the higher award and, hence, attorneys 
--

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that a separate cause 
of action?  Or is it just part of the maintenance and 
cure act?

 MR. McCREADIE:  It's -- it's maintenance and 
cure and it can be brought either under the maintenance 
and cure with an injury or it can be brought under the 
Jones Act.  You can choose your cause of action.  You 
just don't recover twice.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you -- are you then 
disputing what your colleague said about lawyers being 
reluctant to take maintenance and cure claims that are 
not tied with a Jones Act claim?

 MR. McCREADIE:  Justice Ginsburg, we're 

relying on Supreme Court precedent as opposed to 
anecdotal information.  But to answer your question 
specifically, that's why I'm explaining that they do 
have the right to bring a personal injury component to a 
maintenance and cure claim.

 And the other point I wanted to make in the 

Ninth and Fifth Circuits those are the circuits of

Guevara and Roy Al, where punitive damages have been 
clearly eliminated from a maintenance and cure claim for 
willful failure to pay.  Since 1995 there's no dearth of 
cases.  Those remain two of the most active circuits in 
the country for seamen's cases.  And whether they are 
filing as just maintenance and cure or combining with 
the Jones Act, the ratio would probably be the same as 
any other circuit.

 There was also a question about the Vaughan 

and -- and what the dissent knew or didn't know; and 
reference to McCormick on damages.  I think, again, it 
is a small point but it is interesting to point out that 
McCormick on damages, the same volume that the dissent 
referred to, specifically states that punitive damages 
are not available under FELA -- under the FELA.  And, of 
course, the Jones Act incorporates FELA by reference.

 Really the Vaughan dissent did not have the 
benefit of Miles when it reached its decision.  If that 
court had had the benefit, we believe they would have 
found punitive damages are not available.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
