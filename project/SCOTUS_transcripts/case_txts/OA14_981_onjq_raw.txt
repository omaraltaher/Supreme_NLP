CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this  morning  in  Case  14­981,  Fisher  v.  The  University  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  at  Austin. 

 

 

            

Before  we  get  started,  I'll  advise  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers  that  this  is  our  only  case  this  morning,  so  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend  to  grant  the  parties  ten  minutes  or  so  of  extra 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  and  the  amicus  five  minutes. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  Mr.  Rein,  no  need  to  rush. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

               

               

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  BERT  REIN 

 

 

 

 

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

              

I  appreciate  the  extra  time,  and  I  didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

rush  up  here  to  start  before  you  invited  me  this  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  reviewing  the  Fifth  Circuit's  initial 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  in  what  we  call  Fisher  I,  seven  members  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  reaffirmed  that  a  clear  precondition  to  the  use  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race  as  an  admissions  factor  was  the  ability  to  satisfy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  was  called  the  "demanding  burden  of  strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny"  articulated  in  Grutter  and  Bakke. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

By  establishing  that  she  was  considered  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admission  to  UT  under  a  system  that  discriminated

against  her  on  the  basis  of  her  race,  Ms.  Fisher  placed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  UT  the  burden  of  ­­ of  proving,  by  evidence  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  that  its  use  of  race  was,  first,  in  pursuit  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelling,  constitutionally  legitimate  interest 

 

 

 

expressed  with  sufficient  clarity  and  concreteness  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow  a  reviewing  court  to  determine,  first,  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  of  race  was  a  necessary  last  resort  in  pursuing  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  defined,  taking  into  account  reasonably 

 

 

 

 

 

available  nonracial  alternatives. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Rein,  may  I  ask,  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

we  didn't  have  the  10  percent  plan,  if  that  were  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  and  all  that  were  left  were  the  Grutter­like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan,  would  you  then  recognize  that  you  had  no  claim? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  have  the  ­­ what  ­­ what  the  University 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Texas  has  added  on  to  the  10  percent  plan.  But  now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  wipe  out  the  10  percent,  and  we  have  only  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grutter­like  plan. 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  Well,  I  ­­ with  respect,  I  ­­ I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

would  question  the  premise  of  the  question  because  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  Grutter­like  plan  in  its  entirety. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

different  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  know  it's  not  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

MR.  REIN:  That  would  be  a  totally 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ but  ­­ but  I'm  asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  hypothetical.

MR.  REIN:  No.  And  I'm  saying  even  in  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

AI/PAI  system  it's  not  a  Grutter­like  plan.  It's  not  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  of  shaping  a  class  by  individualized  one­to­one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

comparisons.  It's  not  aimed  at  a  critical  mass.  It's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

not  a  Grutter  plan  in  that  sense. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  the  ­­ the  other  part  of  this  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's,  of  course,  not  the  case  before  us.  When  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  satisfaction  of  a  compelling  interest,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  and  ask:  Does  my  preexisting  system  satisfy  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest?  Do  I  have  a  need  to  do  something  else?  And 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

if  I  have  a  need  to  do  something,  is  that  something  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Assume  need  was  proven. 

  

 

 

 

 

I  know.  You're  ­­ you're  ­­ you're  ­­ we're  putting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aside  need.  What's  wrong  with  this  plan  if  need  is  put 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aside? 

            

MR.  REIN:  Well,  let's  put  it  this  way:  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  not  oppose  the  use  of  the  various  PAI  factors  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  in  place  before  race  was  added.  What's  wrong  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  plan,  apart  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  no,  no,  no. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  And  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  know  you're  saying 

    

 

 

 

they  don't  need  to  do  it.  I  said  put  it  aside  and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  Justice  Ginsburg's  question.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  they  had  to  use  race, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  are  they  using  it  improperly? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  If  you  have  to  use  race  and  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  use  the  model  that  was  created  in  Bakke  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grutter,  you  would  need  to  build  profiles  of  individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  allow  you  to  judge  them  one  against  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  context  of  the  class  and  the  educational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience  you  are  trying  to  create. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  My  God,  that  sounds  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  using  race  more  rather  than  less  than  this  plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does. 

            

MR.  REIN:  I  ­­ I'm  sorry  if  it  sounds  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  It  is  not.  It  simply  says,  in  a  situation  of  the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bakke  situation  where  you're  looking  at  every  aspect  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  individual  and  you're  trying  to  judge  whether  one  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  of  individuals  for  the  ­­ for  places,  the  last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places  would  most  benefit  the  class,  the  class  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  as  a  learning  entity,  then  you  can,  as  Bakke 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indicates,  take  account  of  the  fact  that  they  may  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  backgrounds,  which  would  contribute  different 

 

 

 

 

 

ideas. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  does  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  Those  are  whole­person 

  

 

 

 

comparisons.  This  is  not  the  system  that  ­­ this  system 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  do  anything  like  Bakke.

So  if  ­­ it's  very  different.  Even  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  it  from  the  necessity  issue  ­­ which  is,  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  a  major  issue  in  this  case,  but  I'm  assuming 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  question  ­­ that  they've  shown  that  they  needed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  race,  there  was  no  other  way  to  do  whatever  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  trying  to  do  ­­ which  isn't  clear  to  me  either  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  you  have  both  the  question  of  whether  they've  defined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  legitimate  compelling  interest;  you  have  the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  whether  they've  shown  any  necessity  to  use  race.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  I  ­­ even  I  put  those  aside,  whether  this  is  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowly  tailored  vision  that  came  out  of  Bakke  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  serious  question.  It  isn't.  It's  quite  different. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  can  ­­

   

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  still  haven't 

  

 

 

 

answered  why  this  is  worse  than  Bakke.  I  mean  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  Because  it  ­­ it's  not  used  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

build  a  class.  It's  just  used  to  create  a  racial  plus 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  to  increase  the  number  of  minority  admissions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  is  race  given  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  It's  race  as  such. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  is  race  given  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

plus? 

              

I  ­­ I  thought  that  what  they're  looking  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  leaders  in  diversity,  not  just  of  race,  but  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experiences  generally.

MR.  REIN:  Those  factors  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  how  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  REIN:  I'm  sorry.  But  those  factors 

  

  

 

 

 

 

were  in  the  PAI  before  they  added  race.  Leadership; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrated  awards  and  success  out  of  school; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overcoming  obstacles,  like  a  single­parent  family. 

   

 

 

 

Those  were  all  part  of  the  PAI  before  race  was  added. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Race  was  just  tacked  on,  as  they  said,  as  a  factor  of  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor  of  a  factor. 

   

 

            

They've  shifted  position  as  to  how  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used.  In  the  ­­ in  the  district  court,  it  was  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimized,  a  factor  of  a  factor  of  a  factor.  It's  a 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

minor  plus;  don't  worry  about  it.  It's  now  become, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  it's  a  contextualized  part  of  the  PAS,  which  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  PAI,  and  we  can  discretionarily  jack  that  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  way  we  want. 

 

 

 

            

claim  ­­

 

            

But  all  those  other  factors  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  think  your  brief 

    

 

 

 

admitted  that  this  isn't  in  favor  of  any  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race,  that  white  people  in  some  situations  can  show 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leadership,  as  ­­ as  well  as  black  or  Hispanic  or  Asian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  Native  American.  Any  race  could  benefit  from  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plus  factor.  So  how  is  this  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ worse  than  Bakke? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  REIN:  With  respect,  we  did  not  concede 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

that,  and  we  would  not  concede  it  because  the  other  PAI

efforts  ­­ those  are  universal,  and  they  can  benefit  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

candidate.  But  they  don't  benefit  from  the  race  factor.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  in  Grutter  ­­ in  both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grutter  and  what  Justice  Powell  said  would  be  proper  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bakke,  race  was  a  factor.  Race,  itself,  was  a  factor. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

And  that's  why  I'm  finding  it  very  hard  to  distinguish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  university  is  doing,  apart  from  the  10  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan. 

            

But  let  ­­ let  me  ask  you  about  the  10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  plan  itself,  because  it  seems  to  me  that  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  obviously  driven  by  one  thing  only,  and  that  thing  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race.  It's  totally  dependent  upon  having  racially 

  

 

 

 

 

 

segregated  neighborhoods,  racially  segregated  schools, 

 

 

 

 

and  it  operates  as  a  disincentive  for  a  minority  student 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  step  out  of  that  segregated  community  and  attempt  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  an  integrated  education. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  Justice  Ginsburg,  let  ­­ let  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

respond  to  this,  with  respect,  this  ­­ this  way.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Top  10  Plan  does  not  classify  anybody  by  race.  It

the  background. 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  When  you  say  "work,"  it  works  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  number  of  fronts.  It  creates  geographic  diversity. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  looks  all  over  Texas.  It  doesn't  distinguish  between 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high  schools.  It  creates  socioeconomic  diversity.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

does  have  an  effect,  a  demonstrated  effect  on  race 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  a  number  of  minorities,  the  type  they  care 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

about,  are  admitted  under  the  top  10  program.  But  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  based  on  race.  It's  based  on  the  degree  of  effort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  make  relative  to  the  other  people  with  whom  you're

purpose,  to  define  a  neutral  framework  within  which  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy  the  States  and  the  universities'  objectives.

but  that  purpose  and  effect  are  different.  But  yes,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  created,  and  in  part,  because  certain  schools  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  minorities,  the  idea  was,  well,  that  would  benefit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  schools  just  as  it  would  benefit  a  rural  high

Solicitor  General's  attempted  to  do  so  by  breaking  down

your  campus  and  you  believe  there's  an  inadequate

they  cannot  properly  bring  to  bear  their  perspective  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  campus,  you  can  look  at  measures  of  how  successful

is  the  term  in  Grutter,  where  that  exchange  is  vibrant

MR.  REIN:  None  that  I  know  about. 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ scientific  studies  where 

  

 

 

 

 

you  know  at  what  point  you  suddenly  have  enough  of  a

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  what  did  the  university 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  The  university  based  it  on  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

things.  It  was  short  of  the  demographics  of  the  high 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school  graduating  class,  which  is  measurable  but  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate,  and  it  claimed  that  it  was  basing  it  on  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classroom,  small­class  study  which  they  had  conducted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previously,  which  indicated  that  minorities  were  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present  to  the  ­­ their  satisfaction  in  a  lot  of  small

do  they  base  their  satisfaction?  On  what  do  they  base? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Like,  15  percent,  20  percent? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  They  premised  it  on  good  faith,

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  I  thought 

    

  

 

 

that  the  study  they  did  showed  that  in  1996,  they  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  participation  in  these  smaller  classes.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

know  if  they're  really  small  when  they're  somewhere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  eight  and  25  people.  That  was  a  ­­ but  there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  more  of  those  classes  in  1996  than  in  2003  or  '2 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  they  were  looking  at  that  study. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  would  seem  to  me  that  that  suggests  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  less  ­­ what  they  took  from  it,  that  there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  exchange  of  ideas  in  a  classroom  rather  than  more, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  this  race­neutral  policy. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  Well,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What's  wrong  ­­ since 

  

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  infer  these  things,  you  can't  use  a  quota.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You're  saying  we 

  

 

 

 

can't  ­­ they  can't  use  demographics.  So  they  use  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

study  that  shows  there's  less  classes.  There's  less 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  in  classes.  They  talk  to  administrators, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

faculty,  and  students.  They're  having  racial  incidents 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on  campus  where  students  of  color  are  complaining  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  feel  isolated,  that  stereotyping  is  going  on,  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

campus.

concern,  which  is  this  classroom  study. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

First  thing  I  would  observe  about  that  if  I 

   

 

 

 

 

were  in  their  position,  and  I'm  not,  is  that  the  second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

study  was  done  at  a  time  when  there  were  more  minorities 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted  than  the  first  study,  and  they  claimed  it  went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backwards.  So  that  might  tell  me  right  away  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  ­­ the  necessity  for  using  race  could  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrated  for  that,  because  when  you  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah.  Because  the  ­­ the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

necessity  is  not  the  necessity  you're  talking  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  the  ­­ as  I  read  it.  I  mean,  you  use  words  like 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"critical  mass"  and  so  forth.  It  sounds  like  a  cloud  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort  of  you  don't  know  what  they're  talking,  but  as  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  further  into  it,  it  becomes  quite  specific,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  75  percent  of  the  students  are  at  this  university 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  were  in  the  top  10  percent  of  their  class. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  it  doesn't  take  long  before  students  and  faculty  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  situations  know  who  is  who.  25  percent  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  students  in  that  class  are  admitted;  they're  good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students,  not  in  the  top  10  percent  on  the  basis  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leadership,  activities,  awards,  work  experience, 

 

 

 

 

community  service,  family's  economic  status,  school 

 

 

 

 

 

status,  family  responsibilities,  single­parent  home, 

 

 

 

 

languages  other  than  English  spoken  at  home,  SAT  score

Okay?  We're  talking  about  that  25  percent.  And  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't  take  long  before  students  in  a  class  see  that  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  25  percent,  which  means  you  aren't  just  in  the  top 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  of  your  class,  in  that  25  percent  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hardly  anybody  who  is  African­American  or  Hispanic.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ and  seven  years  of  experience  with  that  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  led  the  faculty  at  meetings,  administrators,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others  to  say,  we  should  do  more  to  see  that  that  25 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  has  occasionally  somebody  who  is  a  minority. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

faculty  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Does  anybody  but  the 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  what  their  program 

  

 

 

 

 

is.  It  isn't  something  like  critical  mass,  et  cetera. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  ­­ and  if  you  have  to  say,  it  seems  to  me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  is  that  not  a  diversity­related  judgment  of  what  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary? 

            

that. 

            

MR.  REIN:  So,  Justice  Breyer,  let  me  answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

First  of  all,  one  thing  your  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishes  quite  clearly  is  if  one  assumes  premises 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  evidence  that  doesn't  exist,  you  can  draw 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusions  that  are  perhaps  invalid. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  let  me  go  back  to  ­­ to  where  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

started.  You  say  these  people  are  admitted  on  the  basis 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  various  PAI  factors,  which  you  read.  That's  not

how  they're  admitted.  That  PAI  is  only  part  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admissions  criteria. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

MR.  REIN:  And  it's  not  truly  holistic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  in  the  holistic  systems,  you  look  at  the  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  whole.  Here  you  could  have  the  most  wonderful  PAI 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  never  come  close  to  admission,  because  they  use  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

AI  independently.  So  they're  not  admitted  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Every  school  is  like  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Every  school  in  the  country  that's  a  college  that  I've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever  experienced  is  a  combination  of  grades,  class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

position,  and  a  lot  of  other  things. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  But  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  I'm  talking  about  people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

who  aren't  admitted;  75  percent  are,  solely  on  the  basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  class  ranking. 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  Yeah.  And  ­­ and  then  you  assume 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  people  could  identify  them  one  from  another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  was  going  to  ask  that. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Does  anybody,  except  the  faculty,  know  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  elite  25  percent  is? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  all  of  the  10  percent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  identified  themselves?

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  They  go  around  in  bunches, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

hey,  I'm  one  of  the  10  percent?

percent  are,  do  they? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  ­­ and  the  level  of  admission  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  faculty  at  the  university  subgroup  in  which  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

study,  whether  it's  business  or  communications,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  all  done  by  AI/PAI.  They're  all  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  I  ­­

   

  

 

MR.  REIN:  They're  all  done  equally. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Could  I  come  back  to  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

issue  of  classroom  diversity?  Because  that  does  seem  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  to  be  something  that  could  be  measured.  And  maybe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  evidence  in  the  record  that  measures  it.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know.  So  that's  what  I  want  to  ask  you.  But  the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

University  knows  which  students,  even  if  ­­ assuming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  students  don't  know,  this  University  knows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  students  were  admitted  because  they  were  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

top  10  percent  and  which  were  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  presumably  they  have  a  record  of  all  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  classes  and  which  students  enrolled  in  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classes.  And  so  it  would  seem  to  me  to  be  possible  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  whether  the  students  who  were  admitted  under

found  it.  Is  there  anything  in  the  record  to  show  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  The  best  of  the  record,  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  study  that  specifically.  When  they  did  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classroom  study,  they  ­­ they  did  not  try  to  distinguish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  was  in  the  class.  It  was  just  a  number  count  by  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  classification,  how  many  minorities  of  this  kind,  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  of  that  kind.  They  counted  African­Americans. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They  counted  Hispanic  students,  or  ­­ and  they  counted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Asians  in  that  study,  but  they  counted  them  by  race. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  don't  want  ­­ I  don't 

    

   

 

 

 

want  to  pre­demit  this  line  of  questioning  because  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  important  and  we're  well  into  the  substantive

May  I  begin  with  almost  a  procedural  point: 

   

   

 

 

 

Did  you  object  to  the  University's  request  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  be  remanded  to  the  district  court?

indicated,  that  the  litigants,  and  frankly  this  Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  denied  the  advantage  and  the  perspective  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  gained  if  there  would  be  additional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact­finding  under  the  instructions  that  Fisher  sought

case. 

            

            

happened. 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It's  as  if  nothing  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  REIN:  And  ­­ and  the  reason  for  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  I  ­­ it  seems  to  me 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  Justice  Alito's  question  indicates  that  this  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  thing  that  we  should  know  but  we  don't  know. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  Well,  let  ­­ let  me  point  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ the  purpose  of  strict  scrutiny  is  not  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  adjudicate.  It  is  to  instruct  the  University  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  you  use  the  odious  classification,  before  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employ  race,  you  ought  to  know  these  things.  If  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  depend  on  them,  you  ought  to  study  them  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  them.  So  the  failure  to  do  that  so  there  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  is  not  just  because  they  didn't  put  it  in  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  they  weren't  given  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

chance  to  add  additional  evidence  in  order  to  meet  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard.

the  evidence  available  to  them  about  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  they  could  answer  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  questions  as  ­­ like  the  ones  Justice  Alito 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

added.  And  I  think  it's  a  very  important  point. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  They  could  ­­ I  mean,  but  they'd 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  go  back  and  study  the  conditions  at  the  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  made  the  decision.  And  I  think  that  the  failure  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  that  kind  of  thing  indicates  that  the  retreat  to  race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  reflexive;  was  done  on  the  day  Grutter  came  down. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Not  only  that.  Also  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

failure  to  put  it  in.  It  was  their  burden  to  put  it  in, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  it? 

 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  Yes.  And  they  knew  that  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  we're  going  to  say,  oh,

MR.  REIN:  Well,  procedurally  ­­

standard  was  strict  scrutiny.  Grutter  had  said  strict 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny.  Bakke  said  strict  scrutiny.  It  was  no 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

surprise. 

            

And  Justice  Alito,  more  directly,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  we  did  find  in  the  record  indicated  that  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  most  selective  schools  were  concerned,  which  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  lead  you  to  the  smaller  classes,  more  of  the  top 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ten  minorities  enrolled  in  that  than  the  added 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minorities  that  they  derived  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  the  issue  in  this  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  whether  the  University  can  have  holistic  review. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  The  issue  is  whether  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  have  as  a  component  of  holistic  review  after  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  taken  into  account  other  characteristics  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  dependent  on  race;  they  can  add  race  as  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  characteristic. 

 

            

And  so  if  it  were  ­­ is  there  ­­ would  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  any  way  of  determining,  if  there  were  a  remand,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  non­top  10  admittees  were  admitted  solely  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  race?  In  other  words,  these  students  would  not  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  admitted  taking  into  account  leadership  and  family, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

education  and  socioeconomic  background  and  hardship  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  else.

Texas,  the  answer  to  that  is  no.  They  cannot  make  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  because,  in  their  view,  race  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contextual.  You  cannot  sort  out  those  who  could  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  it  without  race  from  those  who  didn't. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  just  in  response  to  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  as  fact  of  record,  prior  to  the  invocation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race,  15  percent  of  the  non­top  10  admits  were  ­­ were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  minorities  who  later  benefitted  from  race. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it  was  not  devoid  of  admits  who  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hispanic  or  ­­ or  African­American.  It  was  producing  15 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent,  a  marginal  increase  out  of  race  was,  if  you  try 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  measure  it,  very  small.  And  ­­ and  I  could  think  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  for  that,  but  ­­ so  they  couldn't  put  that  in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  denied  that  you  could  ever  identify  those  students. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  that  would  be  a  fruitless  pursuit  unless  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  change  everything  they  said  before.

still  going  to  be  a  very  small  number.  It  doesn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  ­­ it's  statistically  lost.  So  it's  a  very  small 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

increment.  And  of  course,  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  number  is 

  

 

 

 

 

important  to  me.  Is  it  ­­ is  what  any  ­­

Parents  Involved,  you  indicated  that  at  some  point  the

considered  if  at  the  end  of  the  day  it  generates  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  number.  And  I'm  trying  to  figure  out  what  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  is. 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  And  ­­ and  I  am  saying  that,  as

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Right.  Right.

under  3  percent.  And  it's  again  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  I'm  not  sure 

  

  

 

 

 

 

where  you  get  that  number.  As  I  look  at  it,  between 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2004  and  2006  ­­ '7,  it  nearly  doubled  from  3.6  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holistic  class  to  6.8.  For  Hispanic  students  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  blacks  ­­ it  went  from  11.6  to  16.9.  I  don't  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  ­­ that  small  a  change. 

   

 

 

 

            

In  2008,  two  ­­ 20  percent  of  all  black 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students  and  15  percent  of  all  Hispanic  students  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offered  admission  through  holistic  review.  Black  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Hispanic  admission  and  enrollment  rates  have  increased 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  2005.  This  is  on  ­­ on  holistic  review.  The  only 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception  was  2008,  and  that  was  because  92  percent  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  class  came  in  under  the  10  percent  plan.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  wait  a  minute.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

don't  understand  how  that  can  be.  If  the  2004  number 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  that  much  lower  than  the  2007  number,  race  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  some  input  in  that  fact  ­­ in  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  It  ­­ it  has  some  effect.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  UT  says.  They  haven't  measured,  and  say  they  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measure  the  effect.  You're  dealing  with  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

classes. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Could  I  ask  you  a 

   

  

 

 

 

different  question  now?  I  fear  something.  I  know  there 

    

    

 

 

 

 

is  an  educational  debate  on  the  benefits  and  costs  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  plan.  I  don't  want  to  get  into  that  debate, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  do  have  a  worry,  which  is:  If  you're  reading 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

proof  of  a  compelling  need,  or  proof  of  a  compelling 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

need,  will  any  holistic  review  ever  survive? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Because  as  I'm  reading  your  answer,  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowly  tailor,  schools  have  to  use  nonracial  means  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  it.  And  if  the  10  percent  plan  is  the  only  thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  achieves  a  greater  number  in  minorities,  won't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

every  school  have  to  use  a  10  percent  plan?

MR.  REIN:  We're  not,  certainly,  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

dictate  that  every  school  use  a  10  percent  plan,  nor  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  the  only  way  in  which  you  can  encourage  and  increase 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minority  enrollment.  So  I  ­­ I  don't  accept  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

premise. 

            

Strict  scrutiny  is  a  ­­ a  heavy  burden.  And 

   

   

  

 

 

 

the  purpose  of  strict  scrutiny  as  to  recognize  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

base  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  your  answer  is  yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

If  there's  no  other  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  No.  I  ­­

    

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ way  of  doing  it,  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  other  race­neutral  way  ­­ if  offering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scholarships,  which  this  university  did,  increasing 

 

 

 

 

 

outreach  to  minority  neighborhoods,  they  did  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  to  do  ­­ there's  a  list  of  about  six  or  eight 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  things  they  did  that  didn't  increase  the  admission 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  minorities. 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  There  are  many  other  things  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  do.  We're  not  trying  to  tell  them  how  to  run  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  clearly  one  of  the  things  they  could  do  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  in  the  PAI,  they  recognize  that  by  emphasizing,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  did  at  first,  the  two  essay  scores,  which  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strictly  composition,  grammar,  that  ­­ that  is  as

difficult  for  those  who  have  gone  through  an  inferior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secondary  program  to  excel. 

 

 

 

            

So  they  cut  that  score  to  three.  They  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cut  it  to  two.  They  could  ­­ they  could  take  measures 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  were  aimed  at  looking  at  potential  deficiencies  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initial  education  because  you  come  from  a  home  where

apply  equally  without  regard  to  race.

So  there  are  many  things  they  could  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  but  that's  exactly  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question,  I  think.  I  would  ­­ I  can  put  the  same 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

question  ­­ or  suppose  we  do  send  it  back  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  and,  put  in  more  evidence,  we  tell  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Suppose  we  did  that.  And  suppose  they  start  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic  plan  where  we  want  to  use  race  is  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  percent  of  the  holistic  area.  We  want  to  do  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  they're  using  the  chart  ­­ and  I've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen  the  chart  ­­ of  the  factors  that  are  one,  two, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three,  four,  five,  six,  seven,  eight,  nine,  ten,  eleven, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

twelve.  You  know,  using  that  chart.  I've  seen  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

chart.  And  at  the  bottom  of  the  chart  in  my  list  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  "race."  It  says  "race,"  r­a­c­e.

What  kind  of  evidence,  in  your  opinion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  they  or  anyone  else  with  any  roughly  similar  plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  in  that  would  show,  in  your  view,  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional? 

            

MR.  REIN:  Well,  I  mean,  you  have  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

example  of  Justice  Powell's  opinion  in  Bakke.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  that  if  you're  looking  at  the  whole  person  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  comparing  individuals  one  to  another  to  say  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  best  suit  the  educational  need  of  the  class,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  take  account  of  a  person's  race.  It's  part  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  exercise. 

 

 

 

            

You  don't  isolate  it,  because  if  you  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Bakke's  example,  he's  got  A  and  B,  two  minority 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  students,  and  C.  And  he  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

depending  where  the  class  stands  in  the  overall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

composition  of  this  learning  entity,  you  might  choose  A 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  one  circumstance;  vice  versa,  you  might  choose  B; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  sometimes  you'll  choose  C  without  regard  to  race. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  he's  looking  at  it  as  a  way  of  looking  at  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

totality  of  a  person,  all  of  their  achievements, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

academic  and  otherwise. 

 

 

            

So  you  ­­ so  Bakke's  systems  are  not  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  here,  nor  is  the  top  10  at  issue.  That's  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  accepted  in  this  case.  No  one  challenged  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I'm  saying  you  don't  have  to  do  the  top

But  I'm  looking  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  Justice  Breyer,  you  can  achieve 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  small  increment  of  under  3  percent,  in  our  view,  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  number  of  alternatives  that  would  ­­ would  ­­ would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  this  same  boost.  These  are  the  race  ­­ racially 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  neutral  alternatives. 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  have  one.  I  have  one. 

    

    

 

 

 

MR.  REIN:  But  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  you're  saying  is  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

should  look  at  the  two  folders,  and  as  a  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tiebreaker,  use  race.  That,  to  you,  is  okay. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  is  there  ­­ you  said  there  is  several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others?  It  would  be  helpful  if  you  ­­ if  you  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summarize  them  in  a  sentence,  so  I  get  an  idea  of  what 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  others  are. 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  You  could  ­­ you  could  give  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emphasis  to  the  socioeconomic  factors  in  the  school. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  not  to  use  race.

could  do  so  it  is  not  fatal  in  fact? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  And  what  I've  said  first  is  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  shape  their  system  more  toward  the  Bakke  system, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  move  toward  individualized  consideration.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

one  thing.  That's  not  fatal  in  fact,  because  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

endorsed  the  ­­ the  view  that  Justice  Powell  took  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Harvard  system  in  Bakke.  So  that's  one. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

They  could  expand  the  top  10.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

another  alternative.  That's  ­­ that's  available. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

They  could  ­­ as  I  said,  they  could  rescore 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  of  this  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  the  top  10,  you  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  doesn't  use  race.  Justice  Breyer  is  asking,  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes,  race  can  be  a  factor.  It  was  a  factor  in  Bakke. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  was  a  factor  in  Grutter.  And  so  far,  you're  saying 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  now  it  can  be  a  factor  only  if  what? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  we're  not  talking  about  so­called 

 

 

 

 

 

neutral  factors.  We're  talking  about  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  Well,  I  mean,  the  first  question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is,  you  know,  why  are  you  using  it?  The  why. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Therefore,  it  can  be  a  factor.  You  have  to  clarify  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective,  you  have  to  show  the  necessity,  and  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  show  that,  if  you,  as  ­­ as  they  do,  live  with  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept,  over  time,  a  very  small  increment  in  a  very 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

small  segment  of  the  class,  that  you  can't  get  it  done

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  ­­

    

 

MR.  REIN:  Because  race  is  not  the  baseline. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  an  odious  classification.  That's  where  we  differ. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  As  I  understand  what  you're 

   

  

 

 

 

saying,  the  Bakke  approach  ­­ comparing  two  individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  ­­ and,  where  they're  tied,  giving  a  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  to  one  for  race  ­­ that's  okay.  Regardless  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  there  are  any  other  means  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  No  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ of  achieving  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

racial  balance  that  you're  looking  for.  Right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  Well,  Justice  Powell  indicated  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Bakke  that  that  approach  could  be  used  where  it's  part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  greater  function  form  in  the  class. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  ­­

MR.  REIN:  That  is  correct. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Right? 

  

 

MR.  REIN:  And  it's  not  just  me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Scalia.  That's  what  this  Court  said  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior  opinion. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  what  I  thought. 

   

  

 

 

MR.  REIN:  They  had  ­­ it  has  to  be  shown  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  necessary. 

 

            

And  of  course,  that's  true  of  all  strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny.  And  the  Court  said  in  the  prior  opinion  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  other  strict  scrutiny  opinions,  such  as  Adarand, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  applicable  here.  This  is  not  detached.  It's  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different. 

            

Strict  scrutiny  is  a  heavy  burden.  There's 

   

  

 

 

 

no  question  about  it.  That's  why  it's  strict  scrutiny. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  there  any  evidence  that

get  the  number  up,  it's  certainly  number­driven. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  you  look  at  ­­ one  thing  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  Grutter,  you  have  to  have  a  basis  to  review 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  because  you  would  like  to  make  it  end.  There  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  an  end  point.  So  in  ­­ if  you  can't  find  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectives,  you  have  no  endpoint. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  more  important,  you  look  at  what  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  looking  at.  What  are  they  measuring  each  year? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  they're  measuring  numbers.  They  want  those  numbers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  go  up.  That's  what  they  care  about.  That's  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  system  does. 

 

 

            

So  whether  it's  a  quota  in  the  strict  sense, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  wit,  we  have  a  ­­ a  definite  target,  their  target  may 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  equating  with  the  population  ­­ the  high  school 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

population.  I  mean,  today  they're  a  majority­minority 

    

   

 

 

campus,  the  real  world.  They've  ­­ they've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

gone  because  ­­ just  because  of  the  ­­ the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demographics  of  high  school. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Rein,  because  your 

  

 

 

 

 

time  is  running  out,  there  is  one  preliminary  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd  like  you  to  address,  and  that  is:  What  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief  you're  seeking?  I  take  it  not  injunctive, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

because  Ms.  Fisher  has  graduated. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  Correct.

So  what  ­­ what  specific  relief  are  you  seeking  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

MR.  REIN:  This  case  started  with  a  plea  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

damages.  The  damages  plea  is  live.  It  has  never  been 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenged. 

            

consist  of? 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  what  do  the  damages 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  REIN:  They  were  ­­ the  damages 

  

 

 

 

 

 

consisted  of  a  ­­ a  refund  of  the  unjustly­committed  fee 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

for  application.  That  was  the  direct  ­­ one  specified 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application.  We  also  asked  for  other  just  and  further 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief,  because  at  that  point  of  the  case,  we  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  anything  for  certain;  to  wit,  if  she  was  admitted, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  be  one  thing.  If  she  wasn't  ­­ weren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted,  there  would  be  other  damages  arising  from  her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure  to  be  admitted.  And  we  realized  that  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  issue.  We  reserved  on  it.  We  ­­ we've  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  the  ­­ if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

university  should  say,  okay,  the  application  fee  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  else  we  add  to  that,  we  ­­ we  offer  that  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  contest  will  be  over;  if  they  offered  you  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages  that  you  are  seeking,  would  the  case  become 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moot? 

            

MR.  REIN:  No.  And  the  reason  is  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

damages  we  are  seeking  were  broader  than  that.  That  was

what  are  the  broader?  You  gave  me  the  application  fee. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

MR.  REIN:  Well,  now,  Ms.  Fisher  has  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been  admitted,  and  that  she  has  suffered  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences  of  nonadmission,  which  include  she  went  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  alternative  university;  she  had  to  travel  as  opposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  being  in  her  home  State.  There  is  certainly  good 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  that  within  the  State  of  Texas,  a  degree 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  University  of  Texas  has  consequences  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earnings  down  the  road,  and  that's  measurable.  And  she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  that  benefit. 

 

 

 

            

All  of  those  elements,  which  were  not  part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  case  originally,  because  we  were  trying  to  enjoin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  way  that  would  have  her  admitted,  now  she's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted.  That  changes  the  complexion  of  the  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  why  we  bifurcated  ­­ that's  why  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reserved  the  right  to  amend  within  our  broader  plea  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  other  just  and  relief. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  terms  of  just  standing,  we  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing  claim.  They  haven't  paid  us.  They  threatened

I'd  like  to  focus  on  three  things.  One,  why  the  record 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supports  the  Texas  legislature's  conclusion  in  2009  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  holistic  plan  at  issue  was  a  necessary  complement  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State's  Top  10  Percent  Law;  two,  why  the  record 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shows  that  Texas's  holistic  policy  has  had  a  meaningful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact  on  diversity  at  the  University  of  Texas;  and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three,  why  the  record  absolutely  forecloses  any  claim

that  University  of  Texas  has  adopted  a  quota. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  the  first  question  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessity,  there  are  three  principle  ways  in  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  shows  that  the  plan  at  issue  was  a  necessary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complement.  First,  as  Justice  Breyer  mentioned,  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  significant  portion  of  the  admissions  pool,  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

out­of­State  students,  all  students  from  Texas  high 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schools  that  don't  rank,  some  of  the  best  high  schools 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  State,  and  all  students  just  below  the  top  10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  who  are  nevertheless  great  students  who  aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  for  admission  under  the  top  10  percent  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  Fifth  Circuit  found  that  without  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration  of  race  in  the  mix  for  those  students, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admissions 
 

would  approach  an  all  white  enterprise. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Secondly,  the  record  in  this  case  shows  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Excuse  me.  Just  the 

  

  

 

 

 

admissions 
 

of  people  beyond  the  top  10  percent? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  That's  right,  which  is  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

important  component  of  the  class,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  ­­

 

            

Second,  and  I  think  this  goes  to  your  point, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  on  that  point,  can  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine  which  of  the  holistic  admittees  would  not  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  admitted  if  race  was  not  added  to  the  ­­ to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination?

MR.  GARRE:  Okay.  This  goes  to  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

meaningful  impact  point,  and  I  think  there  are  several 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways  to  address  it,  Justice  Alito. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  what  you  can  do  is  you  can  look  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  increase  in  African­American  and  Hispanic  holistic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admissions  after  the  consideration  of  race  was  added. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  what  you  find  is,  is  that  in  each  year,  2005,  2006, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2007,  the  percentage  of  African­American  and  Hispanics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted  and  enrolled  under  the  holistic  plan  grew.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  there  was  a  70  percent  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  That's  not  really  my 

  

 

 

 

 

question.  My  question  was  if  you  look  at  an  individual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person,  can  you  tell  whether  that  person  was  admitted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  ­­ solely  because  of  race?  Whether  that  person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  have  been  admitted  were  it  not  for  the  fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  person  was  an  African­American  or  Hispanic? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Your  Honor,  I  think,  given  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

contextualized  and  individualized  nature  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry,  that's  going  to  be  difficult.  But  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  nevertheless  answers  your  question  because  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  show  a  marked  increase  in  diversity  under  the  plan 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  issue.  I  just  ­­ I've  just  explained  to  you  how  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  confirms  that  holistic  admissions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

African­Americans  and  Hispanics  increased  markedly  in 

 

 

 

 

 

each  year.

If  you  look  at  student  body  diversity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overall,  African­American  enrollment  increased  by  two, 

 

 

 

 

 

doubled  from  2002  to  2008  from  about  3  percent  to  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  percent. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  ­­ one  of  the  things  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  troubling  about  your  argument  is  the  suggestion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  is  something  deficient  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  students  and  the  Hispanic  students  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  admitted  under  the  top  10  percent  plan.  They're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dynamic.  They're  not  leaders.  They're  not  change 

  

  

 

 

 

 

agents.  And  I  don't  know  what  the  basis  for  that  is. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GARRE:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It's  ­­ really  it's  based  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  terrible  stereotyping  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

that  ­­

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Your  Honor,  it's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  is  the  basis  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  GARRE:  It's  exactly  the  opposite.  This 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Court  has  said  time  and  again  that  you  can't  assume  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minorities  think  alike  just  because  they  have  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

skin  color.  What  the  University  of  Texas  does  is  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considers  ­­ it  takes  into  account  the  fact  that  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  come  from  different  experiences,  different 

 

 

 

 

 

backgrounds  are  going  to  have  different  contributions  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  class.  If  you  had  the  situation  where  all  the

out­of­State  admits  from  other  parts  of  the  country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  would  want  the  ­­ both  perspectives. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  ­­ maybe  I 

  

 

 

 

 

misapprehended  either  the  question  or  the  answer.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  the  one  that  says  race  can  be  relevant.  And  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  answer  to  Justice  Alito's  question,  you  say,  oh, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  stereotyping.  It  seems  to  me  that  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent. 

            

MR.  GARRE:  No.  What  stereotyping,  Your 

  

  

 

 

 

Honor,  is  saying,  that  just  because  you  get  a  sufficient 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  blacks  or  Hispanics  under  the  10  percent  plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  that  you  can't  look  at  the  class  holistically  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  we're  not  getting  a  variety  of  perspectives  among 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­Americans  or  Hispanics. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yeah.  But  what  is  the  basis 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  saying  that?  That's  what  I  don't  understand.  It's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

kind  of  the  assumption  that  if  the  ­­ if  a  student  ­­ if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  black  student  or  a  Hispanic  student  is  admitted  as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  top  10  percent  plan,  it  has  to  be  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  student  didn't  have  to  compete  against  very  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whites  and  ­­ and  Asians.  In  ­­ in  the  high  school 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class,  it's  a  really  pernicious  stereotype.

MR.  GARRE:  It's  ­­ it's  not  a  stereotype  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

all,  Your  Honor.  It's  based  on  the  undeniable  fact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  manner  in  which  the  top  10  percent  plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operates.  The  Top  10  Percent  Law  was  enacted  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  to  Hopwood,  and  there's  nothing  ­­ there's  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  to  the  law  in  this  case  that  admits  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well­deserving  students.  But  the  fact  is,  is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  way  that  the  Top  10  Percent  Law  admits  minority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students  is  by  admitting  those  students  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower­performing,  racially  identifiable  schools. 

 

 

 

            

And  the  way  ­­ the  reason  we  know  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  if  you  look  at  the  bill  analysis  decided  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg  in  her  dissent  the  last  time  we  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  that  analysis  specifically  says  on  page  4, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Because  of  the  persistence  of  segregation  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State,  minority  students  will  be  admitted  under  the  top 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  plan." 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  don't  doubt  that  that  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  the  things  that  it  does,  and  I  would  have  thought 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  would  be  something  that  you  would  regard  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficial. 

            

            

MR.  GARRE:  We  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Wasn't  that  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reason  for  adopting  affirmative  action  in  the  first

the  things  that  it  does,  but  it's  not  the  only  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  does. 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Your  Honor,  the  University  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  applauds  those  students.  It  wants  those  students. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Those  students  are  admitted  through  holistic  review  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well.  Nevertheless,  the  University  can  look  at  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

incoming  class  and  determine  that  not  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perspectives  among  a  particular  class  of  students  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

being  represented.  This  is  straight  out  of  the  Harvard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  in  Bakke  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  This  is  a  statistic  that 

   

  

 

 

 

jumped  out  at  me,  which  it  seems  to  me  contrary  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stereotype  on  which  the  Fifth  Circuit  panel  proceeds  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  which  you  proceed.  Of  the  African­American  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hispanic  students  who  were  admitted  under  the  top  10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent  plan,  21  percent  had  parents  who  had  either  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bachelor's  degree  or  a  four­year  degree.  And  for  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

holistic  admittees,  African­Americans  and  Hispanics, 

 

 

 

 

it's  26  percent.  This  is  from  a  Class  of  2008.

African­American,  Hispanic  students,  coming  in  through 

 

 

 

 

 

the  holistic  plan  versus  the  top  10  percent  plan.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  no  surprise,  given  the  obvious  purpose  of  the  top 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  plan.  The  purpose  of  the  holistic  review

Fisher  I.  The  first  phrase  says  this:  "The  decision  to

of  people  who  don't  agree  necessarily  on  affirmative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action.  Generally  we  agreed  on  those  words. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Words  1:  "The  decision  to  pursue  the

provide  a,  quote,  "reasoned,  principled  explanation  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  academic  decision  to  pursue  diversity."  Your  plan 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  pursuing  diversity  among  the  25  percent  who  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted  under  the  Top  10  Plan. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Your  principled,  reasoned  explanation  for 

 

 

 

 

that  academic  decision  is? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Your  Honor,  it's  set  forth  in

Let  me  give  you  some  ­­ a  few  pieces  of  that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Number  one  is,  is  the  University  made  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  pursuing  the  educational  benefits  of  diversity  in

This  is  on  pages  1  through  3  of  the  Supplemental  Joint

were  necessary  to  make  sure  that  it  was  achieving  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

educational  objectives. 

 

            

All  of  that  is  laid  out  in  far  more  detail, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frankly,  than  it  was  in  Grutter  or  that  it  was  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Harvard  plan.  It's  amplified  by  the  deposition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

testimony.  In  particular,  look  at  the  testimony  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Iship  and  Mr.  Walker.  And  I  can  elaborate  that  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  you're  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

about  the  2004  plan? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GARRE:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Excuse  me.  One  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  things  that  it  said  is  that  you  would  review  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  every  five  years.  Has  that  happened? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  It  absolutely  has.  We  ­­ in  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  Your  Honor,  it's  established  that  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reviewed  it  on  an  annual  basis.  We  reviewed  it  on  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five­year  basis.  I  was  personally  involved  in  part  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  did  you

are. 

            

MR.  GARRE:  And  look  at  the  facts,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  In  2002,  you  had  272  African­American  enrollees 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  a  class  of  8,000.  Even  Judge  Garza  recognized  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

note  11  of  his  decision  that  the  University  of  Texas  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  achieved  its  critical  mass  or  educational  benefits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  2004.  So  I  don't  think  that  that  seriously  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

debatable.  If  it  is,  then  we  should  have  a  remand  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  opportunity  to  put  in  more  evidence  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  you're  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

about  the  time  ­­ Grutter  said  that  we  did  not  expect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  sorts  of  programs  to  be  around  in  25  years,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  12  ­­ 12  years  ago.  Are  ­­ are  we  going  to  hit 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  deadline?  Is  this  going  to  be  done  on  ­­ in  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  in  12  years? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Your  Honor,  I'm  not  here  to  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  a  date,  but  what  I  would  say  is  this:  There  are 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

systematic  problems  that  these  problems  ­­ that  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policies  are  attempting  to  address,  including  the  test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

score  gap  between  ­­ between  African­Americans  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hispanics.  And  ­­ and  the  record  in  this  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overwhelmingly  shows  that  without  the  addition  of  race, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

student  body  diversity  suffered,  particularly  among 

 

 

 

 

 

African­Americans.

don't  know  whether  that's  a  yes  or  no.  But  it  was

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ course. 

  

 

 

 

            

And  so  it  was  important  in  Grutter  to  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look,  this  can't  go  on  forever,  25  years.  And  when  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  think  your  program  will  be  done? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Your  Honor,  as  soon  as  we  ­­ we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  achieve  the  same  ­­ sufficient  numbers  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

educational  benefits  of  diversity  without  taking  race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  account,  we  will  no  longer  take  race  into  account. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  strict­scrutiny  inquiry  focuses  on 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  there  are  race­neutral  alternatives, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  I  think  really  is  the  way  to  police  this.  And  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  because  it's  backward­looking,  you  look  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  the  University  policies  in  place  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seven  years  ­­ this  is  a  distinct  case.  You  have  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  of  seven  years  of  trying  the  race­neutral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternatives  that  they're  proposing,  top  10  percent, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plus  race­blind  holistic  review.  And  the  record  tells 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  what  happened.

MR.  GARRE:  University  of  Texas  does  not  do

But  if  you  look  at  what  happened  ­­ and  this

­­ I  don't  think  it's  debatable  that  student  body 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversity  suffered  at  the  University  of  Texas  under  the

in  particular  under  African­Americans  where  you  had

I  can  tell,  to  measure  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Let  me  answer  that  in  two  ways. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One,  doubling  the  enrollment  of  African­American 

 

 

 

 

 

students,  which  happened  from  2002  to  2008,  is  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase  diversity  in  the  classroom.  And  we've  looked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  that,  and  it  has. 

 

 

 

 

            

Secondly,  with  respect  to  diversity  among 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  majors,  University  does  take  holistic 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration  of  where  ­­ which  schools  students  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted  to  as  well.  So  its  policy  addresses  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern  as  well. 

 

 

            

But  what  the  record  does  show,  Your  Honor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusively,  I  think,  is  that  diversity  languished  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  University  of  Texas  in  the  period  where  we  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race­blind  holistic  admissions  plus  the  top  10  percent, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  the  plan  at  issue  here  was  necessary  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplement  that.  The  Texas  legislature  found  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  I  don't  ­­ you  could 

   

  

 

 

 

 

have  determined  whether  this  is  ­­ whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admission  ­­ the  addition  of  race  to  the  holistic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equation  has  done  anything  to  increase  classroom 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversity. 

            

MR.  GARRE:  It  has. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  you  haven't  done  that.

that,  in  part,  in  the  five­year  analysis  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  No.  As  ­­ as  comparing, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

this  goes  back  to  your  ­­ your  underlying  claim  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  something  deficient  about  the  top  10  admittees, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  ­­ maybe  ­­ if  you  have  ­­ do  you  have  evidence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  are  less  likely  to  ­­ to  enroll  in  the  classes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there's  a  lack  of  classroom  diversity  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  There's  a  different  breakdown 

   

  

 

 

there,  Your  Honor.  But  I  think  there's  two  dimensions 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  this  diversity  issue.  One  is  just  the  glaring  racial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isolation  that  existed,  particularly  among 

 

 

 

 

African­Americans. 

            

And  then  two  is  an  effort,  through  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addition  of  holistic  review,  to  admit  minorities  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  viewpoints,  experiences,  and  perspectives. 

 

 

 

 

That  gets  back  right  to  the  core  of  the  essence  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversity  embraced  by  this  Court  in  Bakke. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  look  at  the  Harvard  brief  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bakke  case,  page  17,  it  specifically  says,  "Our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  in  the  educational  benefits  of  diversity  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  met  if  all  of  minority  students  were  ­­ were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coming  from  depressed  socioeconomic  backgrounds." 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I  ­­ but  that's  where 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I'm  looking  for  evidence  that  that's  true.

for,  students  who  are  leaders. 

 

 

 

 

            

At  ­­ do  you  say,  well,  there  are  ­­ there

MR.  GARRE:  I  don't  think  it's  ­­ it's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

seriously  debatable,  but  if  we  need  evidence  on  this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let  us  put  it  into  the  record  that  a  class  selected  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  holistic  consideration  of  numerous  factors  is  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  more  diverse  in  a  way  that  promotes  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

University's  educational  interests  than  a  class  selected 

   

 

 

 

 

by  a  single  factor. 

   

 

            

            

And  let  me  give  you  the  deposition  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

not  ­­ that's  not  the  question.  It's  whether  students

MR.  GARRE:  And  there's  two  problems  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that.  One,  they're  not  ­­ minority  students  are  not

And  then  the  second  ­­

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Wait.  What  are  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

telling  me?  The  holistic  process,  if  race  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressly  considered,  will  not  result  in  any  minority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students? 

            

MR.  GARRE:  No.  It's  not  zero,  Your  Honor. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

But  take  2002  for  example.  272  African­Americans  out  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  class  of  8,000.  That's  glaring  racial  isolation. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

University  of  Texas  concluded  that  was  unacceptable. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  don't  think  that  that's  seriously  debatable. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  again,  if  we  need  more  evidence  on  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  90  percent  of  our  classrooms  of  the  most  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

size  was  zero  or  one  African­American  doesn't  achieve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  educational  objectives  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what  unique 

  

 

 

 

 

 

­­ what  unique  perspective  does  a  minority  student  bring 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  physics  class? 

   

 

            

            

MR.  GARRE:  Your  Honor  ­­

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You're  counting 

  

 

 

 

those  among  the  classes  in  which  there  are  no  minority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students.  And  I'm  just  wondering  what  the  benefits  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversity  are  in  that  situation?

diversity,  Your  Honor,  if  that's  what  you're  focused  on,

the  University  is  being  hit  by  both  sides  here.  Maybe 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  fair  because  of  the  nature  of  strict  scrutiny.

prove  the  way  in  which  diversity  was  lacking  with

MR.  GARRE:  Justice  Kennedy,  I  didn't  want 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  ­­ I  was  going  to  ask: 

    

   

 

 

 

 

What  evidence  would  you  have  put  in  if  you  had  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful  in  your  motion  to  remand? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  preliminary  to  that,  I  assume  that 

   

 

 

 

 

district  court  would  have  had  authority  to  remand  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  allow  the  summary  judgment  record  to  be  expanded  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reopened? 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  the  court  of  appeals  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  had  authority  in  our  view.  The  district  court  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  this  case  is  on  ­­ here  on  summary  judgment.  I

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  understand.  But  ­­ but 

    

  

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  ­­ but  ­­ but  why  did  you  want  a  remand?  Because 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  wanted  to  expand  the  summary  judgment  record?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  so,  what  additional  evidence  would  you  have  put  in?

MR.  GARRE:  Sure.  If  there  are  any 

  

  

 

 

 

 

shortcomings  that  this  Court  sees,  certainly  what  ­­ if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ if  you  feel  that  there  are  deficiencies  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  on  a  more  granular  basis  between  the  nature  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  holistic  admits  that  are  admitted,  the  unique 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

skills,  qualities,  talents  that  those  admits  bring  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  agents  and  bridge  builders,  we  can  put  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  in.  We  can  put  in  additional  evidence. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you  ­­ but  you  asked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  remand  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GARRE:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ and  my  question  was: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

What  evidence  did  you  propose  to  put  in  if  your  motion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  been  granted? 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Your  Honor,  we  didn't  ­­ we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  ­­ we  specifically  pointed  to  evidence  on  standing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we  talked  about  that,  if  the  Court  would  like  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplement  the  evidence  in  other  respects.  And  I  ­­ and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think,  frankly,  we  would  be  entitled  to  a  remand. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  look  at  the  Grutter  case,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  this  Court  rejected  the  argument  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage  plan  was  an  adequate  substitute  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holistic  consideration  of  race.  It  didn't  require 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary  findings  on  that.  But  if  the  Court  thinks 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  findings  are  necessary,  then  the  University  of

pointing  to,  and  you're  sort  of  talking  past  each  other.

was  that,  particularly  as  the  top  10  percent  plan  began 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  grow  and  crowd  out  more  of  the  admissions  pool,  the

did.  The  Texas  Court  of  Appeals  judge  and  his  colleague 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did.  And  all  ­­ what  all  of  them  recognized  is  the

the  top  10  percent  plan,  but  you  did  have  the  program 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you're  advocating  for  here,  the  holistic  review, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  you  have  a  better  or  worse  chance  of  achieving  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversity  you  seek? 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Your  Honor,  I  ­­ I  think  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

first  thing  I  would  like  to  say  is  that  it's  a  different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  And  I  don't  mean  to  dodge  the  question  by  that.

But  what  I  would  say  is,  if  ­­ if  that's  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningful  difference,  then  this  plan  is  ­­ is  in  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  stronger  light  than  the  plan  in  Bakke  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Harvard  plan.  Because  the  University  of  Texas  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

heeded  this  Court's  message.  It's  taken  three­quarters 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  class  that  it  selects  through  a  facially 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

race­neutral  system,  the  Top  10  Percent  Law.  And  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  here  debating  is  whether  or  not  it  can  complement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  policy  by  taking  race  into  account  for  a  quarter. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  it  may  actually  be  that  the  university 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  achieve  more  diversity  through  the  pure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grutter­Bakke­style  plan,  but  we  think,  working  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  legislature,  we've  come  up  with  a  hydrid  ­­ hybrid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  that  works  together  to  both  ­­ to  both  address  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  concerns  about  using  race  too  much  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process,  and  addressing  University  of  Texas's 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate,  core  academic  concerns  about  compiling  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  that's  diverse  in  all  the  ways  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appreciated  by  Bakke. 

 

 

            

If  I  could  read  one  aspect  of  the  deposition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  here.  This  is  from  Ms.  Ishop  on  page  253a  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Joint  Appendix,  and  she  explains  why  top  10  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alone  is  not  sufficient. 

 

 

 

            

What  she  says  is,  quote,  "Considering  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant  on  the  basis  of  just  their  test  score  and

class  rank  leaves  out  all  of  that  life  experience  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstantial  experience  that  an  applicant  faces.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

also  important  not  ­­ not  only  to  how  they  developed  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  type  of  student  they  are,  but  also  to  what  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contribute  to  our  campus."  That's  what  the  holistic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  adds. 

 

            

If  you  exclude  race  from  that  mix,  you  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  aren't  looking  at  the  individual  in  all  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respects  ­­ and  race  still  does  matter  in  Austin  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across  this  country  ­­ but  you're  ­­ you're  preventing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  university  from  rounding  out  its  class  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complementing  the  single­minded  way  that  the  Top  10

that  is  narrowly  tailored  to  its  interests,  which  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  found  compelling. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  all  of  the  colloquy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

so  far  indicates  to  me  that,  if  you  had  a  remand,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  have  put  in  much  different  or  much  more

MR.  GARRE:  Well  ­­

MR.  GARRE:  No,  it's  not,  Your  Honor.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  look,  we  think  that  the  record  is  sufficient.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  the  Fifth  Circuit  got  it  right.

But  ­­ but  to  be  clear,  we  can  certainly  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  plenty  of  additional  evidence.  I  mean,  there  was  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  in  Grutter,  as  Your  Honor  pointed  out  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  in  Fisher  I.  There's  been  no  trial  here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is,  at  a  minimum  ­­ if  ­­ if  ­­ if  our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  doesn't  cross  the  bar  on  strict  scrutiny,  at  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum,  we  put  in  triable  issues  of  fact  on  whether  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  holistic  plan  was  a  necessary  offset,  whether  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  university  was  achieving  its  educational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectives  in  an  environment  in  which  you  had  272 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  students  enroll  out  of  an  incoming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  of  8,000,  an  environment  in  which  90  percent  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  classrooms  had  ­­ the  most  common  side  had  zero  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  why  can't  we  make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

those  inferences  from  the  record?  I  mean,  if  ­­ if  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  a  trial,  you'd  have  credibility.  You'd  have  experts 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  so  forth  ­­

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  think  you  can 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

make  those  going  in  the  university's  favor.  And  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect  of  that,  frankly,  is  the  two­court  rule  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  usually  applies.  Both  the  district  court  and  the

what  you're  saying. 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  GARRE:  Well,  I  mean,  I  don't  want  to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

be  result­oriented  about  this,  Your  Honor.  But  ­­ but  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  think  that  ­­ that  it's  one  thing  to  say  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  there  are  no  triable  facts,  where  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  below  have  gone  that  way.  It's  another  thing  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second­guess.  And  ­­ and  the  Court  can.  It's  a  summary 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  issue.  But  it's  another  thing,  I  think,  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

overstep  the  conclusions  of  the  district  court  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  of  appeals  here. 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  I  think  it's  particularly 

   

 

 

 

 

relevant  here  when  it  comes  to  the  operation  of  the  Top 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  Percent  Law.  Our  friends  have  challenged  the  fact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Fifth  Circuit  discussed  the  way  in  which  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operated,  saying  that  that's  outside  the  record.  If  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  let  us  put  all  that  evidence  directly  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record.  But  they've  never  disputed  the  way  in  which  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Top  10  Percent  Law  operates. 

 

 

 

 

            

What  ­­ what  I'd  like  to  say  too  is,  if  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  rules  that  University  of  Texas  can't  consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race,  or  if  it  rules  that  universities  that  consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race  have  to  die  a  death  of  a  thousand  cuts  for  doing 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so,  we  know  exactly  what's  going  to  happen.  Experience 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells  us  that.

University  ­­ this  happened  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

University  of  Texas  after  the  Hopwood  case:  Diversity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

plummeted,  especially  among  African­Americans. 

 

 

 

Diversity  plummeted  at  selective  institutions  in 

 

 

 

 

 

California,  Berkeley,  and  UCLA,  after  Prop  209.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  exactly  what's  taking  place  today  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

University  of  Michigan. 

 

 

            

Now  is  not  the  time,  and  this  is  certainly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  case  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  There  are  ­­ there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

those  who  contend  that  it  does  not  benefit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­Americans  to  ­­ to  get  them  into  the  University 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Texas  where  they  do  not  do  well,  as  opposed  to  having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  go  to  a  less­advanced  school,  a  less  ­­ a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

slower­track  school  where  they  do  well.  One  of  ­­ one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  briefs  pointed  out  that  ­­ that  most  of  the  ­­

schools  where  they  do  not  feel  that  they're  ­­ that

the  fact  that  ­­ that  the  University  of  Texas  may  have

really  competent  blacks  admitted  to  lesser  schools, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turns  out  to  be  less.  And  ­­ and  I  ­­ I  don't  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ it  ­­ it  stands  to  reason  that  it's  a  good  thing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  University  of  Texas  to  admit  as  many  blacks  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible.  I  just  don't  think  ­­

    

 

 

 

            

MR.  GARRE:  This  Court  heard  and  rejected 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  argument,  with  respect,  Justice  Scalia,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grutter  case,  a  case  that  our  opponents  haven't  asked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  to  overrule.  If  you  look  at  the  academic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performance  of  holistic  minority  admits  versus  the  top 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  percent  admits,  over  time,  they  ­­ they  fare  better. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And,  frankly,  I  don't  think  the  solution  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  problems  with  student  body  diversity  can  be  to  set 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  a  system  in  which  not  only  are  minorities  going  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate  schools,  they're  going  to  inferior  schools.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  what  experience  shows,  at  Texas,  California,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Michigan,  is  that  now  is  not  the  time  and  this  is  not

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

I'd  like  to  make  a  point  about  the 

   

 

 

 

compelling­interest  inquiry  in  light  of  what  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  previously  in  Fisher,  and  then  I'd  like  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  about  the  process  aspect  of  the  narrow­tailoring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry  in  light  of  what  this  Court  said  in  Fisher, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  I  believe  Justice  Kennedy  will  address  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

concerns  about  whether  race  is  determinative  here.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  I'd  like  to  move  on  to  what  I  think  this  case  comes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down  to,  which  is  whether  the  University  has  made  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficient  showing  of  need  to  consider  race  in  ­­ in  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process. 

            

But  before  I  make  any  of  those  points,  Mr. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Justice,  I  ­­ I  can  provide  some  specific  detail 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  response  to  the  question  you  asked  earlier  related  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  parents­involved  point. 

 

 

            

Here  are  the  numbers.  With  respect  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  students  admitted  through  the  holistic 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  program,  in  2004,  which  was  the  last  year 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  race  was  expressly  considered,  that  number  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

141  admitted  through  that  number.  And  that  was  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

high­water  mark,  really,  of  the  period  of  ­­ of  holistic

the  ­­ this  is  in  addition  to  the  10  percent? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Correct.  This  is  just 

  

  

 

 

 

the  holistic  numbers. 

 

 

            

That  number  then  moves  up  to  176  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  year,  to  220  the  year  after,  and  to  262  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2007.  So  the  number  of  holistic  admissions  almost 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubles,  and  that  results  in  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  the  problem,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

guess,  which  is  one  issue  that  we  haven't  looked  at  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  do  you  tell  how  many  of  those  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ would  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

admitted  if  their  race  were  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  You're  right  ­­ you're 

  

 

 

 

 

right  that  you  can't  tell  for  sure,  but  you  do  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty  good  benchmark,  I  think,  given  that  you  have  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  years  without  considering  race  where  141  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  high­water  mark.  And  so  I  do  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  wait  a  minute.  The 

   

  

  

 

 

next  two  years  you  recited  it  was  going  up,  even  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race  was  considered. 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Right.

there  ­­ there  is  a  fluctuation  before  then,  when  race 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  considered.  That  might  have  gone  up,  too. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  it  went  ­­ before 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  started  considering  race,  it  went  up  and  down, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frankly.  But  141  was  the  high­water  mark.  There  wasn't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  consistent  trajectory  in  those  numbers. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  there's  an  aspect  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  holistic  review  process  done  at  the  University  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  which  may  militate  against  the  admission  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  and  Hispanic  students  for  a  ­­ an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

ostensibly  race­neutral  reason,  and  that  is,  that  as  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  it,  standardized  test  scores  count  pretty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heavily  in  that  process. 

 

 

 

            

One  of  the  things  the  University  says  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  for  is  students  with  high  SAT  scores  who  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  top  10  percent  of  their  class.  And  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  who  think  that  SAT  scores  and  ACT  scores  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culturally  biased.  So  if  you  put  less  emphasis  on  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  might  not  have  the  numbers  that  you  just  recited. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well,  it's  rather  strange  that  we  ­­ we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construct  the  process  that  may  disadvantage 

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  and  Hispanic  students  for  an  ostensibly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race­neutral  reason.  So  then  we  have  to  add  race  in  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  special  factor  to  counteract  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  It's  ­­ or  I  guess  what

I'd  say  about  that,  Your  Honor,  is  that  in  Grutter,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  specifically  held  was  that  the  University  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  to  make  those  kinds  of  judgments  in  seeking  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advance  multiple  objectives  to  maintain  an  academic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

environment  of  excellence,  and  to  diversify  the  student 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

body,  both. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  thought  the  ­­ I  thought 

    

   

 

 

 

the  record  showed  the  top  ten  admittees  have  a  higher 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grade  point  average  than  the  holistic  African­American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Hispanic  admittees. 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  the  ­­ the  SAT 

  

 

 

 

 

 

scores  are  about  the  same.  I'm  not  sure  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

to  ­­

 

            

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But,  I  mean,  once  they  get 

   

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  But  I  guess  ­­

is  supposed  to  predict  how  you  are  going  to  do  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

college.  And  I  thought  the  record  showed  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

students  who  have  lower  SAT  scores  but  did  better  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ by  measure  by  high  school  rank  did  better  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

University  of  Texas;  isn't  that  ­­ isn't  that  the  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  I  ­­ I'm  not  sure  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  answer  to  that  is,  Your  Honor,  but  this  all  goes  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  compelling­interest  inquiry,  and  let  me  focus  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.

What  the  ­­ what  the  Court  said  last  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around  is  to  satisfy  the  compelling­interest  inquiry, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  University  has  got  to  articulate  a  reasoned, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

principled  explanation  for  its  decision  to  consider  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

educational  benefits  of  diversity  in  a  matter  that  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  found  to  be  constitutional  and  substantial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  University  of  Texas  has  met  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  has  articulated  exactly  the  same  educational 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits  of  diversity  at  exactly  the  same  level  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specificity  that  this  Court  held  constituted  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelling  interest  in  the  Grutter  case  at  page  330. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  exactly  the  same. 

 

 

 

            

And  the  ­­ the  principal  argument  that  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend  Mr.  Rein  makes  in  challenging  that  is,  well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  a  lot  of  that  is  post  hoc  rationalization,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular,  the  effort  to  find  whether  you  call  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualitative  diversity,  diversity  within  diversity  is  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

post  hoc  rationalization,  that  is  simply  not  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  look  at  page  1  of  the  Supplemental 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Joint  Appendix,  the  first  page  of  the  2004  Proposal,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

University  specifically  says  that  what  it's  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accomplish  is  to  create  a  diversity  of  perspectives 

   

 

 

 

 

 

among  minority  students.  It  says  it  again  at  page  28  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  proposal.  The  Director  of  Admissions  Declaration, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

page  43  of  the  Joint  Appendix,  says  it  ­­ it  says  it

throughout.  So  that  there's  no  ­­ there's  just  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  it's  a  post  hoc  rationalization. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Mr.  Verrilli,  do  you  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  all  of  this  won't  be  necessary  in  another  13

disadvantaging  some  applicants  because  of  their  race. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  What  I  think  about  that 

   

  

 

 

 

is  that  the  ­­ the  Court,  I  think,  made  a  prediction 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  Grutter  that  that  would  hopefully  be  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  think  that's  a  ­­ that's

that  we  can  stop  classifying  people  by  race? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  think 

    

   

   

  

 

the  universities  do  make  progress  on  this,  and  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  do  get  to  a  point  where  you  create  a  virtuous  cycle.

reason  to  ­­ to  believe  that  it  does  work.  And  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  key  point  here  with  respect  to  compelling  interests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  this  really  is  ­­ in  ­­ in  terms  of  having  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

educational  benefits  diversity,  that's  in  the  heartland 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  what  the  Court  has  said,  is  the  area  in  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

University's  expertise  and  experience  deserves 

 

 

 

 

deference. 

            

Now,  if  I  could  go  to  the  process  point, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Just  before,  you  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  ­­ I  agreed  with  you,  of  course,  that  is  what  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said,  the  reasoned  explanation.  And  it  also  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  a  matter  to  which  this  Court  will  give 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some,  but  not  complete,  deference  to  what  the  University 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides.  What  you're  talking  about  is  the  need  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program. 

            

In  addition  to  that  ­­ and  this  is  what  I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  you  to  focus  on,  because  there  could  be  a  question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  whether  to  send  it  back  for  more  evidence  or  not.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  looking  through  the  record  so  far,  on  this  specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  I  found  an  affidavit  by  a  person  named  Walker, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  person  named  Walker  described  seven  years  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

efforts  to  measure  this  stuff;  described  meetings  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

faculties;  described  all  kinds  of  discussions;  described 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusions  of  the  faculty  members,  and  the  admissions

Now,  given  that  that's  there,  and  I  found

something  that  you  should  put  in  as  well.  You  may  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  help  to  put  something  in.  You  may  think  it's

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yeah  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Is  that  affidavit  the 

  

 

 

 

 

relevant  one?  Are  there  others? 

  

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yeah.  I  think  ­­ I 

    

  

 

 

 

believe  that's  the  affidavit  from  the  director  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admissions.  And  it  is  highly  relevant,  and  there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  information.  In  the  latter  part  of  our  brief,  we

for  affirmance.  We  think  it's  sufficient.  But  if  there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  doubt,  I  do  think  the  additional  kind  of  information 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  might  be  developed  in  this  case  would  be  to  look  at

which  it's  been  implemented.  And  I  think  that  would  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  relevant  information  that  might  help  make  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment. 

            

If  I  could  go  to  the  process  point,  and  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  will  return  to  the  need  point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Process  ­­ what  the  Court  said  last  time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around  in  this  case  was  that  the  Court  had  to  ensure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  without  deference  that  the  process  provided  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individualized  consideration  and  that  race  did  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predominate. 

            

Again,  the  University  of  Texas'  plan  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  one  of  what  the  Court  in  Grutter  at  page  334  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  the  hallmarks  of  a  narrowly  tailored  plan.  No 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

quota.  Everybody  competes  against  everybody  else.  No 

  

  

 

 

 

 

automatic  award  of  points.  Modest  factor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And  in  addition  ­­ and  this  goes  to  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  Justice  Kennedy,  about  whether  there  is  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  here  that  race  is  determinative  ­­ Texas  is

plan  in  every  one  of  the  four  ways  that  Your  Honor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  as  ­­ as  being  potentially  troublesome  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  race  determinative. 

 

 

            

Unlike  in  Michigan,  in  Texas  the  percentage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  African­American  and  Hispanics  admitted  does  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mirror  the  percentage  who  applied.  It's  different.

Unlike  Texas,  the  number  ­­ excuse  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Unlike  Michigan,  the  number  in  Texas  of  ­­ of  admissions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fluctuates  year  over  year.  It's  not  the  same  every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year. 

            

Unlike  in  Michigan,  the  bulk  of  Hispanic  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  students  admitted  don't  come  from  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small  subset  of  the  pool  that's  admitted  after  most  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitted  based  on  grades. 

 

 

 

            

And  unlike  in  Michigan,  the  ­­ there  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admissions  officers  don't  monitor  the  process  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  along,  which  would,  as  Your  Honor  suggested,  perhaps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create  the  risk  that  race  would  become  determinative  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

latter  States'  admissions.  None  of  that  is  true  here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So  ­­ so  I  think  with  respect  to  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  If  none  of  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

true,  how  does  the  University  know  when  it  has  achieved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  objective? 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  At  what  point  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  say,  okay,  the  plan  has  worked? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  I  think  ­­ I  was 

   

   

  

 

 

trying  to  address  process,  and  I  ­­ and  I'll  go  right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  to  need,  which  I  think  is  ­­ is  ­­ I  really  do  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you're  right,  Mr.  Chief  Justice.  That's  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  comes  down  to.

And  I  will  answer  your  question  directly, 

   

 

 

 

 

but  I  first  want  to  make  a  point  about  how  you  don't  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  you  shouldn't  do  it.  And  you  shouldn't  do  it  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  the  Petitioner  has  suggested  you  should  do  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What  the  Petitioner  has  said  is  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  order  to  ­­ in  order  to  assess  need,  and  the  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  way  to  meet  ­­ meet  the  need  portion  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strict­scrutiny  analysis,  is  for  the  University  to  set 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a,  quote,  "demographic  goal."  That's  the  Petitioner's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

language.  And  then  test  whether  or  not  they've  made 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  goal. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay.  So  how  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  so  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  ­­ how  should  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

do  it? 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  the  ­­ the  ­­ and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason,  of  course,  that  that's  no  good  is  that  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  Catch­22. 

   

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  no.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

understand  you  disagree  with  their  proposal. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  ­­ so  here's  how  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  do  it,  and  we've  ­­ we've  laid  it  out  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief:  We  think  that  the  approach  ­­ we  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  is  always  going  to  be  fatal  in  fact  because,  if

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  ­­ I  promise  you  I'm 

    

   

 

 

 

going  to  answer  it.  I  just  think  these  points  are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important. 

            

Then  ­­ and  so  the  ­­ with  respect,  we  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  approach  is  faithful  to  Fisher  because  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  fatal  in  fact.  What  we  say  is  that  it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  ­­ a  critical  mass,  numerical  kind  of  analysis.  We

articulation  of  the  educational  benefits  it's  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

achieve.  You  require  the  University  to  state  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

concrete  terms  what  success  will  look  like.  You  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluate  the  evidence  and  analysis  that  the  University 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied  on  in  order  to  make  the  judgment  that  it  isn't

and  see  if  they've  done  it,  but  how  do  you  see  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  ­­ and  you  ­­ and  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  kind  ­­ you  would  look  for  concrete  evidence.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  well  ­­ well­done  classroom  studies. 

 

 

 

 

 

Well­designed  surveys  of  student  attitudes  and  faculty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attitudes.  Graduation  and  retention  rates.  Are  racial 

  

  

 

 

 

 

incidents  going  up  and  down  ­­ up  or  down  on  ­­ on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

campus  in  frequency? 

 

 

            

You  ­­ you  know,  there  could  be  a  whole  list 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  them.  But  you  would  look  at  those.  You  would  look 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  ­­ you  would  look  at  those.  You  would  look  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

University's  analysis  of  those,  and  then  you'd  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  whether  the  University  has  substantiated  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

And  the  burden,  of  course,  is  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

University.  They've  got  to  come  in  and  convince  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they've  substantiated  their  case  that  they  need  to

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Sure.  I  think  that  they 

    

  

 

 

 

can  ­­ and  ­­ and  as  happened  in  Grutter,  I  think  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  ­­ the  ­­ the  interests  that  they  rely  on  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  the  interests  that  they  contemporaneously  identified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  they  adopted  the  program.  I  don't  think  there's  an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  here  on  that. 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  the  evidence  can  include 

   

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  how  things  are  working  in  practice.  For 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  if  they  adopt  a  system  and  it  does  result  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

improvement,  that  does  seem  highly  relevant  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  what  the  Court  held  in  Grutter  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  evidence. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  The  reason  I  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  it's  a  matter  of  concern  is  ­­ what  I  heard  from 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Garre  were  a  lot  of  numbers.  He  said,  look,  this  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  it's  needed,  and  ­­ and,  you  know,  we  will  know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  doing  better  when  the  numbers  look  better. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  just  wonder  whether  the  idea  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

surveys  ­­ I  looked  at  one  of  these  surveys  ­­ I  don't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remember  this  record  or  the  ­­ the  prior  one  ­­ and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  say  it  was  kind  of  sophomoric.  I  mean,  do  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

feel  that  you've  had  enough  interactions  ­­

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  It  certainly  wouldn't  be 

  

 

 

 

 

adequate  by  itself.  It  might  be  probative  evidence  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination  with  other  probative  evidence.  But  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  but  the  ­­ the  question  of  classroom  composition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  hard  evidence. 

 

 

            

And  at  some  level,  demographics  are  hard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  too,  Mr.  Chief  Justice.  When  you're  talking

And  if  I  could,  in  the  time  I  have 

   

   

 

 

 

 

remaining,  I'd  like  to  just  try  to  refocus  the  Court  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  importance  of  what's  at  stake  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  we  told  you  in  our  brief,  our  military 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaders  believe  that  it  is  imperative  that  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  corps  that  are  not  only  diverse  but  capable  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leading  a  diverse  military,  not  only  for  effectiveness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

but  for  the  very  legitimacy  of  sending  our  troops  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm's  way. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  do  you  think  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  and  Hispanic  students  who  were  admitted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  top  10  percent  plan  make  inferior  officers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  compared  to  those  who  were  admitted  under  holistic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review? 

            

But  I  ­­

   

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No,  I  don't.  Not  at  all. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Do  you  think  that  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ROTC  graduates  from  the  University  of  Texas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  superior  officers  to  those  who  ­­ who  graduate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from,  let's  say,  Texas  A&M  or  Texas  Tech? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Here's  what  I  think  about 

   

  

 

 

 

that,  Justice  Alito:  I  think  that  we  want  to  make

African­American  and  Hispanic  candidates  in  that  ROTC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program,  but  that  everybody  who  graduates  from  the  ROTC

And  you  can't  achieve  that  ­­

important,  but  to  come  back  to  my  first  question,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  anything  to  suggest  that  the  top  10  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students  are  less  likely  to  enroll  in  ROTC  or,  when  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do,  they're  not  as  good  as  the  ­­ as  the  holistic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admittees? 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  I  ­­ I  think  with 

    

   

  

 

 

respect  to  the  University  of  Texas  in  particular.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I'm  also  ­­ you  know,  what  the  Court  is  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  in  this  case  obviously  is  going  to  apply  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eventually  to  every  university  in  the  country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  this  is  an  important  interest  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  generally,  that  when  you  think  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  at  stake  here,  that  the  ­­ the  interest  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensuring  that  we  have  military  officers  who  can  lead  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diverse  military  force  is  critical.

The  interest  in  having  law  enforcement 

 

 

 

 

 

officers  who  are  not  just  diverse  but  who  can  operate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively  within  every  racial  and  ethnic  community  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highly  charged  situations  is  critically  important. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Corporate  America  has  told  you  that  having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ a  ­­ a  workforce  that  is  able  to  function 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively  in  diverse  ­­ in  diverse  situations  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical. 

            

And  what  I  would  just  say  in  conclusion  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  these  are  the  considered  judgments  of  people  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  have  the  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vital  functions  of  the  government  protecting  the  country 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  military  and  with  law  enforcement  and  the  vital 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functions  of  commerce  ­­ these  are  the  people  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  have  to  make  sure  that  those  functions  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carried  out.  And  this  is  their  considered  judgment,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  submit  it's  ­­ it's  worth  considerable  weight  in  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis. 

            

Thank  you.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No.  I'm  glad  you  said 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that.  And  ­­ and  I  ­­ this  question  will  sound  very

talking  about. 

 

            

And  I  agree.  I  notice  that  the  briefs  in 

    

   

 

 

 

 

this  case  are  like  the  briefs  in  Grutter.  And  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  does  suggest  that  people  in  the  universities  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elsewhere  are  worried  that  we  will,  to  use  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

colleague's  expression,  kill  affirmative  action  through 

 

 

 

 

 

a  death  by  a  thousand  cuts. 

   

 

 

 

            

We  promised  in  Fisher  I  that  we  wouldn't. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

That  opinion  by  seven  people  reflected  no  one's  views 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly.  But  that's  what  it  says:  Not  fatal  in  fact. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Okay.  That's  what  I'm  focusing  on.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me  there  are  two  parts  to  that,  whether  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  send  it  back  for  another  hearing  or  not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Part  one  you've  dealt  with.  That's  is  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  need?  A  matter  which  Fisher  I  says  we  will  give  some 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  not  complete  deference  to  the  University,  and  as  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  we  have  ­­ you  went  through  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  a  second  part  which  I  want  you  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

address.  The  second  part  in  Fisher,  we  said,  there  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  deference  due  the  University.  On  this  part  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called  narrow  tailoring. 

 

 

            

You  heard  your  friend  on  the  other  side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admit,  he  said,  again.  Maybe  he  believes  it  firmly. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why  use  the  word  "admit"?  He  said  that,  in  the  plans  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grutter  and  the  plans  of  Bakke,  those  were  okay  in

respect  to  narrow  tailoring  because  they  did  compare  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students  one  after  another  and  use  race  as  a  plus 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor. 

            

Now,  what  is  there  in  this  record  that  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support  the  view  that  what  Texas  has  done  in  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrow  tailoring  is  no  worse  than,  perhaps  even  better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than,  what  happened  in  Grutter  or  Bakke? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  I  ­­ I  would  point 

   

   

  

 

 

Your  Honor  specifically  to  the  declaration  at  pages  483a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  484  ­­ and  484a  of  the  Joint  Appendix  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admissions  director,  in  which  he  explains  the  way  race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  considered  in  the  University  of  Texas  system.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  explanation  says  expressly,  at  page  483,  that  race 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  considered  in  exactly  the  same  manner,  and  given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  same  consideration  as  every  other  special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance's  factor  that  the  university  considers  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  its  holistic  review. 

 

 

 

 

            

That  ­­ I  think  that  shows  you  that  actually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know  more  about  the  way  this  program  works  than  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  about  the  program  that  you  affirmed  in  Grutter,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  assurance  based  on  that,  and  nothing  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  contradicts  it  that  that's  the  way  it  operates.

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  BERT  REIN 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  Thank  you,  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

Let  me  first  indicate  that  one  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions  that's  been  asked  repeatedly,  as  ­­ well,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact  did  the  use  of  race  actually  have? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Judge  Garza  ­­ and  this  is  at  Appendix 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

200  ­­ tried  to  make  an  estimate,  because  you  can  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  an  estimate,  because  UT  didn't  know,  and  they  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  now.  His  estimate  was  that  a  very  small  number, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  ­­ it's  in  his  opinion.  It's  ­­ it's  not  only  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage,  but  it's  by  number,  and  that  number  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insignificant  relative  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  think  ­­ do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  change  has  to  happen  overnight?  And  do  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Excuse  me.  Can  I  ­­ can  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

hear  what  you  were  about  to  say?  What  are  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers?  I  was  really  curious  to  hear  those  numbers. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  He  assumed,  at  the  outside,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  of  the  admits  that  were  actually  African­American  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hispanic  outside  the  Top  Ten,  he  said  let  me  take  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption  and  see  what  it  would  add.  And  he  said  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  constitute  less  than  1  percent  and  2.5  percent, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respectively,  in  ­­ of  the  entire  6,322­person  case  ­­

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  are  you  reading 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  REIN:  But  he  did  not  ­­ can  I  finish? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  you  just  tell  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

from? 

            

            

where  you're  reading  from? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  This  is  Appendix  250  to  251a.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  Judge  Garza's  original  dissent.  This  is  ­­ this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  ­­ and  he  repeated,  essentially,  the  same  point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  he  calculated,  and  he  made  different  assumptions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depending  on  how  many  of  the  admissions  in  the  holistic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program  one  would  assume  would  be  different  because  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

race.  Because  no  one  knows,  and  that  ­­ and  that's  part 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  this. 

 

            

And  clearly,  one  ­­ and  ­­ and  ­­ I  can  read 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  these  numbers,  but  you  can  read  them  yourselves. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  a  very  small  number.  And  his  most  realistic 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

estimate  was  that  it  would  yield  only  15 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­Americans  and  40  Hispanic  students  in  a  class  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

6,000.  So  we're  talking  about  a  very  small  effect,  even 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  assumptions  that  ­­ that  actually  exist. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  know,  one  point  is  it's  small.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  point,  equally  important,  is  no  one  knew  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  study  it. 

 

 

 

            

And  then  ­­ then  we  get  the  same  point  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  complementary,  which  was  the  big  theme  of  the  Fifth

Circuit,  oh,  it's  a  necessary  complement.  What  does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  mean?  One  sense,  you've  got  to  have  some  plan  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  going  to  cap  the  Top  Ten  at  75  percent,  so  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  to  do  something.  But  that  doesn't  make  it  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  complement. 

 

            

When  you  really  look  what  the  Fifth  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  they  said  it's  based  on  two  assumptions:  One,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Top  Ten  are  drawn  from  these  minority  high  schools. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where  did  they  come  up  with  that?  They  never  studied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  pattern  of  the  Top  Ten  admits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

How  do  you  know  that  a  Hispanic  or  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

African­American  student  can't  be  in  the  Top  Ten  at  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  call  an  integrated,  high­performing  high  school? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  a  stereotypical  assumption. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  ­­ what 

    

   

   

 

 

you're  saying,  basically,  is,  is  this  is  what  the  Fifth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  concluded  and  which  the  school  basically  agrees, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay?  If  you  don't  consider  race,  then  holistic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

percentage,  whatever  it  is,  is  going  to  be  virtually  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

white. 

            

            

            

            

            

MR.  REIN:  And  that  is  incorrect. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  white. 

  

 

 

MR.  REIN:  And  that  is  an  assumption  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  to  say  ­­ no  ­­

Let  me  finish  my  point. 

 

 

 

 

He's  right.  For  their  educational  needs, 

  

 

 

 

 

record. 

            

            

            

            

is. 

            

reality  ­­

 

            

            

            

            

on. 

            

            

there  are  competing  criteria.  They  need  to  keep  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  SAT,  or  whatever  that's  called,  AI  index,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  high  because  of  the  quality  they  want  to  keep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  school  at.  That  does  discriminate  against  blacks  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  levels,  because  the  difference  in  numbers  are  high. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  you  have  something  like  this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  ­­ what  you're  saying,  basically,  is,  and  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  proposing,  is  change  your  educational  needs  across 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  board,  and  focus  in  only  on  race,  and  make  sure  that

That's  basically  what  you're  arguing,  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  REIN:  No.  And  ­­ and  to  be  fair,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  the  first  thing  I  was  just  pointing  out  is  that  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  to  the  conclusion  of  the  Fifth  Circuit,  you  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  assume  the  pattern  of  admits  in  the  Top  Ten,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  come  from,  which  was  never  established  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  never  studied. 

 

 

            

And  the  second  is  that  you  have  to  assume 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  those  coming  from  ­­ all  students  coming  from  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

integrated,  high­performing  high  schools  don't  include, 

 

 

 

 

 

in  their  Top  10  percent,  any  minority. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  What  we  know  is  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  REIN:  That's  what  he  assumes. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ the  school  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

have  enough  ­­

 

 

            

            

MR.  REIN:  Justice  Sotomayor  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ no  matter  what  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

does,  it  doesn't  have  enough  numbers  of  black  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  REIN:  That  ­­ that  comes  back  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental  point. 

 

            

If  we're  just  talking  numbers,  then  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  show  the  compelling  need  for  more  numbers,  so  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  the  reasons  for  defining  your  compelling  need  is

that  you  have  to  then  look  at  necessity  in  terms  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need. 

            

So  as  in  Grutter,  what  they  said  was  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insufficient  numbers  of  minorities  to  provoke  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  dialogue.  When  we  look  at  the  class  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole,  we  think  we  can  do  better  if  we  introduce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  points  of  view.  It's  very  individualized; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  a  small  class. 

   

 

            

So  you  can  then  say,  increasing  numbers  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  they  were  certainly  after,  you  know,  from  three  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  ­­ will  meet  that  compelling  need. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Since  they  never  bothered  to  administer,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  to  define  the  needs,  it's  really  hard  to  say  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  after  and  why  numbers  would  or  would  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy,  and  whether  the  numbers  they  were  generating, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  included  15  percent  of  the  so­called  holistic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admits  so  it  wasn't  all  white  enterprise,  why  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  work. 

 

            

The  key  point  is,  you  have  to  come  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  with  the  record.  You  can't  make  it  up  later, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that  would  say  do  what  you  want,  and  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  comes,  make  it  up.  That's  not  ­­ no  way  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigate. 

            

And  in  this  case  they  said,  we're  ready  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summary  judgment;  we've  put  in  everything  we  need.  If

you  look  at  their  specific  proffers  ­­ and  the  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals,  they  said  they  wanted  to  take  discovery.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  Judge  Higginbotham,  their  best  friend,  said,  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who?  What  does  Ms.  Fisher  know  about  this?  What  are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  going  to  take  discovery  about?  And  he  found  no  need 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  Court,  all  they  say  is,  we'd  like  to  reiterate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  benefits  of  diversity,  but  those  were  accepted,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we'd  like  a  few  testimonials  about  students  admitted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

holistically  without  knowing  whether  they  were  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries  of  the  race  or  not.  You  can't  ­­ can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigate  that  way. 

 

 

            

            

Thank  you,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted.
