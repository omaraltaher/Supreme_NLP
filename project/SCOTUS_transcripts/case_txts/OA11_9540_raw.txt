9

12  client was convicted of in 1978, in the State of

14  Criminal Act is what he's convicted of.  And as we all 
15
16  elements have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt or 
17  agreed to by a defendant after waiving his 
18  constitutional rights.

21  burglary consists of, is not an element of California 
22  burglary.  Any entry with the intent to commit a crime, 
23  a theft, or a felony will do.  A California jury is

 Regardless of the defendant's conduct, a 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You don't take issue, do 

 MR. JOHNSON:  I -- I don't take issue with 

that, Your Honor.  I think if the State's -- State 

1
2  California burglary conviction is not, by its elements, 
3  Taylor burglary for Armed Career Criminal Act. 
4
you, with the argument that in -- in determining what 
5
6  the State law is you can take account not only of the 
7  words of the statute, but how the State Supreme Court 
8  interprets those words? 
9
10
11  courts clearly state something is an element of a crime, 
12  I -- you know, I agree with that. 
13
14  Court has said that an element of the burglary statute 
is the violation of some possessory interest.  Now, I 
15
16  know there is some disagreement between you and the 
17  government about that.  But assuming for the sake of 
18  argument that that is an element, one way for the 
19  California court to express that is to say simply, as it 
has, that an element is the violation of the possessory 
20
21  interest. 
22
23  would be to say that the term "enters" under the 
24  California burglary statute means either breaking into a 
structure or the violation of the possessory interest in 
25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the California Supreme 

 Another way of saying exactly the same thing

a conviction under this statute potentially qualify 


 MR. JOHNSON:  Okay. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Those are exactly 

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but they -- they set out 
alternative elements, either breaking into the structure 
or the violation of the possessory interest in some 
other way. 

1  some other way. 
2
3
4  equivalent.  Now, if they were to say the latter, would 
5
6  under the Armed Career Criminal Act? 

7
 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, I don't believe it 

8  would, because I don't believe possessory interest 

9  equates to Taylor definition. 

10
11 
12 
13 
14
are shown, and if that's the definition, then yes.  But 
15
16  I don't think California possessory interest is the same 
17  thing. 
18
19  you dispute the fact that saying A, an element is the 
20
21  elements are breaking or the violation of the possessory 
22  interest in some other way, are exactly the same 
23  substantively? 
24
25

 MR. JOHNSON:  I -- I don't, Your Honor, 

because in the Taylor sense you have to have an --

 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, if -- if the elements 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but they have said -- do 

violation of the possessory interest, and B, the

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought your argument was 

1  unlawful -- trespass, actually a trespass, or an 
2  invasion of a person's -- well, unlawful trespass.  In 
3  California you don't have to have a trespass.  And as 
4  the Court indicated in the Taylor decision, it talked 
about shoplifting in the State of California.  So is a 
5
6  shoplifter someone who should be subject to an Armed 
7  Career Criminal Act enhancement? 
8
9  that if the terms of the statute set out alternative 
ways of satisfying an element, you have alternative 
10
11 
elements in essence, that then, even if some of those 
alternatives don't fall within generic burglary, if one 
12 
13 
does, then a conviction under that statute potentially 
can qualify. 
14 
15
16
17
18  that. 
19
20
21 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Alright.  Now, what if the 
22
23  State Supreme Court says exactly the same thing?  Your 
24  answer to Justice Ginsburg was it doesn't matter whether 
the elements are set out in the statute or whether they 
25

MR. JOHNSON:  Well, I --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't that -- do you not --
 MR. JOHNSON:  -- I have no argument with 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay. 
MR. JOHNSON:  That's the modified 

categorical approach, I believe. 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'll ask the question 

I agree with you.  But I don't believe California 

1  are defined by the State court. 
2
 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, I -- as I said, if -- if 
3  the element is set forth and it's an element that meets 
4  the definition of the generic definition in Taylor, then 
5
6  burglary does that, because the entry with intent to 
7  commit a crime is burglary in California. 
8
9  one more time.  Is there a difference -- what the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  substantive difference, but in California breaking is 
not required at any time.  It's not an element of the 
20
21  crime. 
22
23  Justice Alito is getting at maybe in a slightly a 
24  different way?  And it's really the argument that the 
25

California court has said is that an element is the 
violation of a possessory interest.  Assuming for the 
sake of argument that is correct, that is a correct 
statement of California law, is there any substantive 
difference between saying that and saying the element is 
breaking or, in the alternative, the violation of a 
possessory interest in some other way?  Is there some 
substantive difference between those two things? 

 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, there may not be a 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Johnson, can I try what 

Ninth Circuit made, which is that you can take any 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company

that we can look to Shepard documents when we have a 

1  indivisible statute -- indivisible statute, and you can 
2  reimagine it as a statute with divisible elements, and 
3  Justice Alito gave one example of that.  And the 
4  question that the Ninth Circuit says, is, once we've said 
5
6  divisible statute, why not apply the same reasoning when 
7  we have an indivisible statute, given that any 
8  indivisible statute can kind of be reframed in our heads 
9  as a divisible one?

15
16 
17
18  the person convicted of.  They'd be convicted of a 
19  weapon violation, not a gun violation.  And so, I -- I 
20
21
22  held that when you have a conviction for a weapons 
23  violation, you can look to the Shepard materials to 
24  decide whether, in fact, the weapon violation was a gun, 
25

case, the jury -- if a statute is made where the 
question is, is a weapon involved, and you can commit 
that with an ax, a gun, or a knife, but the element is 
weapon, the jury is only required to find weapon.  And 
if gun is -- is the fact that needs to be shown for an 
active -- predicate, you don't get there. 

suggest it's the same thing here. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I thought our cases 

a knife or an ax, can't you?  No? 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

MR. JOHNSON:  Well, because in -- in that 

 Again, you go back to the element, what's 

Official 

 MR. JOHNSON:  If the State's statute sets 

a manner and means of committing the crime.  I don't 

suffice, right?  But if the supreme court doesn't say 
that, we cannot imagine it? 

 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, I -- if it's spelled out 

1
2  off those as an alternative element, I would agree with 
3  that.  If they are not set out in an alternative 
4  element, then I don't think they are -- I think they are 
5
6  think they are an element of the crime. 
7
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or if -- you acknowledge if 
8  the State supreme court says "weapon" could mean a -- a 
9  gun, a knife or a hatchet, that would -- that would 
10
11 
12
13  as an element, I think you can, but if it's not an 
14  element --

16 
17

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not spelled out as an 
element, but the State supreme court says, our statute 
says weapon.  Of course, a weapon could be a gun, a 
knife, or a hatchet, and then we look to the Shepard 
documents and we find that this conviction of a weapon 
violation was in fact based on the possession of a gun. 

court that says the word "weapon" in the statute means

to see whether you have a single crime or separate 
crimes, okay?  That's that's what I think your argument 
is. 

1  knife, ax, or gun.  Now, are those three ways of 
2  committing the crime?  Or are they three crimes, each 
3  with a separate element?  That is -- we'd need not only 
4  St. Thomas Aquinas, but I mean, we'd need those angels 
5
6
 There is no difference that I can imagine. 
7  And therefore you are saying, look to the point of this 
8  statute; it is not to look to the individual way in 
9  which it was committed, and therefore go to the statute 
10
11 
12 
13
14
15
16
 MR. JOHNSON:  I think you do. 
17
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  If I understand your 
18  argument -- it's not as friendly a question as you might 
19  hope--
(Laughter.) 
20
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- because what I want to 
22  do next is say, why are we debating this point, because 
23  the only difference I can see under the California 
24  statute is shoplifting and even that one is sort of 
debatable.  And the very next clause of this statute 
25

 MR. JOHNSON:  It -- it is. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you think I understand 

your argument? 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

still got a statute that for 430,000 convictions and as far 

1  says "or otherwise," "or otherwise involves conduct that 

2  presents a serious potential risk of physical injury." 

3
 So, why not forget about this metaphysical point 

4  and say, look, even if you are totally right, you've 

5
6  as we can tell there must have been fewer than 500 that 
7  involved shoplifting, so this is so much like burglary, 
8  that whatever risks were presented by burglary are 
9  surely present here.  So let's forget the metaphysics 
and just go on to clause 2.  Now, why hasn't anybody 
10
11 
done that?  It's a mystery to me, because you haven't 
12 
and they haven't.  So why not? 
13
 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, it's not my burden to do 
14  that.  And -- I expected that question, but I think even 
15
16
17
18  shoplifter is not -- but I would think --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  But I mean, 
19
what I would do -- I've said this and nobody pays any 
20
21  attention.  I think Justice Scalia's said it; nobody 
22  pays any attention.  I think Justice Posner said it.  He 
23  said, look, under clause 2, these are really empirical 
24  questions, is this dangerous or not.  Let's do a little 
sampling and what we'll do is we'll sample the kinds of 
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why? 
 MR. JOHNSON:  Because in California a 

under -- under the residual clause we win the case. 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, you could.  I just 

1  people that this particular State statute X get 
2  convicted under and where a whole lot of them are 
3  dangerous it's a dangerous statute; and where not, not. 
4  And so nobody's done that sampling, but we do have some 
numbers here and the numbers here suggest that this is 
5
6  really a burglary statute. 
7
 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, there's -- there's other 
8  ways other than just shoplifting.  There -- for example, 
9  a mortgage broker going into a home with an invitation. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 MR. JOHNSON:  Doesn't it come back to the 
17  test that this Court thought Congress meant when you 
18  made the ruling in Taylor that we're not going to look 
19  to the manner and means of commission, we're going to 
20
21
22  have to do with that.  It has to do with the crime and 
23  the crime is the crime that the statute defines.  And 
24  the question is, is that crime otherwise -- present a 
25

don't think there are that many people who burgle their 
own homes or who go into the home of somebody else with 
an invitation and then sneak into the cupboard and stay 
overnight and burgle everything.  I mean, there are some 
such, but --

serious potential risk of physical injury?  And if 4,000 

look at the elements --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  It doesn't 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

all cases it's there. 

 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, if the Taylor definition 

different approach. 

1  manifestations of that crime it does, and 3 
2  manifestations of that crime it doesn't, you would say 
3  the overall judgment here is this is a crime that does 
4  present that dangerous risk.  That's because in almost 
5
6
7  -- after the Court worked that through, I think the 
8  Taylor went with the categorical elements approach.  I 
9  think what you're talking, Your Honor, is -- is a 
10
11
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  It's exactly pure 
12  categorical.  You have a crime in a statute.  You don't 
13  know how dangerous it is.  It is not burglary, arson or 
14  explosives.  So to find out if it presents the same kind 
15
16  all I'm saying.  It has nothing to do with categorical. 
17
 MR. JOHNSON:  But then why do we have the 
18  "is burglary" language and the other sentences?  Don't 
19  they get eaten up by that? 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

JUSTICE BREYER:  "Is burglary or otherwise," 
"or otherwise," "burglary or otherwise," and the reason 
we have "or otherwise" is because Congress does know 
that the number of State statutes that are sort of like 
something, but not completely like something is in the 
thousands.  And so that's why they put in "or 

of danger you do a little empirical research.  That's 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. JOHNSON:  I think in this case one of 

of manner and means in order to establish an element 

1  otherwise." 
2
3  the -- one of the considerations that drives our 
4  argument is that if you get into that fact-finding mode 
5
6  that is not in the State statute, which is in the case 
7  we're looking at here, I think you got an Apprendi 
8  problem, and I think under the Sixth Amendment my client 
9  should have had a right to a jury trial and proof beyond 
10
11
 He went from a max 10 to a max of life and a 
12  mandatory min of 15 years, based on what I -- we contend 
13  is fact-finding in violation of Apprendi. 
14
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the Court were to 
say, we now hold that the modified categorical approach 
15
16  applies to this statute and to these facts.  Would the 
17  plea colloquy suffice to show that under the modified 
18  categorical approach the defendant necessarily was 
19  convicted of a crime that's equivalent to the generic 
20
21
 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, I think the breaking 
22  under the -- under the California statute is a manner 
23  and means of committing the crime.  It's not an element 
24  of the crime, because you don't have to --
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if he necessarily --

Official 

 MR. JOHNSON:  That's kind of a two-part 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It is a two-part question. 

I hope I can get an answer to each. 

 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, the first question is, 

convicted of that, would that suffice?  And if it would, 

 MR. JOHNSON:  -- do that. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- the defendant 


1
2
3  necessarily was convicted of an offense that had the 

4  elements of a generic crime, if he necessarily was 

5
6  does the -- plea colloquy suffice to show that? 
7
8  question. 
9
10
11
12  because the breaking is not part of California 
13  requirement, a jury's never required to find that as an 
14  element.  Nor does a judge when he's taking a plea have 
15
16
17  categorical approach we -- we insist that in the 
18  particular case before us the generic components of the 
19  crime must necessarily have been found by the jury, and 
if we say that that's the rule, that's inconsistent with 
20
21  your view of what the law ought to be? 
22
23  be, because I think unless it -- unless it -- there are 
24  alternatives in the statute, some of which constitute 
25

to -- to find that having taken place. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if under the modified 

the generic crime and some of which don't, I don't think 

 MR. JOHNSON:  I think -- I think it would 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think what you're saying 

 MR. JOHNSON:  That's obviously a more --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The jury in finding him 

1  you can use a modified categorical approach. 
2
3  is, it -- it could necessarily have been found by the 
4  jury, but he would nevertheless not have been convicted 
5
6
7
8  guilty of the generic offense could only have found that 
9  this mode of committing the offense was what he used. 
Nonetheless, he has not been convicted of using that 
10
11 
mode; he has been convicted of the generic offense. 
12 
Isn't that your point. 
13
14  an example would be in a plea bargain context the 
15
16  controlled substance, maybe there is a problem with the 
17  search or something and they come up with a plea bargain 
18  of possession of a controlled substance.  Are we going 
19  to 30 years later go back and say, well, the colloquy 
says this person did do a delivery, so we are going to 
20
21  punish him as if he did? 
22
23  categorical approach the whole point is that we do look 
24  to the plea colloquy. 
25

 MR. JOHNSON:  Exactly true.  Just like for 

of that particular crime. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But under the modified 

MR. JOHNSON:  You look to the plea

that it does and we look at the plea colloquy.  What do 

1  colloquy --

2
3  you say you don't think the modified categorical 

4  approach should apply.  But I'm saying suppose we say 

5
6  you want us to conclude from that? 
7
8  still doesn't -- it's not an element of the crime. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you simplify that? 
9
Could you simplify that?  What do you think the elements 
10
11  of -- just going back to what Justice Scalia said, as I 
12  understand your position the elements of a burglary in 
13  California law is being in a place with the intent to 
14  commit a crime.  Whether you got there with permission 
15
16  So what you are saying is what he pled guilty to was 
17  being in that garage with the intent to commit a crime, 
18  correct? 
19
20
21  commit. 
22
23  not necessary. 
24
25

or without permission, unlawfully or not, is irrelevant. 

 MR. JOHNSON:  Yes.  In California you --

just entry with intent is all you need, with intent to 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the unlawfulness is 

 MR. JOHNSON:  It's not necessary and that's 

Official 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, which is why 


the point --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No matter what he said, 

 MR. JOHNSON:  And the manner and means of --

MR. JOHNSON:  Exactly. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- with intent.  That's 

convicted of.  And again, I think unless the Court 
decides to change that approach, I think we're going to 
have an Apprendi problem. 

1
2  he wasn't convicted of a generic crime because all he 
3  was convicted of under California law was entering 
4  and --
5
6
7  your point. 
8
9  of committing it isn't the point.  It's what are you 
10
11 
12 
13
 JUSTICE ALITO:  But your argument comes back 
14  to how the elements are defined.  It comes back -- so in 
15
16  statute -- whether the statute simply sets out a broad 
17  category or whether it sets out lots of subcategories, 
18  that's what your argument comes down to. 
19
20
21  entry, period, that's one thing.  If they say the 
22  element is breaking or entering in some other way, 
23  that's something entirely different.  It all comes down 
24  to that, in your view. 
25

 If the court says -- if the California 

legislature or the California court says, the element is 

your view, what is critical is in a case of a broad 

MR. JOHNSON:  Well, it may -- it may come 

18
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because it's like the old 

1  down to what -- what the Court thinks California means 
2  by invasion of a possessory interest.  But again, I just 
3  -- I don't see invasion of a possessory interest as the 
4  equivalent of Taylor entry. 
5
6  joke.  I mean, it's in the statute, you are looking back 
7  to see whether he was charged with possession of a gun, 
8  which is one word in the statute, or an ax, or a knife. 
9  That's what we're looking for under the categorical --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
 All they have to say is yes.  They don't 
18  have to say which.  And therefore, Apprendi would be 
19  violated, in your view. 
20
21 
22
23  argument, then you're really asking for us to modify our 
24  prior cases.  Because I thought it was clear, that if 
25

modified categorical.  But if all it says in the statute 
is weapon, even if the supreme court says it's a gun, a 
knife, or an ax, you still have nothing to look for. 
Because the charge to the jury could have been, did he 
have a gun, a knife, or an ax, and the answer to that 
question, when the jury comes back, would be yes.  You 
see? 

the element -- if the statute requires -- if to qualify 

MR. JOHNSON:  That's correct.  I think that 

sums it up. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if that's your

agree with that? 

to this case.  I think what you're saying about the plea 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So your answer to 

Justice Breyer was not yes; it was no. 

 MR. JOHNSON:  Maybe I misunderstood the 

1  under ACCA, you have to have a gun.  And the statute 
2  says that you have to have a weapon, and a weapon is 
3  defined as a gun, a knife, or a hatchet, that would be 
4  okay.  Is that wrong?  Isn't that your -- don't you 
5
6
 MR. JOHNSON:  If the predicate element is 
7  included in the -- in the statute or the decision, I 
8  agree with that.  But again, I don't think I have to --
9
10
11
12  question.  But I think the --
13
14
15
16  colloquy is, even if he had said to the judge, yes, I 
17  broke and entered the Metro Mart, even if he had said 
18  that, the conviction still would not be for burglary. 
 MR. JOHNSON:  The conviction is for just 
19
20
21  how this Court defined burglary in Taylor.  And so --
22
23  argument isn't that -- is that what we've said in the 
24  modified categorical cases is that you look to these 
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You didn't. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's -- let's get back

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but -- here's, I 

1  offense.  So if you're not sure which offense the person 
2  has been convicted of, you look to the Shepard documents 
3  to do that.  But you don't look to the Shepard documents 
4  for a different purpose, which is, we know what the 
5
6  this person also committed the generic offense. 
7
8  And -- but the government wants you to use the Shepard

 MR. JOHNSON:  There's an -- there's an easy 
22  way to fix that.  A State legislature can change their 
23  law, if they want to.  The Congress can change the 
24  approach they want to take, and that would -- that would 
25

guess, the rub, which is -- you know, I take the point 
that what the Ninth Circuit has said does not seem very 
categorical.  It doesn't seem categorical, it doesn't 
seem modified categorical.  But there is something a 
little bit insane about your position.  I don't see --
you take the most populous State in the country and 
everybody who's convicted of burglary, in the most 
populous State in the country, is not going to have 
committed an ACCA offense, even though, as Justice 
Breyer suggested, 98 percent of them really have.

7  Federal legislation and how that operates. 
8
9  amend the statute if they wish, as many members of the 
Court have talked to the Court and asked the Court to 
10
11 
do.  But in light of how I believe this Court interprets 
the law, and the categorical approach, and the idea was 
12 
13 
that using the modified categorical approach would only 
apply in a narrow set of circumstances, the 
14 
California -- or the Ninth Circuit's version is not a

narrow set of circumstances.

19  going to be doing fact-finding on issues, some of the

21  of things like that.  It's not fair to the -- to a 
22  defendant under those circumstances that that kind of 
23  fact-finding is going to take place and result in the 
24  egregious extra penalties he's looking at unless he has

Why doesn't this, the crime of which the defendant was 
convicted, satisfy the remaining, the remaining in the 
building with intent to commit a crime? 

1
2  are facts about the conviction.  I think that's the 
3  difference between the Ninth Circuit's approach and what 
4  all the other circuits have.  I think the other circuits 
5
6  be narrow. 
7
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's -- there's 
8  probably an obvious answer to this, but the Taylor 
9  definition of generic burglary is unlawful entry into or

is -- I believe, in my reading of the case law, it's --

16  the -- the intent is formed as you enter the premises. 
17  And that's when the burglary's been committed.  If --
18  for example, that's the way I read the case law. 
19
20
21
 MR. JOHNSON:  Well, except the -- again, is 
22  it the intent in the generic sense, or is it the intent 
23  in the California sense?  And I suggest there's a

8
9
10
11
12
13  and may it please the Court: 
14
 I would like to start maybe at a point in a 
colloquy that my friend was having with Justice Breyer, 
15
16  which brought out the point that Petitioner's position 
17  here is that there's a difference between alternative 
18  elements in State crimes and alternative means; and from 
19  the point of view of a guilty plea, which is what we're 
dealing with here, I don't see how you're going to make 
20
21  that sort of distinction. 
22
23  from -- from the point of view of the defendant pleading 
24  guilty, whether it's an alternative element or an 
alternative means, it's just an alternative way of 
25

 It's an unworkable distinction, because, 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

crime it was that the offender committed. 

 And the reason that you have to sometimes do 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But you're not -- but 

1  offering the factual basis for the crime.  And the 

2  sentencing court ought to look, as the Court, as this 

3  Court said in Shepard, to the factual basis that's 

4  offered for pleading guilty. 

5
6  you're not looking at the factual basis for the purpose 
7  of deciding the manner in which the defendant committed 
8  the crime.  You're looking to the factual basis or you 
9  look to these other documents in order to decide which 
10
11
12  that is because there are many State statutes which 
13  under a single section number list several different 
14  crimes, where "crime" here does not refer to a thing 
that happened at a particular day at a particular time, 
15
16  but refers to the kind of thing that a statute defines; 
17  i.e., a general category. 
 Now, every case that we've written it seems 
18
19  to me says that or is consistent with that.  And that is 
certainly consistent with the idea of the crimes being 
20
21  burglary, arson, explosives, or other dangerous crimes. 
22  So the guilty plea is beside the point.  It may just 
23  say, guilty of 828 376 Section 42-BC, end of the matter. 
24
25

 And we don't know which of those three 
things:  House, car, boat, which are there in that

part is not the equivalent --

MR. HORWICH:  I -- I do think you've 

1  section, was the crime committed.  And he's saying 
2  that's the end of that.  And so he says, then, look, 
3  this is a California State statute and it isn't divided 
4  into three parts.  It just has one part.  And that one 
5
6
 MR. HORWICH:  I think that --

20
21 
22
23  principled or not to focus on the text versus the 
24  judicial decision, let's accept for the sake of argument 
that that's the line.  The problem is that then the next 
25

accurately described what Petitioner -- the dividing 
line the Petitioner would advocate is.  But I would urge 
the Court to look at the experience of the court of 
appeals with trying to apply that dividing line, and 
that will reveal to the Court very clearly why it 
becomes unworkable.  Because we've got several courts of 
appeals -- as the Court's aware there's a division of 
authority on this -- that have said, well, look, we want 
to look for statutes that are phrased in the disjunctive 
or that have these separately numbered subsection 
headings or something. 

 Now, setting aside whether that's really 

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's exactly right.  So 

MR. HORWICH:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And of course Congress knew 

therefore they wrote the next phrase of their Federal 
statute, which is it's burglary, arson, explosives or 
otherwise, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a 
serious potential risk of physical injury. 

1  case that those courts confront, that applying that rule 
2  rigidly produces really strange results. 
3
4  therefore, that was my question basically. 
5
6
7  that there are hundreds or thousands of State statutes 
8  with several different words and they -- you know, 
9  different ways of getting at the same thing, and 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  but it's pretty hard to imagine it wouldn't otherwise 
17  present the same risks, at least if it's only a slight 
18  variation. 
19
20
21  on what the Court would --
22
23  question.  Why not? 
24
25

 And so if you have a slight variation on the 
burglary theme, it doesn't fit within generic burglary, 

 MR. HORWICH:  Well, this case has been 

argued as -- because this is a conviction under

 MR. HORWICH:  That -- that's -- I understand 

1  California burglary, it's been argued under the -- the 
2  premise that it should be classified as generic 
3  burglary.  But let me offer --
4
argued it because there's some serious constitutional 
5
6  doubt about whether the statute which makes it a crime 
7  to engage in conduct which creates a serious risk of 
8  physical injury is constitutional.  That's such a vague 
9  standard, you go to prison for 30 years if you engage in 
conduct, quote, "that creates a serious risk of physical 
10
11  injury."  I'm not about to buy into that one. 
12
13  Your Honor's view on that, on that subject. 
14
15
16
17  an argument you did make. 
18
19
20
21  argument, because you very carefully distinguish what 
22  are what you call missing elements cases from this case. 
23
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Horwich --
MR. HORWICH:  If I can try to --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm going to ask you about 

 MR. HORWICH:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  As I understand your 

argument, your argument is not the Ninth Circuit's 

 MR. HORWICH:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So do you reject the Ninth 

Circuit's view that the categorical approach should

 MR. HORWICH:  Well, I want to be very 

 And -- and the good way to think about the 

1  apply even where there is a missing element, as you --
2  as you call it? 
3
4  careful that we're talking about the same thing, when we 
say "missing element."  And so maybe I can give -- give 
5
6  an example of what I think is a missing element case and 
7  one to which we do not think the modified categorical 
8  approach can be applied. 
9
exercise that we think a sentencing court should be 
10
11  engaged in here is to say, imagine there's a set of 
12  boxes on one side that correspond to the elements of the 
13  generic offense -- excuse me -- of the State offense, 
14  and then on the other side a set of boxes that 
15
16
17  Shepard materials and figure out what goes into those 
18  boxes or what went into those boxes on the State side to 
19  establish a basis for the previous conviction.  And then 
you take whatever was put in those boxes, be it specific 
20
21  or general or whatever it is, and then see if those 
22  things give you enough to fill in the elements of the 
23  generic offense. 
24
25

correspond to the elements et of the generic offense. 

 And the exercise is to go through the 

 Now, in a case that we would call a missing 

element case, let's take, for example, because we're 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

in the generic box. 

1  talking about burglary, let's talk about criminal 
2  trespass.  So criminal trespass let's assume is defined 
3  as the unlawful entry of a building or structure, 
4  period.  And there's no provision that you have to have 
intent to commit a crime.  Now, it doesn't matter what's 
5
6  in the Shepard materials for someone who pleads guilty 
7  to criminal trespass, because there's no way you're ever 
8  going to get something in one of those boxes about 
9  unlawful entry or structure that's going to let you fill 
10
11
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let me give you a -- let me 
12  give you a different kind of example.  Let's suppose you 
13  have a statute that's made it illegal to interfere with 
14  a law enforcement investigation.  And you're prosecuting 
somebody, maybe the person is pleading, maybe he goes to 
15
16  trial; it doesn't matter.  The theory of the case is 
17  that the defendant violated this statute, interference 
18  with a law enforcement investigation, by assaulting a 
19  police officer, okay?  Is that a missing elements case 
20
21  just -- it's just an overbroad statute? 
22
23  I guess I would need to know in your hypothetical 
24  what -- what we're trying to classify that conviction 
25

or is that what you think is going on here, which is 

 MR. HORWICH:  Well, we would need to know --

as, because --

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  The conviction is 

offenses in it. 

 MR. HORWICH:  Well --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And it's overbroad.  There 

1
2  interference with a law enforcement investigation. 
3  That's the statute.  But interference with a law 
4  enforcement investigation can be done in extremely -- it 
can be done in an extremely violent way, which would be 
5
6  an ACCA offense or not. 
7
8
9  are ACCA offenses in it, but there are also non-ACCA 
10
11
 MR. HORWICH:  Well, I'm sorry.  I guess 
12  my -- my -- my concern is -- is that I would need to 
13  know what generic enumerated crime we're trying to fit 
14  that into, because although perhaps that could be 
15
16
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Sure. 
17
 MR. HORWICH:  Well, that might raise a -- I 
18  think that raises a different set of questions.  I want 
19  to be clear that our argument here at this point is only 
20
21  dealing with the enumerated -- with enumerated offenses. 
22
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why would there be any 
23  difference between those two?  Why would you take your 
24  argument differently from the residual clause than in 
25

that the Court should accept this for purposes of 

classified under the residual clause --

the enumerated crimes? 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think because the way 

figure out what the right frame of reference to draw is. 
 So I think residual clause cases are a very 

1
2  this Court's residual clause jurisprudence has evolved, it 
3  requires the Court to make some assessment of the degree 
4  of risk of some set of conduct that's not too much more 
serious than what the defendant engaged in, but not too 

5
6  much less serious and so I don't know what that 

7  reference point is.  I mean, there's something of that, 

8  I think in -- in -- in Your Honor's disagreement with 

9  the majority in the Sykes case, I think of, trying to 

10
11
12  difficult context in which to -- to talk about 
13  hypotheticals here, and for that reason, I -- I would --
14  I would -- I think it's more productive to try to assign 
15
16
17
18  talk about this case, then.  I mean, I'm not sure I 
19  understand that quite.  But let's talk about the 
20
21  entry.  In other words, this State says unlawful entry 
22  and you say that's overbroad, but we're still in sort of 
23  the same universe of an element.  Suppose the State just 
24  said entry.  Would we be in a missing element world or 
25

burglary.  Suppose that there was a State that just said 

them to burglary or one of the other generic offenses. 

 If I can give an example --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Well, let me -- let's 

in an overbroad world? 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

colloquy, but if they are not offered as the legal basis 
for the defendant's conviction, then they don't make it 
into those boxes that I was talking about and they don't 
make it into being a basis for the generic offense. 

 MR. HORWICH:  If the State statute provided 
1
2  that all entries qualified, which is what I understand 
3  your hypothetical to be, then I think that probably 
4  amounts to a missing elements situation, because -- and 
5
6  question is what did the defendant necessarily admit in 
7  the plea colloquy.  And there may be -- I want to be 
8  clear -- there may be any number of things that are in 
9  the Shepard materials that are noted in the plea 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
which is you say that, but how to define a missing 
15
16  element from an alternative element is -- overbroad 
17  element, doesn't make any sense to me.  As I read the 
18  California statute, all it says is you have to enter a 
19  number of defined things with the intent to commit a 
20
21  is unlawful.  That's your colleague's -- your opponent's 
22  argument.  But you're trying to read into the method of 
23  entering that it could be legal or illegal, and so you 
24  look at the documents to add that.

crime.  It doesn't talk about whether the entry itself 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's my problem, 

Official 

I'm taking the Court's test from Shepard here.  The 

MR. HORWICH:  Well, I don't think -- no, I 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

long as you're entering, the statute literally says 

 But the problem with Petitioner's position 
about California law is that that's not California law. 

1  don't think we're trying to add that.  I agree that 
2  if -- if -- if, for example, the California Supreme 
3  Court's decision in Gauze had come out the other way and 
4  said, yep, it's your own home -- you know, so what.  As 
5
6  "entry," there's no -- there's nothing further we need 
7  to examine, then I agree this would be -- you could call 
8  it a missing element case. 
9
10
11  Petitioner says -- I wrote this down, any -- he says, 
12  "Any entry with intent to commit a crime will do."  That 
13  is not true.  You can enter your own house with the 
14  intent to commit a crime.  That is not burglary in 
15
16  the intent to commit a crime and that's not burglary if 
17  they know you intend to do that. 
18
19  in Gauze is that the entry must invade a possessory 
right in a building.  And that cuts in your favor, 
20
21  because that's not having different ways of committing a 
22  crime, that's what the word in the statute means. 
23
24
25

 MR. HORWICH:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  So now you're ahead. 
But the difficulty I think is, as I understand it, that 

California.  You can enter somebody else's house with 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  True.  But what they said 

34
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

because generic burglary is defined in part there to 

1  invading a possessory interest includes -- includes 
2  going into a shop with an intent to steal something, a 
3  shoplifter.  Now, you could go back to the Blackmun 
4  opinion and you can say, ah, that falls right within it, 
5
6  include generic, an unprivileged remaining in the 
7  building.  And you say, you see, these are the same. 
 Were it not for two facts.  The first fact 
8
9  is in Shepard it seems as if the Court says shoplifting 
is not burglary.  And then you look to the treatise that 
10
11 
they cite for that, which is LaFave, and LaFave makes 
that even more clear.  And says, no, when you talk about 
12 
13 
remaining, what we're thinking of is hiding in a bank 
and not going into what used to be Jordan Marsh and 
14 
staying overnight, or not even staying overnight, but 
15
16 
just putting a few toothbrushes in there.

3
4  back to -- I don't think we're back to -- I don't think 
we're back to any real problem here, because the -- the 
5
6  Court should not be seeking a rule here that turns on 
7  some idiosyncrasy of how State law is phrased or 
8  announced.  The Court should be looking --

11  Because you are asking us to determine or to have courts 
12  below determine what are or are not definitions that the 
13  judiciary is applying to means versus mode, et cetera? 
14
 MR. HORWICH:  Well, we're not asking the 
Court to draw any distinctions among those.  I guess 
15
16  what -- what I'm saying is the government's test is --
17  is that in applying the modified categorical approach to 
18  a conviction entered upon a guilty plea, the Court 
19  should be looking at what the -- what the legal basis 
20
21  Shepard, "the matters" -- "the factual matters the 
22  defendant necessarily admitted."  That's -- that's what 
23  Shepard says.  And Shepard -- Shepard draws an

25

for the prior conviction was, which is, in the words of 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Your approach creates its

 MR. HORWICH:  Yes, it is a different result. 

the prosecutor equally could have said, he broke and 
entered one of the places enumerated in the statute. 
And that too would have been vague and that wouldn't 
have allowed the sentencing court to classify it as 
generic burglary. 

That -- the possibility that the Shepard 

Completely different result under your theory; isn't 

1  own idiosyncrasies.  I mean, suppose the same plea 
2  colloquy had taken place and the prosecutor, instead of 
3  saying -- you know, the defendant broke and entered, he 
4  had said, the defendant unlawfully entered, right? 
5
6  that right?

1  the word "or" in the statute or looking for separately 
2  numbered subsections and then they confront cases like 
3  the statutory rape example in our brief, where the State 
4  statute of conviction provides that the victim of a 
statutory rape has to be under the age of 18, but maybe 
5
6  the generic offense says that the victim has to be under 
7  the age of 16. 
 Now, that element of age isn't phrased in 
8
9  the disjunctive, but it seems very strange that if the 
defendant admits to his victim being under -- age 14, 
10
11 
that we wouldn't recognize that.

 Those would be perfectly valid instructions,

15
16  not refer to elements.  There is a part that refers to

18  thing.  But here the relevant text of the statute asks 
19  the Court to determine does the defendant have a 
previous conviction for a crime that is burglary.  Here 
20
21  the defendant has a previous conviction for breaking and 
22  entering a grocery store, that's the basis on which he 
23  was convicted, and breaking and entering a grocery 
24  store is generic burglary.

4  plea colloquy.  And in this plea colloquy, the 
prosecutor said, he broke and entered a grocery store. 
5
6  He says nothing.  In the typical Rule 11 setting, when 
7  the judge goes through the series of questions, the

18  true that the words didn't come out of the defendant's

fairly understand, as the Ninth Circuit has and other

2  there's a crime qualifying under ACCA, why should it be 
3  enough that the prosecutor said something?  Why 
4  shouldn't the defendant have to say, yes, I broke and

18 
19 
20
21 
22 
 MR. HORWICH:  Here's -- here's the relevance 
23
24  of it.  It's because at common law, of course, there was 
25

that there is a strange Gauze case which says that you 
can't burglarize your own home -- right -- the fact that 
the Court happens to come across that case and happens 
to decide -- it seems completely irrelevant as to this 
matter whether or not the California court once decided 
that you can't burglarize your own home.  What does that 
have to do with anything in this case? 

 MR. HORWICH:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- but -- you know, the fact

entries by threat and so forth. 

Gauze -- taken with subsequent decisions about 
shoplifting and such -- explains California just did 
that one better by adding another category, which is 
entries that exceed the implied consent to enter public 
places for lawful purposes. 

So what you're left with here is, this case 

 Gauze -- and the reasoning in Gauze explains 

1  recognized in Taylor, and in going back to the LaFave 
2  treatise in -- in Taylor, that requirement had over the 
3  years and into modern statutes been relaxed to include 
4  not only strict breakings, but also entries by fraud, 
5
6
7  that the California legislature's codification of 
8  burglary simply does that relaxation a little bit 
9  better, by adding essentially one more category of

exists at the -- the common law core that both 
California and generic burglary retain, which is an 
entry by break -- an entry by breaking.  And it is true 
that both generic burglary is dispensed with that 
requirement, in the sense that it allows other things to 
qualify, and so, too, California has dispensed with that 
requirement, but it hasn't completely eliminated the 
relevance entirely of the lawfulness of the entry. 
There's still a question there.  It's simply easier to 
satisfy it --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Let me quickly ask you this 

Now, go back and read the Blackmun opinion, and it 


MR. HORWICH:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  The one possible difference 

1
2  then, you say look at Gauze for this reason, it makes 
3  clear that in these words of the California statute, 
4  there must be an interference with a possessory interest. 
5

7  unprivileged entry or remaining into a building.  You 

8  say now, between those two forms of words, there is

19  those last words; and therefore, I begin to think maybe 
it is a factor.  And if it is a factor, then I'm afraid 
20
21  I'm then leaning in favor of saying there is a big 
22  difference in the California statute in generic 
23  burglary.

 MR. HORWICH:  Exactly. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And as to shoplifting, here 

 But if you could tell me, no, there are 

other shoplifting statutes, this is never or hardly ever

 MR. HORWICH:  Well, I can't --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  You see why I turn back to

7  time -- get the sentencing committee, get someone to

MR. HORWICH:  I can --

12  who -- who anticipate committing these crimes, so that 
13  they will know which crimes carry another 30 years. 
14

17  don't think I can give you a statistical survey.  The 
18  only thing I can offer, and I offer it with some 
19  hesitation, is my conversations with California 
20
21  generally disinclined to charge shoplifting as burglary, 
22  because it's a lot easier, and effectively gets them the 
23  same result in those cases, to charge it as larceny.

7  is very hard to prove they had the intent when they went 
8  into the store. 
9
10
11
 MR. HORWICH:  It does, but it -- in exactly 
12  the same way that automobile burglaries come under this 
13  statute.  The statute is broader as to the place 
14  burgled, it's broader as to the types -- types of 
15
16
17  when the defendant, as Petitioner did here, says my 
18  crime was breaking and entering -- to recognize it as 
19  breaking and entering, which is all we think Shepard 
20
21
22  beyond that.  We're not saying that a defendant who's 
23  pleading guilty to criminal trespass who says it was 
24  breaking and entering and I intended to go steal 
25

something in there, you can't then call that burglary, 

unlawfulness of entry.

the difference is between entering the garage with 
permission and taking a wrench and walking out, and 
entering a store with permission and taking an article 
of clothing.  Are they both shoplifting? 

1  because the additional admission to intent is not 
2  germane to the conviction for criminal trespass.  So you 
3  can't use that and turn that into generic burglary. 
 That answers the hypothetical that was 
4
raised about someone who enters a plea bargain to 
5
6  possession of controlled substances instead of 
7  distribution.  That -- that answers a great many of the

have the consent of the garage's owner to -- who knows 
that you're going to take the wrench, no, they are the 
same.  Those are the same thing. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They are the same thing. 
So in answer to Justice Breyer's question, you do admit 
that under the California definition of burglary, 
shoplifting could be charged. 

 MR. HORWICH:  Shoplifting could be charged, 
and someone could plead guilty to shoplifting, and that

MR. HORWICH:  Yes, we agree. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There are some. 
 MR. HORWICH:  Absolutely.  You can be 

and Shepard suggests is one that focuses on what the 
defendant necessarily admitted in offering the legal 
basis for his conviction rather than on hypotheticals 
about other conduct he might have committed that would 
have resulted in the same conviction. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What seems to me perhaps 

1  wouldn't count.  The problem here is that --

4  convictions for shoplifting under the statute.

clearest about this case and others is that this

extremely complicated, and occasionally produces results 
that seem to make no sense whatsoever.  Was this 
inevitable?  Is this really what Congress intended, or

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAN B. JOHNSON 

1  this problem is largely the product of lower courts 

2  trying to draw very fine formalized 

3  angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin distinctions about the

 One thing I would like to point.  There is a 
14  lot of discussion about shoplifting, as if that's one of 
the only problem areas we have.  On page 9 of our reply

17  other -- California burglaries.  And I don't -- it's

21  entry into homes.  That is not an unprivileged entry, 
22  and it's not a trespass. 
23
24  just saying that -- that shoplifting is the only problem 
25

 I think -- I think that -- limiting it to 

 California burglary, it's -- those examples 

are just a few examples how burglary is consensual 

we have, I don't believe that's the case.

 MR. JOHNSON:  I agree with that, and I think 

1
2  answer by Mr. Horwich to the last question was, it would 
3  be simpler if we hadn't done the modified categorical 
4  approach; but the reality is we have a statute.  The 
active statute that defines violent felony not with 
5
6  respect to a felony that involved dangerous conduct, but 
7  as any crime punishable by imprisonment that has an 
8  element that threatened use of physical force.  So it's 
9  not what the Court created, it's what the statute 
10
11
12  that -- I -- I don't think anything has changed in --
13  since -- in the last 22 years for the Court to step away 
14  from Taylor.  In fact, I think the recent developments 
15
16  fact-finding. 
17
18  burglary have the element of using force or threatening 
19  to use of force? 
20
21
