 MR. McCONNELL:  And that's the sole

 MR. McCONNELL:  So, the -- first of all, the 
disclosure statute is a -- describes in layman's terms,

12  liability section, which is set out in 1679g and which 
13  tells us exactly what Congress had in mind in creating a 
14  cause of action.
 And when you look at the language of the 
15
16  actual operative provision, 1679g, it's almost as if 
17  Congress deliberately went out of its way to use 
18  language that would not preclude arbitration.  That 
19  language provides that a person who violates the statute 
20

22  different, Mr. McConnell.  Suppose the disclosure 
23  provision didn't exist at all, but that instead of that 
24  liability provision, you had a provision that simply 
said:  Any person injured by a violation of this Act 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose it said something 

shall be liable to the persons --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. McConnell, you 

action which is a right to sue does not preclude 
arbitration, because --

1  will have a right of action or will have a right to sue 
2  under this statute.  And then you had the waiver 
3  provision that you have in this statute.  Is that 
4  enough?
 MR. McCONNELL:  Justice Kagan, I think that 
5
6  would be exactly the same, because a cause of action and 
7  a right to sue are the same thing.  They mean the same 
8  thing.  And this Court has consistently since Mitsubishi 
9  held that just because Congress creates a cause of 
10
11 
12
13  started with the notion that the disclosure provision in 
14  the statute is meant to apply to ordinary people, and if 
15
16  have a right to sue," wouldn't they understand that to 
17  mean I have a right to sue in court? 
 MR. McCONNELL:  Justice Ginsburg, in the 
18
19  ADEA context, the government itself, the EEOC, sends 
discriminated-against workers a right-to-sue letter that 
20
21  tells them they have a right to sue.  But this Court has 
22  twice said that that does not preclude arbitration.  And 
23  that's because a right to sue is simply a cause of 
24  action.  It doesn't actually -- that doesn't mean 
25

an ordinary person not schooled in the law read "you 

exclusively a right to be in court.  It gives you rights

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can you imagine any 

 MR. McCONNELL:  Yes, Justice Alito, I can 

agreements that provide for the vindication even of 

agreement other than language that expressly prohibits 
the waiver of the right to sue in court in favor of 
arbitration? 

1  which may be vindicated, and there are various ways in 
2  which they can be vindicated.  And the Federal 
3  Arbitration Act provides that the -- that this Court or 
4  that the courts must enforce private contractual 
5
6  statutory rights through arbitration. 
7
8  statutory language that would eliminate the right, the 
9  ability of the parties to enter into an arbitration 
10
11 
12 
13
14  imagine it.  Now, Congress has to date not used it. 
Congress knows perfectly well how to bar arbitration. 
15
16  They've done it in a number of statutes.  In fact, in 
17  the very Congress that enacted CROA, there were three 
18  different statutes that were proposed that would have 
19  eliminated arbitration for particular statutory schemes. 
20
21
22  this.  I don't think they have to use the magic words 
23  "no arbitration," but -- but they certainly have to do 
24  something considerably more direct than this.
25

None of them were adopted. 

 But Congress is perfectly aware of how to do 

 Here they've created a statute that provides

That's lawyers' language.  But when ordinary people talk 
about this, they think that's a right to sue.  But a 
cause of action and a right to sue are exactly the same 
thing. 

1  that there must be liability and creates a cause of 
2  action, and then they tell people in a separate

4  the drafting process, right -- simply to tell people

15
16  distinction between procedural rights and substantive 
17  rights, which you invoke here.  But where does that 
18  distinction itself come from?  Because it seems very 
19  atextual in nature, that distinction, which does appear 
in the cases.  But when Congress talks about rights, why 
20
21  should we think of rights as limited to substantive 
22  rights rather than also procedural rights? 
23
24  waiver argument depends upon those particular cases; we 
have a second argument.  But, nonetheless, I think this 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. McConnell, the cases 
that you cite in support of your position rest on a 

 MR. McCONNELL:  First of all, only our 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  comes from the very long tradition, at least back to the 
2  1980s in Mitsubishi, of understanding that arbitration 
3  is a choice of a forum, but it must vindicate the 
4  substantive rights of the particular statute.
 So, this is the way courts have talked about 
5
6  the relationship between arbitration and the substantive 
7  statute.  So, you look at the statute, and you see what 
8  are the prohibitions, what are the substantive rights 
9  and so forth, and the arbitrators enforce all of those, 
but that the term rights does not include -- it does not 
10
11 
mean that there's an exclusively judicial forum, just 
that whoever is the decisionmaker is going to enforce 
12 
13 
exactly the same set of substantive rights which are in 
the statute.
14 
15
16  persuasive, Congress is perfectly aware that that's the 
17  way that this Court had been interpreting the words, 
18  because Gilmer, which interprets the very words "any 
19  rights" in an anti-waiver provision as not including 
20
21  enactment of this statute.  And we know Congress was 
22  aware of Gilmer, because in -- the very same Congress 
23  that passed CROA also considered a bill, considered and 
24  rejected, a bill that would have reversed the decision 
25

arbitration, happened just a few years, 5 years, before 

 But, Justice Kagan, even if that were not 

in Gilmer.

 So, Gilmer and the very question of -- of 

matter. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the -- the Act in 

language that was interpreted that way in Gilmer. 

1
2  arbitration was before this Congress, and they knew that 
3  the word "any rights" was interpreted by this Court the 
4  way that it was in Gilmer, and they used precisely the 
5
6
 And so, at this point, there's a vocabulary. 
7  It's like there's a glossary.  Congress is using it, and 
8  even if it may not be, you know, fully textual, as you 
9  say, that's -- that's the way Congress now addresses the 
10
11
12  Gilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as 
13  a right within the non-waivable provision. 
14
15
16  say anyone looking at the ADEA's language, which says 
17  that an aggrieved person may bring a civil action in 
18  court, anyone would say that that is a right to sue.  It 
19  is surely a right.
20
21  that statute in Pyett, this Court called it a right, a 
22  right, to a judicial forum.  Three times in the opinion, 
23  the Court refers to that as a "right."  And the fact 
24  that our statute here refers to a right to sue, rather 
25

than a right to bring a civil action, seems -- certainly 

 MR. McCONNELL:  That's true, Justice 

Ginsburg, and the question is, does it matter?  I would 

 And, indeed, when this Court interpreted 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Considering this, and considering the paltry 

basis in the text for -- for that conclusion, I don't 

1  against the backdrop -- recall, please, that the 
2  question here is whether Congress has explicitly 
3  abrogated the -- specifically disavowed, specifically 
4  barred the use -- the arbitrability of the -- of the 
contracts, and that all doubts are supposed to be 
5
6  resolved in favor of arbitrability, and the -- the 
7  statutes must be interpreted with a healthy regard for 
8  the policy in favor of arbitrability. 
9
10
11  see how the Ninth Circuit's decision can be withstood --
12  could be upheld. 
13
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think a --
14  the word "lawsuit" typically describes an arbitration

19  right to sue refer to a lawsuit?
 MR. McCONNELL:  It refers to a cause of 
20
21  action, Your Honor, you know, and we can call that a 
22  lawsuit, too.  I mean, often that's another layman's 
23  term for a cause of action.  But this Court has held I 
24  don't know how many times, I believe it's at least six 
25

 MR. McCONNELL:  I do not think so. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why doesn't a 

proceeding?  If you're subject to an arbitration, would 

times since -- since Mitsubishi, that just because 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  Congress creates a cause of action and says that it will 
2  be in court, that does not mean that that's -- that that 
3  does not preclude arbitration, that that creates a cause 
4  of action.
 And I think the -- the underlying logic of 
5
6  this is that the existence of a cause of action or of a 
7  right to sue, which I submit is a synonym for a cause of 
8  action, is -- is not inconsistent with arbitration; it's 
9  the precondition for arbitration.  If there were not a 
cause of action, there would be nothing to arbitrate, 
10
11 
right?  So, in every case in which there's a legal 
arbitration, there's a cause of action.  It might arise 
12 
13 
from contract, it might arise from a statute, but in 
every single arbitration, there is a cause of action. 
14 
If this Court were to interpret --
15
16
17  to be read by and understood by lawyers, I think you 
18  would have a stronger argument.  But this is meant for 
19  consumers, and they read "you have a right to sue, and 
that right is not waivable."  A right to sue -- they're 
20
21  not going to think about cause of action.  They don't 
22  know what cause of action is.  But they do know that a 
23  right to sue is a right to bring a lawsuit. 
24
25

 MR. McCONNELL:  Justice Ginsburg, again, if 
that is so, it would apply to other cases in which the 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, if this were written

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. McCONNELL:  Well, what the statute says 

 MR. McCONNELL:  It's in the regulations, 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but Title VII 

doesn't mean that Congress has --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that in -- is that in 

1  language "right to sue" is used.  For example, the 
2  EEOC's right-to-sue letters, what could be more explicit 
3  than that?  But this Court has held several times that 
4  just because the EEOC sends a right-to-sue letter 
5
6
7  the statute?  Or is it just a colloquial --
8
9  Your Honor.
10
11  doesn't say "right to sue."  It's a name that the agency 
12  uses, but it's not -- it's not in the statute.  The 
13  statute doesn't say you have a right to sue. 
14
15
16  Court -- I do not see how the Court can say that the 
17  right -- that the language "the right to sue" is 
18  different from a right of action.  It certainly -- it's 
19  -- it is the same thing.
20
21  it is that the right to sue is more familiar 
22  colloquially.  If somebody, you know, hits your car and 
23  you jump out angrily and say -- you can say:  I'm going 
24  to sue you.  You're not likely to say:  I'm going to

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. McCONNELL:  We have -- there is no 

1
2
3  reason to think that when Congress appended a disclosure 
4  provision toward the end of the drafting of this statute 
and simply used a colloquial version of cause of action 
5
6  so that ordinary people would understand it, that they 
7  intended to change the meaning of the operative 
8  provision.  The operative provision tells us, I think 
9  very clearly, what Congress meant, and then in this sort 
10

13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  agreement, if Smith and Jones agree to arbitrate and 
20
21  stayed pending arbitration, has there been a breach of 
22  the arbitration agreement simply by bringing the suit? 
23
24
25

of quick shorthand, colloquial way, they're telling 
people, yes, they have an action, but just like they 
have an action -- persons have an action under the 
Sherman Act, they have an action under RICO, they have 
an action under the ADEA, they have an action under the 
Truth in Lending Act.  In all of these cases, people 
have a right to sue, but this Court has held that 
arbitration vindicates the cause of action. 

 MR. McCONNELL:  I don't --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, doesn't that 

happen rather often? 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In a standard arbitration 

Jones then brings suit in court, and that action is then

whether to enforce the arbitration clause or not. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And, of course, suits are 

 MR. McCONNELL:  Exactly.  Exactly.  So, in 

 MR. McCONNELL:  It does happen rather often. 

1
2  I'm not sure what the -- I would say no.  What I would 
3  say is that the -- is that the question of arbitrability 
4  has been put before the court, and the court will decide 
5
6
7  brought after arbitration to enforce the arbitration 
8  award. 
9
this sense, it's not that the cause of action goes away. 
10
11  It's not the -- the cause of action is not being waived. 
12  It's simply being vindicated in a different way, in a 
13  way which Congress in the Arbitration Act has told us is 
14  perfectly appropriate, just as appropriate as a -- as 
vindication in Court and that we should leave it to --
15
16  and that a contract between the parties to decide which 
17  of the forums for vindication of their rights would be 
18  used should be enforced. 
19
20
21  contracts.  So, the consumer doesn't really elect 
22  arbitration.  It's just presented as part of the terms 
23  that the consumer can take or leave and not negotiated. 
24
 MR. McCONNELL:  That is an argument against 
arbitration that this Court has rejected several times. 
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Except that this is not 
what the parties decide.  These are take it or leave it 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's a question of 

 MR. McCONNELL:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, 

1
2  whether we take that into account in -- in determining 
3  what "you have a right to sue" means. 
4
Congress -- that's a policy question, and Congress has 
5
6  given us an answer.  Recently, by the way, Congress has 
7  indicated a slightly different answer which will affect 
8  cases like this in the future.  As part of the 
9  Dodd-Frank regulatory reform bill, Congress required the 
new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct a 
10
11  serious study of the use of arbitration procedures in 
12  consumer financial matters to find out whether things 
13  like what you referred to, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the 
14  types of contracts and so forth are fair to consumers.
 So, we'll get an authoritative answer to 
15
16  this.  And Congress then vested this new bureau with 
17  authority either to outlaw arbitration awards or to 
18  require conditions or to reform them.  But in the 
19  meantime, the policy that Congress has set is the policy 
in the Federal Arbitration Act, which is one of a strong 
20
21  policy in favor of enforcing arbitration contracts. 
22
23  indicates otherwise and --
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, except if Congress 

 MR. McCONNELL:  Unless Congress has 

indicated otherwise.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I guess that the problem 

contract. 

 And that seems a very different kind of 

they're going to end up resolving their disputes, and it 

1
2  here is that there is this language in this disclosure 
3  provision which is meant, you know, truly to inform 
4  consumers about -- about their rights and about where 
5
6  says "you have a right to sue."  And you're asking us 
7  essentially to read that language as:  You have a right 
8  to bring a claim in court, but it's probably going to 
9  end up in arbitration because of the nature of your form 
10
11
12  statement to consumers. 
13
 MR. McCONNELL:  Justice Kagan, I do not see 
14  how it would be any different from a consumer who reads 
any of the statutes that this Court has held are subject 
15
16  to arbitration.  If, for example, in the Truth in 
17  Lending Act, which this Court interpreted in the Green 
18  Tree case that as part of the arbitration contract, it 
19  was required to send the consumer a copy of the statute. 
The consumer would read in the statute that there's a 
20
21  cause of action, that they can bring suit in court to 
22  enforce their rights under the Truth in Lending Act. 
23
24  draw exactly the same conclusion that they do from the 
25

shorthand layman's language of "a right to sue." 

 They would read that statute, and they would

 Unless there are further questions, I will 

 But, again, even if that were so, I think as 

1
2  a matter of -- of how -- of statutory interpretation, 
3  that a disclosure provision cannot change the meaning of 
4  the operative section.  The operative section which 
creates the rights and liabilities here is section 
5
6  1679g.  And not even Respondents seriously claim that 
7  that section is -- shows a congressional intent to 
8  prevent arbitrability.  And that seems -- the fact that 
9  there's a disclosure provision that uses more informal 
language instead of the lawyers' language used in 1679g 
10
11 
does not change the meaning of the statute. 
12
13  reserve the remaining part of my time for rebuttal. 
14
15
16
17
18
19  please the Court:
 The Credit Repair Organizations Act provides 
20
21  consumers with what it explicitly denominates a right to 
22  sue, and then it says that any right of the consumer 
23  under the statute is non-waivable.  As this Court has 
24  said --

9  are waivers made unenforceable, but it is -- it is 
prohibited to ask someone to waive their rights. 
10
11
 However, that does not mean that you 
12  actually have a cause of action to go in and sue 
13  somebody for that, because, remember, under 1679g, what 
14  you can sue for is your money back.  If somebody's asked 
15
16  didn't pay them any money.  Or your damages -- if 
17  somebody asked you for a waiver and you never signed up

19  punitive damages in addition, which -- you know, the

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, doesn't that 

reading. 

1  some onerous penalty imposed on a company merely for 
2  asking for a waiver. 
3
4  reading, however, make suspect your claim that Congress 
would have intended -- without any discussion in the 
5
6  legislative history -- and our case law has said you 
7  have to read the intent to bar arbitration both from the 
8  language of the statute, its context, and its history. 
9  I just don't see any history here that supports your 
10
11
 MR. NELSON:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, I want 
12  to take that in two parts, because the first was -- was 
13  tied to the -- the attempt to procure a waiver and 
14  whether that calls into question whether Congress really 
15
16  provision to say not only can you not waive rights, but 
17  it's a violation even to ask somebody to waive them. 
 But that's no more unusual with respect to 
18
19  the right to sue than with respect to any other right 
under this statute.  For example, the right to cancel 
20
21  after 3 days.  Everybody would concede, I think, that 
22  that's a non-waivable right under the clear language of 
23  this statute.  It's an unusual and perhaps onerous 
24  provision to say that if somebody just suggested that 
you waive that right to cancel and you never actually 
25

could have meant this.  It's sort of an unusual 

19

 But, you know, that's what Congress wrote 

relation to the people that it was -- it was trying to 

1  waived it, they still violated the statute. 
2
3  here, because in this statute, it was concerned with an 
4  industry that it saw as overreaching pervasively in 
5
6  sign up for its services.  And that's why Congress 
7  wanted a very strong prohibition of waiver of rights 
8  that even attempted -- that even extended to attempts.

12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
 MR. NELSON:  First of all, the -- the rules 
18
19  are not that Congress has to be especially clear in this 
context.  And, in fact, the Court has said over and over 
20
21  in the line of cases starting with Mitsubishi, McMahon, 
22  Rodriguez de Quijas, and Gilmer that what has to be 
23  discernible -- and this also gets back to Justice 
24  Sotomayor's question -- it merely has to be discernible 
25

 Now, as to the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Nelson, but your 
friend Mr. McConnell says quite rightly that the rules 
in this area have been fairly clear, that Congress knew 
it had to make especially clear that it wanted to void 
arbitration agreements.  So, if that's the case, why 
didn't Congress do what it has done in a thousand other 
statutes -- or maybe that's an overstatement -- but a 
number of other statutes, which is to say so? 

from the text or the legislative history or the

 That's not an unmistakable plain statement 

rule; it's not a requirement of explicitness in the 

 What this Court said, what it told Congress 
in the years leading up to this statute is:  You have to 

1  structure and policies of the Act that -- that there's 
2  an intent to preclude waiver of the right to judicial 
3  remedies. 
4
5
6  sense of explicitly using the term "arbitration."  As 
7  even my friend stated, there's no requirement of magic 
8  words. 
9
10
11  express a discernible intent to preclude waiver of the 
12  right to judicial remedies. 
13
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  And -- and you 
14  don't need a magic word, but it seems to me you need 
something more than a provision dealing with what you 
15
16  have to tell to the people who -- who accept these 
17  contracts.  I mean it's not in the substantive part of 
18  the statute.  It's in the part of the statute that tells 
19  you what provisions of the -- of the Act you have to 
notify the consumer of.  It's a very strange way for 
20
21  Congress to say "no arbitration" by putting this 
22  language in a section that has nothing to do with the 
23  rights under the Act. 
24
25

 MR. NELSON:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is intended to be a 

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  summary of the rights under the Act. 
2
 MR. NELSON:  Justice Scalia, I think it's --
3  I think it's not a strange way at all but a very direct 
4  way in the context here.  Remember, in Gilmer, what the 
Court was dealing with was a statute that as amended in 
5
6  an amendment that actually wasn't before the Court in 
7  Gilmer said you can't waive any right under the statute. 
8  But that then raises a question:  Well, what do we mean 
9  by rights under this statute?  And the Court concluded 
there and reinforced in Pyett that it interpreted that 
10
11 
to mean substantive rights; in the absence of a textual 
indication, that when Congress used the term "rights" in 
12 
13 
this statute, it was intending to protect the procedural 
right to go to court.
14 
15
16  Congress creates a cause of action which, as my friend 
17  says, colloquially someone could call that a right if 
18  they wanted to.  But the cause of action says you can --
19  you can obtain this liability; the court will determine 
20
21  gives you an entitlement to go to court.  But Congress 
22  then goes further and it denominates that one of the 
23  rights under this statute, one of only two rights under 
24  this statute that are so-called.
25

it; you obtain it through an action.  That certainly 

 Here we have something very different. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think that Gilmer 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. NELSON:  Yes, they are definitely 

1  would have come out differently with regard to one of 
2  the procedural rights involved in that case if the 
3  statute had happened to refer to that procedural right 
4  as a right?  Procedural rights are rights, aren't they?
5
6  rights, and --
7
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, and if the statute in 
8  Gilmer had referred to one of the procedural rights in 
9  passing as a right, you think that one would have been 
10
11
 MR. NELSON:  I think that if Congress had 
12  expressly denominated something in that statute as a 
13  right --
14
15
16
17  Does "any right" refer to both procedural and 
18  substantive rights? 
19
20
21  that it did not in Pyett.  But when Congress -- you 
22  know, it does matter what words Congress uses, and 
23  "rights" is a word that can have a lot of meanings. 
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.
 MR. NELSON:  Which is what this Court held 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but --
MR. NELSON:  This is a statute that --

non-waivable? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But procedural rights are 

rights.  I mean, to denominate it as a right is --

 MR. NELSON:  Well, but the question is: 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you're saying -- in 

 MR. NELSON:  I think if Congress makes clear 

about rights is -- includes procedural rights, and then 
it has a provision that says any right under this 
statute is not subject to waiver, that creates a very 
strong inference that Congress meant what it said.  But, 
in fact --

1
2  answer to my question, you're saying that just because 
3  the statute refers to procedural rights as rights, just 
4  as we do, all of a sudden, simply because the statute 
uses our normal language, those procedural rights are 
5
6  elevated to the level of substantive rights and can't be 
7  waived.  That can't be right.

19  Congress has said -- I mean, many of these statutes such 
20
21  non-waivable.  This statute is a unique statute in its 
22  phrasing.  It has a non-waiver provision applicable to 
23  any right, and it has a list of rights.  That's pretty 
24  unusual.
25

as Title VII and TILA don't say that rights are 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think that 

referring to a procedural right as a right creates any 
inference at all.  It is a right. 

 MR. NELSON:  It is a right, and when 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What else is non-waivable 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. NELSON:  Well, the other thing that this 

1  besides the 3 days to back out? 
2
3  statute makes non-waivable besides rights is 
4  protections, and -- which is a phrase that isn't then 
tied to anything defined in the statute.  But I think 
5
6  that, for example, all of the prohibited practices 
7  listed in section 1679b, which are at pages 4a to 5a of 
8  the red brief -- those would be non-waivable.  You 
9  couldn't waive your right not to have the credit repair 
organization make false statements to you.  You couldn't 
10
11 
waive your right under 1679b(b) not to have to make a 
payment in advance to a credit repair organization.  You 
12 
13 
can't waive the right to the disclosures provided for in 
1679c or the protection provided by those disclosures. 
14 
And 1679d requires written contracts and specifies those 
15
terms.  Those would all be subject to the provision in 
16 
17 
the statute that says you can't waive any protection or 
any right provided by the statute. 
18 
19
20
21  know of any other statute that arguably voids 
22  arbitration agreements without saying that they're 
23  voiding -- that it's voiding an arbitration agreement? 
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you know, Mr. Nelson, 
whether this statute is unique in this sense:  Do you 

 MR. NELSON:  No.  There's a -- sort of a 

pending disagreement, perhaps, over whether the

 But you remind me of your earlier question, 

1  Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act does, but that's because of 
2  some very specific language in that statute about 
3  informal dispute resolution mechanisms and the manner in 
4  which that has been interpreted in agency regulations. 
So, this is really the only statute that I'm aware of 
5
6  that uses this formulation. 
7
8  which I never got to finish answering about the 
9  thousands of other statutes that say specifically that

13 
14

16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21  never before been a statute that prohibited the 
22  enforcement specifically of an arbitration agreement in 
23  those terms.  And as Mr. McConnell said, there were some 
24  proposals, unenacted proposals, that had been floated at 
25

you can't enforce arbitration agreements.  In fact, 
there are very few such statutes.  There were none at 
the time this statute was enacted.  The first one 
appeared 6 years later.  The only time that there has 
been any number of them is in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, 
which came after what I would say is a lengthy period of 
considerable attention that had been paid by advocates 
before Congress to the issue of arbitration that I think 
led to the desire to use as sort of a belt and 
suspenders approach in those statutes.

 But what we had here in 1996, there had 

that time.  But I think the one thing that is clear is

considered agreements to settle, absent very special 
either statutory language such as in the ADEA, which 
does apply a waiver provision to some types of 
settlements, and in the Fair Labor Standards Act, where 
there's a very specific policy reason for prohibiting 
certain kinds of settlements.  But, generally, the Court 
has not considered the settlement of a case to be a 
waiver of the right to bring the case.  And that 
primarily came in the FELA cases that we cited in our 
briefs.

 And that's why I think when Congress enacted 

backdrop and would not have -- no one would have thought 
that a settlement agreement is a waiver of the right to 
sue.  A settlement agreement is a resolution of the 
right to sue. 

 And in McMahon and Rodriguez de Quijas, what 
1
2  the Court disagreed with Wilko v. Swan about was whether 
3  the right to sue under that particular statute was 
4  non-waivable.  But it favorably commented on the notion 
5

7  settling an actually pending dispute.

20
21
22  necessarily contemplates an alternative dispute

24  would bar -- when someone goes to court to compel 
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Another argument that is

comprehends arbitrators and maybe even one might have

6  thought was principally applicable to them, you've got

21  provision; but if the consumer then defended and said, 
22  wait a second, this contract is void because I never got 
23  the right to cancel, the provision would quite clearly 
24  prevent the arbitrator in that circumstance from saying 
25

organization from requiring a consumer to arbitrate the 
credit repair organization's breach of contract action. 
And, in fact, most -- well over 99 percent of the 
consumer arbitrations that were handled by the 
arbitration forum that was designated in this contract 
were collection actions brought by a company that says 
this consumer owes me some money.

and this goes to Justice --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's 

that you have to proceed to arbitration? 

1
2  argument that the consumer retains the right to sue, 
3  since they can go into court with their complaint, but 
4  it's simply -- the rule that the court will apply is 
5
6
 MR. NELSON:  Well, I think it's -- it would 
7  be a remarkably crabbed notion of having a right to sue 
8  that meant you could file a complaint that was 
9  mandatorily subject to decision elsewhere.  And, second, 
10
11
12  frequently -- that's frequently the way these issues 
13  come up.  I mean, people --
14
15
cannot be forced to arbitrate either under the agreement 
16 
or any other provision, they'll bring their complaint in 
17 
court, and then there will be a judicial resolution of 
18 
whether or not the proceeding should go to arbitration.
19 
 MR. NELSON:  But -- but all that has been 
20
21  resolved in that -- that suit is not the plaintiff's 
22  claim under CROA, which is what he has a right to sue 
23  on.  All that's resolved is the issue of whether he has 
24  a contractual obligation to arbitrate which he has

3  has filed a complaint that is in breach of an agreement

6  to sue.  You can't stop them from going and filing a 
7  complaint, but once they do, you come in and say, no, 
8  you have no right to -- to proceed on the merits with 
9  this claim in court.  And, in fact, that's -- that's 
10
11
12  damages in the arbitration for the cost of attorney's 
13  fees to go to the court to say that you had to go to the 
14  arbitration?
15
16  generally have that entitlement under any -- any rule of 
17  law that is -- that is normally applicable in American 
18  courts.  However, if your -- if your arbitration 
19  agreement provided for that -- I'm afraid I can't point 
to any decision that would make it unenforceable, much 
20
21  as I would regret that result. 
 So, you know, I think in a -- in a real 
22
23  sense, the consumer has no right to -- right to sue 
24  merely because they can run into court and -- and then 
be compelled to arbitrate.  And that's exactly why this 
25

exactly what the arbitration --

 MR. NELSON:  No, I don't think you would

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You agree, I take 

 MR. NELSON:  Yes.  I -- you know, a cause of 

over again in McMahon, Rodriguez de Quijas, Mitsubishi, 

1  Court, in every one of its decisions enforcing 
2  arbitration agreements or not, has referred to the 
3  arbitration agreement as a waiver of the right to 
4  proceed judicially.  It has used that phrase over and 
5
6  and -- and Gilmer itself. 
7
 The -- the common recognition of all those 
8  cases is that the arbitration agreement is a waiver of 
9  the person's right to proceed in court.
10
11  it, that you would lose if the statute said "you have a 
12  cause of action"? 
13
14  action I don't think would -- would do it for us.  In 
fact, that's exactly what the ADEA says, the section 
15
16  that creates a judicial remedy is headed "Cause of 
17  Action."  And so, you know, the question again is 
18  "right" is a word that -- that can be used in many 
19  senses.  It's -- it's a word sort of like 
20
21  when Congress says a right is non-waivable, it's 
22  referring to something specific.  And the question is: 
23  What is it referring to in a statute that uses the term 
24  "right" and uses it to describe the -- the ability to go 
25

"jurisdiction."  It gets thrown around loosely.  But 

to court? 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And -- and, again, that "right to sue" 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well -- well, I guess it 

goes further than that, your argument does, it seems to 

the nature of the right.  It's a right to sue.  It's not 

1
2  language is important in two ways, because it not only 
3  specifies that the 1679g remedies are a right for 
4  purposes of this statute, but it says something about 
5
6  just a right to get those damages, to get your money 
7  back.  And "sue," as I -- and I think my friend 
8  agrees --
9
10
11  me.  Your argument is the waiver -- the non-waiver of 
12  rights provision would normally be read to mean 
13  non-waiver of substantive rights, but the notice given 
14  to the consumer here, which refers to the procedural 
right to sue as a "right," eliminates that presumption. 
15
16
 So, I presume, therefore, that your position 
17  is that all procedural rights under this statute cannot 
18  be waived.  Because, I mean, that's what we're talking 
19  about:  What does "right" mean --
MR. NELSON:  Justice --
20
21
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- when it says rights are 
22  not waived?  And our prior case law says ordinarily that 
23  means only substantive rights.  But here in this 
24  statute, it refers to the right to sue, which is 
25

certainly a procedural right, as a right.  So, I presume 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. NELSON:  Well, I -- I'm not really sure 

substantive right. 

 But as far as procedural rights of the 

1  all the other procedural rights in this statute likewise 
2  cannot be waived. 
3
4  there are other procedural rights in the statute.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, there are none? 
5
6
 MR. NELSON:  I mean, unless -- the right to 
7  cancel within 3 days I suppose could be called a 
8  procedure in one sense, although it's -- it's -- I think 
9  it -- it probably would generally be categorized as a 
10
11
12  consumer, they are set forth in 1679g, and they are the 
13  right to bring an action either on an individual or 
14  class basis for the damages and attorney fees specified 
15
16  referred to as "the right to sue." 
17
18  statute that one might arguably call a right and 
19  arguably call procedural -- I mean, it's hypothetical 
because I don't think it's there, but I would not jump 
20
21  to the conclusion that it was a right if it was not 
22  comprehended by "right to sue," because I think what 
23  that statement "right to sue" makes non-waivable is the 
24  right to sue.  It's not just any procedural thing in 
25

in that section.  And that's what I think is being 

this statute that one might loosely call a right. 

 Now, if there were something else in the

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the case were 

 MR. NELSON:  Well --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that under 

1
2  reversed.  The liability section says you have a right 
3  to sue, and the disclosure section says you have a right 
4  to sue or go to arbitration.  What result then?
5
6
7  your -- well, I'll let you answer. 
 MR. NELSON:  Justice Kennedy, let me divide 
8
9  it up.  If the liability section said you had a right to

16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
22  the liability section said you have a right to sue, 
23  that's okay, but if it says you have a cause of action, 
24  that's not okay.  But the right to sue is really just a 
colloquial way of expressing the first.  So, why should 
25

sue and there were no disclosure -- disclosure section 
at all, I would say that's -- that's plenty good enough. 
If the disclosure section says, you have a right to sue 
or to go to arbitration, I think you would have to then 
say sensibly what is Congress talking about when it's --
when it's referring to this, and you would have to read 
them together.  And I would have a hard time standing up 
here and saying that a statute that told people "right 
to sue or arbitrate" meant right to sue only and 
foreclosed arbitration.  And -- and, you know, I think 
-- I think that really would be a very different matter.

even that courts normally use it but actually to -- to

3  "colloquial," I'm not -- I don't want to fence with you,

6  it in statutory terms, did it so people would have an 
7  understanding of what their rights were, and did it in a 
8  way that no reasonable consumer would understand meant, 
9  oh, this non-waivable right is not really to sue in the 
10
11 
12 
13
 So, I -- I don't think it's colloquial in --
14  in a disparaging sense.  What it is, is something that 
is designed to convey a clear meaning, and the clear 
15
16  meaning that it conveys is you have a right to go to 
17  court.  Now, of course, even a disclosure that you have 
18  a right to go to court wouldn't be enough to get you 
19  over the hump if you didn't also have a provision that 
20
21  have is both. 
 And -- and in doing that, in writing that 
22
23  statute, Congress was doing exactly what the Court had 
24  told it, it didn't do in Gilmer, it didn't do in

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. McConnell, can we go 

to the issue of the class action?  If we buy your

 Mr. McConnell, you have 10 minutes

10
11  argument that procedural and substantive rights are 
12  different, is it your position that you could seek a 
13  waiver of a class action even though this statute 
14  expressly contemplates class actions?
 MR. McCONNELL:  Actually, Justice Sotomayor, 
15
16  I think this statute specifically does not require -- it 
17  contemplates but does not require class actions.  If you 
18  look at -- at 1679g(a)(2)(B), which is the class action 
19  provision -- it's on page 59a of the appendix to the --
to the petition -- all that it says is that in the case 
20
21  of a class action, here is how we would -- here's how 
22  the damages, the punitive damages, would be calculated. 
23  It does not say that there must be class actions.  It 
24  doesn't make that a non-waivable right at all.
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, your answer to me is

 MR. McCONNELL:  Actually, my answer to you 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you have to meet 

to seek one.  But your position is that's not a 
protected right? 

1  that that is waivable.  That's not a right contemplated 
2  by the right to sue. 
3
4  is that it's not a right to begin with.

 MR. McCONNELL:  Whether waivable or not.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you have to meet the 
8
9  prerequisites of a class action before you are entitled 
10
11 
12
 MR. McCONNELL:  May I -- if we were to 
13  hypothesize that the statute did provide that there 
14  shall be class provisions, which this does not -- I 
15
16  hypothetical statute where class actions are 
17  contemplated, I would not argue that that is necessarily 
18  waivable.  What I would argue is that that can be 
19  vindicated through arbitration, that there can be -- as 
this Court discussed just last term in Concepcion, there 
20
21  can be class arbitration proceedings. 
22
23  arbitration agreement precludes class actions, doesn't 
24  it?
25

think this statute is agnostic on that, but the 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- but this 

 MR. McCONNELL:  Yes, it does.  And, again, 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. McCONNELL:  Yes, and that seems to me 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Unless --
 MR. McCONNELL:  -- statute that did.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Unless we read the
 

1  this statute does not require that there be class
 
2  proceedings.  I'm only addressing a hypothetical --
3
4
5
6  disclosure requirement of a right to sue to mean that
 
7  you're entitled to bring your action in court.  With
 
8  whatever protections, procedural and substantive
 
9  protections, that entails.

10
11  just a further reason not to interpret a disclosure 
12  provision with a layman's language as importing, you 
13  know, very specific legal notions, that -- I think this 
14  simply means -- right to sue simply means cause of 
15
16  out, in the disclosure provision is -- has its actual 
17  textual home elsewhere.  None of them are created in the 
18  disclosure provision.  Each of them is created 
19  elsewhere, either in this statute or another.  To find 
20
21  substantive provisions.  Here, you would look to 1679g, 
22  and you would see that class actions are possible but 
23  not required under this particular statute.

action.  And it's -- each of the rights, I should point 

out exactly what they entail, you look to the 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could you in an 

agreement waive the provisions of 1679g(b) that specify 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. McCONNELL:  I don't think so, 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, well what --

1  what a court shall consider in awarding punitive 
2  damages? 
3
4  Mr. Chief Justice.  Most lower courts treat the right to 
punitive damages as a substantive right which would not 
5
6  be waivable. 
7
8  what if you don't want your arbitrator to consider those 
9  four requirements?  Could you waive particular aspects? 
I mean, that tells you that -- first of all, it says, of 
10
11 
course, "the court shall consider"; but I take it your 
position is when they say "the court," they mean the 
12 
13 
court or arbitrator? 
14
15
16  might do, even though those statutes can be vindicated 
17  in arbitration.  Title VII, for example, has several 
18  provisions in which it says, if the court determines 
19  this, then it may do that, for example, issue 
20
21  substantive provisions of a statute into an arbitration 
22  proceeding, everything that would be substantively 
23  available from a court becomes available from -- from 
24  the arbitrator.  And that's the way I would read the

Many statutes of course refer to things that courts 

injunctions and so forth.  I -- when you import the

 I note, by the way -- if I might just 

 One is that under their reading, a
 

1
2  respond to a few of the points made by my friend in 
3  response to questions -- begin with Justice Sotomayor's 
4  interesting question about the fact that the statute 
appears to make even offering a waiver, offering an
 
5
6  arbitration clause, a violation.  It's actually even
 
7  worse than that for two reasons.
 
8
9  settlement is surely just as much a waiver as an
 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  said no, that their position doesn't suggest that, when 
20
21  settlement as well.  He said that their interpretation 
22  does not exclude a settlement in which the plaintiff 
23  agrees --
24
25

arbitration is.  Now, they say, oh, well, that only 
means post-dispute waivers.  But that is not what this 
statute says.  This statute is about all waivers.  In 
contrast to other statutes previously enacted, like the 
ADEA, which distinguish between pre-dispute and 
post-dispute waivers, this one does not.  So, their 
position suggests that even a settlement offer is a 
violation of this statute. 

 MR. McCONNELL:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, that 
was his answer, but what that tells us is that he is not 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, Mr. Nelson just 

I asked him about post-dispute and he brought up

 It would be much easier simply to follow the 

quoting Alice in Wonderland.  It's -- it's all about 

1  giving us a plain language meaning of the statute, which 
2  is all that they have, right?  Their entire position is 
3  based upon a plain language reading of the statute. 
4  Remember the way the Ninth Circuit begins its opinion by 
5
6  plain language.  But they do not offer us a plain 
7  language interpretation of this statute.  In order to 
8  avoid absurd consequences like making settlement offers 
9  a violation of the statute, they have to create 
exceptions, unspecified exceptions, to the text. 
10
11
12  rules of construction that this Court had announced 
13  before this statute was enacted and against which 
14  Congress operated.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, one of those 
15
16  rules of construction is that you don't read statutes 
17  when -- to the extent they lead to absurd results.  I 
18  mean, I think you can still say follow the plain 
19  language, but that doesn't mean you go so far as to say 
20
21
22  simply to assume that Congress was using words in the 
23  way that this Court used them in Gilmer just a few years 
24  before, that that's a much more straightforward way of 
25

you can't enter into a settlement. 

 MR. McCONNELL:  I think it's easier, though, 

reading the statute.

 MR. McCONNELL:  Just as I think you can say 

 The -- just a couple of other small points. 
 My friend points out that this is the first 

1
2  settlement is a waiver anyway.  It's a vindication.  You 
3  -- you vindicate your right to a settlement.  I don't 
4  know that you waive it.
5
6  that when you go to arbitration, you vindicate the 
7  substantive rights of the statute as well.  And, indeed, 
8  this Court has used that very language in Mitsubishi 
9  with respect to -- to arbitration.
10
11
12  statute in -- or that at the time of this statute in 
13  1996, that there had been no statute that explicitly 
14  barred arbitration, which is historically true but I 
15
16  Mitsubishi and then '91 in Gilmer that Congress became 
17  aware that it needed to do this in statutory causes of 
18  action.  In -- and by 1996, they were considering bills 
19  that explicitly voided arbitration clauses.  They 
20
21  Remember the political composition of Congress in 1996. 
22
 It is not surprising that statutes voiding 
23  arbitration agreements become more common when the 
24  political composition of the Congress changes.  This is 
fundamentally a political choice, and ought to be -- we 
25

think not particularly revealing.  It was only in '85 in 

weren't enacted, but this is for political reasons.
