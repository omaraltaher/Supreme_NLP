CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  No.  15­674,  United  States  v.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  GENERAL  DONALD  B.  VERRILLI,  JR. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  has 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  to  defer  removal  of  the  class  of  aliens  who  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parents  of  U.S.  citizens  and  LPRs,  have  lived  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country  continuously  since  2010,  and  not  committed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes.  That  policy  is  lawful  and  Respondents  concede 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  lawful.  It  is  fully  justified  by  the  fundamental 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reality  that  DHS  has  resources  only  to  remove  a  fraction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  unlawful  aliens,  the  aliens  presently  ­­ present 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawfully  in  the  country  now. 

 

 

 

 

            

This  class  of  aliens  is  the  lowest  priority. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  there  is  a  pressing  humanitarian  concern  in  avoiding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  breakup  of  families  that  contain  U.S.  citizen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children.

simply,  as  was  suggested  in  one  of  the  briefs,  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  these  children  ­­ parents  of  citizens  or  LPRs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  them  identity  cards  that  say  "low  priority,"  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  there  be  any  difference  between  that  and  what  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DAPA  Guidance  does? 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  That  is  ­­ that's  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

important  point,  Justice  Ginsburg.  That  ­­ that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely  what  deferred  action  is.  Deferred  action  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  that  you  were  ­­ that  you  are  a  low  priority 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  removal,  and  it's  an  official  notification  to  you  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  decision.  And  Respondents  have  conceded  that  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  lawful  authority  to  do  both  things:  To  make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  judgment  and  to  give  an  identification  card. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  General,  maybe  it 

  

 

 

 

 

would  make  logical  progression  if  you  began  with  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing  argument  first. 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes.  And  I  think  this 

   

  

  

 

 

does  lead  right  into  the  standing  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  the  principal  bone  of  contention 

 

 

 

 

 

between  the  ­­ the  Respondents  and  the  United  States  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  whether  the  Secretary  can  also  authorize  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  to  work  and  accrue  ancillary  benefits,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents  lack  standing  to  challenge  that  for  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental  reasons. 

 

            

First,  there's  ­­ the  injury  is  not

redressable,  because  even  if  they  achieve  the  ­­ even  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  achieve  the  injunction  that  they  want,  barring  us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  providing  work  authorization  ancillary  benefits,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can,  for  the  reason  Justice  Ginsburg  identified,  still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  them  with  deferred  action.  And  under  Texas  law, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  still  qualify  for  a  license  under  deferred  action, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  there's  no  redressability. 

 

 

 

            

Second,  they  have  not  alleged  a  concrete 

   

 

 

 

 

particularized  injury  because  the  costs  that  they  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  to  be  an  injury  are  actually  the  expected  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

desired  result  of  the  policy  that  exists  in  current 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  law  ­­

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  if  ­­ if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  change  that  policy  to  avoid  the  injury  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allege,  in  other  words,  if  they  did  not  confer  ­­ offer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driver's  licenses  to  those  who  are  lawfully  present 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  your  policy,  avoided  that  injury,  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue  them,  wouldn't  you? 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I'm  not  sure  at  all  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  would  sue  them.  It  would  depend  on  what  they  did. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  the  fundamental  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  no.  What  they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

did  ­­ I'm  hypothesizing  ­­ is  that  they  offered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driver's  license  to  everyone,  but  not  those  who  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  under  your  ­­ under  DAPA,  under  your  proposal.

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Chief  Justice,  the  key 

  

 

 

 

 

word  in  your  question  is  "hypothesize."  And  that's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  it  seems  to  me.  They  have  not  made  that  change 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  their  law.  What  they  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  because  they 

  

 

 

 

 

have  what  seems  to  me  a  perfectly  legitimate  policy,  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  want  driver's  license  to  be  available  to  people  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  lawfully  present  here.  And  if  you,  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  say,  well,  these  people  are  lawfully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present,  that  means  they  have  to  give  a  driver's  license 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  however  many  of  them,  more  than  half  a  million 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people,  who  would  be  potentially  eligible  for  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  as  I  understand  from  your  brief,  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

answer  is,  well,  just  don't  give  them  driver's  licenses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  The  current  policy  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

as  Your  Honor  describes  it.  The  current  policy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reflected  in  the  existing  law  and  regulation  is  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different,  and  that's  the  point.  They  will  give  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driver's  license  now  to  any  category  of  person  who  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

document  from  the  Federal  government,  not  only  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  lawfully  present,  but  that  you're  officially  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  officially  tolerating  your  presence. 

 

 

 

 

            

There  are  vast  numbers  of  people  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing  Texas  law  that  are  eligible  for  a  license  even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though  they  are  not  lawfully  present.  For  example,  the

State  of  Texas  said  this  policy  that  the  government  has

therefore,  we  will  not  issue  licenses  to  this  class  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persons? 

            

point  ­­

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  I  think  the 

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  seems  to  me  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  could  say  this  is  not  for  you  to  say. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  That's  correct.  We  could 

  

  

 

 

 

and  we  probably  would.  But  the  point  is,  they  haven't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done  it.  And  so  in  order  to  establish  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  that's  the  whole  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  this  suit,  isn't  it?  They  don't  want  to  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driver's  licenses  to  the  beneficiaries  of  DAPA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  I  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  unless  you  can  tell  us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  is  some  way  that  they  could  achieve  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  I  don't  see  how  there  is  not  injury  in  fact.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  disagree  with  which  part 

  

 

 

 

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  think  all  of  it. 

    

 

 

 

 

            

of  it? 

 

            

            

(Laughter.) 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Texas  law  and  policy  now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  express  that  judgment.  You  look  to  their  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  tell  you  what  their  policy  is  now,  and  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  is  now  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  General,  when  you  say 

  

 

 

 

 

that,  I'm  looking  at  their  law.  And  their  law  says  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  will  give  licenses  to  persons  granted  deferred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  on  the  basis  of  immigration  documentation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received  with  an  alien  number  and  from  the  government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  that's  what  ­­ you're  saying  they've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  made  the  determination  that  they'll  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

licenses  to  people  with  deferred  action. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes,  Justice  Sotomayor. 

  

 

 

 

That's  one  thing  I'm  saying  that's  quite  important,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  even  goes  beyond  that.  They're  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Oh,  but  they  want  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  that.  Is  there  anything  wrong  with  their  policy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  if  you're  lawfully  present,  you  ought  to  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driver's  license? 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No,  but  I  guess,  Mr.

policy,  as  it's  written  down  and  which,  it  seems  to  me, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  be  taken  as  the  authoritative  statement  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  policy,  is  not  just  that  they  want  to  give

advancing  now,  would  not  be  eligible  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay.  So  what  your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

argument  is  then,  they  should  take  these  people  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligibility,  too. 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  My  argument  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Their  argument  is, 

  

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  give  driver's  license  to  people  subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  deferred  action.  And  you're  saying,  okay,  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  injury?  You  can  take  that  away. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  just  think  that's  a  real  catch­22. 

   

   

 

 

 

If  ­­ if  you're  injured,  you  have  standing.  But  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  injured  because  you  can  change  your  policy  and  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  driver's  license  to  these  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  suggest  that  ­­ I  think  you  would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

want  ­­ you  would  sue  them  instantly  if  they  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  here  lawfully  present  under  the  Federal  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  being  discriminated  against.  It's  a  preemption 

   

  

 

 

 

argument  the  government  makes  on  a  regular  basis.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  don't,  the  intervenors  will  sue  them.  They've

already  said  that  they  think  that's  illegal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  The  fundamental  problem, 

  

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  is  ­­ with  that  theory  ­­ is  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  this  Court  essentially  to  issue  an  advisory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  about  whether  this  new  law  of  theirs  would,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  be  preempted.  After  all,  we  might  think  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted,  but  it's  up  to  the  judiciary  ultimately  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  whether  it's  preempted.  So  in  order  for  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  to  occur,  they  ­­ the  law  ­­ the  judiciary  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  decide  it's  preempted.  And  the  normal  way  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  you're  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

they  would  not  have  injury  because  they  can  do  this,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  might  lose  the  suit. 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  That's  correct.  It's  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

it's  hypothetical  at  this  point. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  mean,  General,  I  don't 

    

   

 

 

understand  why  you  wouldn't  lose  the  suit.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  1621  says,  "States  aren't  required  to  give  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits  to  nonqualified  aliens,  including  deferred 

 

 

 

 

 

action  recipients." 

 

              

I  guess  I  don't  really  understand  what  the 

   

 

 

 

 

basis  of  a  preemption  suit  would  be  given  that  section. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Justice  Kagan,  I'd  like 

  

 

 

 

 

to  be  able  to  agree  with  you  about  that.  We  don't  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1621  actually  applies  to  driver's  licenses.  And  it  ­­

depending  on  what  they  did,  we  might  or  might  not  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law  is  preempted.  But  until  they  actually  take  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

step,  which  would  be  a  significant  change  from  Texas  law 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  it  now  exists,  they  really  are  asking  you  for  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory  opinion  about  whether  the  thing  they  want  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  preempted.  I  mean,  if  you  think  about  it  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You're  saying  they  have 

  

 

 

 

 

inflicted  this  injury  on  themselves  because  they  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

options.  And  one  of  the  options,  and  I  assume  the  one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  would  like  to  pursue,  is  to  deny  driver's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

licenses  to  the  beneficiaries  of  DAPA.  And  if  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  make  the  argument  that  they  lack  standing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  have  a  viable  legal  option,  I  think  you 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  tell  us  whether,  in  the  view  of  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States,  it  would  be  lawful  for  them  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So,  it  would  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  think  the  Chief  Justice 

    

 

 

 

 

asked  you  that  question  before,  and  you  didn't  get  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance  to  answer  it.  Maybe  you  could  answer  it  now. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  It  would  depend  on  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  did  and  why  they  did  it.  But  it  does  seem  to  me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  fundamental  that  they  have  to  do  it.  I  mean,  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  it  this  way  ­­

what  they,  we  might  well  think  it's  unlawful.  For 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  if  they  did  try  to  enact  this  new  law  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  we're  going  to  give  licenses  to  everybody  we're

this  course  of  action  is  being  compelled  on  me.  I  want 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  declaratory  suit  that  says  that  it's  void. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  I  think  that  gets  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  point  ­­ that  gets  to  the  point,  Justice  Kennedy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  right  now,  tomorrow,  today  instead  of  suing  us  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  come  into  court  and  said  we  want  a  declaratory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment,  we  are  thinking  about  ­­ in  light  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  in  Federal  law,  we're  thinking  about  changing  our

hypothetical,  and  that  is  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  is  precisely  the  situation  we  are  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  now.  You  have  to  render  a  judgment  on  that  issue

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Do  we  really,  or  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  enough  ­­ is  it  enough  that  they  would  have  to  be  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  litigation  in  order  to  escape  the  policy?  You

it's  ­­ you  won't  dispute,  I  think,  that  they  will  be

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  don't  think  that  could

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  how  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different?  If  I  ­­ if  I  own,  say,  a  parcel  of  land  and 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  subject  to  some  government  regulatory  program  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  is  a  taking  under  ­­ under  existing  law,  why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  the  answer,  well,  you  should  go  buy  some  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

land  that's  not  subject  to  it.  You  can  avoid  the  injury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  your  own  action. 

 

 

 

            

And  it  seems  to  me  that's  what  you're  saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  Texas  says,  our  injury  is  we  have  to  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driver's  license  here,  and  that  costs  us  money.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  answer  is,  well,  maybe  you  don't  have  to  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driver's  license.  Go  change  the  policy.

between  ­­ in  your  ­­ in  your  proposed  hypothetical, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  that's  a  direct  action  against  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

land  owner  by  the  government.  In  this  case,  we're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting  directly  against  Texas.  We're  regulating 

  

 

 

 

 

individual  aliens,  and  there's  an  indirect  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incidental  effect  on  Texas.  And  that  gets  to,  it  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me,  the  deeper  and  broader  point  of  importance  here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  that  if  you're  going  to  recognize  ­­ and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  the  first  time,  I  think,  in  ­­ in  our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  ­­ you're  going  to  recognize  that  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incidental/indirect  effect  as  a  basis  for  allowing  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government  to  sue  another  ­­ another,  then  there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  no  limit  on  the  kinds  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  General,  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

normal  course  of  things,  let's  assume  that  Texas  decides 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tomorrow  to  change  its  law,  and  it  says,  now,  contrary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  what  the  ­­ its  law  says  right  at  this  moment  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  going  to  give  licenses  to  immigrants  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferred  action.  Presumably,  the  immigrant  who  wants 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  license  would  sue  the  State,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Precisely. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  make  either  an  equal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

protection  or  any  number  of  preemption  argument, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever.  The  State  could  then  defend  that  action,

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  it  could  raise 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

legitimately  full  standing  to  raise  any  defense  in  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct?

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes.

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  ­­ and  I  think  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

points  out  ­­ I  mean,  it  really  goes  to  what  the  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  Raines  v.  Byrd.  You  know,  it  may  seem  like  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  important  issue  that  is  ­­ is  teed  up  in  front  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you,  and  it  is  an  important  issue.  But,  you  know,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  that  the  legitimacy  of  the  citing  issues  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  importance  come  from  deciding  the  context  of  a

statute:  We  are  transferring  one  quarter  of  a  million 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

soldiers  to  Rhode  Island. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  Rhode  Island  thinks  the  first  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  unconstitutional,  and  it  also  thinks  that  the  second 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  for  some  technical  reason,  is  unlawful.  We're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  talking  about  standing.  In  that  circumstance,  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rhode  Island  have  standing? 

 

 

 

            

See,  totally  analogous.  I'm  trying  to  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  law,  which  you  say  is  vague.  I'm  imagining 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  there.  It  says,  Texas,  you  have  to  give  a  driver's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license  to  certain  people.  And  then  there's  a  second 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

law  which  says,  we  are  sending  you  a  million  of  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  Now,  all  I  want  to  know  is:  Can  Texas,  under

that's  true  here  or  not  ­­ but  under  the  ones  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothesize,  is  there  standing,  in  your  opinion? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Texas  would  say  the  first  law  is  wrong, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional  for  some  reason.  The  second  is  wrong 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  technically  failed  for  some  reason.  Do  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  standing  to  say  that? 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  The  ­­ I  have  to  ­­ I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  caveat  my  answer,  because  I  think  if  the  second 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  is  an  immigration  law  that  says  we're  going  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  immigration  policy  judgment  that's  going  to  result  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  people  being  in  the  State,  then  I  don't  think

they  would  have  standing. 

 

 

 

            

But  the  fundamental  point,  I  think,  of 

   

 

 

 

 

importance  here  is  that  the  premise  that  the  first  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  law  that  they  are  required  to  give  driver's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

licences  is  not  present  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  have  no  doubt  it  isn't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

present  here.  I  asked  the  question  to  clarify  what  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  I'm  supposed  to  say  if  I  agree  with  you. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  I  tried  to  answer 

   

  

 

 

 

that  and  tell  you  why  I  think  the  premise  is  different. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  did  try  to  answer  you  and  then  tell  you  why  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  premise  is  different. 

 

 

 

            

But  I  ­­ but  I  do  think  ­­ and  I  think  this 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ you  know,  there's  a  sort  of  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

shoe­on­the­other­foot  issue  here.  If  you  really  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  State  can  sue  the  Federal  government  based  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  kinds  of  indirect  and  incidental  effects,  then  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me  you'd  have  to  also  say  that  if  a  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided,  for  example,  that  it  wasn't  going  to  enforce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  minimum  wage  law  anymore,  and  as  a  result,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  had  to  increase  its  enforcement  costs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  Federal  minimum  wage  laws  in  that  State,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  would  then  have  standing  to  go  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  court  and  say  that  the  State  is  violating  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law?  I  don't  think  anybody  would  think  that's  a  valid

claim.  But  that's  just  the  flip  side  of  this  kind  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  the  injury  here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

any  more  indirect  and  speculative  than  the  injury  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  against  EPA? 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes.  I  ­­ yes.  I  think 

    

    

  

 

 

definitely,  Mr.  Chief  Justice.  I  mean,  that  was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  a  closely­divided  Court  in  that  case,  but  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  majority  opinion,  it  seems  to  me  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  ­­ there  are  two  fundamental  differences,  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  fundamental  differences. 

 

 

            

One  is  what  the  Court  said  is  that  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ under  the  Clean  Air  Act,  that  Congress  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged  the  EPA  with  protecting  States  and  others  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  effects  of  air  pollution  and  then  given  a  specific 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  of  action  to  the  people  whose  protection  EPA  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged  with  to  sue  if  EPA  wasn't  doing  its  job.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ and  I  think  this  is  at  page  520  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  ­­ the  Court  said  was  indispensable,  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical  to  the  finding  that  States  got  special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solicitude  and  were  allowed  to  sue  in  a  manner  where, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Article  III,  they  normally  wouldn't  be  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue. 

            

In  addition  ­­ and  in  addition,  I  do  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  do  have  a  quite  different  situation  in  that

there  was  no  way  for  Massachusetts  to  avoid  the  effects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  which  it  was  complaining,  and  there  is  a  way  here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  ­­ so  there  is  a  difference. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Maybe  I  could  ask 

   

  

 

 

 

you  to  switch. 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  was  just  going  to  ask 

    

 

 

 

 

 

whether  I  could.  Thank  you. 

   

  

 

            

So  I  think  it's  important,  again,  to  frame 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where  we  are  on  the  merits  here,  that  the  ­­ their  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  agrees  that  the  ­­ that  DHS  has  the  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defer  removal  of  this  class  of  alien  parents  of  U.S. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens  and  LPRs.  They  agree  that  that  judgment  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreviewable. 

            

What  we  disagree  about  is  whether  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

principally,  whether  we  also  have  the  authority  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorize  them  to  work  and  to  accrue  some  ancillary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits  based  on  that  work. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Before  you  get  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that,  could  I  ask  you  a  question  about  the  scope  of  your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument? 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Sure. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Under  your  argument, 

  

 

 

 

 

could  the  President  grant  deferred  removal  to  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful  ­­ unlawfully  present  alien  in  the  United

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Definitely  not. 

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  not? 

  

 

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Here  are  the  limits. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Because  the  deferred  action  has  ­­ over  time,  there  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  built  up  a  set  of  administrative  limits,  which  I'll 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk  about,  some  administrative  policy  limits,  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  substantive  statutory  limits. 

 

 

 

            

The  administrative  policy  limits  are  these: 

 

 

 

 

 

Deferred  action  has  always  been  for  the  lowest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priorities  for  removal.  And  everybody  agrees  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  By 

  

  

 

 

 

"administrative,"  you  mean  by  the  Executive  branch? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Correct.  Yes.  But  ­­

  

  

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  that  somehow 

  

 

 

 

 

binds  the  Executive  branch  now,  the  fact  that  ­­ I  mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  hasn't  been  approved  by  the  Executive  branch  prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  this  point,  either,  and  yet  it's  a  fairly  significant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

departure. 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Let  me  ­­ let  me  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  ­­ I  wouldn't  agree  with  that  premise,  Mr.  Chief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice,  but  let  me  walk  through  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  it's  ­­ you've  got  to  be  the  lowest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

priority.  It's  ­­ there  are  ­­ the  regulations  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  decades  that  talk  about  work  authorization  related

a  tie  to  a  statutory  policy  that  the  Secretary  has  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  implement,  such  things  as  foreign

they've  got  to  be  lowest  priority;  it's  got  to  be

of  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  the  Chief  is  going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

more  fundamentally,  General.  Those  are  the  parameters 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Executive  has  set  for  itself  now.  He's  asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  keeps  you  from  changing  those  parameters  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

future  and  simply  saying,  I  have  ­­ under  your  theory  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case,  I  have  discretion  to  defer  action  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody?  I  think  that's  his  question. 

    

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  A  couple  ­­ a  couple  of 

    

   

 

 

 

things  about  that.  One  is  there  are  statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

constraints  that  exist  now.  For  example,  Congress  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

told  DHS  that  it  has  to  prioritize  the  removal  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  aliens  and  aliens  detained  at  the  border. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  no  way  we  could  give  deferred  action  to  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

populations  consistent  with  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay.  So  not  ­­ not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

criminals.  Who  else?

another  ­­ criminals  ­­

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Seems  to  me  it  would

arrived  ­­ recently  made  it  into  the  country,  if  they

to  ­­ everyone  has  been  here  for  two  years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  then  ­­ and  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  specific  statutory  provisions  that  cover  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories  of  aliens  like  people  with  asylum.  So  then  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  host  of  things  that  impose  manageable  limits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  if  ­­ you  know,  if  ­­ if  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  were  to  conclude  that  there  is  standing  ­­

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  Just 

  

  

 

 

 

so  ­­ so  the  categories  you  say  would  have  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excluded  are  criminals,  people  detained  at  the  border, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  people  who've  been  granted  asylum.  And  other  than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  the  President  could  grant  deferred  removal  to

what  the  Chief  Justice  hypothesized,  suppose  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President  said,  you  know,  there  was  a  time  when  we  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open  borders  in  the  United  States,  and  I  think  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  right  policy,  so  we're  just  not  going  to  remove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody.  Who  could  challenge  that? 

  

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  obviously,  we're 

  

 

 

 

doing  more  or  less  the  opposite  now  in  terms  of  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  doing  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  understand.  It's  a 

    

  

 

 

hypothetical  question.  Could  anybody,  in  your  view, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  that? 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yeah,  I  ­­ yes.  I  think 

    

   

  

 

 

that  would  be  challengeable  under  the  ­­ you  know,  the

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  it's  four  million 

  

 

 

 

 

people  from  where  we  are  now. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  you  know,  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

big  number.  You're  right,  Justice  Kennedy. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  that's  ­­ and  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  whole  point,  is  that  you've  talked  about  discretion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  What  we're  doing  is  defining  the  limits  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion.  And  it  seems  to  me  that  that  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislative,  not  an  executive  act. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  All  of  the  cases  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs  go  on  for  pages  to  the  effect  that  the  President 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  admitted  a  certain  number  of  people  and  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  approves  it.  That  seems  to  me  to  have  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backwards.  It's  as  if  ­­ that  the  President  is  setting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  policy  and  the  Congress  is  executing  it.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  upside  down. 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  think 

    

   

 

 

 

it's  upside  down.  I  think  it's  different,  and  it's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  in  recognition  of  the  ­­ of  the  unique  nature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  immigration  policy.

much  ­­ please,  how  much  of  a  factor  is  the  reality  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  11.3  million  undocumented  aliens  in  the  country, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Congress,  the  Legislature,  has  provided  funds  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removing  about  four  million.  So  inevitably,  priorities 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  be  set. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Right.  Exactly. 

  

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  started  out 

  

 

 

 

 

telling  us  that  the  enforcement  priorities  were  not  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue;  that  ­­ that  the  problem  was  the  benefits  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flow  from  that,  the  work  authorization,  the  earned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

income  tax  credit,  the  Social  Security  benefits,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Medicare  benefits. 

 

            

So  as  I  understand  it  ­­ and  I  think  this  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  point  you  made  ­­ the  other  side  is  not  disputing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  you  have  authority  to  exercise  discretion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Correct.  And  that,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

think  is  the  answer  to  ­­ that  I  was  going  to  give  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  question,  Justice  Kennedy.  And  it  seems  to  me,

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  ­­ yes.  We  have 

  

  

 

 

 

resources  for  about  400,000.  Right. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  we  have  ­­ we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically  10  million,  nine  hundred  thousand  people  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  be  deported  because  there's  not  enough  resources, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct? 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  they  are  here  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we  want  them  or  not. 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  the  key  point  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  always  had  a  policy  that  says  when  you  have  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  your  presence  is  going  to  be  officially  tolerated, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  not  here,  you're  violating  the  immigration  laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  being  here.  You  don't  have  any  rights,  but  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence  is  going  to  be  officially  tolerated.  When 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  in  that  circumstance,  we  allow  you  to  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  makes  sense  to  allow  you  to  work.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise  ­­ you're  going  to  be  here,  and  otherwise,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  work  lawfully,  you're  going  to  either  not  be

than  a  page  later,  you  say,  "Aliens  with  deferred  action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  present  in  violation  of  the  law." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that  must  have  been  a  hard  sentence  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

write.  I  mean,  they're  ­­ they're  lawfully  present,  and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet,  they're  present  in  violation  of  the  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  actually  had  no  trouble 

    

 

 

 

 

writing  it,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  The  reason  I  had  no 

   

  

 

 

 

problem  writing  it  is  because  that  phrase,  "lawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence,"  has  caused  a  terrible  amount  of  confusion  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case;  I  realize  it.  But  the  reality  is  it  means  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  means  something  different  to  people  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration  world. 

 

            

What  it  means  in  the  immigration  world  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  that  you  have  a  legal  right  to  be  in  the  United 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States,  that  your  status  has  changed  in  any  way.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  any  defense  to  removal.  It  doesn't  mean  any  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  things,  and  it  never  has.  And  ­­ and  so  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  ­­ and  so  at  that  fundamental  level,  we  are  not

being  in  the  United  States?

recipients  about  whom  this  is  true  right  now.  And  this

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  It's  ­­ let  me  just  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  the  reality  here,  and  ­­ and  I'll  give  you  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  of  just  how  disruptive  a  ruling  would  be  to  accept 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  theory  on  ­­ on  who  can  lawfully  work  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States. 

 

            

Right  now,  since  2008,  one  category  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  can  get  work  authorization  are  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying  for  adjustment  of  status.  We've  given  out  3.5 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

million  of  those  to  that  category  of  people  since  2008, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  in  the  decades  before,  it  was  hundreds  of  thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  people  a  year.  They  are  not  lawfully  present  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  on  the  theory  of  having  ­­ on  the  sense  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  lawful  status.  People  who  have  applied  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cancellation  of  removal,  those  are  people  in  removal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings  now  since  2008,  we've  given  out  325,000  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  those  are  statutory 

  

 

 

 

 

categories,  are  they  not? 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No,  no.  There's  no 

  

  

 

 

 

statutory  authority  to  do  either  one  of  two  things: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  to  say  that  they're  lawfully  present  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States;  there's  no  authority  for  that.  And  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  key  thing  for  their  work  authorization  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  is  no  statutory  authority  to  grant  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  to  those  categories  of  people  ­­

those  other  categories,  did  you  say  that  those  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  lawfully  present  in  the  United  States?

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  But  the  ­­ but  the  key 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  that  their  argument  about  why  we  can't  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  authorization  is  a  statutory  argument.  They  say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  it's  under  ­­ that  1324  passed  in  1986  extinguished 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  right  to  give  ­­ our  ­­ our  authority  to  give  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  to  people  whose  presence  we  are  officially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolerating. 

            

What  I'm  saying  is  that  that  is  not  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plausible  reading  ­­

 

 

  

it's  not  a  plausible  reading  of 

   

 

 

 

the  text.  There's  a  1987  regulation  that  ­­ that  INS 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

promulgated  which  considered  that  very  question  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  passage  of  that  statute  restricted  INS  to  giving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  work  authorization  only  to  people  who  are  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category  specifically  identified  in  the  statute.  INS 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rejected  that  as  implausible  and  inconsistent  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory.  That's  been  on  the  books  for  30  years.  It's  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  Chevron  deference.

sorry.  Go  ahead. 

  

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  The  third  point  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

consequences  point.  This  argument  they  are  making 

  

 

 

 

 

 

says  ­­ you  know,  if  you  ­­ if  you  go  through  the  reg

authorization,  their  reading  of  1324  knocks  out  like  15

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yeah,  absolutely.  And, 

  

  

 

 

in  fact,  if  the  Court  thinks  it's  a  problem  and  wants  to

my  doubts  if  they  would  be  entitled  to  get  a  preliminary

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  They  would  have  ­­ they

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Sorry,  I  wasn't  clear,

If  this  Court  decides  ­­ if  this  Court  gets

difficult  to  defend  legally."  What  was  he  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about? 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  ­­ so  I  think  two  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's  two  possible  things.  One  is  what  DACA  does  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  DAPA  does,  which  is  provide  tolerated  presence  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  the  ability  to  work.  If  he  had  said,  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  going  to  give  these  people  lawful  permanent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resident  status  or  legal  status,  that  would  be  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Or  say  ­­ or  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  lawfully  present. 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  ­­ and  well,  but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  as  I  said,  I  ­­ you  know,  I  really  think  that  ­­

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  ­­ and  then  second,  the  other  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  you  know,  maybe  he  thought  he  couldn't  extend  it  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  time  to  DAPA.  But,  you  know,  what  happened  here  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  President  and  the  Secretary  went  to  the  Office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Legal  Counsel  and  asked  for  an  opinion  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scope  of  their  authority  to  ­­ to  ­­ the  scope  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretionary  authority,  and  they  got  one.  And  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercised  it  consistently  with  that  and  up  to  the  limits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  that  and  no  further. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so,  you  know,  I  do  think  whatever  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

President  may  have  met  ­­ meant,  we  went  through  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process,  we  came  to  that  conclusion,  and  we  ­­ and  acted

daily  fear  that  they  will  be  separated  from  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

families  and  detained  or  removed  from  their  homes  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  current  nonuniform  and  frequently  arbitrary  Federal

has  blocked  the  Guidance  that  would  secure  the  Jane  Does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  opportunity  to  step  forward,  register  and  apply  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain  a  timely  decision  with  respect  to  deferred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

action.  Texas  does  so  based  on  asserted  indirect  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculative  budgetary  injury  that  contradicts  the 

 

 

 

 

 

State's  own  legislative  decision,  after  balancing  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  considerations  to  subsidize  and  encourage  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquisition  of  driver's  licenses  with  no  annual  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cumulative  limit  on  subsidies  in  that  form. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Do  you  think  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  illegal  if  Texas  adopted  a  policy  saying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone  lawfully  present  in  Texas  except  people  subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  DAPA  get  a  driver's  license? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  I  think  it  would  be,  in  candor, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  a  challenge  that  would  revolve  around  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  and  the  reasoning  behind  that  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation.  It's  important,  of  course,  to  note  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  has  not  done  that.  And  there's  no  indication  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  legislative  process  would  result  in  determining  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  previous  decision  that  subsidized  licenses  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense  without  limit  has  some  endpoint.  The  circumstance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you've  described  where  it  specifically  targets  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  of  deferred  action  recipients  would  certainly  raise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions.  It  would  be  resolved  if  ­­

said  ­­ let's  take  it  out  of  DAPA  ­­ if  they  just  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know  something?  There's  too  many  deferred  action 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  It  doesn't  matter  why  you're  deferred  ­­

MR.  SAENZ:  In  that  circumstance,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

it,  too,  would  be  subject  to  challenge.  It  would  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  challenge  because  of  circumstances,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasoning  would  be  different.  There  would  be  equal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection  claims.  There  might  be  preemption  claims. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

And  those  would  be  resolved  in  the  kind  of  concrete 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clash  of  real  interest  that  this  Court  has  indicated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article  III  supports.  You  would  have  the  State  of  Texas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defending  a  decision  it  has  made  to  change  its  law  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  keep  that  law  in  place.  Then  you  would  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggrieved  individuals  who  would  have  been  denied  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driver's  license  because  of  that  change. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Not  every  State  grants 

  

 

 

 

 

licenses  to  deferred  action  individuals,  do  they? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor.  In 

  

  

 

 

 

 

this  case,  it  would  arise  in  the  context  of  a  change 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  could  raise  equal  protection  concerns  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolved  in  the  kind  of  concrete  clash  of  interest  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  indicated  are  behind  Article  III.

has  Texas  not  changed  its  policy  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Do  I  take  it  from  the  way 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  are  phrasing  this  that  you  actually  think  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal  protection  concerns  would  be  more  serious  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption  concerns? 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  I  think  it  depends  on  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  of  how  Texas  is  to  make  its  decision.  All 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  more  reason  to  wait  until  it's  actually  made  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  through  a  legislative  process  where  there  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  record  of  why  the  legislators  chose  to  change  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  policy  that  currently  provides  licenses  to  anyone  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  demonstrate  that  they  are  authorized  to  be  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,  to  something  that  would  leave  some  folks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  category  out. 

 

 

 

            

If  they  would  decide  that  tolerated  presence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  authorization,  for  example,  we  would  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  of  why  they  made  that  decision.  Of  course,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  there  yet  because  Texas  has  not  made  a  decision

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Are  there  other  ways? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  SAENZ:  No,  Your  Honor.  That's  the  only 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

thing  they  put  forward  in  one  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  the  answer. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  SAENZ:  And,  in  fact,  it  shows  that  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  they  would  face  additional  expenses,  though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  not  really  enough  to  conclude  that  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  the  State's  previous  determination,  taking  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account  those  costs  from  every  subsidized  license  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Isn't  ­­ isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

losing  money  the  classic  case  for  standing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  It's  a  classic  case  for  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

private  individual,  Your  Honor,  but  here,  we're  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  a  State  that  has  made  a  decision,  as  States  often 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

do,  to  spend  money  by  subsidizing  licenses  because  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balanced  other  considerations,  including  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We  said  in 

  

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  against  EPA  that  we  have  a  special 

   

 

 

 

 

 

solicitude  for  the  claims  of  the  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  Yes.  In  that  case,  it  was  not  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  claim.  As  you  know,  Your  Honor,  it  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  related  to  the  State's  quasi­sovereign  interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  land. 

 

            

In  addition,  as  General  Verrilli  has 

 

 

 

 

 

indicated,  there  was  a  procedural  right  within  the  Clean

Air  Act  that  does  not  exist  here.  Indeed,  if  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedural  right  were  to  be  established  under  the  APA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself,  there  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  States  that

JUSTICE  ALITO:  If  an  employer  took  the 

  

 

 

 

 

position  that  the  employer  was  not  going  to  hire  a  DAPA 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiary  because  the  employer  believes  that  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  ­­ that  they  are  not  lawfully  authorized  to  work, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  prefer  someone  else  over  them,  could  that  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue  on  any  theory  of  discrimination,  for  example,  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  1981? 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  They  could,  Your  Honor.  And  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  outcome  of  that  case,  I  think,  has  not  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  established  by  precedent  so  far.  But  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  clash  between  folks  with  concrete  interest,  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  who  wants  to  hire  someone,  not  the  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  If  that's  true  then,  DAPA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

gives  them  a  legal  right.  It's  more  than  just  putting 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  in  a  low­priority  prosecution  status. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  I  think  it's  important  to  note, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  that  work  authorization  is  a  separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

determination  from  deferred  action  itself.  Not  everyone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

who  receives  deferred  action  will  receive  work

authorization.  I  also  think  ­­

    

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  work  authorization,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

your  view,  gives  them  a  legal  right  they  did  not  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before. 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  It  gives  them  the  right  to  work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  authorization,  certainly.  However,  I  also  need  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

go  back  to  standing  and  point  out  that  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  has  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  driver's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

licenses  in  Texas,  where  the  test  is  authorized  to  be  in

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  When  you  ­­ when  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answered  the  question  about  ­­ you  said  there  might  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1981  suit.  You  are  not  saying  who  would  win  that  suit. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You're  saying  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

question.  Not  that  they  have  a  legal  right,  but  anyone 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  sue.  You  can  always  sue. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  It's  far  from  clear,  I  think. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

The  precedent  is  not  clear  enough  to  determine  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome  of  that  case. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  is  ­­ but  what  is  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  on  that? 

 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  Our  position  would  be  that  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  to  be  litigated.  In  fact,  to  be  ­­ in  all

no  established  precedent  to  make  it  clear  one  way  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other. 

            

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  you  believe  they  do  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  right? 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  They  do  have  work  authorization, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  certainly  means  that  they  ought  not  be  subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  unreasonable  discriminatory  bases  for  denying  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work.  It's  different  from  when  they  don't  have  work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization.  But  going  back  to  the  work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

authorization,  it  has  no  relationship  to  the  driver's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

licenses.  In  fact,  they  could  receive  licenses  without 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever  applying  or  receiving  work  authorization. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's  no  connection  between  the  two. 

 

 

 

 

 

Therefore,  any  concerns  about  work  authorization  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  redress  ­­ redress  the  injury  behind  standing  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  of  Texas. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  In  the  Whiting  case  a  few 

   

  

 

 

 

 

terms  ago,  the  Court  upheld  an  Arizona  statute  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed  pretty  severe  civil  penalties  on  an  employer  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employed  individuals  who  were  not  authorized  to  work. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  if  an  employer  in  Arizona  hires  DAPA  beneficiaries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  State  attempts  to  impose  those  civil  penalties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  that  employer,  I  assume  that  you  believe  that  DAPA 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  provide  a  legal  defense  to  that? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  I  believe  there  would  be  a

defense,  but  before  that,  because  the  Whiting  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  a  requirement  to  use  either  by  system  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verified  system,  those  who  were  work  authorized,  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  deferred  action  or  otherwise,  should  come  back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  authorized  workers. 

 

 

            

So  I  think  the  State  of  Arizona,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

premised  its  statute  in  part  to  receive  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blessing  of  that  statute  on  relying  on  Federal  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makers,  would  not  be  in  a  position  to  engage  in  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  described. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  prior  to  DAPA,  if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  had  employed  these  individuals,  the  employer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  subject  to  those  penalties,  would  it  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

be. 

            

MR.  SAENZ:  That  is  correct. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  after  DAPA,  it  would  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SAENZ:  Work  authorization  is  an 

  

 

 

 

 

authorization  to  work  that  is  separate  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferred­action  determination.  Basically,  the  State  of 

  

 

 

 

 

Texas  has  conceded  the  deferred­action  determination  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  be  focusing  on  work  authorization.  But  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  authorization  has  absolutely  no  relationship  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged  injury  of  driver's  licenses. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  see  my  time  is  up,  Your  Honor.

Mr.  Saenz.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  SCOTT  A.  KELLER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

DAPA  is  an  unprecedented  unlawful  assertion 

 

 

 

 

 

of  executive  power.  DAPA  would  be  one  of  the  largest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes  in  immigration  policy  in  our  nation's  history  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  can  you  say  that?  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  we  have  the  Fairness  Act  that  happened  in  1990. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  granted  basically  the  same  thing,  deferred  action  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  authorization,  to  1.5  million  people  out  of  4 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

million.  That  was  a  ­­ 40  percent  of  the  immigrant 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

population  of  the  time  was  affected.  Here,  the  best 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estimate  is  that  only  35  percent  are  affected. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  at  least  once  before,  the  President  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken  action  that  has  a  greater  percentage  effect  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

now.  So  why  is  it  the  largest?  Is  it  the  number  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people? 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  the  Family  Fairness 

  

 

 

 

 

Program,  first  of  all,  was  done  pursuant  to  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  It  was  a  voluntary  departure  program.  It 

   

  

  

 

 

 

was  not  an  extra  statutory  deferred  action  program. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Also,  I  believe  only  47,000  people  actually

got  relief  there. 

 

 

            

And  what  Congress  did  in  1996  after  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Family  Fairness  Program  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  that's  because 

  

 

 

 

Congress  decided  to  step  in.  Here,  we  have  a  Congress 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  decided  ­­ some  members  of  the  Congress  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided  they  don't  like  it,  and  so  Congress  has  remained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

silent.  It  doesn't  mean  that  at  some  later  point  after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  election  or  whenever,  Congress  can't  step  in  and  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  wants  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  But  ­­ but,  Justice  Sotomayor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  that's  backwards.  Congress  has  to  grant  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  authority  first  for  the  Executive  to  be  able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  act.  And  to  do  so,  on  a  question  that's  of  this  deep 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic  significance,  it  would  have  to  do  so  expressly. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  know,  you  keep 

  

 

 

 

 

saying  that,  "deep  economic  significance."  Those  nearly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11  million  unauthorized  aliens  are  here  in  the  shadows. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  are  affecting  the  economy  whether  we  want  to  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not. 

            

The  answer  is,  if  Congress  really  wanted  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  an  economic  impact,  it  would  ­­ it  would  allot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  amount  of  money  necessary  to  deport  them,  but  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't.

with  work  authorization,  and  1996  with  benefits,  is  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restricted  work  and  benefits  as  an  alternative  mechanism 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  enforce  immigration  law.  Those  judgments  acknowledge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  going  to  be  people  in  the  country  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawfully  present,  and  yet,  Congress  put  forward  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barriers  to  work  and  to  benefits  precisely  to  deter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful  immigration.  What  the  Executive  is  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  here  is  flout  that  determination. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Except  that  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

work  authorization  ability  of  the  Attorney  General  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  clearly  stated  since  1986,  and  Congress  hasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken  that  away.  It  may  at  some  later  point,  but  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  has  not  undone  the  1986  regulation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  But  in  1986,  Congress  passed  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

comprehensive  framework  for  combatting  the  employment  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unauthorized  aliens.  That  was  a  decision  to  repudiate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  past  practice  and  enact  a  general  Federal  ban  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment  of  unauthorized  aliens. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  ­­ and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

regulation  permitting  the  Attorney  General  to  give  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  to  deferred­action  individuals  has  stood 

 

 

 

 

 

since  that  time. 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  But  when  that  regulation  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

passed  in  1987,  the  Executive  said  that  the  number

quote,  "the  impact  on  the  labor  market  is  minimal," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unquote. 

            

So  regardless  of  what  Congress  may  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquiesced  to  afterwards,  that  regulation  has  always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  known  as  being  for  a  small  class  of  individuals 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  deferred  action. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  it's  been  applied  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  large  class.  It  was  applied  to  a  large  class  in  1990. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.5  million  out  of  four  million.  40  percent  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal  population.  That  was  a  fairly  significant 

   

  

 

 

 

number,  and  Congress  didn't  act  thereafter.  In  fact,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expanded  the  program  the  President  had  started. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  No.  The  1990  Family  Fairness 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Program  was  voluntary  departure  with  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  Congress  responded  in  1996  by  capping  it  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

120  days.  And  the  Executive  acknowledged  that  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  did  that,  it  could  no  longer  authorize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment  under  that  voluntary  departure  program. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 

  

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  But  here,  with  deferred  action, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

when  they've  only  ­­ the  Executive  has  only  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

granting  500  to  1000  deferred  action  permits  a  year, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  way  Congress  would  have  acquiesced  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

granting  four  million  permits  than  in  a  program  like

this  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  it  has  ­­ it  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquiesced  to  larger  numbers  of  Salvadorians, 

 

 

 

 

 

Guatemalans,  Hondurans,  Haitians,  Chinese,  the  TNU  visa 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applications,  those  numbers  have  been  much  larger  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  limited  numbers  you're  quoting  right  now. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  And  those  programs  would  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been  under  temporary  protective  status;  humanitarian 

 

 

 

 

 

parole,  deferred  enforced  departure,  which  is  justified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ and  has  been,  at  least,  under  the  President's  Article 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

II  power,  and  there's  no  suggestion  that  ­­ here  DAPA  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unprecedented  because  this  is  a  extra  statutory  deferred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

action  program  that  is  not  bridging  lawful  status.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aliens  do  not  have  a  preexisting  status,  and  they  don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  an  eminent  status. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  General,  could  I  take  you 

   

  

 

 

 

back  a  few  steps?  General  Verrilli  said  a  couple  of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

times  that  you've  essentially  conceded  the  legality  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DAPA  taking  out  the  work  authorization  and  the  Social 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Security  benefits;  is  that  correct? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  No.  I'll  be  very  clear.  When 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  Executive  is  forbearing  from  removal  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case­by­case  basis,  that  is  what  this  Court  in  Reno 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noted  was  deferred  action  enforcement  discretion.  But

into  lawful  presence,  and  granting  eligibility  for  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  and  Medicare  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Let  me  make  sure  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand  that.  You're  saying  that  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

could  do  this  case­by­case,  one  by  one  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  people  in  the  class,  but  that  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  identify  the  entire  class  and  say  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forbearing  from  enforcement;  is  that  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  While  that  would  be  a  harder, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

tougher  case,  I  do  believe  that  they  could  do  it  class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  if  they  were  simply  forbearing  from  removal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  that's  what  I  asked 

   

  

 

 

 

originally.  If  they  were  simply  forbearing  from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

removal,  and  there  was  not  work  authorization  attached 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  it,  and  there  was  not  Social  Security  or  any  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits  attached  to  it,  are  you  conceding  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  In  this  case,  given  that  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  removing  400,000  people  a  year,  we  admit  that  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  do  forbearance  from  removal.  But  what  they  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  is  grant  authorization  to  be  in  the  country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's  a  ­­

   

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  I  ­­ can  I  ask  you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

specifically?  You  have  a  statement  in  your  brief,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  ­­ it  says  that  the  Executive  could  give  cards,

priority."  Are  you  adhering  to  that?  Is  ­­ is  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ what  you  mean?  These  people  you're  objecting  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  authorizations,  Social  Security,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  not  one  by  one,  but  to  give  everyone  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fits  into  this  category  a  card  that  says  low  priority? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  The  government,  as  part  of  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  discretion,  could  do  that.  But  that's  very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  than  what  they're  doing  here  where  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

granting  lawful  presence.  And  that  matters  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  we  have  to  grant  driver's  license.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  they  get  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  General,  are  you  ­­ are  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  referring  to  that  single  phrase  in  the  DAPA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

memorandum?  Is  that  what  you're  referring  to?  Because 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

General  Verrilli,  of  course,  says  you  could  strike  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase  today  if  you  wanted  to;  that  that  phrase  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  no  legal  consequence  whatsoever;  that  all  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

document  does  is  do  exactly  what  you  said,  which  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant  forbearance,  to  tell  people  we  are  ­­ you  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  enforcement  priority,  we  are  not  going  to  deport  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

until  we  say  otherwise,  which  we  can  tomorrow  too. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  That  lawful  presence  phrase  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

key  because  that's  the  first  time  in  a  deferred­action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

program  the  Executive  has  taken  that  position.  But  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  that  phrase  were  struck,  that  would  still  not  cure

the  defect.  And  the  reason  is  because  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive  is  doing  when  they're  granting  deferred  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  they  are  affirmatively  granting  a  status.  And  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

know  that  from  their  own  benefits  regulations,  which  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ this  is  H.C.F.R.  1.3.  Sub  A  says  lawfully  present 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualifies  if  you're  in  deferred  action  status.  And  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sub  B  says,  well,  just  because  we're  forbearing  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal,  that  doesn't  necessarily  mean  that  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawfully  present. 

 

            

And  so  what  is  going  on  here  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transformation  of  deferred  action  from  what  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized  in  Reno  to  something  far  more  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forbearance  from  removal.  It  is  granting  a  status,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  status  then  entails  certain  things  beyond  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Medicare  and  Social  Security.  For  instance  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  ­­ I  really  did  want 

    

   

 

 

 

 

to  know,  just  take  out  the  work  authorization,  take  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Social  Security,  and  take  out  that  phrase.  Can  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ can  the  government  say  to  all  of  these  people,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  it  all  at  once,  not  one  by  one,  yes,  you're  a  low  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  of  you  are  low  priority,  and  we  will  not  be  coming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  you,  and  we  will  not  deport  you  unless  we  change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  minds. 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  And  Justice  Kagan,  they  can  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  and  they  can  do  that  under  the  unchallenged

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  think  that's  just  a  label. 

    

   

 

 

 

Can  they  do  that?

that  Congress  created  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  my  hypothetical  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  you're  suggesting  that  the  label  has  some  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence.  And  my  hypothetical  is  we  just  say  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  however  many  million  people  it  is,  you  will  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deported  unless  we  change  our  minds.  Can  they  do  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  If  that's  all  they  were  doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes.  But  as  soon  as  they  link  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Even  though  it's  many 

  

 

 

 

 

millions  of  people  they  could  do  that?  And  they  can  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  all  at  once. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Yes,  as  long  as  they're  not

presence"  appear  in  statutes  enacted  by  Congress? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  It  does.  It  appears  in  IIRIRA,

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  then  it  seems  to  me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  Keller,  that  your  ­­ that  what  you  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attacking  is  not  DAPA.  What  you  should  be  attacking  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  work  authorization  regulations  that  the  DHS,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  that  the  INA,  has  had  for  30  years.  Or  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  attacking  other  connections  that  DHS  is  making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  these  people,  but  not  DAPA  itself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  But  Justice  Kagan,  I  think  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  DAPA  itself  that  we're  challenging.  And  the  reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  is  because  that  is  what  is  transforming  unlawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  into  authorized  lawful  conduct  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Where  does  it  say  that  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

DAPA?  We  have  the  DAPA  directive.  I  didn't  see 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything  in  it  about  work  authorization  or  about  Social

mention  Social  Security.  It  does  mention  work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

authorization.  This  is  Pet.  App.  413a.  And  I'll  quote 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  it:  "Deferred  action  means  that  for  a  specified 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

period  of  time,  an  individual  is  permitted  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawfully  present  in  the  United  States." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  Executive  wants  to  take  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  that  that  has  no  legal  consequence.  Of  course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  OLC  memo  at  JA  76  ­­ and  this  has  been  misquoted  in

their  reply  brief  ­­ said  that  what's  going  on  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolerated  presence  is  it  is  ­­ the  forward  action  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  toleration  of  an  alien's  continued  unlawful  presence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  it's  continued  unlawful  presence, 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  not  authorized  to  be  in  the  country;  we  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  issue  driver's  license.  They  can't  get  deferred 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  and  gun  ­­ sorry  ­­ they  can't  get  Medicare, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Social  Security,  gun  possession. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  tie  the  driver's 

  

 

 

 

 

license  to  work  authorization?  Let's  say  somebody  is  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  deferred  status  but  isn't  working.  Do  they  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Texas  law,  do  they  get  driver's  licenses? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Under  Texas  law  ­­ and  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  Texas  statute  ­­ if  someone  is  authorized  to  be  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States,  they're  eligible  for  a  driver's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

license. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  it  ­­ it  sounds  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  don't  have  to  have  any  work  authorization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  That's  correct.  They  need  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

be  authorized  to  be  in  the  country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  to  give  some  context  to  how  this  works, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  to  rely  on  the  Federal  government  immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classifications.  I  mean,  we  determine  whether  someone 

    

 

 

 

 

is  eligible  for  a  driver's  license.  We  run  that  through 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  save  background  system.  So  we  ask  the

Federal  government,  is  this  individual  authorized  to  be

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

also  says  you  don't  have  to  do  that,  or  maybe  you  don't

you.  But  why  don't  you  go  ahead  and  not  give  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driver's  license? 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think,  as 

   

   

  

 

 

Your  Honor  had  suggested  before,  that  we  are  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

catch­22  here.  Either  we  have  to  not  incur  millions  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars  of  financial  harm,  which  ­­ which  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quintessential  Article  III  injury,  or  we  have  to  change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  law  and  somehow  we  have  to  come  up  with  a  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background  check  system.  We  wouldn't  have  a  uniform 

   

  

 

 

 

 

policy. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  How  does 

  

  

 

 

 

somebody  get  a  license  in  Texas?  I  know  how  to  do  it  in 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

New  York  and  Washington,  because  I  lived  in  both  places. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  I  don't  know  how  to  do  it  in  Texas.  Do  you  go  up, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  do  what? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  You  ­­ you  would  go  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department  of  Motor  Vehicles.  You  would  show  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

documentation  showing  who  you  are  and  that  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  for  a  license.

at  JA  377  to  382  outlining  the  process  ­­ then  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verifies  that  the  individual  has  authorization  to  be  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  country.  And  that's  sort  of  the  Federal  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  Now,  I  do 

   

  

  

 

 

know,  because  I've  experienced  it,  that  lines  are  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long  at  DMVs.  Sometimes  people  wait  the  entire  day. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  know  that  they  leave  the  next  day  when  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  gotten  to  them.  And  they  keep  coming  back. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  an  ideal  situation.  Most  States,  to  avoid  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frustration,  do  ramp  up,  but  many  States  don't.  People 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  keep  coming  back  until  their  license  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processed. 

            

So  why  is  it  that  you  have  to  spend  all  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money?  Why  can't  you  just  have  your  regular  process  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let  people  wait  on  line? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  first  of  all,  under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  REAL  ID  Act,  if  our  State's  driver's  license 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipients  want  to  be  able  to  use  that  license  to  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  airport  securities,  TSA  security,  there  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  integrity  in  the  license  for  the  Federal  government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  we  have  to  check  whether  an  alien  is  actually  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Fine.  I  was  just 

    

  

 

 

saying,  why  do  you  have  to  ramp  up?  This  ­­ I  mean,  one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  allegations  ­­ I  haven't  really  gone  through  it

affidavit  estimating  losses  in  your  process  is  made  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically  because  A,  there's  already  a  built­in  profit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

from  profiting  licenses  of  $25,  that  you  really  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  if  you  have  to  add  all  this  personnel,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  five  million  people  are  not  going  to  walk  into  DMV 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  one  day.  And  that  the  numbers  are  going  to  be  much 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  no  matter  what,  because  not  everybody  ­­ not  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  million  are  going  to  want  licenses  to  start  with. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  question  I  have  is,  why  do  you  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ramp  up?  Why  can't  you  just  let  people  wait  on  line? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Yeah.  So  this  is  at  JA  377  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

382.  And  the  reason  is,  is  because  there's  going  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  spike  in  the  applicants  for  driver's  licenses,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  much  more  to  do  than  simply  granting  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license.  There  would  have  to  be  processing  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paperwork,  making  other  determinations. 

 

 

 

            

            

But  in  any  event,  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you  do  that  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

speed  you  do  it  in.  Meaning,  I  got  a  temporary  piece  of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

paper  when  I  was  there,  and  it  took  weeks  for  me  to  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  regular  license  while  the  motor  vehicle  bureau  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  was  going  to  do  as  fast  or  as  slow  as  it  wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  it. 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  and  here,  we  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

factfinding  that  we  would  incur  these  costs.  Neither

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  This  is  a  jurisdictional

MR.  KELLER:  It  is  a  jurisdictional  standing

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  we  give  you  standing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  on  the  basis  of  you  saying,  I'm  going  to  do  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  makes  no  sense? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  We  have  a  factfinding  here. 

   

  

 

 

 

They  have  not  alleged  it's  clear  error.  We  also  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declarations  in  from  Wisconsin  and  Indiana  that  have  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  challenged.  The  bottom  line  is,  if  we're  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  issue  more  driver's  licenses,  it's  going  to  cost

really.  If  there's  something  else  that's  worrying  you, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  ­­ it's  sort  of  hidden.  But  money  is  money;  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  that.  And  my  question  is  about  standing.

And  this  is  technical,  but  it's  important  to  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Looking  at  the  briefs,  awful  lot  of  briefs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

senators,  both  sides.  Awful  lot  of  briefs  from  States, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  sides.  Members  of  Congress.  Why?  Because  this 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

has  tremendous  political  valence.  Keep  that  in  mind. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  keeping  that  in  mind,  let's  go  back  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  old  cases  which  are  scarcely  mentioned.  But  old 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  cases  never  die  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.)

overruled.  And  a  few  have  been.  They're  submerged  like 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

icebergs. 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  one  I'm  thinking  of  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Frothingham  v.  Mellon,  Massachusetts  v.  Mellon.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there,  in  those  cases,  the  Federal  government  had  given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  to  some  people.  There  were  beneficiaries. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Other  people  wanted  to  sue  because  they  said  that  means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  have  to  pay  more  money.  And  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  you  other  people  from  Massachusetts,  I'm  sorry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  lost,  but  lo  and  behold,  it  did. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  just  because  I'm  from  Massachusetts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  the  point  is  they  lost, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  says  the  Court,  we  can't  let  you  just  sue  on

the  basis  that  you,  as  a  taxpayer,  will  have  to  spend 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  money.  Because  if  we  do,  taxpayers  all  over  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country  will  be  suing  in  all  kinds  of  cases,  many  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  will  involve  nothing  more  than  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreements  of  all  kinds.  And  before  you  know  it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  will  be  transferred  from  the  President  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress,  where  power  belongs,  to  a  group  of  unelected 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges. 

            

And  for  that  reason,  we  say  you  individuals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  will  have  to  pay  more  money  will;  cannot  just  sue  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  basis.  And  as  for  the  State,  it  cannot  represent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  parens  patriae  because  this  is  between  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  and  the  citizens.  They're  the  ones  who  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  pay.  And  as  far  as  Massachusetts  is  concerned, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again,  bringing  up  to  a  case  that  they  won,  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  own  coastline.  And  that's  not  money.  That's  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical  territory  belonging  to  Massachusetts.  And,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

course,  they  have  standing  to  protect  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  want  your  ­­ think  for  a  second.  I'm

harms  from  our  own  State's  fisc.  That's  not  a  parens 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

patriae.  And  we're  also  raising  sovereign  harms,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  Massachusetts  v.  EPA.  We  have  ceded  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  the  authority  to  determine  who's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawfully  present  within  the  borders  of  the  26  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  sovereign  harms,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

realize,  would  follow  a  fortiori,  because  if  a  State 

   

   

 

 

 

 

cannot  sue  and  its  citizens  cannot  sue  to  stop  the  Feds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  giving  somebody  a  benefit  on  the  ground  that  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  cost  the  State  or  the  individuals  more  money, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surely  they  cannot  sue  just  by  announcing  it  requires  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  in  law  in  general,  or  because  it  requires  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hurts  our  sovereign  interest,  for  then  every  case  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  disagreement  where  States  disagree  would  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  Court. 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  but  I  think  a  lot  of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

those  cases  would  be  taken  care  of  through  causation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements,  injury­in­fact  requirements,  and  the  zone 

 

 

 

 

 

of  interest  test,  for  instance,  the  adjusted  gross 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

income  example  and  the  veterans  benefits  example  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  side  has  brought  up.  I  think  that  all  those 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  would  be  screened  out  through  the  zone­of­interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test.

which  is  that  the  States  bear  the  consequences  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal  immigration. 

 

            

And  when  we  can  come  to  court  and  show  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concrete  injury  and  a  policy  that  is  causing  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury,  and  by  enjoying  that  policy,  we  wouldn't  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incur  either  the  financial  harm  or  the  sovereign  harm, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  precisely  when  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  but  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  ­­ you  have  Article  III 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cases  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ that  really  pits  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

States  against  every  Federal  agency.  And  any  harm, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  harm  that  indirectly  flows  from  a  change  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  would  be  subject  to  attack. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let  me  give  you  a  prime  example.  Okay? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Imagine  Texas  passed  a  law  forbidding  its  State  pension 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  from  investing  in  any  financial  company  whatsoever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Federal  Stability  Oversight  Council  declares 

 

 

 

 

 

 

systematically  important.  Too  big  to  fail. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Texas  reasonably  doesn't  want  to  invest 

 

 

 

 

 

money  in  companies  that  if  they  fail  are  going  to  tank 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  economy.  Now,  let's  say  the  Federal  government  sets

out  a  policy  memorandum  that  says,  in  our  discretion,  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  not  going  to  declare  some  insurance  firms  under  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  size  as  too  big  to  fail.  We  just  don't  think  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should.  Okay? 

  

            

Why  can't  the  States  sue  that  Federal  agency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  say  the  law  mandates  that  you  tell  us  who's  too  big 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  fail? 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  I  don't  think  States  would  be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

protected  by  laws  governing  which  banks  are  too  big  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fail,  but  States  absolutely  are  protected  by  immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws  saying  who  is  lawfully  present  within  our  borders. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  ­­ so  that  would  be  ­­ we  did  that  under  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

zone  of  interest  test.  So  even  if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  We  already  said  in 

  

 

 

 

 

Arizona  v.  Whiting  that  you  can't  tell  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  who  to  say  is  legally  or  not  legally  present 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  You  don't  have  a  right  to  set  immigration  policy. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KELLER:  And  that's  precisely  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You're  not  in  the  zone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  interest  of  this  ­­ of  this  ­­ of  the  immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Oh,  we  absolutely  are,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  precisely  why  I  am  standing  here.  Because  as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  recognized  in  Arizona,  just  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  government  pervasively  regulates  immigration,

that  doesn't  mean  that  the  States  don't  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  interest  in  who's  within  their  borders.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  an  easily  identifiable  sovereign  interest  on  who's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  our  borders.  However  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  the  State  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

remove  anyone,  and  we  still  go  back  to  the  basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem:  11.3  million  people.  Congress  is  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

appropriating  money  to  ­­ to  remove  more  than  ­­ what  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it?  ­­ four  million  of  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  there  are  these  people  that  are  ­­ who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  here  to  stay  no  matter  what.  And  you  have  conceded 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Federal  government  can  say,  low  priority, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's  your  card.  Not  going  to  deport  you  unless  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  our  mind. 

 

 

            

So  the  only  thing  that's  involved  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work,  and  you  haven't  challenged  that  separately. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  challenging  DAPA. 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  And  ­­ and  DAPA  itself  purports 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  grant  not  only  work  authorization,  but  also  transform 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawful  conduct  into  lawful  conduct. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  We've  already  gone 

  

 

 

 

through  that.  We've  ­­ we  have  agreed  that  that  means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolerated  presence.  The  government  has  said,  take  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  word.  It  was  unfortunate  that  we  used  it.  What  we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  is  tolerated  presence.

MR.  KELLER:  But  it's  not  just  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

unfortunate  slip.  When  they're  granting  deferred­action 

  

 

 

 

 

status,  under  their  regulations,  that  is  lawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence.  So  they  want  you  to  take  out  "lawful 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence"  from  the  DAPA  memo  and  pretend  "lawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence"  isn't  in  there.  But  then  when  you  go  into  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  ­­

 

            

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  then  why  aren't  you 

  

 

 

 

 

challenging  the  regulations?  I  mean,  I  understand  what 

    

   

 

 

 

you're  saying  that  DAPA  in  some  sense  triggers  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations,  but  only  because  the  regulations  say  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  say,  that  your  real  challenge  is  not  to  DAPA,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  nonenforcement  part  of  this.  Your  real  challenge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  the  regulations,  the  fact  that  nonenforcement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leads  to  a  certain  set  of  results  and  yet  you're  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  challenging  those  regulations. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  insofar  as  you'd  conceive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  our  case  of  challenging  those  regulations,  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  challenging  them  as  applied  to  DAPA,  but  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  problem  is  that  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  exhausted  administratively,  and  we  always 

 

 

 

 

 

require  you  to  do  that.  There  isn't  an  exception,  as  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  it,  under  the  APA,  for  your  failure  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaust  your  avenues  in  the  agency  first.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ­­ please.  Go  ahead. 

   

  

  

 

 

 

MR.  KELLER:  And  when  we  bring  forth  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit,  which  only  occurred  as  of  November  20,  2014,  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  we're  challenging  DAPA's  granting  of  deferred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  doesn't  mean  in  the  four  narrow  categories  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  passed  statutes  allowing  deferred  action  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  VAWA  self­petitioners,  T­ and  U­visa  applicants,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

widows  and  widowers  ­­ that  somehow  we'd  have  to  also  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenging  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Do  you  think  this?  Suppose 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  instead  of  doing  DAPA,  DHS  had  decided  to  go  one  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  by  one  and  it  just  ­­ you  know,  it  sent  a  notice  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  person.  Do  you  think  at  that  point  that  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DHS  could  also  say,  and  this  will  include  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  because  of  our  preexisting  regulations? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Insofar  as  they  were  granting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

lawful  presence,  no.  Work  authorization,  I  think  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

most  look,  you'd  look  at,  well,  has  there  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  acquiescence  to  this  minimal  program  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  ­­ I'm  not  sure  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  the  first  part  of  that  because  let's  just, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like,  take  out  the  labels.  Just  ­­ it  notifies  a  single

you  unless  we  change  our  minds.  And  by  virtue  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preexisting  regulations,  you  now  can  work  on  the  books. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is  that  legal?  Could  ­­ could  DHS  do  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  I  don't  think  there's  statutory 

    

 

 

 

 

authorization.  There  may  have  been  congressional 

  

 

 

 

 

acquiescence  to  a  practice  in  a  ­­ very  small  cases 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that's  bridging  lawful  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  See,  that's  interesting 

  

 

 

 

because  I  thought  ­­ and  as  you  said,  there's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  authorization  with  respect  to  that,  and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  your  entire  argument  is  that  they  can't  do  this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except  for  statutory  authorization.  And  now  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  well,  in  some  cases  they  can  do  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  Justice  Kagan,  we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

multiple  arguments.  The  first  is  a  statutory  argument. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

And  our  backup  argument,  which  is  a  response  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive's  congressional  acquiescence  argument,  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

at  most,  Congress  would  have  acquiesced  to  a  practice  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  small  uses  that  were  bridged  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  how  about  this?  How 

  

  

 

 

 

 

about  DHS  doesn't  do  it  one  by  one.  How  about  DHS  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  senseless  to  do  it  one  by  one.  We  should  use  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories.  Here's  the  category.  You've  been  here  for 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

25  years.  You're  entitled  to  ­­ not  entitled.  You  can 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stay  unless  we  change  our  minds.

So  that's  the  category.  So  it's  a  smaller 

   

  

 

 

 

 

category,  but,  you  know,  there's  some  ­­ there's  a  lot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  people  in  that. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  If  there  was  no  previous  lawful 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

status  or  an  eminent  lawful  status,  there's  no  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  acquiesced  to  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  I  can  back  up  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  wait  a  minute.  So  ­­ so 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

that's  important.  So  ­­ so  DHS  could  not  say  to  all  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  have  been  here  for  25  years  and  perfectly  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abiding,  Congress  could  not  say  to  those,  you  know,  tens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  thousands  of  people,  let's  say,  not  millions,  tens  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands,  all  right,  you  ­­ we  won't  deport  you  unless 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  change  our  minds,  and  you  can  work,  you  can  feed  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

families,  you  can  do  that.  Congress  ­­ DHS  could  not  do

smaller  policy  of  the  kind  that  DHS  or  its  predecessor

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Please,  you  may 

  

 

 

 

 

answer  the  question. 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  When  we're  talking  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

scope  of  the  program  as  opposed  to  bridging  lawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status,  the  scope  goes  to,  is  this  a  question  of  deep 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

economic  significance?  It  also  goes  to  when  the  1987 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  authorization  was  justified,  the  Executive  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling  everyone  through  the  administrative  process  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  was  for  a  minuscule  number  of  people,  and  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  affect  the  labor  market. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  this  also  brings  to  light  that  here,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive  didn't  even  use  notice­and­comment  in 

 

 

 

 

 

promulgating  this  sweeping  ­­ their  theory  is  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  grant  deferred  action  where  there's  not  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawful  status,  that  no  court  can  review  it,  and  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  even  use  notice­and­comment  procedure. 

 

 

 

 

            

That  is  unprecedented,  is  a  sweeping 

   

 

 

 

assertion  as  Justice  Jackson  said  in  Youngstown.  "It  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  duty  of  the  Court  to  be  last,  not  first  to  give  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  separation  of  powers." 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  General. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice.

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Ms.  Murphy. 

  

 

 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ERIN  E.  MURPHY 

 

 

 

 

 

       

FOR  UNITED  STATES  HOUSE  OF  REPRESENTATIVES, 

 

 

 

 

 

      

AS  AMICUS  CURIAE,  SUPPORTING  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Three  years  ago  the  Executive  asked  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  enact  legislation  that  would  have  given  it  the  power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  authorize  most  of  the  people  that  are  living  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country  unlawfully  to  stay,  work,  and  receive  benefits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Congress  declined. 

 

 

            

Now  the  Executive  comes  before  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  extraordinary  claim  that  it  has  had  the  power 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  achieve  the  same  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse  me.  Was  that 

  

  

 

 

 

really  all  ­­ was  that  part  of  a  package  for  a  pathway 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  citizenship? 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  It  was  not  a  pathway  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

citizenship.  It  was  a  pathway  to  lawful  presence  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

country  that  would  have  allowed  individuals  to  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  status,  to  remain  in  this  country,  and  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  not  created  a  legal  status  for  the  category  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  covered  by  DAPA. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  correct.  Why  do 

  

  

 

 

 

you  think  this  is  a  legal  status  in  the  way  that  that

bill  imagines? 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  It  is  a  legal  status  because 

   

  

 

 

 

 

under  the  agency's  own  regulations,  it  is  a  status  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  consequences.  And  I  would  point  you  in  particular 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  8  C.F.R.  1.3.  This  is  the  statute  that  defines  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term  "lawfully  present."  Under  that  statute,  if  you  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  deferred­action  status,  you  are  lawfully  present  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible  for  benefits. 

 

 

            

Now  that  statute  goes  on  to  say  if  you  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  an  individual  as  to  whom  DHS  has  declined  to  pursue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

removal  proceedings,  you  are  not  lawfully  present.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  you  are  in  deferred­action  status  makes  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  under  the  agency's  own  regulations.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  affirmative  act  of  not  just  forbearing  and  making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  decision  not  to  remove  somebody,  but  putting  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  deferred­action  status  that  triggers  the 

 

 

 

 

 

availability  of  work  authorization  and  eligibility  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive  benefits. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  why  don't  we  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross  ­­ why  don't  we  just  cross  out  "lawfully  present," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  SG  has  suggested? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  You  can't  cross  it  out  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

achieve  what  DAPA  is  supposed  to  achieve,  because  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  matters  in  DAPA  is  that  it  is  allowing  the  grant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  deferred­action  status.

Whatever  the  Executive  wants  to  label  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  its  own  regulations,  deferred­action  status  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equated  with  lawful  presence.  So  if  you  cross  it  out  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  DAPA  memo,  it's  still  part  of  the  regulatory  scheme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  says  once  we've  taken  this  extra  step,  not  just  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferring  the  removal  of  you,  but  of  putting  you  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  status,  that  changes  your  eligibility  for  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  and  benefits  in  this  country.  And  once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Executive  is  doing  that,  we  are  far  outside  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notion  of  mere  enforcement  discretion. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  you  would  agree  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  clause  that  says  low  priority,  that  ­­ that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  about  work  authorization,  nothing  about  Social 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Security,  if  you  are  low  priority,  which  means  we'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  never  get  to  you  because  Congress  hasn't  given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us  the  money  to  remove  you. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Well,  we  would  not  necessarily 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concede  that  you  could  actually  grant  people  cards  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  we're  not  going  to  enforce  the  law  as  to  you.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  all  not  at  issue  in  this  case,  because  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive  wants  to  do  is  something  much  more  than  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  all  they  wanted  to  do  was  say  we're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  enforce  as  to  you,  the  only  memo  they  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  issued  is  the  Enforcement  Priorities  Memo,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  order  to  qualify  for  DAPA,  you  have  to  already  not  be

an  enforcement  priority  under  the  Enforcement  Priorities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Memorandum. 

            

What  the  Executive  wanted  to  accomplish  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  more:  To  say  not  only  are  you  not  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  priority,  but  we  want  you  to  be  eligible  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  and  to  receive  benefits.  And  the  way  that  we  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  by  taking  this  affirmative  act  of  converting  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  a  status  that,  under  our  own  regulation,  changes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  eligibility  ­­

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Why  wouldn't  the 

  

 

 

 

appropriate  way  for  Texas  to  proceed  have  been  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  the  regulation  under  the  APA  ­­ I  think  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  553  ­­ and  then  if  there  were  concern  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice­and­comment  taking  too  long,  asking  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preliminary  injunction? 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  I  ­­ I  don't  think  that's  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

way  that  it  actually  makes  sense  for  this  to  proceed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there's  nothing  inherently  problematic  about  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  that  ties  deferred­action  status  to  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization.

think  it's  the  way  you  have  to  challenge  this,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me,  the  real  problem  is  not  the  linking  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferred­action  status  and  work  authorization,  it's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse  of  deferred­action  status.  That's  not  a  power 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  includes  the  power  to  grant  deferred  action  status

General  Keller,  because  I  think  he  did  say  ­­ came  up  a

category  of  people,  give  them  that.  But  you  can't  give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  work  authorization  or  Social  Security. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  What  I  would  say  is  we  would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  concerns  if  this  case  were  challenging  just  the

gave  them  an  enforcement  priority  card.

Before  1997,  you  didn't  even  have

But  suppose  we  played  ­­ suppose  I  picked  up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  thought  and  also  coupled  it  with  what  the  SG  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross  out  the  words  that  say  "special  status."  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose  that  would  it  work  to  say,  look,  the  question  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  Texas  has  standing  to  complain  about  simply  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  in  priorities  for  action.  We  don't  know  yet  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  affects  driver's  licenses,  or  could,  or  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect  benefits,  or  will.  But  should  the  Administration 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  so,  then  they  might  have  a  case  that  they  could  bring 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenging  that  aspect  of  the  situation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

All  we're  saying  is  that  they  do  not  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case  now,  given  the  SG's  concession  or  agreement  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

desire  to  strike  those  words  out.  Does  that  work  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not,  in  your  opinion?

MS.  MURPHY:  I'm  not  sure  I  completely  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

I'm  sorry. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  If  I  am  not  clear,  I  will 

   

   

  

 

 

 

not  repeat  it,  but  you  can  forget  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  No,  no.  I  want  to  be 

    

  

 

 

 

 

responsive.  I  just  want  to  be  sure  I  understand  the  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question. 

 

              

I  mean,  I  think  ­­ I  ­­ I  ­­ I  guess  my 

   

   

   

   

 

 

point  is  that  I  don't  think  anything,  either  in  Texas's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  of  the  case,  or  in  our  view  of  the  case,  that  turns 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  these  words  "lawful  presence"  being  in  the  DAPA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

memorandum,  because  what  matters  is  the  DAPA  memorandum, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  it  says,  is  designed  to  make  it  a  path  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  to  be  eligible  for  work  authorization,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  DAPA  they're  not. 

 

 

 

            

And  it's  also  a  path  to  make  them  ­­ I  mean, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

once  they  are  in  deferred­action  status,  that  is  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  are  considered  lawfully  present.  You're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

considered  lawfully  present  just  because  the  Executive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  actively  pursuing  removal  proceedings  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you. 

            

Again,  C.F.R.  ­­ 8  C.F.R.  1.3,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

specifically  says  the  decision  not  to  pursue  a  removal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding  does  not  render  you  lawfully  present.  So  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters.  You  know,  the  ­­ the  words  that  were  used

here,  and  the  program  being  created,  matters.  It's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  to  have  mere  forbearance.  You  need  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  step  to  achieve  what  the  Executive  wants  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accomplish. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  your  position  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  1989,  when  George  H.  W.  Bush  granted  deferred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforced  departure  for  Chinese  residents  after  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tiananmen  Square  situation,  that  he  acted  illegally? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  No.  Because  that  program  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

justified  on  a  different  power  than  the  power  here.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  deferred  ­­ that  ­­ the  deferred  enforced  departure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Article  II  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  there  was  no 

  

 

 

 

 

statutory  authority  for  him  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  It  is  a  power  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Executive  has  always  grounded  in  Article  II  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affairs  power.  A  nationality,  country­based  concern 

    

 

 

 

power. 

            

Now,  there's  currently  a  statute  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

books,  the  temporary  protected  status  statute,  that  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  the  exclusive  authority  through  which  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive  can  grant  nationality  based,  but  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That  came  after  this. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Right.  And  at  the  time,  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute  didn't  exist  ­­

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  At  the  time,  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

no  statutory  authority. 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Whatever  was  happening  before 

  

 

 

 

 

1990  doesn't  tell  you  very  much  about  what  Congress  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquiesced  in  when  Congress  passed  a  statute  in  1990 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  said  these  are  the  circumstances  under  which  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  grant  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ I  appreciate  that. 

    

   

 

 

And  that  may  be  what  Congress  does  here.  It  may  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  and  say  deferred  action  is  limited  in  this  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  it  hasn't  yet. 

 

 

 

            

So  assuming  that  we  have  a  history  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

deferred  action  for  categories  of  people,  then  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  really  arguing  about  it  ­­ and  you  ­­ and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stopped,  or  you  got  interrupted  when  you  were  answering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  earlier  ­­ why  are  you  ­­ are  you  arguing  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1986  regulation,  which  gives  the  Attorney  General  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  grant  work  authorizations  to  individuals  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  provided  deferred  action,  are  you  arguing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  unconstitutional? 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  No.  Because  there  are  statutes 

  

  

 

 

 

 

on  the  books  that  say  deferred  action  status  also  comes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  work  authorization.  So,  of  course  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Except  that  the  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

says  that  the  ­­ those  people,  deferred  action,  can  be

granted  under  the  statute  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

            

General. 

            

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ or  by  the  Attorney 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  MURPHY:  I'm  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  ones  if  ­­ you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

striking  out  by  the  Attorney  General? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  I  was  talking  about  different 

    

 

 

 

 

statutes,  not  1324a(h)(3).  I  was  talking  about  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

statutes  that  actually  refer  to  deferred  action.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  say  that  the  Executive  can  grant  deferred  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  work  authorization.  So  there's  nothing  inherently 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problematic  about  a  regulation  that  implements 

   

 

 

 

Congress's  precise  understanding  that  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  where  the  Executive  is  authorized  to  grant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferred  action  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  Murphy,  suppose 

  

 

 

 

something  is  not  statutorily  authorized.  Suppose  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  a  version  of  the  hypothetical  that  I  gave  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  Keller.  Suppose  DHS  decided  to  do  this  one  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  by  one.  And  in  doing  it  one  by  one  by  one,  also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  and  you're  entitled  to  work  on  the  books.  Could  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  DHS  do  that? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  I  think  it  would  ­­ it  would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  in  that  instance  start  to  become  a  question

of  scope  and  a  point  at  which  you  have  a  policy  that  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  with  the  use  of  deferred  action  status. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  in  the  past,  I  mean,  there  have  been  this  kind 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ad  hoc  de  minimis,  case­by­case  use  of  deferred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  status. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Okay.  So  suppose,  then  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

again,  same  kind  of  question  that  I  gave  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

General  Keller.  Suppose  that  there  was  a  policy,  but  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  of  much  less  significance  scope.  Let's  say  a  policy 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  said  if  you've  been  in  the  United  States  for  30 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years  and  you  have  children  here,  we're  not  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deport  you  unless  we  decide  otherwise,  and  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  work  on  the  books.  Could  DHS  do  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  No.  There  is  not  any 

  

  

 

 

 

 

congressional  authority  that  allows  it,  and  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

past  practice  like  it. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  this  is  very 

  

 

 

 

 

significant,  right?  No  past  practice  like  it?  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean  ­­

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  There's  not  any  past  practice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  What  was  that  family  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  That  was  not  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ policy  ­­ fairness? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  ­­ voluntary  departure.  There 

  

  

 

 

 

was  a  statute  on  the  books  at  the  time  that  permitted

extended  voluntary  departure.  You  no  longer  can  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  There  is  no  past  deferred  action  program  that  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  category  of  individuals  that  had  no  path  to  loss 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  status. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So,  but  this  is  important. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Because  you're  ­­ you're  basically  saying  that  DHS, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  forward,  any  administration  cannot  have  any  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  policy,  even  if  it's  limited,  much  more  limited  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  kind  of  policy  is  that  allows  undocumented  aliens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  work. 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Congress  has  passed  a  statute 

   

  

 

 

 

that  says  if  you  are  living  in  this  country  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  authority,  you  cannot  work.  That's  Congress's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

policy  judgment  in  1324a. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That's  ­­

  

 

 

MS.  MURPHY:  You  may  disagree  with  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

understand  the  point.  All,  I  guess,  I'm  just  saying  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  would  be  an  enormous  change  in  practice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  MURPHY:  Not  at  all,  Your  Honor,  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  past  practices,  there  are  none.  They  have  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  to  a  single  deferred  action  program  that  granted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  to  a  class  of  individuals  who  had  no  lawful  path  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status  in  this  country.

there's  only 

 

about  four  deferred  action  programs  that  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class­based.  Those  all  were  path  to  lawful  status.

Second,  even  if  you  think  they  got  over  the

zone  of  interest  in  any  provision  within  the  APA,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  haven't  tried  to  establish  that.

And  then  third  with  respect  to  standing,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  Justice  Breyer's  point  about  the  analogy  between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  kind  of  theory  that  they  are  advocating  here  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taxpayer  standing  and  parens  patriae  is  dead  on  correct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  would  invite  exactly  the  same  kind  of  flood  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  that  you  have  always  said  Article  III  is

already  exists.  Texas  is  already  using  this  theory  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue  the  United  States  based  on  the  resettlement  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Syrian  refugees  in  Texas,  and  that  will  just  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning. 

            

Now,  Justice  Alito,  you  raised  a  couple  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

points  I  want  to  get  to  with  some  specifics.  You  asked 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  whether  an  employee  with  a  deferred  action  work 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  could  sue  if  an  employer  refused  to  hire. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  would  direct  Your  Honor  to  8  U.S.C.  1324b.  Actually, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  determined  the  situations  in  which  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  ­­ well,  with  ­­ an  alien  with  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  has  a  discrimination  claim  and  when  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

employee  doesn't.  That  statute  says  if  you're  a  lawful 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

public  resident,  you  do.  Deferred  action  is  on  the  side 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  don't. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I  was  asking  about 

   

  

 

 

 

Section  1981. 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  but  I  think  that  if

you  have  a  ­­ you'd  have  a  hard  time  making  that  claim 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  that  Congress  has  made  that  kind  of  a  judgment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  with  respect  to  another  point 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor  made  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  your  position  is  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  could  not  be  a  suit  under  1981. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  What  I'm  saying  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  made  a  judgment  there  that  ­­ that  bears  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly  on  it. 

 

 

            

But  now,  with  respect  to  another  point  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor  raised  about  specific  statutory  references  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawful  presence,  my  friends  on  the  other  side  made  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

huge  deal  about  this,  in  particular  8  C.F.R.  1.3,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  they  cite  seven  or  eight  times. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  urge  you  to  go  to  look  at  it.  I  urge  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to,  in  fact,  read  the  rulemaking  order  that  went  along 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  it  from  ­­ from  1996.  What  you'll  ­­ you'll  see 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  says,  that  it  applies  to  one  thing  and  one  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only.  That's  the  accrual  of  Social  Security  benefits 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Section  1611(b).  And  the  rulemaking  order  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  quoted  this  in  our  reply  brief  ­­ specifically  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  although  we're  counting  deferred  action  as  lawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence  for  the  purpose  of  accruing  Social  Security 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits  for  the  reason  that  if  you  can  work  lawfully, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ought  to  be  able  to  accrue  benefits.  This  does  not

confer  any  lawful  status  under  the  immigration  laws.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  says  that. 

 

 

            

 

 

And  so  we  can  argue  about  whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive  has  the  authority  to  consider  people  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deferred  action  as  lawfully  present  in  that  narrow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense.  We  think  we're  right.  Maybe  they're  right,  but 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  the  tail  on  the  dog  here.  That's  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  if  you  ­­ if  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase  "lawful  presence"  were  stricken  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guidance,  would  you  take  the  position  that  DAPA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries  are  not  lawfully  present  for  purposes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ under  certain  statutes  that  use  that  phrase  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

re­entry  bar,  for  eligibility  for  Federal  benefits? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  It's  ­­ the  only  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  is  Social  Security. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  would  you  say  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were  lawfully  present  for  those  two  statutory  purposes? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No.  There  are 

  

  

 

 

regulations  that  say  that  they  are,  but  we  ­­ and  we  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fight  about  that.  But  that  doesn't  ­­ but  that  ­­ as  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  that  is  the  tail  on  the  dog. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  I  could  go  to  the  merits. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Repeatedly,  you've  heard  that  the  Family  Fairness  policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  pursuant  to  statutory  authorization.  That's  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

flat  wrong.  There's  a  D.C.  Circuit  case,  and  you  can

read  Judge  Silberman's  opinion  in  that  case  that  we  cite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  page  49  in  our  brief  which  specifically  describes  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  extra­statutory,  which  is  what  it  was. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  other  key  point,  and  I  think  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  really  important.  Their  theory  about  the  scope  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  can  get  work  authorization  is  that  either  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  specifically  say  you  get  work  authorization,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  to  specifically  authorize  the  Attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General,  now  DHS,  to  get  ­­ to  grant  ­­ to  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  people  in  this  particular  category  can  get  work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization. 

            

Forget  about  deferred  action.  There  are 

  

 

 

 

 

millions  of  people  who  get  work  authorization  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existing  law  now  who  ­­ who  couldn't  get  it  if  ­­ if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  the  proper  interpretation  of  the  law.  These 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

millions  of  people  are  in  proceedings  for  adjustments  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status.  The  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  who  are  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings  for  cancellation  of  removal.  The  hundreds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  of  people  that  have  parole.  None  of  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  qualify  under  reading  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  is  why  in  1987,  when  ­­ when  INS  had  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rulemaking  proceeding  about  this,  they  rejected  it.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  completely  and  totally  upend  the  administration  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  immigration  laws,  and,  frankly,  it's  a  reckless 

   

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion.  And  it  just  ­­ and  ­­ and  they

all  kinds  of  statuses  that  don't  qualify  as  lawful
