 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. SHAH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 Relying on common law trust principles 

applicable to private fiduciaries, the Federal Circuit 

imposed on the United States a duty to disclose 

attorney-client privileged communications to an Indian 

tribe.  That abrogation of the privilege should be 

16 

reversed for at least three reasons.

 First, reflecting the sovereign nature of 

the United States function, the Indian trust context 

lacks the factors essential to recognition of a private 

trust fiduciary exception.  Unlike in a private trust, 

government attorneys and other Federal officials owe an 

exclusive duty of loyalty to the United States, not to 

the beneficiary.  The government pays the cost of trust 

administration out of appropriated funds, not out of the 

trust corpus.  The government, not the trust, owns the

resulting record, and the release of such governmental 

record, including to a tribe or individual Indian, is 

governed by specific statutes and regulations as well as 

the Freedom of Information Act, not the common law.

 Second, the decision below conflicts with 

this Court's precedents that distinguish the United 

States from a private trustee and that reject 

enforcement of duties governing the administration of 

Indian property that are not set forth by specific 

statute or regulation. 

 The fiduciary exception to the 

attorney-client privilege is premised on a private 

trustee's general common law duty to disclose trust 

information, but no statute or regulation imposes such a 

duty on the United States. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, all of the 

statutes relating to these funds use the word "trust." 

Not one statute defines trust and says in any way this 

is not a fiduciary relationship.  To the contrary, in 

fact, most of the statutes require what would be 

consistent with fiduciary obligations, and at least one 

of them that you rely on says "but not limited to." 

 So the issue before us doesn't involve a 

24 

competing sovereign interest by the U.S.  You've 

25

conceded that in your cert petition.  The circuit below 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

said this is not a case where there is an independent 

sovereign issue governing the U.S. activities.  Just 

explain to me what's the rationale that would permit a 

trustee of a trust fund to withhold from the beneficiary 

the kinds of documents that relate to the management of 

the fund?  If the funds exist for the benefit of the 

Indian tribe, why aren't they entitled to management 

documents? 

 MR. SHAH:  Okay -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the part that

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shah, you might want 

to make your third point.  You said you had three points 

preliminarily, so why don't you make your third point 

and then respond to the question. 

 MR. SHAH:  Sure, Your Honor.  The third 

point is that the Federal Circuit's decision poses 

serious practical problems for the government because 

the general common law duty to disclose which undergirds 

the fiduciary exception extends to all trust information 

without regard to the existence of litigation; excepting 

it implies a broad and burdensome disclosure obligation. 

For example, there are over 300,000 individual account 

holders, individual Indian account holders on top of the 

tribal, tribal account holders.  If this Court were to 

5

5

accept the fiduciary exception and thereby ratify the 

underlying rationale, presumably then any one of those 

or all of those 300-plus thousand individual account 

holders could simply call up the Interior Department and 

request all related trust records outside of the 

6 

existing statutory and regulatory regime.

 Now, Justice Sotomayor, let me turn back to 

your set of questions, and let me start with the first 

point that you made, which is the statutes here use the 

term trust; why doesn't that connote some sort of broad 

fiduciary relationship?  This Court has made clear in 

its precedents, and it dates back to the Mitchell 1, the 

first decision in Mitchell case, where Congress's use of 

the term "trust," the Court said, does not imply the 

full gamut of common law fiduciary obligations. 

 The dissent made precisely -- the dissent in 

Mitchell made precisely the argument that you're 

sketching out here, which is when Congress uses a term 

like trust, we would naturally assume that it implies 

fiduciary obligations.  The majority in Mitchell 

rejected that notion, and in fact in Mitchell 2 in the 

Navajo Nation decisions, the Court has continued to 

reject that proposition.  But more -- more than as a 

matter of precedent I think that makes -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But in both -- in all of

those cases, counsel, it was a limitation related to 

competing interests, meaning it was recognizing that 

there are potentially moments in which an attorney is 

acting both in the interest of the government and in the 

interest of the tribe. 

 MR. SHAH:  Justice Sotomayor, with respect, 

there is no competing interest that I'm aware of that 

were mentioned in -- in the Mitchell decisions, Mitchell 

1, Mitchell 2, or even the Navajo Nation decision. 

Those were simply -- in Mitchell 1 it was the Indian 

General Allotment Act, which said that the United States 

"shall hold in trust" land for the benefit of the 

Indians.  The argument made by the tribe in that case 

and by the dissenters in the Court was when the Court 

said you shall hold the land in trust, that implies 

certain management and other responsibilities for 

resources related to that land.  This Court said no, 

when Congress uses the term "trust" in the Indian 

context, that there must be specific statutory 

regulatory duties that the Court sets out.  Let me 

21 

explain -­

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that was a 

jurisdictional question, not a question with respect 

to -- to the -- to the obligation.  You're not seriously 

suggesting that if you're a trustee of an Indian fund 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1

that you can breach your fiduciary duty by simply not 

exercising care in your investment strategies.  So some 

form of -- of duty exists. 

 MR. SHAH:  Sure, and let me -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- from the common law, 

6 

and the common law has to define that.

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, I agree 

everything up to the point when you said we go to the 

common law.  Of course there would be in this context 

some enforceable duties with respect to investment of 

the funds held in trust, and that's because the relevant 

statutes, section 161a and 162a, set forth specific 

investment duties that the government must comply with. 

Now, as to your other point, that Mitchell 1 and the 

Navajo Nation -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so why would, if it 

imposes those duties, protect you from disclosing items 

that might -- attorney confidences that go to that very 

act, the very act of investing in the way, even under 

your definition, that the trust requires you to? 

 MR. SHAH:  A couple responses, Your Honor. 

The -- the two statutes that you're talking about, 161a 

and 162a, set forth specific investment duties.  They 

don't say anything about disclosure.  The 1994 Act does 

set forth some disclosure obligations, but they are

extremely discrete.  There are essentially two 

disclosure obligations that all of these statutes 

together impose.  The -- the United States must provide 

an account statement, a quarterly account statement; and 

the United States must provide the -- the Indian tribes 

and individual Indians an annual audit.  That is the 

extent of disclosure obligations that Congress has set 

forth and that the Interior Department by regulation has 

implemented.

 Now, to the -- to the extent that your 

question suggests that the tribes may need more in order 

to enforce those enforcement duties, I think the -- the 

account statements and the annual audit goes a long way 

towards suggesting that if there is a problem, then the 

tribe may want to try to enforce those duties. 

 The other point I would make is, although 

the legally enforceable duties under this Court's 

decisions in Mitchell and Navajo Nation are those set 

forth by statute and regulation, that doesn't mean the 

Interior Department doesn't have discretion to provide 

more information.  And in fact, in practice, the 

Interior Department does provide a much broader swath of 

information to the Indian tribes regarding these 

accounts than the two discrete pieces of information 

that the statutes set forth.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you agree that the -- do 

you agree that the fiduciary exception is well 

established as a general matter? 

 MR. SHAH:  Your Honor, the United States 

does not contest the existence of a fiduciary exception 

in certain private trust contexts where the criteria for 

that exception are satisfied.  So the answer is no, we 

don't, we don't dispute the existence in certain 

contexts under certain circumstances of a fiduciary 

exception. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So if this cause arose in a 

different context with a different trustee, the position 

of the United States would be that under Rule 501 of the 

Federal Rules of Evidence there is a fiduciary exception 

to the attorney-client privilege? 

 MR. SHAH:  Yes, Your Honor.  It would depend 

on the circumstances.  For example, if it were a private 

trust and the factors that -- in which the courts, the 

old English cases, for example, have recognized where 

the fiduciary exception applies, that is the information 

is sought solely for the benefit of the beneficiary, the 

expenses for that legal advice are paid out of the trust 

corpus, and as a result of that, the resulting legal 

advice and the resulting records belong to the trust 

corpus.  All of those things give right, as the old 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

English cases say, give right to a common law right of 

access for the beneficiary to access those. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shah, you don't have 

4 

to take a position on that, because you don't represent 

5

6 

7 

8

a private trustee.  And the government can accept 

arguendo that there would be such a relationship, but I 

don't think you have to defend it. 

 MR. SHAH:  Absolutely, the Court need not 

9 

decide that question in order to reach the question.

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

The Court can assume it arguendo and then go forward.  I 

think the critical point here is, though, that all of 

the factors that underlie that -- that exception in the 

private trustee concept are absent here.  Here the 

government is acting out of its own interest.  It is 

paying for the legal advice out of congressional 

appropriations.  The government owns the records at 

issue by virtue of the Federal Records Act, by virtue of 

Interior Department regulations, which are cited in the 

back of our brief make very clear that the government 

owns these records, and because they are governmental 

records their disclosure is not governed by the common 

law.  There is a highly -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The thrust of what -- my 

24 

understanding of the thrust of what Justice Sotomayor 

25

was asking is something like the following:  It's easy

to understand how there can be competing government 

interests when you're talking about some, the management 

of lands, things of that nature.  But when you're just 

talking about managing funds, what competing interests 

can there be in practical terms?  If you assume arguendo 

that this exception applies to a private trustee, why 

should it not apply to the government in practical 

terms? 

 MR. SHAH:  Sure.  Let me provide two 

responses, Justice Alito.  First, I think as a formal 

position I don't think our position turns, as a formal 

matter, on the existence of a specific competing duty. 

I think such a rule would overlook the ways in which the 

U.S. inherently, United States inherently differs from a 

private trustee.  And I think that's especially true in 

the light of the complex multifaceted ways in which the 

government interacts with Indians and Indian tribes. 

Those sovereign obligations extend to law -- providing 

law enforcement, educational duties, health services. 

One subset of those duties are the type of trust 

21 

responsibilities at issue in this case. 

22

23 

24 

25

 Now, to be more concrete, I think, even 

putting aside that larger framework which may create 

tensions between the United States and with -- and the 

Indian tribes in certain circumstances, I think even in 

12

12 

13 

14 

15

the trust fund, purely in the trust fund context that 

we're talking about, there could be at least tensions 

that arise. 

 For example, the D.C. Circuit in the Cobell 

case when it talked about the accounting obligation that 

it imposed on the government, it made clear that it's 

not the same accounting obligation that would apply at 

common law.  And the reason the D.C. Circuit gave was 

because the United States would be taking that -­

performing that obligation at the expense of taxpayers. 

There are budgetary constraints that the United States 

must take into consideration as a sovereign.  Maybe 

that's not a specific competing obligation in the formal 

sense, but I think it's -- it's a factor that 

distinguishes the United States from a private 

16 

fiduciary. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 Also, there are -- for example in our brief 

we discuss one of, just as an example, one of the 

documents at issue in this case, which involves a 

judgment by a tribal court seeking to attach funds from 

an individual Indian money account.  The United States 

acts as a trustee with respect to that individual -­

Indian account.  It may be the case that the United 

States consistent with its fiduciary obligations in that 

sense could simply pay out the judgment, but I think

there would be room for the United States to take a 

closer look at the judgment, to make sure that it 

complies with, for example, the Indian Civil Rights Act 

or basic due process -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose we have the Union 

Trust Company, a private company that has 5,000 trust 

accounts.  One day the president of the company says to 

the lawyer:  Mr. Smith's account is in a special 

situation.  Will you please look into what we should do 

for him as trustee?  There's no implication for any 

other account.  There's no threat of litigation.  I just 

want to know what we're supposed to do.  Now, I take it 

the document that is subsequently written would be open 

for Mr. Smith to get; is that right?

 MR. SHAH:  Yes, Your Honor.  We do not -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, okay.  Now, why should 

the government be treated differently were the situation 

identical to what I just proposed? 

 MR. SHAH:  I think the response is, Your 

Honor, is that the situation will never be identical to 

the hypothetical you posed because the government 

inherently differs, and let me set out -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But this argument, 

24 

frankly, would be -- we wouldn't have any need for 501, 

25

because if as an evidentiary rule the government is 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

always different, then there is no situation in which 

fiduciary duties in common law would ever exist. 

 MR. SHAH:  To be clear, Justice Sotomayor, 

4 

the government is not arguing that no common law 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

exception to the attorney-client privilege can apply to 

the government or that Federal Rule 501, Federal Rule of 

Evidence 501 is otherwise inapplicable.  We're making a 

much more limited argument that this particular common 

law fiduciary exception is not applicable to the 

10

government, and that is because the premise of that 

11 

fiduciary exception does not apply.

24

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there -- is there any 

greater value to a fiduciary duty than to manage the 

account for the benefit of the beneficiary?  That's the 

very essence of what a trust means, and so I'm having a 

hard time understanding not a competing interest 

situation where you're addressing a different statutory 

requirement, but merely -- and that's what this case was 

presented as, merely the management of the trust.  So 

what you're, it seems to me, you're arguing is there is 

no duty.  You're saying it's all defined by statute 

only, but you're rendering -- there's no need to use the 

word "trust" because it wouldn't be a trust. 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

that those two things are inconsistent.  The fact that 

15

4 

5

7 

8

we don't look to the common law to fill in all of the 

duties doesn't mean that the government doesn't have 

duties in this context.  It has very specific duties, to 

invest the funds properly, to invest the funds as set 

forth in the statutes.  What this Court has said could 

not be done is to look at the general common law to 

create obligations on the government. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I would like to get an 

9 

answer to my question.

10

11

12 

13 

14

15

 MR. SHAH:  Sure. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  My question, to go back to 

it, was imagine that the government has a thousand trust 

accounts for a thousand tribes. 

 MR. SHAH:  Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And imagine that several of 

16 

them consist of nothing more than $500,000 in cash. 

17

18

 MR. SHAH:  Okay. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And one day the Secretary 

19 

of the Interior says to a lawyer:  I fear there is kind 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

of a difficult fiduciary problem arising into account 

number 302, which is owned by such and such tribe. 

There is no threat of litigation.  As far as I can tell, 

the answer to this will have no implication for anything 

else in the government.  Will you please look at it and 

give me a memo what to do?

 Now, why should that memo not be given to 

the lawyer for the tribe if in the identical case of the 

Union Trust Company you would give the lawyer -- the 

memo to the beneficiary?

 MR. SHAH:  A couple of reasons, Your Honor. 

First, as this Court recognized, starting back in 1912 

in the Heckman case, and reiterated in the Candelaria 

and Minnesota cases after that, is that the United 

States is not acting simply out of the beneficiary's 

interests. 

 So in the hypothetical, the original 

hypothetical that you posed in the corporation or the 

bank that was acting as a trustee, there the trustee is 

simply acting out of its fiduciary obligation solely to 

benefit the beneficiary.  That is not how the 

governments work.  As this Court made clear, the 

government is acting not out of the beneficiary's 

interests, it is acting out of its own sovereign 

interest in managing the statutes and regulations that 

govern the administration of Indian property.  That's a 

21 

fundamental difference. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You're saying, one, we're 

23 

not really a trustee totally? 

24

25

 MR. SHAH:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, if we

and totally -­

 MR. SHAH:  Sure. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in this very limited 

situation I described, what harm would befall the

government? 

7

8 

9 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, we would still 

win, and here's why.  The factors that -- even assuming 

a common law trustee, the fiduciary exception doesn't 

10

apply automatically at all common law trustees.  There's 

11 

several things that underlie that fiduciary exception.

22 

23

25

 One, the -- the -- the advice sought is 

typically paid for out of the trust corpus, and as a 

result of that fact, the trust itself owns the records. 

Those are the principal two factors that the cases 

recognizing a fiduciary exception rely upon to create a 

common law right of access of the beneficiary to such 

records. 

 None of those factors are present here.  The 

government pays for these -- for -- for the cost of 

administration, including legal advice, out of 

congressionally appropriated funds.  The records 

resulting from that advice belonged to the government. 

The government owns those records, both as a matter of 

statute and regulation.  And the disclosure of those

records is subject to a highly reticulated regime. 

There are statutes, there is regulations, there is the 

Freedom of Information Act.  All of that would be 

bypassed if this Court were to accept the fiduciary 

exception in this context. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shah -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Other than the time and 

expense of going through voluminous records, which is 

obvious, is there any other harm to the government in 

10

being required to show that there's a competing interest 

11 

that makes disclosure unnecessary or improper?

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. SHAH:  Yes, Your Honor.  As I said to 

Justice Alito, it may not always be that the government 

can point to a specific competing interest in the sense 

that Justice Sotomayor is talking about, a competing 

statutory interest.  But there are inherently these 

tensions, budgetary concerns, other ways in which the 

United States interacts with Indian affairs. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is one -- is one of them 

shielding government actors?  I mean, from what you said 

so far, on the one hand you recognize that it is what we 

call a guardian, the guardian-ward relationship between 

the United States and the tribe.  But what you seem to 

be suggesting is that the government has a dual focus, 

and one is its guardianship relation to the tribe, but 

19
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

the other is these are government actors and the 

government is also interested in shielding its actors. 

 Is that -- is that it or is it a more 

4 

nebulous interest?

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, I think it 

could be more nebulous -- but -- but there -- I think 

there is a real chilling concern.  And I think this 

dovetails into Justice Kennedy's question, that the 

Interior Department, in order to properly administer, to 

carry out the statutory and regulatory duties, it often 

needs to seek the legal advice of -- of the lawyers in 

the Interior office or in the Department of Justice.  In 

order to avoid the chilling the full and frank seeking 

of rendering of legal advice, the same purposes -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, this is just the 

general purpose behind the exception to 301, right, 

the -- the exception for providing attorney's advice. 

The ordinary private litigant doesn't have to show, when 

he refuses to turn over attorney advice, that there's 

some conflict which would make it harmful for him to 

21 

turn that over, does he? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. SHAH:  Not as a general matter, Your 

Honor.  If -- if -- if we were in the private trustee 

context and a court were to decide that the fiduciary 

exception applied -­

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not in the trustee context. 

2 

I'm just talking about the normal operation. 

3

 MR. SHAH:  Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.  The 

4 

justifications are general in nature and there isn't an 

5

6

7 

8 

9 

obligation to -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and so, once you 

establish that this isn't the normal trust complex, we 

apply the normal Rule 301 law, and -- and that does not 

require the person who declines to turn over the 

10

information to show why it would really hurt him to turn 

11 

it over, right? 

12

 MR. SHAH:  I think that's exactly correct, 

13 

Justice Scalia. 

14

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many -- how many of 

these mismanagement suits are there?  Do you have any 

16 

estimate? 

17

18 

19 

20

 MR. SHAH:  Yes.  Currently there are about 

90 such pending suits, counting all of the district 

courts as well as the Court of Federal Claims.  And -­

and -- and of course, this issue could arise in any of 

21 

those cases. 

22

23 

24 

25

 Let me get back to one of Justice 

Sotomayor's questions, the -- the initial question about 

the fact that the Congress has used the term "trust."  I 

think as a matter of precedent, both the Mitchell 

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

decisions and the Navajo Nation decisions, I think those 

are binding, controlling precedent, and the Court should 

not deviate from those precedents that say a statute or 

regulation must define the duty.  But beyond the binding 

nature of those precedents, I think they make sense from 

6 

first principles as well, and let me try to explain why. 

7

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 The -- the -- the term "trust" has been used 

by both Congress and the courts in a variety of ways, 

often in a variety of imprecise ways, when it comes to 

the relationship between the United States and Indians 

and Indian tribes.  Courts and Congress have used the 

term when it comes to providing law enforcement, when it 

comes to providing educational services, health 

services, none of which are really the type of private 

common law trust that we know. 

 And even in scenarios where there is a 

discrete property interest that might bring us closer to 

the common law context, this Court has used -- this 

Court and Congress has recognized that "trust" can mean 

a lot of different things.  It can mean the type of bare 

trust that was at issue in Mitchell 1, the Indian 

General Allotment Act, when the trust was really simply 

to avoid alienation of the land.  It may mean specific 

investment duties, as we have here.

 But the point is that there is no "one size 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

fits all" trust terminology, and so that's why it makes 

sense for this Court to require Congress to set forth 

the specific duties and statutes, and the Interior 

Department to set forth specific duties and regulations 

before it implies such a sweeping obligation on the 

6 

United States.

12 

13 

14

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

 I think it also flows from a more general 

principle of a reluctance to hold the United States to 

common law duties when there's an existing statutory and 

regulatory regime.  I think for all of those reasons, 

not only as a matter of precedent, but as -- as a matter 

of principle, I think the -- the -- the fiduciary 

exception would -- would not apply here. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I hadn't thought about 

your argument until this -- until you made it this 

morning, that if there -- if -- if the tribe is correct 

that it owns these documents and gets -- can get them 

anytime, but the -- the -- the trial court here divided 

the documents into five categories.

 MR. SHAH:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As to some of those 

22 

categories it -- it denied -- it denied production. 

23

24

25

 MR. SHAH:  Yes, Your Honor, but those -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I take it did that in 

the context of recognizing the attorney-client 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

privilege, including work product, which were the 

accountant's records. 

 MR. SHAH:  Right.  As I understand it, 

4 

you're right, Justice Kennedy, that most of the 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

documents that the -- the trial court said the 

government didn't have to produce were, as you stated, 

attorney work product privileges -- privileged 

documents, and those the trial -- the trial court said 

that no fiduciary exception would apply to the attorney 

10

work product privilege.  And it was on that basis that 

11 

it allowed the government to withhold the documents. 

12

 If there are no further questions, I would 

13 

like to reserve the remainder of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN D. GORDON 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. GORDON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 The Jicarilla Apache Nation has sued the 

government for mismanaging millions of dollars of its 

trust monies.  No trustee in this situation, including 

the government, is entitled to withhold the legal advice 

that it has received about managing the beneficiary's 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company

money.  The beneficiary is entitled to see that legal 

advice, so that it can determine whether the trustee 

followed the advice. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's -- you don't 

doubt that in this context sovereign commands would 

trump trustee obligations, do you?  In other words, if 

Congress -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 

 MR. GORDON:  The -- the notion of -- the 

issue here is an issue of evidence, and it is controlled 

by Federal Rule 501, which specifies that Federal courts 

that resolve claims of privilege based on common law 

principles.  Under the common law, a trustee cannot 

assert the attorney-client privilege to withhold from a 

fiduciary legal advice about management of the trust. 

 That, I submit, is the end of the analysis. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what do you make of 

the fact that the Uniform Trust Code reserves decision 

on the question whether there is a fiduciary exception 

to the attorney-client privilege?  That seems to suggest 

that as a general matter, this is not as 

well-established as you seem to argue.

 MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, there are very -­

there are a handful of States that have not recognized 

the fiduciary exception, but there is no Federal circuit 

that has refused to recognize it.  Indeed, all of the 

Federal circuits that have considered it have adopted 

it, and it is recognized in both, as we stated in our 

brief, the Restatement of Trusts and the Restatement of 

the law Governing Lawyers. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Gordon -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has it ever been applied, 

to your knowledge, where -- where it was not the case 

that the trust paid for the attorney's advice out of the 

trust funds and where the trust did -- where -- where 

the trust owned the papers that consisted of the 

attorney's advice?  Is there any case where those two 

conditions or either one of them did not exist where 

the -- the trust was required to turn over the 

attorney's advice? 

 MR. GORDON:  Justice Scalia, I -- I cannot 

19 

cite a specific case -­

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but, see, that's the 

argument of the government, that the exception, the 

trust exception to the extent that it exists, was based 

principally upon the fact that these papers belonged to 

the trust and that the attorney's advice had been paid 

for by the trust, so of course the trustee is entitled 

26

to get it. 

2

3 

4 

5

 MR. GORDON:  But that's not correct, if -­

if I may, Mr. Justice.  If you look at the seminal 

American decision, the Riggs Bank decision that's cited 

in both briefs, they talk about the rationales and they 

said that the first rationale is that the trustee acts 

as a proxy for the beneficiary in obtaining the advice. 

 The second rationale is that the trustee has 

9 

a general duty to disclose relevant information to the 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16

beneficiary.  The Court mentioned that one factor that 

it would look at was who had paid for the legal advice, 

but it did not suggest that that was determinative, and 

indeed subsequent case law has made clear that it is 

not, and the Restatement says explicitly that who paid 

is not the controlling factor. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you don't have a single 

17 

case? 

18

 MR. GORDON:  Not that I can cite right now. 

19 

But it would be -­

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought Riggs -- you 

said Riggs was a case where the trust fund paid the 

lawyer, and the Court distinguished cases where that 

wasn't so, where the trustee was paying the lawyer for 

the trustee's own protection, and the Court went out of 

its way to say we are dealing with a case where the 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

2 

3

lawyer is paid out of trust funds.  In Riggs, the -­

case, right? 

 MR. GORDON:  Yes, Your Honor.  But the issue

-- this is, I submit, letting the tail wag the dog.

What we are talking about is money that belongs to the 

beneficiary.  We're talking about money.  We're not 

talking about a bare trust.  We're talking about a 

full-fledged trust under Mitchell 2.  Indeed, this Court 

in Mitchell 2 said that trusts involving the management 

of Indian money were full-fledged trusts.  And in that 

situation for the government to say that, while any 

private fiduciary would be obliged to show to the 

beneficiary the legal advice it's received when there's 

an issue about whether it's fulfilled its fiduciary 

duties, it's different because we've spent our 

hard-earned money on these lawyers and we own the 

records in issue.  I mean, that doesn't make sense. 

 And basically as a matter of discovery, 

19 

which is where we are right now, the posture of the 

20

21 

22 

23

case, whenever you seek discovery, in virtually all of 

those circumstances the documents in issue are going to 

belong to the opposing party. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, the 

24 

attorney-client privilege is policy-based and I'm 

25

concerned about the policy implications of your 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

position.  Our system has concluded that it works best 

if people have candid advice from their lawyers, and my 

concern here is if you're a lawyer -- you are a lawyer 

-- and -- and you're asked for your advice by a 

trustee -­

 MR. GORDON:  Right. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and if you know 

that that is going to be shared with the beneficiary, 

you're going to give bland, mushy, hedging advice rather 

than direct and candid advice to the trustee, because 

it's going to be shared more widely beyond the trustee. 

And that's -- that hurts not only the trustee, but also 

the beneficiaries, whose trustee does not have candid 

legal advice.

 MR. GORDON:  My response to that would be 

twofold, Your Honor.  The first is that that same 

argument can be made for any private fiduciary, yet the 

courts have felt that the more important relationship is 

the relationship between the trustee and the 

beneficiary, that that trumps the need for or the

desirability for private discussions between the -­

22

23 

24 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So how does -- I 

appreciate the point, but how does a trustee get candid 

legal advice?  In every case, isn't the -- the lawyer -­

concerning his dealings with the beneficiary, with the 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

trust:  I don't know if I have to do this or I have to 

do this. 

 MR. GORDON:  Right. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And it seems to me 

if the -- if the information is always going to be 

shared with the beneficiary, the trustee is always going 

to get hedged advice. 

 MR. GORDON:  Well, if it's never shared, 

1 

2 

3

4

5

6 

7 

8

9 

Your Honor, then it leaves it at the option of the 

10

trustee to selectively waive the privilege when it's to 

11 

its advantage in a breach of trust suit. 

12

13 

14 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  Why can't the trustee 

say:  I'm going to hire my own lawyer?  I'm not going to 

pay this lawyer out of trust funds, so it will be my 

lawyer, and his advice is only to me and serving my 

16 

interests?  Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that suffice? 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. GORDON:  I think the issue, Your Honor, 

is whether that, in fact, is what the trustee is 

seeking.  If the trustee is seeking advice about 

personal liability, then I certainly agree that the 

trustee could do that.  If the trustee instead is 

seeking advice, regardless of who pays for it, but is 

seeking legal advice about how the trustee should manage 

money belonging to the beneficiary -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's always

a question of liability.  If he messes up and doesn't 

manage it the way he's supposed to, he will be liable. 

So the distinction you draw doesn't seem to me to be a 

workable one.

 MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I submit 

that the whole issue is if there is a suit for breach of 

trust, which is the precondition for all of this, 

whether in that circumstance the trustee is obliged to 

produce the legal advice that it has received so the 

beneficiary can be -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The trustee cannot hire his 

own lawyer, you're saying.  So long as he's a trustee, 

he cannot hire his own lawyer to get advice on how to 

manage the trust in a way that will avoid his liability. 

He just can't do it, right?  Trustees can't -­

 MR. GORDON:  Yes, Your Honor, that's the 

position.  And that puts the government in no different 

position than private beneficiaries or ERISA 

beneficiaries or any other sorts of beneficiaries.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's your best case that 

you have on that in the private trustee context?  I had 

thought your answer was going to be that in that case, 

the fact that the payment is made by the trustee out of 

the trustee's own funds and not out of the trust funds 

might be dispositive and might give him the privilege. 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

But you -- you seem to say, in answer to the questions 

from the Court, that, other than this distinction you 

make between what the personal liability is and how he 

ought to manage the trust, which I think is a murky 

distinction, that the documents have to be disclosed. 

6 

What's your best case for that?

13

17 

18

 MR. GORDON:  Justice Kennedy, let me respond 

to that.  And I agree that who is paying for it -- if 

the trustee is paying for it out of his own or her own 

pocket, that is a factor that certainly should be looked 

at and would be entitled to -- to some weight in terms 

of what the purpose of the advice was for; but 

ultimately the issue is whether the trustee is seeking 

to protect personal interests, protect against a claim 

of liability, for example, or whether is -- the trustee 

is looking for advice about how to manage the 

beneficiary's money. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I'm the trustee, 

19 

and I say I would like legal advice as to whether I 

20

21

22

23 

24 

25

should renegotiate this lease with the government. 

 MR. GORDON:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, I want that 

advice so I manage the trust correctly, and I'm 

concerned if I don't manage the trust correctly I'm 

going to be sued.  Now is the document from the lawyer 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company

responding to that inquiry privileged or not? 

2

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8 

9

10

 MR. GORDON:  I think, Your Honor, that if it 

focuses on how to manage it properly, then -- and it's 

prospective, then I think that the -- it -- it is not 

privileged.  If, instead, you posit, you know, this is 

what I did and I'm concerned I may have screwed up, do 

you think I'm liable, then I think a different answer 

may obtain. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if he says this 

is what I did and I might be liable, it's privileged. 

11 

If he says this is what I'm going to do -­

12

13

 MR. GORDON:  Please tell me what to do, yes. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Which means you can't get 

14 

preventative advice, which is one of the most important 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

kinds of advice an attorney can give. 

 MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, I agree 

preventative advice is the most -- is among the most 

important one can give.  But why should the government 

be in a different position with regard to this than the 

private beneficiary? 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I have a question on that 

particular point, and there may be an obvious answer to 

this which I just couldn't find.  But if the lawyer is 

in the government and he writes a memo, then -- and if 

it's available to a litigant who litigates against the

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that just -- that 

just says it may or may not be coextensive.  Reading the 

statute, it says you have to make all inter- agency or 

all memos available of a certain type, which I think 

this would fall into.  Then exception 5 protects, among 

other things, attorney-client memos that are privileged 

because they're inter-agency or intra-agency memos that 

would not be available by law to a party other than an 

agency in litigation. 

 MR. GORDON:  Right. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, they are available if 

you win.  And so, if you win that exception doesn't seem

to apply.  And if it doesn't seem to apply, that's what 

was -- then the whole world can get this memo.  And what 

I'm wondering is there must -- either there is a very 

obvious answer to that, which there could be, or there 

isn't.  If there is an obvious answer, that's the end of 

6 

it.

 MR. GORDON:  I would say, Your Honor, that 

this Court's decision in Julian, where it said that 

different classes of persons may have different rights 

under FOIA -- the right we are talking about here is the 

right of the beneficiaries.  We're not talking about the 

citizen's right to see how Indian trust monies have been 

16 

managed. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I know you don't want that, 

18 

and what I'm looking is how you prevent that. 

19

20

21 

22 

23

 MR. GORDON:  But I believe that under the 

precedent in Julian, that it would be that what we're 

talking about here is access to Indians whose money is 

being managed. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If we assume for the sake of 

24 

argument that a private trustee may, using the private 

25

trustee's own fund, hire an attorney to obtain

prospective advice about liability, does that doom your 

argument here for the reason that the government claims 

it has no ability to set up a system like this, to have 

some attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice 

regarding the management of the funds and other 

attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice 

regarding -- regarding the possibility of prospective 

liability in light of all of these suits that you 

mentioned?

 MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, again I come 

back that the trustee is entitled where the issue is 

liability, rather than how to manage the money.  The -­

that gets into an area that would not be subject to the 

fiduciary exceptions.  So if that is the focus of the 

advice, a private beneficiary wouldn't have to give up 

that advice and we don't contend that the government 

should, either.  But where, as here, all of the 

documents are general documents that deal generally with 

how to manage Indian trust funds -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Again, as the Chief Justice 

pointed out, that seems to me an artificial distinction. 

What I ask from -- for from the attorney is advice as to 

how I can manage the trust so as to avoid liability.  I 

mean, the -- the two are connected.  You can't separate 

out advice as to how to manage, how to manage the trust

from advice as to how to avoid liability.  In the -- in 

the context of asking, of a trustee's asking advice, the 

two are the same. 

 MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, at -- at some 

logical level there is a link there that can never be 

severed, but I submit, respectfully, that the 

government, when it's getting advice about managing 

trust funds, is not really focused on its liability. 

The government's liability, after all, is much more 

10

circumscribed than private fiduciaries, in any number of 

11 

ways. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 It is seeking legal advice about what is the 

proper way to invest, can we do this, can we pool funds, 

can we do -- you know, can we make a certain type of 

investment or is it prohibited to us.  And advice of 

that nature is advice to which the beneficiary is 

entitled. 

 A private beneficiary -- the beneficiaries 

19 

of private trusts are entitled, and Indians, whose money 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

is being managed because the government has taken on 

itself by statute and said, we are going to take control 

of your monies and we're going to manage them, have no 

lesser right to get access to this highly relevant 

information when they litigate for breach of trust.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You make a distinction,

I -- I take it, between attorney-client privilege and 

work product.  Initially, you were seeking both on the 

theory that the tribe is in fact the client, but 

apparently you are not pressing that point any more 

about work product? 

 MR. GORDON:  In fact, Your Honor, there is 

some case law that says the fiduciary exception can be 

applied to -- to work product.  We did not press that 

point in the Court of Federal Claims.  We -- focused our 

10

request for documents on attorney-client, not on work 

11 

product. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So under your theory 

if there's a claim of privilege on -- on -- on the 

government's behalf, presumably the district court would 

conduct an in-camera review to determine whether it was 

retrospective for liability or prospective for 

responsibility? 

 MR. GORDON:  Yes, Your Honor, which is 

19 

exactly what happened here.  The Court of Federal Claims 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

reviewed all of the documents in camera and made a 

document-by-document determination, which is, of course, 

the standard approach when you're talking about 

attorney-client privilege.  It's done on a document by 

document basis.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did it do -- did it do on 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

that basis, retrospective versus prospective? 

2

 MR. GORDON:  It didn't come up, Your Honor, 

3 

because there weren't any retrospective wants. 

4

5

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There were no 

prospective, is that -- did you -­

 MR. GORDON:  They're all prospective, Your 

7 

Honor.  They're all prospective.  The -­

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they -- they 

9 

could be retrospective, too, right?  The government 

10

exposes itself to liability, obviously, in these areas 

11 

as well.  That's the basis for your suit, right? 

12

13

 MR. GORDON:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 The -- I want to pick up, I believe it was 

14 

on a comment that you made, Justice Sotomayor, when you 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

said that under the government's theory there would be 

no need for Rule 501.  And indeed, they say that it's 

not enough.  501 on its face says apply common law 

principles.  And the government's argument is that's not 

enough unless there's some other statute that requires 

common law principles to be applied to. 

 Now, this is a neat trick.  You just read 

501 out of the Rules of Evidence when it comes to the 

government, notwithstanding that 501 itself says it's to 

be used to determine privilege claims by the government, 

and that's reinforced in Federal Rule of Evidence 1101, 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

which specifically says that the Rules of Evidence are 

to apply in the Court of Federal Claims. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose the 

4 

government as a whole has an obligation to act in the 

5

best interests of the citizenry, right?  Why doesn't the 

6 

same theory apply to any citizen? 

7

8

11 

12 

13

 Look, government, you're supposed to -­

you're acting in a fiduciary statute -- status with 

respect to me.  You're supposed to be acting in my best 

interests.  If you're getting advice from the, you know, 

Department of Justice about what to do, I'm entitled to 

get that. 

 MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, it -- I think that 

14 

that could pick up on the same distinction that the 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

Court has already drawn in Mitchell 1 and Mitchell 2, 

between bare trust and a full-fledged trust.  The 

government may have a general duty to act in the 

interests of all citizens.  Indeed, I think we would all 

agree with that.  But that does not mean that the 

government is engaging in the conduct of a full-fledged 

21 

trust with respect to citizens.  It's not. 

22

23 

24 

25

 Its relationship to citizens day in and day 

out is akin to, in fact maybe even a level below, the 

bare trust relationship that was at issue in Mitchell 1.

 So, we're not proposing a -- a sweeping new 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

rule here.  It's the government that's proposing to 

transform this Court's jurisprudence about Indians, 

because the notion that the only enforceable obligations 

it has are those set forth in statute or regulation, 

were the Court to adopt that, it would be overruling its 

6 

decision in White Mountain Apache. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are there any 

other -- are there any other areas in which the 

government's relationship to particular groups of 

citizens is that of fiduciary to beneficiary? 

 MR. GORDON:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What are some of 

13 

those? 

14

15

20

21

 MR. GORDON:  Well, the -- the principal one 

we could find, which is cited in our brief, is with 

respect to government retirees who make voluntary 

contributions to their fund, and the government's 

argument here could be applied to them. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And your argument 

could be applied to them? 

 MR. GORDON:  Yes, Your Honor, and I'm happy 

22 

for it to be.  I believe it should be. 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if I'm a 

24 

government retiree, I have the ability to get the legal 

25

advice that whoever it is that runs that trust gets?

fortunately it's not the Bureau of Indian Affairs that 

runs that. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Does that happen a lot?  I 

mean, I -- I -- I'm not -- does that happen a lot?  I 

mean, are there a lot of instances where the lawyers who 

work for all -- the retirement funds are huge.  There 

must be cases coming up all the time.  And all the 

advice of the lawyers is just available -­

MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, no, frankly it 

hasn't come up that much with -- in terms of Federal 

retirees.  There's the Cavanaugh v. Wainstein case that 

we cite in our brief which is about the only published 

decision I've been able to find.

 The fact of the matter, I -- I was being 

humorous a moment ago, but the fact of the matter is 

that the government retirement funds have been, it 

appears, run quite well and there have been relatively 

few claims brought against them.  There's a reason that 

there are a bunch of pending cases regarding Indian -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I know that.  I'm just 

worried about the -- the attorney-client privilege is 

somewhat sacred, and suddenly making everything 

available to the whole public has got me worried.  And I 

looked at that Sears case.  I didn't see anything there 

42

that eases my concern.  And then you referred to a

I couldn't get how you spell it. 

 MR. GORDON:  I will -- it -- 486 U.S. 1, 

12 

1988, Your Honor. 

13

 The -- there is another inconsistency in the 

14 

government's position here that I would like to 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

highlight for the Court, if I may.  That is this:  The 

government relies on the common law in the first place 

to say it has a privilege.  There's no statute that 

gives the government attorney-client privilege.  So it 

relies on common law saying:  We have an attorney-client 

privilege. 

 Now, that's fine under Federal Rule 501. 

But the government says, while it can rely on common 

law, Jicarilla cannot rely on that same common law to 

establish the limits on the privilege it's claiming. 

This Court described that sort of argument as "heads I 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company

win, tails you lose," and said that it can't be right. 

And I submit that it can't be right here.  The -­

one hand it is a guardian or a trustee, and on the other 

hand it is the sovereign.  So it's the latter, the 

government's claim that it is the sovereign, that makes 

the difference, it's not the -­

 MR. GORDON:  I agree, Your Honor, that 

that's their claim.  But the government hasn't shown how 

the fact that it is the sovereign, which we certainly 

concede, makes any meaningful difference for purposes of 

the issue presented here.  The cases it cites establish 

that the government, because it is sovereign, in some 

instances has broader authority than a private trustee 

would to help out the beneficiary.  And I believe that 

that is -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it also has broader 

19 

authority, and that's just their point, I take it, for 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

many other areas.  The sovereign can't easily divest 

itself of its responsibilities.  A trustee can so 

conform and shape its business that it doesn't have 

conflicts.  A government just can't do that. 

 MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, I agree, but 

the issue of conflicting, competing interests, first of 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

all it arises in the private trust context and it arises 

frequently.  Anytime you've got a life beneficiary and a 

remainderman, you've got a potential conflict between 

the beneficiaries; and this issue of conflict has led to 

the development of the duty of impartiality for private 

trustees; and it's discussed at length in section 79 of 

the Restatement. 

 So the notion of competing interests is not 

9 

unique to the government.  The government may have some 

10

13

15

16 

17

24 

25

different competing interests than a private trustee 

might have.  That's certainly conceivable.  And if it 

does, the existence of a specific competing interest may 

affect whether the action that the government takes is 

or is not a breach of trust.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  We're not talking here 

about competing interests.  I mean, the example you give 

of -- of the life beneficiary and the remainderman, 

those are interests of the beneficiaries that conflict. 

 MR. GORDON:  That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  We're talking here about an 

interest of the trustee that conflicts with what he is 

supposed to do, with respect to the person who is the 

beneficiary of the trust.  That -- that's a totally 

different situation.

 MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, I submit that 

45

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

it's not totally -­

2

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And ordinarily if there is 

that kind of a conflict where the trustee has a personal 

conflict, he has to step down as trustee.  You can't 

continue to be trustee when you -- your own financial 

interests, for example, are against the financial 

interests of the beneficiary; right? 

 MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, you're 

9 

positing that the trustee has a personal interest that's 

10

11

12 

13 

14

15

adverse to the beneficiary. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what the government 

asserts:  I have other duties as government besides my 

duties to the -- to these Indians. 

 MR. GORDON:  That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And sometimes those duties 

16 

conflict with my duties to the Indians. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. GORDON:  Those are competing 

responsibilities.  I agree that the government may have 

that, and that may affect whether the decision that they 

ultimately make is or is not an appropriate decision. 

But it does not affect their duty to disclose as a 

matter of evidence the legal advice that they use to 

make that judgment.  The beneficiary, when the 

beneficiary's money is at stake, is entitled to see what 

advice the government acted on in dealing with its 

46

1 

money. 

2

3 

4 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is this true regardless of 

the fact that the government may have a very powerful 

interest in seeking neutral, independent advice from an 

attorney, and that were you to prevail that advice would 

6 

become watered down?

 MR. GORDON:  Yes, Your Honor.  I don't -- I 

submit that the ultimate balancing of interests here is 

the same as it is for a private fiduciary.  There is no 

-- the Court -- we urge the Court to affirm that under 

Rule 501 Indian tribes are entitled to the same evidence 

as other trust beneficiaries about how their money was 

managed.  That is our request of this Court. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The trustee I guess 

is -- is broadly conceived of as the government? 

 MR. GORDON:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't the 

lawyer working for the trustee then a trustee too, an 

employee of the trustee?

 MR. GORDON:  I think that may in a 

theoretical sense be true, Your Honor.  But practically 

speaking, there's a difference between the BIA officials 

who are acting as the trustee and the attorneys who are 

advising the trustee.  Our claim is against the trustee. 

It's not against the attorneys.  We are not seeking to 

47

impose any professional responsibilities on the

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SHAH:  Your Honor, if I can just make 

11 

three -- three points on rebuttal. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 The first is with respect to Federal Rule of 

Evidence 501.  The government is not implementing any 

trick here.  This is not a "heads you win, tails you 

lose" type situation.  Our argument is simple.  We look 

to -- we invoke a valid attorney-client privilege.  The 

other side invokes a common law exception to that 

privilege.  Our argument is not that no common law 

exception is applicable to the government.  It's simply 

that the basis for this common law exception is not 

applicable, so the exception should not be applicable. 

It's a very straightforward argument. 

 The second point I would like to make is in 

24 

response to the contention that we have a full-fledged 

25

trust here as opposed to a bare trust in Mitchell.  I'm 

48

not quite sure what "a full-fledged trust" means in the 

Indian trust context.  Certainly there's specific 

investment-related duties that the statute sets forth 

with respect to trust funds, but this Court has made 

clear in -- in Mitchell and reiterated in the Navajo 

Nation decision that it's not enough for the statute to 

simply set forth the statutory duties, but it must 

define, and this is a quote, "define the contours of 

those duties."

 The statutes at issue, section 161a, 162a, 

do nothing of the sort.  They don't even set out a 

general disclosure obligation, let alone the contours of 

any such disclosure obligation.  But even if we were to 

disregard this Court's precedents in Mitchell and in 

Navajo Nation, and we were to resort to the common law 

to flesh out the nature of the responsibilities, again 

there's nothing from the discrete investment obligations 

that are set forth in those statutes that would lead to 

a general disclosure obligation, let alone an intrusive 

obligation to disclose the government's attorney-client 

21 

communications. 

22

23 

24 

25

 And there's good reasons to think that 

Congress did not apply such an obligation when it has 

set forth a fairly reticulated statutory and regulatory 

regime governing disclosures, and with respect to other 

49

11 

12 

13

statutes.  For example, the 1982 Indian Claims 

Limitation Act specifically addressed privileged versus 

nonprivileged information. 

 The last point I would make goes to the 

general duty to disclose.  Whether that's contingent 

simply on payment, ownership or other factors.  While it 

may not be the case that the payment is the sole factor, 

it's certainly an important factor, and I think as my 

friend responded in response to Justice Kennedy, if in 

fact the private trustee is paying for the legal advice 

on their own, that's going to be a significant 

consideration as to whether the beneficiary can get it. 

 And as Justice Scalia pointed out, the lines 

14 

are not always going to be clear between trust 

15

administration advice and liability advice.  In fact, 

16 

they're often going to run into one another. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 Beyond payment, I think the even more 

important factor here is the ownership of the records. 

While payment is indicative of ownership, when we're 

talking about the government context, payment is not the 

only reason why we say that the government owns the 

records that result from legal advice or any other trust 

administration facet.  That's set forth by statute and 

regulation, the Federal Records Act, and the Interior 

Department regulations that are set forth in the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If I -- if I pay -­

if I pay a lawyer to prepare a document for me, is 

that -- I do own that document or does the lawyer?

 MR. SHAH:  I think as a general -- I think 

as a general matter, one would think that the client 

would -- it would belong to the client, at least in the 

sense that the client would have full access to that 

document.

 And I think that's a fundamental distinction 

here, that we're not -- because the -- these are 

governmental records, they're subject to the statutory 

and regulatory regime that governs disclosure of 

government documents, either specific disclosure 

obligations set forth by Congress, Interior Department 

regulation or the more general Freedom of Information 

Act. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But aren't you 

19 

confusing, just following up on the Chief Justice's,

ownership with access?  FOIA itself doesn't make these 

records less -- the government doesn't own them less 

merely because FOIA requires them to share it with other 

people.  So the ownership interest is not the defining 

legal obligation.

 MR. SHAH:  You're absolutely correct.  The

fact that they're accessible by FOIA does not -- does 

not change the government's ownership of those records, 

but the fact that Congress is able to set forth a scheme 

like FOIA is turned on the fact that these are 

government records that are owned by the government. 

 Because they're government records, it's 

Congress and it's the Interior Department that decides 

when to disclose them and under what circumstances to 

disclose them.  The tribe's rule here would eviscerate 

that very reticulated statutory and regulatory regime. 

 Thank you, Your Honor. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Shah,

and Mr. Gordon. 

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
