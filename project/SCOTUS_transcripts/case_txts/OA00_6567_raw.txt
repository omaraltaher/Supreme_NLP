(10:02 a.m.)


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 00-6567, Larry Dean Dusenbery v. the United


States. 


the Court:


Mr. Zieve -- Ms. Zieve.  Pardon me.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. ZIEVE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


The issue in this case is whether the procedures


used to serve notice of forfeiture of petitioner's


property satisfied due process. 


The Federal Government forfeited Mr. Dusenbery's


$22,000 in 1988 after mailing a notice to him at the


Federal prison where he was incarcerated.  It is not


disputed that he did not get the notice. 


The -- the Government argues that its 1988


procedures satisfied due process whether or not the notice


was received.  However, in light of the circumstances


presented here, including the Government's control over


the prisoner's location and knowledge of the prisoner's


location at all times and its control over prison


procedures, due process requires the Government to use


procedures that offer assurances of delivery to the inmate

addressee and not just to prison personnel.  Such


procedures --


QUESTION:  Well, you take the position that it's


not sufficient that there be staff at the prison who


deliver mail to the inmates?


MS. ZIEVE:  That, in and of itself, is not


sufficient.  The -- the procedures need --


QUESTION:  A procedure whereby a prison employee


delivers certified mail to prisoners is inadequate in


your --


MS. ZIEVE:  That -- that, in and of itself, is


inadequate as -- although --


QUESTION:  Is in adequate? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Is inadequate, although those


procedures --


QUESTION:  How can that be under any of our case


law, that that would be in adequate per se?


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, the -- under this Court's case


law, what's required when the notice is served is


determined by a consideration of a balance of factors in


light of the circumstances.  And that --


QUESTION:  Well, we've never required actual


notice in any case, have we? 


MS. ZIEVE:  No, although there is some


suggestion of that in -- in a couple cases, for instance,

Phillips Petroleum.  But in -- in the cases discussed in


the briefs, there is not a requirement of actual notice,


but at the same time, the Court assumes that the mailed


notice or the form of notice will be received, and the


Court hasn't considered a case where it was uncontested


that individual -- an individual was entitled to notice


and yet the notice wasn't received. 


QUESTION:  Well, but that's going to happen


sometimes with any sort of notice except the requirement


of actual receipt by the individual, and we've never felt


that destroyed the validity of the notice.


MS. ZIEVE:  That's true, Your Honor, but in the


circumstances presented here, consideration of the balance


of factors leads to a requirement the procedures that


would satisfy those factors would also lead to actual


notice.  For instance, today the Government uses


procedures under which, after the mail is received by the


prison, there's not just some vague distribution process


at the prison, but the mail is signed for.  In the mail


room, there's a log book kept, and when it leaves the mail


room a log book is kept that is ultimately signed for by


the inmate.  And this chain of receipts helps to ensure


that there's extra care and attention paid with the


delivery of the notice.


QUESTION:  Would you be satisfied with that if

that had been the case here? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Yes.  If those procedures had been


followed.


QUESTION:  Even -- even though there was -- I


was going to say even though there was no receipt


signature, but I guess under the procedures now, the --


the prisoner would have signed a log.  Is that right?


MS. ZIEVE:  Yes, he would have signed a log. 


And if he had a challenge and he has a signature, he's


going to lose, and if there is no signature -- excuse me.


QUESTION:  The procedure that was in place for


certain kinds of mail that was labeled special mail -- if


that had been -- if that had applied to notices in this


category -- special mail, as I understand it, could be


opened only in the presence of the prisoner?


MS. ZIEVE:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And if that had applied, that old


rule had applied to this category of mail, you would not


object to that, would you? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, the special mail opened only


in front of the prisoner happens after it's delivered to


the prisoner.  I think it's helpful that the FBI and the


DEA, in recent years -- the Government writes in its


brief, in recent years, have considered forfeiture notices


and labeled those as special mail, but the procedure still

needs to be adequate to get to that point where you're


standing in front of the prisoner opening the mail. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Zieve, I'm -- I'm not sure what


-- what is the general principle of which you assert the


rule that you urge upon us in this case is -- is just an


exemplar.  Is the general principle that when the


Government is in charge of the delivery system, there must


be actual notice evidenced by a signature of whoever it's


delivered to? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Your Honor, that's one important


factor, but the case here is even easier because there are


-- there are numerous --


QUESTION:  You're not urging that when the --


that the distinctive factor is that the Government is in


charge of the delivery system because that would have been


the case in the old post office when -- when the post


office was actually part of the Federal Government.  So,


that's not the principle.  Right? 


MS. ZIEVE:  That's not the only factor.  Here we


have not --


QUESTION:  What -- what is the principle?  When


the Government is in charge of the residence?  Right?  So,


we would need a similar rule for all members of the armed


forces. 


MS. ZIEVE:  There are several key factors here,

and I don't think you can separate out one circumstance


from the rest.  The inmate --


QUESTION:  Well, you said the first one isn't


it.  Right?  I don't understand.  If neither one alone is


enough, I don't know why all in combination turn out to be


enough. 


MS. ZIEVE:  Because that's the circumstances. 


There's a body of circumstances presented here.  The


inmate's location is not just easily ascertainable by the


Government, but determined by the Government.  The


procedures used for --


QUESTION:  Well, that would apply -- that would


apply to all members of the armed forces. 


MS. ZIEVE:  The procedures used for delivery are


also determined by the Government, and --


QUESTION:  That would also apply to the armed


forces. 


MS. ZIEVE:  And the Government is in an adverse


position, which I think requires additional cross checks


in the system to ensure that care is taken because the


Government doesn't have incentive to identify and rectify


inefficiencies on its own. 


QUESTION:  You really think that that's


realistic here?  You would not urge us to apply this rule


in a civil action where your client was being served a

paper by -- by someone who is not the Government. 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, if the -- if the serving party


were not the Government, then the person doing the service


would not be the person who was also in control of the


delivery procedures. 


QUESTION:  I understand that. 


MS. ZIEVE:  So --


QUESTION:  So, you have not urged the rule in


that case, only when the Government is -- is the opposing


party. 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, I'm not trying to be evasive,


but it's hard to answer without knowing all the


circumstances there.  For instance, what would be the --


QUESTION:  All the other circumstances are just


like this one except that the complaint was not on behalf


of the Government.  It was behalf on a private individual.


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, then the private individual


wouldn't have control over the procedures.  It might be


that mailing wasn't -- wasn't adequate in that


circumstance.  It might have to do with the value of the


property.


QUESTION:  You can answer this yes or no.  Do


you assert that your rule would apply in that situation or


not?  All of the circumstances are the same.  The only


difference is the complaint was not filed by the

Government, but by a private party.


QUESTION:  Say it was for an ordinary debt, that


the prisoner owed money and the creditor brought suit.


MS. ZIEVE:  It might not apply in that


circumstance, but whether or not it does, this is an


easier case. 


QUESTION:  Let -- let me ask you.  I -- I take


it you begin from the premise that mailed notice is


adequate for a civil suit, or do you?  I'm going to ask


the Government the same thing.  I -- are we supposed to


write an opinion that -- that says that mailed notice is


adequate in any civil suit? 


MS. ZIEVE:  No.  The -- in fact, under rule 4(d)


mailed notice is not adequate under civil suit -- for any


civil suit.  But I don't think --


QUESTION:  From a constitutional -- I know what


4(e) says, but from a constitutional standpoint, is mailed


notice adequate in any civil suit? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, I think it's probably not


adequate in any civil suit.


QUESTION:  All right.  What is -- what is it


about this that makes mailed notice adequate whereas


apparently there's another class of cases in which


personal service is required? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, this case --

QUESTION:  You -- you begin I -- I think with


the assumption that mailed notice would be adequate, and


the question is, are these mailing procedures adequate in


this case? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, no, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  But I'm -- I don't want to have you


take a position you don't take.  But it -- it does seem to


me that that is the baseline assumption from where you


begin the argument.  Am I correct about that? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Not exactly, Your Honor.  This case


is not really a mailed notice case because the procedures


that are inadequate are the procedures that happened after


the mailing.  The mailing is the first step in the


delivery chain, and the question here is the adequacy of


the procedures after that. 


QUESTION:  But I'm asking why is mail adequate


at all?  You seem to assume that, and that's fine.  We can


decide the case on that basis.  But you make the


assumption that if the mail were received, the mailed


notice would be adequate. 


MS. ZIEVE:  If the mail is received by the


inmate? 


QUESTION:  Yes.  And I want to know why that is. 


I'm going to ask the Government.  If we have to write this


case, it would seem to me that at least an argument could

be made that personal service is required --


MS. ZIEVE:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- in any civil case.  And then we


ask if this is a forfeiture or there's some old hangover


from the in rem idea that is still somehow affecting us


even though we don't talk about in rem anymore and so


forth. 


But I want to know what your -- your beginning


principle is for the due process, elementary, minimum


standards of service.


MS. ZIEVE:  The mailed notice is any form of


delivery -- any form of notice is adequate as to that


individual if it's received.  The mailed notice is


adequate when it's received, and in this case, the


Government's procedures used certified mail so that you


know that the mail was received.  If the Government had


mailed the certified mail to the proper prison and it had


not been received, the certified mail slip never came


back, then I don't think the mailed service would have


been adequate. 


QUESTION:  Have any of our cases ever required


certified mail? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, the first case where the Court


considers whether mailed notices is constitutional in Hess


v. Pawloski, the mail at issue was certified mail.

21

22

23

24

25

Subsequent to that, the Court hasn't made a distinction


between the form of mail. 


The Court also hasn't considered the case where


mail was sent but not received.  And the Court's cases in


Mennonite Board and Tulsa Professional Collection


Services, in the cases discussed in the briefs, the


question was whether an individual was entitled to notice


in addition to publication or posting, not whether -- the


Court had no occasion to consider what would happen if the


notice was mailed but never got there.


QUESTION:  It seems to me one of the


difficulties I find with your position, Ms. Zieve, is that


this inquiry can come up, you know, months and maybe years


after the actual notice took place or didn't take place. 


And it's one thing to say we have a -- you followed a


system and that system affords due process, but to have


every case turn on perhaps an argument between the person


who's seeking to set aside the service -- I never received


it -- and someone else saying, yes, you did receive it, I


think is rather unsatisfactory. 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, that's why the procedures


should require proof of verification which the


Government's procedures do today.  If Mr. Dusenbery was


served with a forfeiture notice today, he would be


required to sign for it and there would be no question

later about whether or not he received it. 


QUESTION:  Was he not --


QUESTION:  Your --


QUESTION:  The question I'd have is we all seem


to agree now that the question -- the Government has to


provide reasonable procedures.  Reasonable means


reasonably calculated to give actual notice.


MS. ZIEVE:  Under the circumstances. 


QUESTION:  Well, don't say -- there's no such


thing.  There's no such thing.  Under the circumstances


doesn't add anything I don't think.  You say is it


reasonably calculated to give actual notice.  I haven't


figured out your qualification, how that would work. 


But why wasn't this precisely?  Precisely what's


wrong with these procedures in your opinion? 


MS. ZIEVE:  The --


QUESTION:  Why are they not calculated to give


actual notice reasonably?


MS. ZIEVE:  The 1988 procedures did not provide


assurances of delivery because what happened after the


mail reached the mail room is -- was vague and


undocumented.  And as the Government acknowledged --


QUESTION:  I always thought the procedure -- I


thought the -- what -- what -- tell me precisely.  I think


the procedure is, A, mailed to a prison.  B, it comes to a

prison, and a person who works for the prison signs for


it.  Then the procedure required what?  C.  What was it


required?  And then what should it have required? 


MS. ZIEVE:  The procedure was that the mail room


employee picked up the mail and signed the certified mail


receipt at the post office, brought it back to the prison,


where he entered it in a log book.  A prison employee


testified that in 1988 the procedure then would have been


that a -- a housing unit staff would have signed when he


took the mail -- the certified mail out of the mail room.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MS. ZIEVE:  He also testified that he didn't


know what the procedure was after that.


QUESTION:  All right.  I guess after that -- a


reasonable person would think the procedure after that is


you give it to the person it's addressed to.  Now, is -- I


mean that would be normal in life.  Is there any testimony


that that wasn't the procedure?  No. 


MS. ZIEVE:  No.  There was no testimony about


that.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, we've described the


procedure, and now you tell me what, in your opinion, is


wrong with that procedure. 


MS. ZIEVE:  The procedure doesn't require


verification of delivery and that --

25

QUESTION:  Okay.  So, in your opinion, it is


unreasonable not to have an additional step that the


prisoner signs for it.


MS. ZIEVE:  Yes, and the reason is this. 


Because the documentation -- the improved documentation


improves delivery.  The -- the Department of Justice Board


of Prisons memorandum that the Solicitor General lodged


with the Court both in 1999 and 2001 -- it ties improved


documentation to improved delivery.


QUESTION:  Then -- then whenever there's a


requirement or -- a requirement -- procedure for service


by mail, it should be certified mail so the person signs


for it in every case. 


MS. ZIEVE:  In --


QUESTION:  Ms. Zieve, you couldn't say every


case because in Mullane regular mail was adequate in that


under the circumstances, which was heavily emphasized by


Justice Jackson, those words, under the circumstances. 


MS. ZIEVE:  In Mullane and in some cases where


there's a class of interested parties where everyone has


this same interest, it might not be necessary for all


interested parties to receive the notice.  As the Court


recognized in Mullane, because there were many


beneficiaries of a 113 different trusts and they all had a


identical interests --

QUESTION:  All right.  Then I'll -- then I'll


amend my question.  In a case where there is only a single


defendant and service is permitted by mail, it must be by


certified mail.


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, that would likely be


reasonable since the burden of doing so is so small and


the increased -- the decreased risk of it not reaching the


addressee would be --


QUESTION:  You don't mean that it might


reasonable.  You mean it isn't reasonable not to do it.


That's your argument. 


MS. ZIEVE:  Right. 


QUESTION:  It isn't reasonable not to do it. 


And I guess a person who thought it was reasonable not to


do it would say, well, we can't think of everything, and


you know, it's in the prison, and prisons normally do


work.  I mean, they're not great, but they have a -- a


fairly disciplined order.  And so, it's good enough.  And


your response to that is what? 


MS. ZIEVE:  It wasn't good enough in -- in these


circumstances.  The Government has shown us --


QUESTION:  Well, they might -- they might say


more than that.  They might say we have no reason to


believe that the prison delivery system is any worse than


the post office's delivery system.

And I -- I guess it's your -- I guess it's your


contention that even if the reason your client never


received the notice was -- had nothing to do with the


fault of the -- of the prison.  It was the Postal Service


that lost the -- the notice on the way.  That would still


-- that would still invalidate the service.  Right? 


MS. ZIEVE:  It would still mean the forfeiture


was done without adequate notice. 


QUESTION:  So that -- so -- which would not be


the case, I suppose, unless you're going to adopt the


certified mail rule, which would not be the case for an


ordinary citizen who is not incarcerated.  If notice is


sent to an ordinary citizen and the post office looses it,


unless you adopt the certified mail rule, that would be


adequate notice.  But in the case of an incarcerated


person, if the post office looses it, it is not adequate


notice.  Right? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, I don't know that it would be


adequate notice to serve someone by mail out of prison if


it's not received. 


QUESTION:  Well, what is -- what is the


statutory requirement in your view for forfeiture as -- as


far as notice is concerned? 


MS. ZIEVE:  The statutory requirement? 


QUESTION:  Yes.

QUESTION:  By mail?  What is the general


statutory requirement on these forfeiture notices? 


MS. ZIEVE:  I believe the statute says by mail,


although the Government always does it by certified mail. 


And it does that --


QUESTION:  Is it in the materials we have in the


briefs?  Is there some copy of that provision somewhere


that you're aware of in the briefs?  Don't take a lot of


time if you don't know.  I just thought perhaps you knew. 


Is in your brief at all? 


MS. ZIEVE:  It's on page 3 of the Government's


brief. 


QUESTION:  Page 3. 


MS. ZIEVE:  It just says, shall be sent to each


party who appears to have an interest. 


QUESTION:  See, that's why I don't know how to


do it because, I mean, suppose there's a ship, for


example.  Take the other extreme case.  People forfeit


ships.  People have tort actions against ships, and you


could have ships that are owned by thousands of people,


for example.  And where you bring the action against the


thing, it's fairly normal that you don't actually have to


get the signature of every person who has some interest in

that ship, for example.  Now, I think, am I not right, or


do you have to get the signature? 


If -- if, for example, you're bringing an action


against a thing and the thing is owned by millions,


thousands, or hundreds, does the -- do you have to


normally, under the rules -- forget the Constitution for


the moment -- you have to get the signature on a -- on


that notice, a return receipt requested of each person who


has an interest in that thing? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Under the statute? 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MS. ZIEVE:  Now, you've asked a sort of


complicated question because the statute for an in rem


judicial forfeiture requires publication, but the


Government, based on this Court's case law, gives notice


by certified mail. 


QUESTION:  But I take it your argument would be


that even if all the signatures are not required in the in


rem case, there is -- there is a fairness in the procedure


that would not require actual notice and signatures to


every ship owner because the owner of the ship at least


has some right to control the ship.  So, you say, look, if


-- if they don't pay attention to what's happening to


their ship, we -- we can tag them with that. 


But the difference between that case and this,

as I understand it, is there is a period between delivery


of the letter and what should be the point of receipt by


the prisoner when the prisoner is not in control of the


process.  The post office has finished its part.  So, if


we assume regularity on the post office is normally


enough, that isn't enough here because there's a hiatus


between where the post office stops and the point at which


we hope the prisoner gets the delivery. 


And I take it you would be satisfied in this


case, even without a rule requiring actual signature, if


the Government were required to show, with a greater


detail than you say it has here, that there was a regular


procedure, at the time involved here, that makes it just


as probable that the letter would have gotten from the


front door of the prison to the prisoner, as it is


probable that the letter mailed in the box gets to the


front door of the prison.  You'd be satisfied with that


kind of a rule, wouldn't you? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Yes.  I'm not -- it's not -- it's


not important to petitioner how the procedures --


QUESTION:  How he wins the case as long as he


wins.  I realize that. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. ZIEVE:  No.

satisfied if -- if we had the -- I take it, the same kind


of demand for proof of regularity for the period between


the front door of the prison and the prisoner's cell that


we do from the mailbox to the front door of the prison. 


That would be a reasonable system.  And -- and you'd be


satisfied with it, I would take it, as a general rule.


MS. ZIEVE:  Probably. 


QUESTION:  It would be nice to have a signature


requirement, but basically we -- we would have the same


kind of rule then that we have with -- with respect to


mail delivery in general. 


MS. ZIEVE:  Yes, but the reason that I emphasize


the signature is because, as the Bureau of Prisons has


since recognized, the -- the signature does help to


improve delivery.  It helps to make sure that this letter


is treated with some extra attention and care.  It ensures


that it's not going to get misdelivered to Larry Smith two


cells over. 


QUESTION:  What do we do with prisoners who


won't sign? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, actually the Board of Prisons


procedures deal with that, and I think effectively, which


is on the log book, if the prisoner refuses to sign, then


the person delivering the mail signs for it stating that


the prisoner won't sign, which I think is comparable to a

process server giving a contemporaneous statement that


service has been completed. 


QUESTION:  You know, it seems to me we need to


focus on some kind of a test, and I thought I understood


you to argue for a test that says in these prison cases,


there has to be actual receipt by the prisoner.  And I --


I know the Third Circuit and probably the Fourth have a


different sort of test, which is that the Government just


has to show that internal prison delivery procedures are


adequate.  Is that an acceptable general statement of the


test?


MS. ZIEVE:  They have to be adequate.  My view


is that under this Court's -- the analysis that this Court


has used in its cases, in its due process cases, that


applying that general statement leads to the same result


that I'm arguing for here, although if the Court --


QUESTION:  You say it isn't adequate unless


there's actual receipt. 


MS. ZIEVE:  Yes, because those procedures are --


it's entirely practicable to do that.  There's -- it is


not difficult to --


QUESTION:  Well, in the event we don't agree


with you, what's your fall-back position? 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, even under the Third Circuit's


formulation, the Court, looking at the 1988 procedures in

the record, such as they are -- those procedures were


inadequate.  It's uncontested that he didn't get the


notice, and the procedures as described, are inadequate,


although for the same reasons as I think lead to actual


notice, even if you don't want to go that far. 


QUESTION:  Why is it that a procedure is


inadequate if the procedure is that if we get certified


mail, we -- we deliver it to the prisoner?  What's


inadequate about that as a procedural standard?


MS. ZIEVE:  Again, it doesn't provide the


assurances of delivery that both are feasible because, if


you're going to deliver it, it doesn't take that much to


just get the signature, and because I think it's important


to have cross checks to make sure that the Government --


QUESTION:  Do we look back at Mullane or at


Mathews v. Eldridge for our guidance here in establishing


a standard?


MS. ZIEVE:  I think either one, Your Honor. 


Mullane states -- sort of states the test in one sentence,


but I think summarizes the three-part framework that


Mathews articulates later.  Either way you can reach the


same result.  The value of the property at stake, the risk


of erroneous deprivation, the valuable -- the value of


additional procedures, and the burden on the Government,


the factors to consider, all lead to same -- to the result

here that the prison should have done more and could have


and should have ensured actual notice to inmates in its


charge. 


QUESTION:  -- apply this rule to any -- anything


other than prisons or are you talking about the


circumstances of someone incarcerated by the Government? 


Is there any other setting in which you would require not


merely that certified mail be sent and signed for by


someone, but in-hand delivery? 


MS. ZIEVE:  There may be other cases, though


there also may not be.  This is the easy case.  If there's


any circumstances where actual notice is required, it's


got to be these where the Government is both the sender


and sort of the recipient for later delivery to the person


who it knows where it is --


QUESTION:  Why is it the easy case?  It is the


case, I take it from your argument, because you haven't


suggested that there might be another setting other than


where the Government has someone in confinement. 


MS. ZIEVE:  No, I haven't. 


QUESTION:  Is it any part of your argument that


we should be suspicious of prison officials because they


may use a refusal to follow their procedures for


vindictive reasons or anything like that? 


MS. ZIEVE:  That may occur, Your Honor, but our

argument does not rely on any malfeasance on the


Government's part. 


QUESTION:  That's not your argument. 


QUESTION:  Well, if that's not part of your


argument, I don't see why your situation is any different


from the military situation where, unless -- unless the


serviceman or woman is AWOL, the Government knows right


where that person is and the Government is responsible for


-- for where that person is.  I don't know why you


wouldn't have the same rule. 


MS. ZIEVE:  Well, to be honest, I hadn't


considered the military situation, and maybe there's more


parallels.  However, there's still the -- the inmate is


still special in that he has no control over his property. 


There are no proxies looking out for him, for his


interests.  And the mail, even when it's sent to the


military, my assumption is that if you get certified mail,


the soldier is going to sign for it.  The officer will


sign for it and not someone for later delivery to him


without any proof or documentation about what happened in


the interim. 


If the Court has no further questions, I'd like


to reserve the balance of my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Zieve. 


Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. MINEAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This Court has repeatedly held that the notice


requirements of the Due Process Clause are satisfied by a


method of notice that's reasonably calculated to provide


interested parties with notice of the proceedings.


The Government's method of providing notice in


this case, this forfeiture case, satisfies that test.  The


method was by the use of certified mail.  And petitioner


does not dispute that mails generally are satisfactory for


purposes of notice.  Rather they draw the distinction that


only in the case of prisoners is that method unwarranted


or unconstitutional. 


Petitioner is asserting a constitutional


violation.  It therefore has the burden of proof of


establishing the procedures the Government used are


unconstitutional. 


And I'd like to clarify a point with regard to


whether notice was received here or not.  The Government


has not submitted that notice was not received.  We simply


are unable to prove that it was not received. 


QUESTION:  So, why not just put the burden on


the person who was supposed to get it to prove he didn't


27

get it? 


MR. MINEAR:  Well, that is in fact what the 


court did.  It didn't -- there wasn't a test it required,


but the inquiry was made, and the court concluded that


whatever the protestations of the defendant might be, or


the prisoner in this case, nevertheless the method that


was used here was reasonably calculated to reach him.  And


that is all that Mullane requires. 


QUESTION:  No, no.  Look, what I take it that


she's arguing for is there's a step missing here and it


should apply not just to prisoners, apply to anybody who's


going to have their property forfeited, and that is, you


give them notice by certified mail so they have to sign


it.  That's the point.  So, it would apply to everybody,


armed forces, everybody.  And what's wrong with that?  It


isn't that hard to do.  It protects pretty thoroughly


against losing your property without even knowing about


it.  So, do it. 


MR. MINEAR:  The problem --


QUESTION:  That's -- that's basically, as I


understand it, the argument. 


MR. MINEAR:  The problem with that position is


it's contrary to 50 years of this Court's precedence,


which has consistently recognized that mailing alone --


not certified mail -- but ordinary mail, is sufficient to

provide parties with notice.


QUESTION:  Where did the Court hold that? 


QUESTION:  Have we ever said that with reference


to a simple contract or tort action? 


MR. MINEAR:  No.  All of the cases in which this


issue has arisen in this Court's jurisprudence have


involved special procedures.  Nevertheless --


QUESTION:  Well, that's why I'm asking because


in Mullane and subsequent cases, we have tended to say


that the in rem/in personam distinction is -- is not too


clear a line. 


Are you arguing for the proposition that, again,


in a standard contract or tort case, notice by mail would


be sufficient? 


MR. MINEAR:  We are certainly willing to defend


the proposition that the Federal Rules of Procedure, which


provide --


QUESTION:  No.  I'm talking about -- I'm talking


about due process requirements now. 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  And -- and with regard to the


Federal Rules, they do recognize that service can be


effected through mail -- through the notice of waiver


provisions that are set forth there, and we would defend


the constitutionality of those provisions which allow the


party to, in fact, accept service by notice.

QUESTION:  If this Court writes a due process


opinion, can we say that mail, routine mail, is always


sufficient, or are there some cases in which you must have


personal service? 


MR. MINEAR:  Well, the Court can certainly do


that.  We might caution that it's not necessary to do that


in this case. 


QUESTION:  Well, I want to know what the


principle is that you're -- that controls our case, the


beginning principle here. 


MR. MINEAR:  The Court has drawn these


principles largely from common experience and knowledge


about the instrumentalities that are used for purposes of


service.  And if we looked at the Mullane case, the Court


cited that the mails had, through common experience, been


determined to be a reasonable means for providing service


in that type of proceeding. 


Now, whether the Court would want to take the


step of saying that the mails are always adequate in any


proceeding is a step that's not necessary for the Court to


take.  And so, I'm hesitant to suggest to the Court that


it ought to do so.  It certainly does not need to do so in


this case because this case involves procedures that are


very similar to Tulsa, to Mennonite, to Schroeder, to --

on the fact that this is a forfeiture case and we're --


there's this voice of the past of in rem versus in


personam hanging over this -- this argument of yours. 


MR. MINEAR:  Well, actually no, Your Honor. 


It's not the in rem nature of the proceedings, but rather


it's a -- it's an intersection of two factors. 


One, this type of proceeding is similar to the


proceedings this Court has dealt with previously that are


not necessarily in rem.  For instance, probate claims are


not necessarily -- would not necessarily be treated as in


rem I think under -- under traditional law.  But it's --


it's the intersection of the fact that these proceedings


are similar to proceedings elsewhere that the Court has


already ruled on and the fact that this Court can draw on


its long experience the mails are, in fact, as a practical


matter, a reasonable means for providing service or


providing notice.


QUESTION:  I'm just very puzzled by your


reliance on Mullane when Justice Jackson took such care to


say this procedure, common trust fund, so many


beneficiaries, some unknown, some addresses lost -- if we


use regular mail, the chances are it will get to many, if


not most, people in the group, and that's good enough for


that kind of case.  Here we're talking about some $12,000


that once belonged to an individual, not 113 trusts

combined together in a common fund with hundreds, even


thousands of beneficiaries. 


QUESTION:  Your Honor, Mullane has been extended


beyond the facts of its individual case.  And this case


is, in fact, quite similar to the Court's most recent


decisions, such as Tulsa Professional Services.  In that


case, I believe there was some $12,000 in medical fees


that were in dispute.  The -- the creditor in that case


couldn't count on other claimants, as in Mullane, to


perhaps make the arguments that that creditor might --


QUESTION:  Well, but that was with the probate


proceeding.  And as Justice Ginsburg's questions point out


and what I've been trying to -- to explore with you, this


is a case where a person has an ownership interest.  It's


not that much different from an ordinary contract or tort


action. 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, Your Honor.  And we think that


this case is similar to Tulsa and ought to be treated as


such.  I'm simply reluctant to urge this Court to go


beyond the facts of this case and to deal with the


question of a civil complaint and whether ordinary --


QUESTION:  I suppose -- I suppose in probate a


claimant, a debtor claimant, is in much the same standing


as a person who sues in contract on that claim before the


person dies.

MR. MINEAR:  Well, yes.  But probate is very


similar to the situation here, that the notice that is


being provided is simply to ascertain whether there are


any claims outstanding to the property at issue.  And if a


person does make a claim, then that initiates a judicial


procedure in which further process would be necessary.


But this case is --


QUESTION:  Here there's no doubt about the


person who has the interest.  It was not like sending out


a notice:  any interested people come forward.  The


Government knows who the person in the world is who has a


claim to this $12,000.


MR. MINEAR:  But, Your Honor, the same could be


said, for instance, in Mennonite with regard to the


mortgagee, that the person who is -- that -- that was a


situation in which there was an interest in -- in


foreclosing on a property and selling it at a tax sale. 


Now, the Government in that situation certainly could have


identified the mortgagor and simply provided notice by


publication.  This Court said that notice by mail was


sufficient.  It was the minimum that was necessary and it


applied in that --


QUESTION:  -- better than publication generally.


MR. MINEAR:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- publication is the least

25

effective, and the Mullane case that you rely on so


heavily makes that point. 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, and that's the reason why the


Government in these situations provides notice by


publication, also by notice to the person's last address,


and also notice to his current address if it can be


ascertained.  In this case, the Government, through


reasonable diligence, was able to locate the individual


and send notice to his place of incarceration. 


The only thing that distinguishes this case, in


fact, is that the mails are being directed to a prison,


and the only real question here is whether the prison


system is reliable.  And what we established at trial was,


in fact, it was.  There were procedures in place to ensure


that the mails were delivered to prisoners. 


QUESTION:  Fine.  Then you would win even under


their rule because then the prisoner would be unable to


prove that he didn't get the notice. 


So, assume that that's the rule.  The prisoner


has to prove he didn't get the notice.  Anyone who doesn't


-- who actually gets notice loses.  Assume that.  What I'd


like to know is, assuming that, what is the argument


against saying where it's a forfeiture case and where the


forfeiting -- the person who's going to get the property


knows the address of the individual who would forfeit the

property, that person has to use certified mail?  What she


said was the Government does that anyway in forfeiture


cases. 


MR. MINEAR:  The argument against that, Your


Honor, is that the Due Process Clause simply specifies the


constitutional minimum.  The Government can make a


decision to provide more process than is necessary.


QUESTION:  Fine.  And my question is, what is --


if you're in the Government, aside from -- well, it's a


little easier.  Is there any policy reason for not doing


it? 


MR. MINEAR:  The reason -- there -- there are


several reasons for not recognizing this as a -- a general


constitutional standard.  One is the fact that it would


have to be applied to other analogous situations at least


by a parity of reason-­

QUESTION:  All right.  And the reason that


that's wrong is because?  I mean, the harm that it will do


it other analogous situations.  Give me an example of some


serious problem that would be caused by such a rule. 


MR. MINEAR:  The rule would, first of all,


require, for instance, as the Chief Justice has pointed


out, similar service on the armed services.  It also would


apply to other situations that might not be documented in


the record.  For instance, it's my understanding that the

Postal Service delivers mail to dormitories and


residential halls in bulk for distribution to the people


that live in those halls.  So --


QUESTION:  So, I want an example, since you're


writing the address anyway -- I want an example of the


problem that would be caused by saying you not only have


to write the address, you also have to send it certified,


whether it's to dormitories, armed forces, prisoners, or


anyone else in the world.  What's the actual practical


problem that would cause the Government? 


MR. MINEAR:  Well, I cannot say that the


Government cannot overcome that difficulty, because it


does in fact use certified mail. 


But the problem is should the Court erect that


as a constitutional standard, and the difficulties with


erecting that as a constitutional standard, as I pointed


out before, is it will be very difficult to cabin that to


a wide variety of other situations --


QUESTION:  With certified mail, you have to get


a signature from the recipient, whereas with ordinary


mail, you can put it in the slot in your mailbox.  In


other words, it's often difficult to obtain the certified


mail signature in a way that it wouldn't be to get the


ordinary mail slot.


MR. MINEAR:  That's correct.  And, for

example --


QUESTION:  But shouldn't it be difficult if


you're going to take $20,000 away from them? 


MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, but again, this case is


on -- on par with other cases that involved similar


amounts of money. 


And with regard to the signature -- obtaining


the signature, my suggestion is it might be that the


litigation will shift from the assertions that we think in


many cases are -- are untrue, that the person did not


receive the notice, that, well, a guard signed for me and


never actually -- I did not refuse to receive it and a


guard simply signed and said that I refused. 


What we're trying to do from a policy


perspective, from the Bureau of Prisons' perspective, is


to eliminate the sort of wasteful litigation that takes


place over assertions.


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, the Third Circuit has


apparently adopted a test that requires the Government to


show a little more than that it dropped a notice in the


mail, and that, in fact, the Government must show that


procedures at the receiving facility, the prison, were


reasonably calculated to deliver notice to the intended


recipient. 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.

Government would find satisfactory? 


MR. MINEAR:  We disagree with that, Your Honor,


for the reasons set forth in Judge Alito's dissenting


opinion on -- on that ground; namely, that it imposes


burdens that are not necessary.  The burden is on the


person who's raising the constitutional challenge to show


the deficiency in the procedures, and no deficiency in the


procedures has been shown. 


QUESTION:  But your -- your argument, it seems


to me, is premised on the fact that forfeiture is like an


in rem proceeding and it's just different.  Assume with me


-- I'm not sure that this is -- assume that there's a


constitutional due process requirement for personal


service unless there's some showing of unavailability in


the routine case for contract and tort.  Why should this


be any different? 


MR. MINEAR:  The reason -- the reason why --


QUESTION:  That may be an heroic assumption. 


I'm not sure that's true.  I think -- let me go back. 


Do you know of any State which in an ordinary


civil action allows service by mail as a routine matter?


MR. MINEAR:  I don't know of --


QUESTION:  Absent unavailability or the fact


that the person is avoiding the process server or

something like that? 


MR. MINEAR:  I don't know of any State that


allows ordinary mail.  I believe that a number of States


have adopted certified mail with return receipt requested. 


I believe that California follows that pattern.  And in


fact, the Federal rules that provide this optional method


were based on that -- on that approach.


QUESTION:  Okay. 


But then -- then going back to the other


question, it seems to me your case is premised on the


assumption that this is a forfeiture in rem type,


different action than -- than a routine contract or tort


action.


MR. MINEAR:  Well, we certainly do think it


falls on the side of the -- of the line that this other --


the other cases of this Court demarcs, namely probate


proceedings, tax sales, condemnation proceedings, notice


of forcible entry and detainer proceedings, which are


basically ejectment proceedings.  All of those types of


proceedings have involved situations where this Court


indicated that notice by ordinary mail would be


sufficient.


Now, we go beyond that.  We do provide certified


mail as -- as a matter of policy.  And it serves an


important policy --

QUESTION:  May I ask you?  This is prompted by


Justice Scalia's question.  Does the Government have any


special procedures for people in the military? 


MR. MINEAR:  I'm not aware of any special


procedures that -- that we provide in those situations. 


For instance, if there was forfeiture --


QUESTION:  And I should think there's a lot of


mail that might -- addressed to a serviceman that might be


signed for by the mail orderly or something.  He may never


get the mail.  I'm just wondering if the -- there's


nothing in the record about that, is there? 


MR. MINEAR:  No.  There's nothing in the record


and it's not clear to me at all that if there was a


forfeiture that was directed to a serviceman, it would be


treated any differently. 


QUESTION:  What about the -- the immunity while


the person -- there's an immunity that governs people in


the military during the time.  Is it -- what is that


statute?


QUESTION:  The Soldier's and Sailor's Civil


Relief Act. 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes, and I'm not sure how that


would apply in this situation.  It might very well toll


the type of requirement --


QUESTION:  It would toll the statute of

limitations because the person could assert immunity for


the period that they're in service.


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  I'm simply not certain how


that would apply.  But I do know that for general civil


procedures -- for civil forfeitures, the regulations of


the FBI do provide mechanisms such as mitigation and


remission that can ameliorate some of the hardships, where


a party can actually show that there was nonreceipt.


QUESTION:  But can I ask you a question that


puzzles me about this?  The -- even before the current


regulations, there was this special mail category and


several things fell into it, including letters that the


prisoner would get from the attorney.  Those have to be


opened in the presence of the prisoner? 


MR. MINEAR:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And then there was this category


called law enforcement.  And why wasn't a notice of this


character categorized as law enforcement and therefore put


within the special mail category? 


MR. MINEAR:  I think for a short while the DEA


and the FBI did follow the practice of denominating


certain mails as special mail.  I'm not sure if the


special mail category existed in 1988.  I don't think the


record is clear on that. 


I would point out, however, that under the

Bureau of Prisons operations memorandum, there is more


protection to providing it by certified mail rather than


by special mail, primarily because of the long period of


retention of the log books for certified mail.  And so,


the practice for -- the current practice of BOP --


QUESTION:  That applies to the Federal system,


but the rule we're working with today would apply to State


forfeitures as well, the State prisons and the like.  So,


your rules don't necessarily tell us what would happen in


a -- to a State prisoner. 


MR. MINEAR:  No, they do not, although I think


that the -- the Court can -- can safely assume that State


prisons do, in fact, provide for mail delivery to their


prisoners. 


QUESTION:  Would you just comment on the


suggestion that your opponent has made, in effect, that


there really ought to be a special rule for people who are


in the custody of the Federal Government?  And I assume


with Justice Scalia that would include military personnel


too.  Is there -- would it make sense to say that when


they know darned well where a person is, there's no reason


to have three publications in the local newspaper?  You


just make sure you get it to -- to where the man is. 


MR. MINEAR:  Well, there's no reason to depart


-- that's certainly -- the fact that we know where the

person is, certainly does dictate that we contact the


person by mail, and that's inconsistent with Mullane and


its progeny, that where the address is reasonably


ascertainable, the person should be contacted by mail.


The fact that we have the person under our


control I don't think adds anything to that.  The basic


question is, is this notice reasonably certain to reach


the inmate?  And if it does, it doesn't really matter if


he's at a location of our choosing or some other location. 


It's simply what's important here is, is this method, is


the procedure reasonably certain to provide actual notice?


QUESTION:  Is there any court action -- if you


accepted your -- your points and said, look, they send it


to the prison.  It's signed for in the prison.  So, up to


there, it's certified.  And then a person regularly picks


it up, and this person did, and then delivers it to the


cell.  Suppose the picker-upper either maliciously,


negligently, or deliberately didn't give it to the


prisoner.  Would the prisoner have any kind of claim under


the Tort Claims Act? 


MR. MINEAR:  I think not under the Tort Claims


Act because it does exclude intentional torts.  There


might be the -- the opportunity for either seeking redress


through the prison administrative remedies or through a


Bivens type action.  But certainly the problem there --

QUESTION:  -- Bivens type action.  It must be


that there's a constitutional right or -- I mean, that's


-- but -- but is under the Torts Claims Act negligence?


MR. MINEAR:  Under negligence?  There is


conceivably an opportunity to seek damages based on


negligence, although you'd have to show an absence of --


of due care.  In the case of the Government, the


regulations here do certainly provide the sort of


reasonableness that we think compliance with would --


would satisfy the standard.


QUESTION:  Let me make sure I understand your


position on one point.  Is it your view that that even if


you had not use certified mail in this case, but just used


regular mail and an affidavit by the Secretary that it was


mailed and so forth, that that would be constitutionally


sufficient? 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  It's our view that that would


be constitutionally sufficient.  The procedures that we


use, with regard to certified mail, are something that we


do beyond constitutional requirements in order to --


primarily to ensure that we can disprove false claims of


nonreceipt. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, am I correct that the --


that the current method of simply providing written notice


is -- you -- you maintain that that is method that

Congress has specified in 19 U.S.C. 1607(a)?


MR. MINEAR:  The method of -- the requirement of


providing written notice I believe is in 1881, on page 3


of our briefs.  And all that Congress has specified is


that -- oh, excuse me.  It is 1607(a).  I'm mistaken. 


Written notice of seizure, together with information --


QUESTION:  This is on page 3, Mr. Minear? 


MR. MINEAR:  On page 3, and the -- at the end of


the first indented paragraph.


It provides that written notice of seizure is to


be provided.  It does not specify mail --


QUESTION:  Shall be sent. 


MR. MINEAR:  Shall be sent. 


QUESTION:  Shall be sent. 


MR. MINEAR:  To each party --

does one normally send things? 


MR. MINEAR:  Well, normally by mail, and we


think that it's --


QUESTION:  It doesn't say shall be sent by


certified mail.  I think it's -- a fair reading of what


Congress thought was adequate was -- was by mail. 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  I think that by ordinary


mail.  And I think -- as I say, the certified mail


procedure is something that the Bureau of Prisons and the

agencies have adopted in order to disprove false claims of


nonreceipt.  That's its principal purpose. 


But it's our position that ordinary mail is


sufficient here as it would be in the wide variety of


other cases, comparable other cases, this Court has


addressed. 


QUESTION:  How do you think the Sixth Circuit


standard differs from the Third Circuit's and the


Fourth's?


MR. MINEAR:  I think as a practical matter, Your


Honor, there's primarily a question of the burden of


proof.  Under the Sixth Circuit's standard, we are simply


-- if we are challenged, if there's a challenge to whether


mail was -- was received or not, it's the obligation of


that party who's raising the challenge to prove the lack


of reasonableness. 


QUESTION:  Well, but here the Government is


seeking to forfeit property from someone.  Maybe it's not


unreasonable to think that the Government has the burden


of proving that notice was given or reasonably calculated


to be given. 


MR. MINEAR:  Well, the Government met that


burden in this case, but again, we don't think that that


should be the test.  Rather, we think that it's the


obligation of the party to show that -- what defects are


46

necessary.  And in this case, the only defect -- the only


proof of inadequacy that petitioner showed was his claim


that he did not receive the notice, and we in return


indicated there were procedures in place that would have


ascertained the mail. 


Now, because the issue is joined, it's likely


the Government would be required or would find it


necessary or useful to put forward information about


procedures. 


But the problem with the Third Circuit standard


is it requires that we, ex ante, at the very beginning of


the process, go through and determine what procedures are


in various prisons.  And that doesn't seem particularly --


that seems particularly inappropriate with regard to State


prisons where we think it's reasonable for us to send --


to mail the receipts to the prisons with the expectation


that those State prisons will forward the mail


appropriately. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, we have a smattering of


courts of appeals cases addressing the issue that we've


got today, but beyond that, I don't know how much


litigation there is about this.  Do we have any indication


of how much time in forfeiture cases is spent litigating


the question of notice? 


MR. MINEAR:  I don't know the answer to that,

Your Honor.  As we point out in the brief, in the year


2000, the Government, the DEA and the FBI, sent out


roughly 9,000 notices of forfeiture to their incarcerated


prisoners.  Now, how many of those are contested, I don't


know the answer to that, but certainly there is the


possibility of a substantial clog on the courts,


particularly over claims of nonreceipt which are so easily


made. 


QUESTION:  Well, except that I -- I don't know


that the -- that that argument really favors you.  There


would be certainly some questions of -- of adequacy of


signature and so on.  But if there were a -- a certified


mail kind of signature requirement, I'm guessing that


institutionally it might be of some help to the courts


because I'm -- I am assuming that in most cases there


wouldn't be any contest.  If the Government had the


signature, it would go forward.  If it didn't have the


signature, it would wait until it got one.  So, I am -- I


am assuming that, knowing nothing, if I don't know any


facts beyond what I know now, that there might be an


institutional advantage in a rule that required the -- the


kind of proof that -- that your friend on the other side


wants. 


MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, I think that -- you


know, that the Department of Justice, and the Bureau of

Prisons in particular, has tried to be helpful in that


regard with -- with regard to providing this type of


process.  But we simply do not believe that it's required


by the Due Process Clause and was not required to be in


place in 1988 when this case arose. 


QUESTION:  But would you -- would you agree that


there can be an institutional consideration in a closed


case in deciding what due process does require? 


MR. MINEAR:  That certainly is a factor that the


Court could weigh, but again --


QUESTION:  Well, you'd have no problem if we --


if we held the way you've asked us to hold.  I mean, that


-- that institutional problem would disappear if you put


it in the mail and there are prison procedures in place,


as there are in every prison, everything is okay.  Right?


QUESTION:  There wouldn't be any litigation


about that. 


QUESTION:  There wouldn't be any litigation.


MR. MINEAR:  Well -- well, no.  No, there isn't,


but there are also State prisons that do need to determine


what procedures they would follow.  And my guess is there


are a large number of State prisons that follow the


practice that was in place in 1988, namely that certified


mail may be signed by the -- by the prison officials, but


they may not have recorded signatures with regard to the

actual receipt by the inmate. 


QUESTION:  And you think it's not reasonable for


the Government go assume that the State prison procedures


are adequate to get mail to State prisoners.  You don't


think that that's reasonably calculated to get mail to


State prisoners. 


MR. MINEAR:  We think it is reasonably


calculated.  Exactly, yes. 


QUESTION:  So, if we held that this is a


reasonable -- sending it by mail is a reasonable way to do


it, you wouldn't have any more of an institutional


problem. 


same --


MR. MINEAR:  Well, no, we wouldn't.  At the


QUESTION:  But if we -- if we said that because


there is a gap between mail delivery to a prison and


delivery to a prisoner and, for that reason, there must be


some indication of the procedure for getting the mail to


the prisoner, then you might have a -- a problem and there


might be an institutional advantage in a signature rule. 


Wouldn't there? 


MR. MINEAR:  Well -- well, that's correct.  But


again, I think that the baseline, the constitutional


baseline, here should be that ordinary mail suffices, and


it's left to the --

QUESTION:  I don't understand why it's -- it's


intuitively obvious that ordinary mail suffices when we


have a situation here which is different from the


situation covered by the -- the ordinary mail.  In the


ordinary mail situation, the mail is delivered to


someone's post office box or -- or a mailbox, and that box


is under the control of the addressee.  We don't have that


here.  We have a -- we have a gap between that point and


the point at which the mail gets to a prisoner.  And


that's why it doesn't seem obvious to me that merely


adopting an ordinary mail rule is appropriate to these


circumstances at all.  What am I missing? 


MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, I think what -- what


you see here is the proceedings below validated the fact


that ordinary mail would suffice, the fact that there are


mail --


QUESTION:  The proceedings below didn't -- as I


understand it, did not stop with proof that the letter was


mailed.  The proceedings below involved an -- an


indication of what the prison did with the mail when it


got it in order to get that mail to the prisoner.  Isn't


that correct? 


MR. MINEAR:  Well, perhaps the answer to your


question, Your Honor, is that this Court can certainly


affirm the decision below and say that the procedures

below were adequate.  It would be our view, though, that


the Court ought not to foreclose the possibility that


ordinary mail would suffice.


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, are there -- do you know


whether there are more prisoners incarcerated in prisons


than there are college students living in dormitories to


whom the mail is not delivered personally or -- or


individuals living in high rise apartment buildings where


the mail is -- is sorted downstairs and not delivered by


the -- by the postman to their -- to their own room? 


MR. MINEAR:  I do not know the answer to that,


Your Honor.


QUESTION:  That's a problem for all those


people, just as it is for prisoners.  They have to rely on


whatever institution they're in getting the mail to them.


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  Although I would draw a


distinction between the apartment building where


oftentimes the mail is provided -- is sorted by the mail


-- by the U.S. Postal Service, put into individual boxes,


and the dormitory residential hall.  I think the Postal


Service does draw a distinction between apartment


buildings and dormitories in that regard. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear --

not always routinely delivered to prisoners.  Sometimes it


was censored and all the rest.  Would you say that


ordinary mail would have been sufficient in that period of


time? 


MR. MINEAR:  Yes.  Well, we think -- again,


there are --


QUESTION:  The warden could just put it on the


shelf and not even give it to the prisoner and there would


be no remedy at all. 


MR. MINEAR:  Obviously, if there is -- if there


is reason to believe by the party that's sending notice


the mail will not -- that ordinary mail will not suffice,


then due process may require that additional steps be


taken. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Minear, in the -- in the hospital


setting, the Government has a claim against someone, knows


that person is hospitalized, sends ordinary mail to the


hospital for the contract claim, the tort claim, whatever. 


Is the Government saying that for an individual it is


enough that mail is sent to that person care of an


institution, no return receipt requested, that will do to


satisfy due process notice requirements? 


MR. MINEAR:  Your Honor, I think that it would


for this reason, that if a return address is provided and


the mail is not delivered by the hospital, we can expect

the hospital to send the mail return it to sender.  Upon


learning that, the Government may be on an -- under an


obligation at that point --


QUESTION:  But suppose the hospital doesn't? 


Suppose all we know is that this mail -- well, I think


your time is up.

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Minear. 


Ms. Zieve, you have 2 minutes remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. ZIEVE:  First of all, I'd like to address


the -- the suggestion that these cases are about false


claims.  Mr. Dusenbery actually made claims -- tried to


get return of property of eight categories of forfeited


property in this case and in the one cited at 201 F.3d


763.  As to seven of the eight categories, it was proven


that he didn't get the notice either because it wasn't


sent at all or it was sent to the wrong place.  So,


there's no reason to think that he's lying about the


eighth.


In addition, this is not a mail notice case. 


We're not talking about the adequacy of mail notice to a


mortgage company or a creditor of an estate.  This case is


more comparable to a situation in which you have a process

server go out and you prove that you gave the notice to


the process server, but you don't ask him or her to ever


give you any verification that it was served. 


Certified mail -- counsel suggests it could be


above the constitutional minimum, but applying this


Court's framework, this Court's test for assessing the


adequacy of notice, we know it's not above the


constitutional minimum because it will reduce the risk of


erroneous deprivation at minimal burden, and we know it


reduces the risk because it can only be -- the notice can


only be delivered, if their signature is required, to the


addressee.  It will not be sent as in a private residence. 


It won't be misdelivered to your neighbor's house if you


have to sign for it.  In a prison, it's not going to be


misdelivered to the next cell or bundled with something


else.  The inmate is going to have to sign for it. 


And finally, the Third Circuit, which did not


require actual notice, did so only because of concern


about the evidentiary burden it would place on the


Government to have that standard, but the Government's
