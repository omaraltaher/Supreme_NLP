CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in Case 15-577, Trinity Lutheran 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Church v. Comer. 

 

 

            

Mr. Cortman. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. CORTMAN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The State of Missouri has excluded The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Learning Center from a recycling program that provides a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

safer playground for children solely because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preschool is operated by a church rather than a secular 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

not-for-profit. 

            

The State has made several important 

 

 

 

 

 

concessions in this case.  Number one, that the policy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case is not facially neutral, and number two, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that based on their religious character, churches are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not eligible for the benefit here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This admitted discrimination against 

 

 

 

religion violates this Court's Free Exercise Principles. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First, as stated in McDaniel and Smith, the Free 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exercise Clause prevents the government from imposing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special disabilities on the basis of religious views or

religious status, and forcing a choice between the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

4 

exercise of religion and receiving either a government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

benefit, right, or privilege. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Assuming that there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

serious risk of an establishment violation, that's off 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the table, are there ever instances in which status --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious status can be used to deny religions or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious believers benefits from the State?  Or are you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that it's -- that absent in Establishment Clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem, that status can never be the base -- religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status can never be the basis for a governmental action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or governmental ordinance, governmental statute? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I -- I'm not sure if it can 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be.  I can't think of a specific example.  And the 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

reason I say that is, the question is, is why would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone's religious status matter in the first place to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receiving a government benefit?  And that's another --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  On that -- on that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question, I guess rather long ago now in the Everson 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case back in 1947, this Court said in no uncertain terms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the Framers didn't want was tax money imposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay for building or maintaining churches or church 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property.  And doesn't that fit this case?  And if so, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is Everson pass√©? 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I don't think it does.

Everson also said that we have to be careful in not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishing a church not to deprive religious people or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

organizations of general government benefits.  And so I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that's the key here.  I think there's a difference 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

between funding of religious activities and funding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secular activities of religious organization.  And I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how is the building 

  

 

 

 

 

 

separate from the religious exercise therein?  I believe 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that this playground is part of the ministry of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church.  And, in fact, I look at its bylaws, I look at 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

its advertisements, and it includes play and conducted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a religiously valuable way.  I think that's the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

materials that you're -- that the church is advertising. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

How do you separate out its secular function 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from its religious function? 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I think the way the Court 

    

 

 

 

 

 

always has.  And the answer to that is, for example, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even though the motivation behind operating this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preschool is a religious motivation, doesn't mean that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

every single activity that occurs there happens to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, how about if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

school does a prayer before the children start playing? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I don't think --

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or how about if it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

chooses on a sunny day to do its religious instruction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside.  How does the State know or how can it control 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

without then controlling on the -- on the basis of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belief and viewpoint?  How could they control against 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that involvement? 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Sure.  It's the same way it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

has in all the case law.  And that is, is we have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at where's the money going to?  What's it going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fund? 

            

And in this particular instance, for 

 

 

 

 

 

example, if you look at the -- this Court's case law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going back from Everson and all the way forward, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always said is the money going to a religious activity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or is it going to a secular activity? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

This Court has approved funding to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But --

  

 

 

MR. CORTMAN:  -- religious schools, just not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for religious activities. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So do you think, 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Cortman, suppose there was an application and a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from a -- a church that used its playground for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

religious activities.  Had prayer services there, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

example.  Could the State, in your view, deny the money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on that ground, or at least would you think that that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a significantly different case?

MR. CORTMAN:  I -- I think it would be a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

7 

different case.  I would say the answer to the question 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be I don't think they should, and here's why:  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think there would be a --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That they -- I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They don't think they should --

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  They should be able to deny it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on that ground.  And the reason I say that is, is all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about is a -- is a surface, a safer 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

surface on the playground for when -- when kids play. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As was mentioned in one of the amicus briefs, I believe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was the World Vision brief, the surfacing being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

softer doesn't enable religious activities, it doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow it, it doesn't prohibit it.  It's really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely separate and apart from it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think a good example would be 

   

   

 

 

 

something like this --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  How would you -- for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

example, one of the things that the Court has -- has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought about in the past is like computers for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

education.  So I guess somebody could make the same 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument about computers.  Well, it doesn't really --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's separate from the religious instruction that might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be carried out over those computers. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Do you think that that's the same, or is it

different? 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I -- I think it's actually 

    

   

 

 

 

8 

easier than computers because you don't have to get into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diversion and all the -- the concept this Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talked about over the -- over the years in the Mitchell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case and the other types of cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And here the reason is, is that what we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about is just a surface.  It's not even the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire playground.  It's just the surface that doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

enable any religious activity. 

 

 

 

            

So, for example, if there was a program from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a State that said we have a lot of old buildings in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

town, and we're going to -- we're going to reimburse for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fire extinguishers for all of the old buildings, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including the religious schools and all the schools. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And they said, but if -- if you have a religious school 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you use this fire extinguisher reimbursement, could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they then be able to say now that you received that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that public benefit, that safety benefit, you can no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer include any religion in those classrooms or in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the schools? 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But don't you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. CORTMAN:  And all my point --

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Finish 

  

  

 

 

 

your sentence. 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  All my point is I think that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

would be going too far because it's not advancing or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

furthering the religious activity.  It's separate and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

apart from it. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not sure I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understand your answer to the playground being used for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a more religious activity.  Let's suppose that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

public school sometimes uses its playground for things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other than children playing, whatever they're going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have, a -- you know, an auction or anything else. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Isn't it the consequence of your argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the church can use the playground for more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious activities if the public school can use the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

playground for other non-playground activities? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I think it can.  And -- and I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that the key here is, is that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

think it can what? 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I think they should be able 

    

 

 

 

 

 

to -- I think both the public schools should be able to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use it for other activities, and I think that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious schools should be able to also. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and as I mentioned, I think the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

reason for that is it would be a penalty on the benefit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say because we're putting up a safer surface for when

forth?  Because we could go on and on.  Suppose you have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an earthquake safety program for schools or -- or for --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for public -- or for buildings with large numbers of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people.  And you have an earthquake -- in California, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 percent of the cost of structure is earthquake-proof. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Suppose they have earthquake reinforcement for a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

church and have to spend extra money because there --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a window in the shape of a cross. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

That's all -- these are all establishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems? 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  They -- they are.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

interestingly in this case, the State concedes, and as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did the lower court, there is no Federal Establishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause.

what makes the case a -- just a little bit -- in --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in my last hypothetical about earthquake safety, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

any problem there with giving the money to a church and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spending extra money for the cross in the window?  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all -- it's for public safety. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I think it would be an issue 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the -- on the Establishment Clause, the question of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Establishment Clause.  But once you get to the fact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there is no Establishment Clause problem, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we have here, the question then is can you single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out religious people or religious organizations for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty from this benefit?  Or, as this Court said in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McDaniel and Sherbert, is that you're forcing them to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose between exercising their religious faith and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receiving the -- a public benefit. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I'm sorry --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Going back to my first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question, that means what your position is, if there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no Establishment violation, there can never be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction based on religion. 

 

 

 

            

we --

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I wouldn't say never.  We --

    

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Give me an example. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. CORTMAN:  Well, play in -- what comes to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind is Locke v. Davey and play in the joints.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

reason that's an important one there is because that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

a narrow distinction that was based on, what this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, a unique historical interest.  And the Court also 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

said that the program there went a long way to include 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religion.  Here, it closes religion right out at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

door. 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We -- we did --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but it does --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We did say in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case -- well, I think you stipulated that this school 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a nondiscriminatory admissions policy.  But suppose 

   

  

 

 

 

it didn't.  Suppose its policy was we prefer Lutheran 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children, and then if we have any space left over after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, we'll take other Christians.  And then after that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe Jews, and then everyone else.  Everything else is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same.  They want the paving of their playground. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Could -- could this -- could they demand as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a matter of Federal constitutional right that that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

playground be funded, even though they have an -- an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admissions policy that favors members of their church? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I -- I think they can, because 

    

   

 

 

 

 

they have a -- they have a free exercise right to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious autonomy to decide who their members are.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, most private organizations and religious

organizations do so.  I --

    

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So this church could say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we will take only Lutheran children. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I believe it can. 

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And -- and still get the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

public money. 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I believe so, because we're 

    

 

 

 

 

still at the premise of -- of why are we making the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church choose between exercising its religion, the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts in McDaniel v. Paty, and saying he can't both be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minister and also be a constitutional delegate. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Cortman, do we know what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Missouri -- how Missouri interprets the term "church" in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its constitution?  It speaks about church.  Does it have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be -- is this a matter of the form of the ownership 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a facility?  Is this playground considered to be --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the State to be part of the church because of its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximity to the church?  What if it was a -- what if we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had a -- a religiously affiliated school that was not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

adjacent to a church and it had a playground.  Would 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

they consider that to be part of -- would they consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that to fall within the prohibition? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I think it would depending on 

    

 

 

 

 

 

how religious it is.  And so what Missouri Supreme Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case law has -- says, number one, any -- any

organization that's owned or controlled by a church.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

that answers the church part. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So if it's controlled. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  That's right. 

  

 

 

            

And also, any religious organizations that 

 

 

 

 

 

are sectarian or denominational.  And so it's not only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the church, it's other religious organizations. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And Missouri Supreme Court case law says the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way we decide those questions is -- is -- is how much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious influence is there in a church?  In other 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

words, are they serious about their faith?  Do they --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is it voluntary for the students there?  And so there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a question about how religious you may be in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive the benefit or not.  But it's clear it applies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to religious organizations, and that's what their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing has conceded, and to churches. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Cortman, my questions 

  

 

 

 

 

about religious uses, I think, was to get at a -- a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broader point, a broader distinction, and asked -- ask 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you think of it.  And as it seems that you are on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strongest ground when you say, look, the State has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided to fund some activity, and it's denying that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that funding to a particular party based solely on that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party's religious status. 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Yes. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that's the way you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

briefed the case. 

 

 

              

I hear you making a different argument, or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

broader argument now, that extends into a State's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

decision to deny some uses -- to deny funding to some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uses at the same time as it gives funding to other uses, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a State's decision to say, look, we really just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want to fund religious exercise.  They can do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious exercise.  We don't want to fund religious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise.  And I understand that you might think that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

out of bounds, too.  But what I'm trying to figure out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, is there a distinction between these two things. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I don't think it's a broader 

    

   

 

 

 

argument that we're making.  What I'm -- what I'm trying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to communicate is, is that when you look at what you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funding -- so this program says that you can't use this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money for any religious activities and it has to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

toward the playground resurfacing.  So it's actually a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reimbursement grant whereas the church already lays out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the finances.  Once it proves that it's put down the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surfacing, then it puts its information in and gets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reimbursed for it.  So the money has to be used for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

My only point is, is can the State then say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for example, in Everson and Allen, now that we've given

you this bus transportation or these books, you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

engage in any religious activity once we've given you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that separate benefit.  Not that you can't use the money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for religious activity, which you cannot, and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't -- we don't disagree with that.  The question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is --

 

            

with that. 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So you don't disagree 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR. CORTMAN:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the State is entitled to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say you can't use this money for religious activity, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe I'll bring you a little bit further, we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to take certain prophylactic measures to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure that you don't use the money for religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity. 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Yes.  But -- I absolutely 

   

  

  

 

 

agree.  But once you take that benefit, I think it goes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too far to say, like in Allen, for example, we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing you with these textbooks, so you have to stop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all religion in your school.  And that's all my point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of -- that I was trying to --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, then how about the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What does the record

17 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me, but you were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking about Locke --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Yeah. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and how this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

dissimilar from Locke. 

 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, there is a 

  

 

 

 

 

tradition.  There are 39 States with constitutional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

amendments like the one Missouri has.  That's a history 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's even longer than the Locke history.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essence of that history is, basically, we don't want to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a country -- well, the vast majority of States, to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fund houses of worship.  One would think that if there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

play in the joints, that that would include the concept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that States are free to say we don't want to spend money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the public FIs on houses of worship. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, you say this affects free exercise.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to be confusing money with religious practice.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think the two are tied.  This church is not going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to close its religious practices or its doors because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its playground doesn't have these tires.  So I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure how this is a free-exercise question, because there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

is no effect on the religious beliefs.  No one is asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

the church to change its beliefs.  In fact, no one is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking the church as a condition of saying don't use 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we give you for religious purposes; they're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even doing that.  They're just saying we don't want to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be involved with the church. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Sure.  But there's -- there's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

government coercion when you say there's a public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

benefit, and the only way you could receive that public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit is if you do not exercise your religion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why is that coercion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to your beliefs? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Because it's -- it's a choice, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

just like with McDaniel v. Paty.  He could not do both 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things simultaneously.  He could not -- Mr. McDaniel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could not both be a minister and be a constitutional 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

delegate, and what the court said forcing that choice --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you can have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

playground here. 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  But you can't be -- you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a religious organization and have a playground. 

   

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You have a playground. 

   

  

 

 

No one is taking the playground away from you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  No.  But you're -- you're

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  The priest was 

  

  

 

 

 

being penalized.  The priest was being told you can't be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a priest or a congressman.  So you can't do one or the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other. 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Here, there's nothing 

  

 

 

 

being taken away from. 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Sure.  It's the same public 

  

  

 

 

 

 

benefit.  You can't be both, run this -- operate this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

daycare as a religious organization and receive the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

public benefit. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do we do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

discrimination for religion under your theory?  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the way you're going in your theory is an expansion of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McDaniel; but putting aside that it's an expansion of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McDaniel, what are we going to end up with when secular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people say religious people are being discriminated in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor of and against us?  If status should not be an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect on free exercise, what are we going to do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tax benefits? 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I think --

    

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What are we going to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with all the exemptions that churches receive? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Those are benefits. 

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Sure.  And I would say that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

20 

the -- the clauses take care of that.  So, for example, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it goes too far and the government benefit is solely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favoring religion, it's likely a violation of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Establishment Clause.  But we also have a --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, there's plenty of 

  

 

 

 

 

people who would think tax exemption goes too far. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I don't.  I'm just 

   

  

  

 

 

saying there are people who make that claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Sure.  And the Court's already 

  

  

 

 

 

 

ruled on that.  And so on one side you have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Establishment Clause.  If you're going too far to favor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religion, there's an Establishment Clause problem; but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you go the other side on the Free Exercise Clause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has said for decades, sometimes we may and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even must accommodate religion, and I think is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable treatment that Your Honor is talking about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I think all the clauses work together in that route. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you take it too far, you do have an Establishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause problem. 

 

            

In this -- this case, it's considered there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is no Establishment Clause problem, and -- and there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a point where you can accommodate religion, this other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit, under the Free Exercise Clause, but I think

they all balance out each other.  And in this particular 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

case, it's not only McDaniel v. Paty, but McCauley 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically said that if you target religion on its --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on its face, which this policy does, then it's -- it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And Mr. Cortman, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

know whether we -- excuse me.  I don't know whether we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to get into the history of this particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendment here.  I tend to think we don't need to, but 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the beginning of the line of questioning that Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor just finished, she began with the suggestion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that perhaps this amendment reflects an admirable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historical tradition that should be respected. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Do you think that that is the proper way to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analyze this question? 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I don't.  And -- and this --

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

this particular provision that we're discussing, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are -- and this has been briefed by several amicus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs and -- and briefly by us, is a product of what we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would consider to be one of the Blaine Amendments that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not found in Locke v. Davey.  And the reason for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is, is it has that same language in the Blaine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.  It was adopted the same exact year, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is much history showing about the anti-Catholic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bigotry that's behind this specific provision, and

several members of this Court have opined on that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before.  So I think it doesn't carry the same history 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as -- as this general Establishment Clause, not --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is a serious 

   

  

 

 

debate about that, isn't there? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  There is.  And that's why our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument is, is we believe it is one, but it -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't matter to the deciding of this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Has the -- has the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State courts, have they ever said the amendment prevents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State from giving grants or from spending money on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police protection for churches? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  They -- they have not, and --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Have they ever said that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevents the State from, say, having a -- a border 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

guard, you know, crossing guards or fire protection? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Or, let's say, health inspections? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  They have not. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. CORTMAN:  But what --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  In that case, why, just --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just like you and the other side to spend a minute on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, just a minute, why isn't the case moot?  That is, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have a governor.  He said he's going to give you the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grants.  He said that we know for four years this is

going to recur anyway.  There's certainly -- of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it could happen, somebody brings the case in the Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

Court and they decide it differently in -- in -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State. 

            

But what case would you cite as closest to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proposition?  This is not moot -- you didn't ask for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money, did you? 

 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You just want an injunction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for the future. 

 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Because of the 11th Amendment. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And you're going to get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that injunction, whether you want it or not, with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present governor. 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Possibly, and likely, 

  

 

 

 

temporarily. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's -- well, 

  

 

 

 

 

temporarily.  Is there any chance he would change his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind? 

            

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What? 

  

 

MR. CORTMAN:  Well -- well, for -- if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political winds change, we have -- we have this policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by Facebook or press release.  So it can easily be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed back if political --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  I see that. 

    

  

 

 

24 

What case would you cite? 

 

 

 

 

MR. CORTMAN:  I -- I -- excuse me.  I think 

    

    

   

 

 

 

the best two cases are Friends of the Earth and the Knox 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. CORTMAN:  In fact, I think those cases 

   

  

 

 

 

 

are more difficult cases than --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Okay.  Fine. 

  

  

  

 

MR. CORTMAN:  -- this case, because of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

voluntary cessation proposition.  But I think that's --

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's two -- there's 

  

 

 

 

 

two questions, isn't there?  One is we're talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the case moot, and I think, technically, it's not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moot.  But if we think -- suppose Missouri had a policy 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it has today, very recently, and we were asked to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant cert in this case.  That would be a factor in our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision whether we thought this was an appropriate case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to review, wouldn't it? 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  This case would have to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, I guess, in a different posture, maybe coming from 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the other side, if that was already the policy.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of the problems is, is that the original policy was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on the Missouri Supreme Court's interpretation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what's interesting here is there's

already talk that the new policy is immediately going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be go challenged, and likely struck down by the Missouri 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme Court.  So absent a ruling here, the -- the old 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

policy will be back in place.  And that's why it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important for the Court to rule because it's not -- this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't a permanent change by any means.  It's a temporary 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

change.  In fact, the government is -- is actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defending both the old policy and the new policy, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think shows why this Court needs to issue a ruling. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- but I think what's likely to happen 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Voluntary Cessation Doctrine, especially as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has said, we look at this with a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical eye because of the 11th hour change, is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State free to return to its old ways?  It clearly is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not only in this administration, but in the new lawsuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being brought to challenge the new policy, because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates why we're here in the first place, is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Missouri State constitutional provision. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  May I take you back to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

substance, Mr. Cortman, unless anybody -- it's -- let's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talk a little bit about federalism, and here's what I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would like to know.  You know, usually when we see these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funding cases, it comes in a different context.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

comes where the State wants to give money and somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is objecting.  And this case comes in the converse way,

where a State says we just don't want to fund --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- this institution.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

these -- these church/States divide, it's a -- it's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraught issue.  It's a hard issue.  It's a -- it's an 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

issue in which States have their own very longstanding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  It's an issue on which I -- I guess I'm going to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say nobody is completely sure that they have it right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and so I guess there's something attractive about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having some play in the joints where States can go their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own way and make their own choices.  And why shouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this be one of those cases? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Because I don't think this is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

one of the difficult cases.  In fact, I would say, with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the Court's jurisprudence under Free Exercise and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Establishment Clause, this is actually one of the easier 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  And the reason for that is if you look at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

play in joints, the first conclusion was there was no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Free Exercise violation there.  Here, there clearly is. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you look at the Court's case law under Sherbert and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McDaniel and McCauley and Smith, this is clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

singling out a religious organization with no 

   

 

 

 

 

justification to do so.  So just having a Free Exercise 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation takes it out of the play in the joints where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there wasn't one there. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

              

I think the other thing is, if you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

looking at the --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's, of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

true, that if there's a -- a constitutional right at 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

stake, that trumps.  But the question is, how are we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to interpret the constitutional right?  What are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- so -- so I guess what I'm asking is, do you see 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value in the other side in having some flexibility here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for States to make these sorts of choices? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  I think States have tremendous 

    

 

 

 

 

leeway in the way they set up and decide these types of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

programs.  And here's what I would say, which I think is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

an easy solution.  Number one, the State doesn't have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set up the program in the first place.  Number two, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could set it up in a way that said, we're only going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do government schools' playgrounds and not any private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schools. 

            

But once it sets up the program to include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all not-for-profits and all not-for-profit preschools, 

 

 

 

 

 

it sets out 16 different criteria, neutral criteria, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that everyone has to comply with.  Then the question is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- when you have a -- a religious organization that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

meets those criteria; in fact, does better on them than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost everybody else, and then you look at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application and say, well, we just found out you're

operated by a religious organization, we're going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

28 

take you back out of that, even though you meet the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's criteria and further our interest better than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost everybody else, that seems to be not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But one last -- I know your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

white light is on.  But might the State think that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's the problem.  The problem is this church has come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in with a very competitive application.  We want to give 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

money to this church.  Let's say, you know, a Protestant 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

church.  There's a Catholic church across the street. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Catholic church applies, doesn't get money, this happens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five years running.  And people start thinking, well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why is the Protestant church keeping on getting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money and the Catholic church never gets the money?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State says, we just won't -- don't want to sow that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of division, that kind of mistrust, that kind of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, that --

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Sure.  It sounds like a -- a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

reasonable observer question, but put that aside for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second.  If you know the history and context of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program, you would know that this is a competitive 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant, and they actually should be religion blind. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So if you're not looking at who is applying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can grade this just like this application was graded

highly, based on secular and neutral criteria.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

anyone knows that the program is purely religion blind, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not looking at who's applying, they'll know that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not favoring any religious organization or secular. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But what you do when you favor -- when you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remove the religious organizations, even though you've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scored them high under your own competition, you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually singling out for -- for a benefit they should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise get under Free Exercise.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Layton. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. LAYTON 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

Justice Alito asked the question as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether this is an admirable tradition that should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respected, this 39-State tradition of have -- keeping 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hands off of religion, and the answer from the States' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view is yes. 

 

 

            

In 1820, Missouri's first constitutional 

 

 

 

 

convention adopted from Jefferson's Virginia Statute for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Religious Freedom the language that, "No man can be

worship." 

            

We modified that, made it more specific in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 1865 and 1875 constitutions.  And in 1945, it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

reenacted in our latest constitution with reference back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the founding era. 

 

 

 

            

The -- the question, then, is whether that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fits within this Court's jurisprudence under the First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.  And there we look at both the Establishment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause and the Free Exercise Clause, and the play 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between the joints that this Court confirmed or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized in Locke v. Davey. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you don't want 

  

 

 

 

 

 

us -- you say we don't have to look at the Establishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause.  In your brief, you said there's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Establishment Clause problem here. 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  No.  I -- we say that there is 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not an Establishment Clause violation.  Some of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

amici on our site -- side say that there is, but no, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in the State's view, there is not an Establishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause violation.  And so Governor Greitens' decision to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed differently does not violate the Establishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause. 

            

The question is whether that's the limit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are Establishment Clause concerns here, even if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's not a violation.  And those concerns arise both 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

with regard to endorsement and with regard to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entanglement. 

31 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And is it your argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that this statute is valid to keep us away from close 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Establishment Clause questions? 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Yes.  Yes.  We don't want to be 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

in a position, for example, in this case, where we are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selecting among churches.  We don't want to be in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position where we are making a visible, physical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

improvement on church property. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but this -- this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite different than Locke, because this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status-based statute. 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, in -- in that respect, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is different.  In other respects it's different as well. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For example, in that case, we have independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisionmaking, which has been key to many of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's decisions.  In this Court, the decisionmaking is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not by some third party, it is by the State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Layton, you said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you don't want to -- you don't want to have a program 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that makes physical improvements to -- to churches.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I just wanted to ask you about some Federal laws that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are highlighted in the amicus brief filed by the Union 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, and get your reaction

whether a program like that would be permissible under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

the Missouri constitution. 

 

 

            

So one of them is a Federal nonprofit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

security grant program providing grants through the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department of Homeland Security to harden -- harden 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonprofit organization facilities that are deemed to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at high risk for terrorist attacks.  So if you have a --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a synagogue that is at high risk for an attack by an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anti-Semitic group or a mosque that is considered to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at high risk for attack by an anti-Muslim group, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Missouri constitution permit the erection of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bollards like we have around the court here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  The answer traditionally -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'm not sure that I can speak for the current 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governor -- of course, I was brought back to argue this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case and instructed I could defend the prior position, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

but the answer traditionally would be no.  State money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could not be used to actually erect or -- or operate or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide that kind of physical addition to a -- to a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church or synagogue. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Here's another one. 

  

  

 

 

 

I have two more, if you'll indulge me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This is a Federal program that provided 

   

 

 

 

 

grants for the repair of buildings near the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

building in Oklahoma City that were damaged by the

bombing there.  Would that be permitted? 

  

 

 

 

 

33 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Under the traditional view of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

-- in the State of Missouri, it would not be permitted, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided that those were actually church buildings. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Worship buildings. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Last one.  This is a 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

New York City program that provides security -- money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for security enhancements at schools where there's fear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of shooting or other school violence. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Again, under the traditional 

  

 

 

 

 

view in Missouri, if -- if this was actually a cash 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant, money leaving the public treasury to go to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church, it would not be permissible. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that doesn't mean that a 

 

 

 

 

 

religious-affiliated school could not qualify.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

St. Louis University case by the Missouri Supreme Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shows that the Missouri courts have been willing to draw 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the definition of churches and religious institutions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty narrowly. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So what is the definition of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a church?  So a religiously-affiliated school is not a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

church under the -- under the Missouri constitution? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  The decision with regard to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

St. Louis University was that even though it is a Jesuit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institution that is founded by Jesuits, had a Jesuit

president and Jesuits on its board, since it had a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self-perpetuating board, even though it declared a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

Jesuit philosophy, it was determined to be eligible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive -- in that instance not direct payment from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State, but eligible to receive State funds. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But why --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Layton --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why would that be so? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LAYTON:  I suspect because the Missouri 

    

 

 

 

 

courts are trying to provide as much assistance as they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can within the realm that they feel that the Missouri 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitution permits. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Oh.  So suppose you -- we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have the -- a school that's run by the Trinity Lutheran 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Church of Columbia.  And then next to it we have a -- a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jesuit elementary and secondary school.  One would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

eligible, one would not be eligible? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  It would depend on the nature 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the two.  In fact, if the Trinity Lutheran went back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the position it was in in 1985 where the preschool 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was an independent, although somewhat affiliated, entity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using the church's facilities, presumably under some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of a lease arrangement, the State likely would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said yes, because that would be consistent --

MR. LAYTON:  No.  I don't think -- I -- it 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

would be a fine line in terms of the control.  But no, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

if the organization itself, the church itself rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than the self-perpetuating board, such as with St. Louis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

University, controlled the -- the preschool, that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is what has made the difference in Missouri in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

past, although understand, we have very few cases in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Missouri that have addressed these questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Layton, could we go back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to where Justice Alito started --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- and -- and you said no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money to churches.  Why can the State provide police 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection or fire protection? 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, the -- the -- the State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does, and I think for a couple of reasons.  One is that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are not actually taking money from the State treasury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and giving it to the church.  And this Court has seldom, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if ever, actually said it's okay to write a check from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the public treasury to a church.  So this -- we're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing a service.  And the service there is not being 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided solely for the benefit of the church.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service is being provided for police and fire for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit of the public safety --

State X.  And State X says, we're not going to provide 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police protection.  We will for everybody, but not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church.  And by the way, that costs us extra money.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to hire extra policemen -- revoke. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

Okay?  That's all.  Why not? 

  

  

 

 

MR. LAYTON:  That --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  We don't want -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't -- we don't want to because they're a church. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's why not. 

 

 

            

Same with fire protection.  Same with 

  

 

 

 

 

vaccination programs.  Same with public health.  Same 

  

  

 

 

 

 

with helping children who get sick at school.  Okay? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You know, the hypotheticals are obvious.  Nothing to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with Missouri.  But as soon as you answer that, I'll be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to know that ask you a question and how does this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differ.  Okay? 

  

            

            

yet. 

MR. LAYTON:  Well, this -- this differs --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I'm not asking that

37 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm asking, does the 

  

 

 

 

 

Constitution of the United States permit a State or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

city to say, we give everybody in this city police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection, but not churches?  We give everybody fire 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection, but let the church burn down.  We give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody public health protection, but not a church. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

That's -- that's the law in my imaginary State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I'm saying, does the Constitution, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantees free exercise of religion, permit such laws? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  I -- I am not going to take the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

position that it permits those laws --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now you say no, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

it does not permit those laws.  Very well. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If it does not permit a law that pays money 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of the treasury for the health of the children in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the church, school, or even going to church, how does it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit Missouri to deny money to the same place for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helping children not fall in the playground, cut their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knees, get tetanus, break a leg, et cetera?  What's the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference? 

            

MR. LAYTON:  The difference is that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

establishment concerns that motivate Missouri's policy 

 

 

 

 

 

do not apply in the police and fire context, but they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply here.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why in health context?  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

if there's --

 

 

            

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- an epidemic? 

  

 

 

 

MR. LAYTON:  No, I don't know that they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

apply in health context.  Because the kind of examples 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor is giving are examples where the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits are universal.  They are not selective, which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are here; they are universal. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So we start on the endorsement side.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those instances, the State is not endorsing a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

church by choosing to provide that church with those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits and not another church, which is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

that --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Layton, I understand 

   

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Establishment 

  

 

 

 

Clause -- the -- the entire basis for your rule is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're afraid of violating the Establishment Clause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even though you're sure there's no violation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Establishment Clause? 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  No.  I -- it -- it is that we 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do not want to come to the edge of violating the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Establishment Clause.  I mean, we are not taking the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

position that we would by doing this, but the

position that it is not, that this is not a violation --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  It is not a violation. 

   

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- Establishment 

  

 

 

 

Clause violation. 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  The question is, do we have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come all the way to the edge of a violation, which is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what I think Petitioners are arguing. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, I --

   

  

 

MR. LAYTON:  But it -- that it -- that as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long as we aren't violating, there is no room between. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Layton, let's say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I accept that the State might have an interest in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying we just don't want to be seen as giving money to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one church and not another in these selective programs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  And that's the endorsement 

  

 

 

 

 

side.  There's also entanglement. 

  

 

 

            

            

legitimate. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  I --

    

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- I think that that's 

    

   

 

 

 

But here's the thing.  There's a 

  

 

 

 

 

constitutional principle.  It's as strong as any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional principle that there is, that when we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a program of funding -- and here we're funding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

playground surfaces -- that everybody is entitled to

that funding, to -- to that particular funding, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

or not they exercise a constitutional right; in other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

words, here, whether or not they are a religious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

institution doing religious things.  As long as you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

using the money for playground services, you're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disentitled from that program because you're a religious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

institution doing religious things. 

 

 

 

            

And I would have thought that that's a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

pretty strong principle in our constitutional law.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how is that the State says that that's not violated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here? 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, let me react to the way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you set that out.  If we're only going to look at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the rubber, then what Your Honor asks does make sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But the rubber doesn't have any meaning until it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

placed there and is available for use.  And under this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory, we not only have to put rubber on playgrounds, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but don't we have to put new paint on the sanctuary if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the old one had lead paint?  Don't we have to put --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay -- reimburse for pews to be upholstered?  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what -- what is the --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not -- maybe not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think --

    

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- not under -- not

scholarship and others. 

 

 

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  It did. 

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So perhaps -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean, maybe you'd have a good argument.  Or on the other 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hand, maybe if you painted the interior of all sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other buildings but singled out religious, I don't know. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But it seems to me that that's -- raises much more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious problems than this case. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  I don't think that Locke 

    

 

 

 

 

raise -- I think that this case raises more serious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems than Locke in a number of respects.  It is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct payment to a church.  It's not an indirect 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

payment chosen by someone else.  It is not available to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone.  It's only available to those who are selected 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But here's the deal.  You're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

right that this is a selective program.  It's not a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

general program in which everybody gets money.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

still the question is whether some people can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disentitled from applying to that program and from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receiving that money if they are qualified based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other completely nonreligious attributes, and they're 

 

 

 

 

 

disqualified solely because they are a religious 

   

 

 

 

 

institution doing religious things.  Even though they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

not -- they could -- they could promise you, we're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to do religious things on this playground surface, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

and you're still saying, well, no, you -- you can't get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the money. 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, they -- they could, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that still doesn't get us out of the entanglement issues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  We have a church that, in order to participate, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to agree to curriculum requirements in their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preschool.  The idea that the government is going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dictate what is taught at a church, even if they're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willing to accept it, which they are here, is anathema 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the Establishment Clause considerations that have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highlighted many of these questions --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You suggested two lines. 

  

 

 

 

 

I'm back to my question --

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- which is really quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

similar to what Justice Kagan is asking.  You -- once 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you accepted the first part of what I asked, you agree 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there has to be a line. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, one line you've 

  

 

 

 

 

suggested is the question that you're selecting rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than giving to any -- everyone. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Universal versus select.

JUSTICE BREYER:  But would you say the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

case, were you to give the money to all schools instead 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of just some by selection, then would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional barring churches?  I don't think you 

    

 

 

 

 

would.  But wait.  Say the other line. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

The other line, which I want you to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

contrast, is that where there is a grant given to all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schools, private and public, and the purpose -- and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant has nothing to do with religious practice, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does -- has to do with health or safety.  Then you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do it.  What about that? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, that's --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- that's -- because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you win -- you lose -- or you win on the first; you lose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the second. 

 

 

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  That -- that is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, they are two competing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

lines that I'm at least seeing.  Maybe there's some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others. 

            

MR. LAYTON:  If the sole benefit to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

church and its members was health and safety and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could draw that line, that may make some sense.  But, of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, that's not true here.  It's -- it's more than 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that here.  What we are being asked to give to this

that declares in their petition that they use this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

preschool to bring the gospel message to nonmembers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not -- now your line is the benefit, if the benefit is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical, that's okay; but if it's not, it's not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  No.  I'm saying --

  

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what is your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

issue?  Your -- your answer said the -- the issue here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that it's the physical area near the church. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  No.  I'm saying that -- that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

even physical changes, even if they have a safety 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

element, may still have an entanglement problem. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because we are saying to the church, you -- you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this now incentive to rearrange your property, your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

church site, in order to maximize the amount you get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the State rather than maximizing the spiritual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

development of the children. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if you had a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

program at the -- the State capital?  You had tours for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school groups, and you had someone who, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coordinated, tied it into the social studies program; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school groups can come in, but no religious schools. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is that okay?

MR. LAYTON:  I don't know that it would be. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

We don't know who -- we -- we -- frankly, we have tours 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like that, and we --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You have to have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

position.  And -- and it seems to me that if you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer the question whether or not you could prohibit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tours for religious schools while allowing tours for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other schools, I don't understand the basis of your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

program -- your position. 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  The -- the tours, at least in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our experience, are also universal.  Everyone who comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the capital gets a tour.  And so --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well --

  

 

 

 

MR. LAYTON:  -- we would be -- in terms of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

universal versus selective, we would be in that same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

range.  But also with regard to entanglement, the tours 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do not require the State to be entangled in any way with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the church and its ministry.  And the playground 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

improvement here does require that, not just as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

curriculum, but as to the manner in which this is done, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the way in which it is portrayed to the community. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's the kind of entanglement that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, "the way it is portrayed to the community"?

in this particular program, the church gets points for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

telling people in the community that the State paid for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this improvement to their church.  And so the -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essence, it -- it exacerbates the endorsement problem by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling them what they have to say publicly about this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular improvement. 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, you could say the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

same thing, that -- that the church is delighted that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has fire protection. 

 

 

            

said --

 

MR. LAYTON:  Well, I -- I suppose if we 

   

   

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. LAYTON:  -- we're only going to provide 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fire protection to churches that will declare publicly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they appreciate the States providing that, maybe; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but, again, that's not selective.  And so that -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement by the church has no meaning.  It -- it can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be perceived as an endorsement.  But when I drive past 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this church and this church has this beautiful new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

playground surface that the State paid for, I am 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

receiving a message with regard to the State in this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular regard. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And -- and so long as the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money is granted based on neutral criteria that are

distinction between a program that's open to everybody 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and a selective program. 

   

 

47 

              

I mean, suppose Missouri offered 50 full 

 

 

 

 

 

college scholarships every year to students who achieved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain academic criteria -- who satisfied certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

academic criteria, and this was open to public school 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

students and private school students.  But, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

after a few years, the school saw -- the State saw that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a disproportionate number of these were going -- among 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those given to the religiously affiliate, to the private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schools, a disproportionate were -- a number of the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

scholarships were going to students at schools that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affiliated with a particular faith. 

   

 

 

            

Would it be, then, justified to say, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we better not -- we better disqualify every student who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went to a religiously affiliated school so there aren't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

any hard feelings? 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, I think that may be an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Equal Protection problem, because I don't know what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the basis for that would be. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  So what's the difference 

  

 

 

 

 

between that situation and this situation --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, here, it's --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- as far as the difference 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

between selective and nonselective? 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  If we're going to deal with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Equal Protection approach to this, then the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes whether our endorsement and entanglement 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

concerns are a rational basis. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  I'm not talking about 

  

  

 

 

 

 

equal protection.  You -- you said there's -- that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters that this is selective as opposed to not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selective. 

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And what is the basis for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawing that distinction?  I thought that -- I thought 

    

   

 

 

 

 

your asserted basis was it prevents the perception of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favoritism. 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Yes, it -- it does.  Because 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

this is a very selective program, very few institutions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

get it.  And unlike the scholarship example or, frankly, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the example in Locke v. Davey, it is a publicly visible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manifest demonstration of State endorsement. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I don't understand --

   

  

 

 

 

I -- I think I understand how the States' interests 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

might differ some, but essentially this is a program 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

open to everyone.  Happens to be a competitive program, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

but everyone is open to compete on various neutral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms, and you're depriving one set of actors from being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to compete in the same way everybody else can

compete because of their religious identification. 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

            

MR. LAYTON:  And that is what we are doing, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because we are concerned about the endorsement and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entanglement issues that arise in connection with this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

type of a program. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  And those are 

  

  

 

 

 

interests.  I don't mean to say that those are not valid 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests.  But it does seem as though this is a clear 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden -- looked at that way, this is a clear burden on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a constitutional right.  And then your interests have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rise to an extremely high level. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, I don't know that I --

   

   

  

 

 

 

I --

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a burden on 

   

  

 

 

constitutional right, in other words, because people of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a certain religious status are being prevented from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competing in the same way everybody else is for a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neutral benefit. 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, this -- this is -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not like McDaniel where someone is being barred from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participating in -- in the life of the -- the community. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is a -- kind of the opposite of that.  It is not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like the -- what we have in Locke, in the sense that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that here we have -- we -- we really have a -- a direct 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment to a church.

50 

your question, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

            

sorry. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Cortman -- I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Layton, I'm -- I'm -- I know the Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is very grateful that you took up the request of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Missouri Attorney General to defend the old position, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I -- I am worried about the, if not the mootness, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the adversity in this case.  If the Attorney General is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in favor of the position that your adversary is taking, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't his appointment of you creating adversity that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't exist? 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, I don't know the answer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to that -- that, but let me -- let me give some of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual background here. 

 

 

            

The Attorney General himself is recused 

 

 

 

 

 

because he actually appears on one of the briefs on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side.  The first assistant in this instance is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Acting Attorney General, and the Acting Attorney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

General, at a time before governor -- the governor gave 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his new instruction, asked me to defend the position, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because at that point, it was still the position of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State, and was not being disavowed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

question.  It doesn't appear to be the position of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

State right now.  Reading through the lines of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

Acting Attorney General to us, it doesn't appear that he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believes that you're taking the right position. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  So -- so let me talk about what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has happened and what -- what happens next. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

After the governor did -- made his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

announcement, the director, who is my client here, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact, put up on her website the 2017 application and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2017 instructions, in which she largely tracked the 2016 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and prior ones, including 2012 that the Court has, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eliminated all reference to churches, religious 

 

 

 

 

 

instruction; all of those were eliminated. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's all I know about what she intends to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

do, because I don't represent her with regard to that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm asking a simple 

   

  

 

 

question.  If she -- if the State and she as the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representative of the State are not willing to fight 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, are they manufacturing adversity by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appointing you? 

 

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  So -- well --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we have no adversity, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't this case become mooted? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  So let me -- let me tell you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what happens next if the director actually grants --

issues a grant to a church. 

   

   

 

52 

            

If she does, then under Missouri's liberal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taxpayer standing rules, someone can then sue and say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are violating the State constitution.  And if there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a determination that -- that she was filing in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State constitution, then the question before the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court today would have to be answered. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right. 

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- do you agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this -- this Court's voluntary cessation policies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply to the mootness question? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  I agree that they can apply to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  It's not a perfect fit compared to some of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedents, but -- but certainly there is no assurance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that four years from now, with a change of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

administration, or at some point in the interim through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a taxpayer standing suit, that there wouldn't be a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change back to the prior practice. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Mr. Layton, I'm struggling 

  

 

 

 

 

still to understand Justice Kagan's question, the answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to it. 

 

            

How is it that discrimination on the basis 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of religious exercise is better in selective government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

programs than general programs, first? 

 

 

 

 

            

And second, how do we tell the difference

between the two, if that's the line we're going to draw? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53 

            

The tours, isn't it selective based on who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can show up at the Capitol and afford to do that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Public benefit programs, aren't they often selective if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you meet criteria?  Copyright laws?  You have to have an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original work, things like that.  What do we do about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those problems? 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, I -- I still maintain my 

   

   

  

 

 

 

position that when we have a -- a -- a case where it is 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a selective program that is publicly announced, publicly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visible, that that is different from these other kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

programs. 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  But how do we draw the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

line between selective and general?  One -- one could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to play with that line forever. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, one could, just like the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest of the lines in this case.  We don't get a -- a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine line --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, discrimination on 

  

 

 

 

the basis of status of religion, there's no -- no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line-drawing problem there.  We know that's happened in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, right? 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  We do know that the decision 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here was made because it was a church.  And assuming 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what "status" means, then I -- I suppose we -- we 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

know that.  I mean, that's true. 

    

 

 

 

54 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If you -- if you make that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the line, selective versus universal, if you like, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can reproduce the same problems.  Volunteer fire 

  

 

 

 

 

 

departments, most places that the State give grants to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upgrade -- upgrade.  We don't have enough money, so we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a selection. 

   

            

Same with police.  You have crossing guards. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

You know, you have dangerous intersections.  There are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

crossing guards.  We have grants to help the schools pay 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the children. 

 

 

            

Do the same thing with health of children. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You know, I can do that.  That's what I see as a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficulty, we choose your line there, and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proliferate litigation forever. 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  I -- let me make --

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  In areas that are critical, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

like police, fire, health. 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Police, fire, and health, when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they are universal.  But you gave the crossing guard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, I --

   

  

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  -- and in Missouri, that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not -- that's not universal. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course.  That's my

problem.  I can reproduce programs in the State that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem absolutely necessary for police protection, fire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection, health of children.  And it seems like an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrelevant factor, whether they're just open to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody to apply and you automatically get it, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether you have criteria and are selected because you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a limited amount of money.  And you want to make 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that line the --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- constitutional line on 

  

 

 

 

 

Free Exercise?  I'm afraid of that one.  Now, I put that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

out, so you can reply. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, the -- and -- and the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer would be that the line is some combination.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I can't give you a bright line, because you're 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejecting the bright line that we have.  Some kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

combination of the endorsement problems with 

 

 

 

 

 

selectivity, and the entanglement problems that come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when we're dealing with grant programs that actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect the physical plant of a church and how that plant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is used in a preschool or otherwise. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

There is no way for the State to comply with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- its determination, maybe the requirement, that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police the use of the funds and what the funds here put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on there without becoming involved with the church. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

There's a statement in the -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

56 

Appellant's brief that says that the church is told that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it can't participate in the life of the community, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Trinity wants is to have the community participate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the life of the church.  And that is anathema to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of basic doctrines that we get out of the founding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

era that provided for a division --

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Imagine, why would it be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on the basis of a physical plant, as opposed to, say, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personnel or nonphysical grant money? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LAYTON:  Why -- why wouldn't what be? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Now the line is moving. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Now it's apparently on the basis of whether we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

granting the money to physical plant or to some other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose.  What is that --

  

 

 

 

            

MR. LAYTON:  Well, no, I -- I'm saying that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the physical plant is our case, because the physical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plant is a -- a -- an improvement to the church property 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the church will use and may use for actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proselytizing and not just use it for religious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activities. 

            

And wherever the line is, that ought to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the other side of the line, just like wherever the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line is, writing a check that says payable to Trinity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lutheran Church ought to be on the other side of the

Thank you.

remaining. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

  

 

 

 

Mr. Cortman, you have three minutes 

 

 

 

 

 

          

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. CORTMAN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. CORTMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Just three points in rebuttal. 

 

 

 

 

            

First of all, as to the endorsement problem, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think the neutral government criteria here take care 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the endorsement problem.  So when you have this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competitive grant that you have to fill out this -- this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretty complicated application, 16 neutral criteria, 

 

 

 

 

 

there is no endorsement of religion.  I think the free 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speech cases give a good analogue to that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Number 2, as far as the selective or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

universal government benefit program, I don't think that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is really the test here.  And the reason, as Your Honors 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mention, if this was open to all schools, and it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

universal, they still would be prohibited from giving a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grant to a religious organization.  So whether it's a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

narrow class of all non-for-profits, or a broader class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of all schools, they would still not be able to fund

based on their constitution. 

 

 

 

58 

            

And lastly, as we talk about entanglement, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is not an entanglement issue.  Entanglement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

generally is an ongoing, intrusive surveillance.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not a one-time grant where you have to show a receipt 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the expense to receive the reimbursement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

time. 

            

If there are no other questions, I yield my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted.
