CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-1238, Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League


and Missouri Municipal League against Southwestern Bell.


Mr. Feldman.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS


MR. FELDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case concerns 47 U.S.C., section 253(a)


which preempts State laws that prohibit or have the effect


of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide


telecommunications services. 


Now, it's common ground that section 253(a)


preempts State laws that keep private firms from the


telecommunications market.  The question presented is


whether the law also reaches into the structure of State


government and invalidating even a State statute that


declines to grant the State's political subdivisions the


authority to provide telecommunications.


In Gregory against Ashcroft, this Court held


that Federal statutes should not be construed to intrude


on core areas of State sovereignty unless Congress has


made its intent to do so clear.

 Now, in our tradition, political subdivisions


are creatures of the State and they have the authority and


only the authority that the State has granted them.  Under


respondents' interpretation, section 253(a) would be a


sharp and unprecedented break with that tradition because


it would be a grant of power by the Federal Government to


political subdivisions of powers that the State, which was


hitherto the sole source of their authority --


QUESTION:  I don't think that's right.  It


wouldn't be a grant of power.  It would be -- it would


preserve power granted by the State itself.


MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I don't -- I'm not even sure


whether that's true.  That actually goes into another


difficulty in construing the statute the way the court of 

appeals did.  Some States create their political


subdivisions or some political subdivisions and say you


have only the authority that we have given you, and it's


not -- other States create political subdivisions and say


you have any authority you want except --


QUESTION:  The only -- the only thing I question


is your statement that the statute itself is a grant of


power to a local entity.  It doesn't grant any power to


anybody.  The statute doesn't. 


MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I think --


QUESTION:  It preserves power from being

preempted.


MR. FELDMAN:  Well, perhaps it's a question of


semantics, but --


QUESTION:  It is. 


MR. FELDMAN:  -- but -- but the -- but the --


the issue here is that in Missouri political subdivisions


do not have the authority to provide telecommunications


services.  Under the court of appeals' ruling, the statute


that -- that reaches that result is preempted, and


therefore they do have that authority.  In any event, that


would be a sharp break with the tradition that because it


would be Congress specifying what the authority of a


political subdivision is even when a State has chosen not


to give it that authority. 


QUESTION:  Is it your view that in all instances


we must interpret this statute so that any entity -- that


phrase -- does not include a local subdivision of the


State?


MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, because under the Gregory


rule, if you -- if the Court were to construe the statute


so that it did include political subdivisions, it would be


a intrusion into State sovereignty.


QUESTION:  It would be under the circumstances


of this case.  Are there other circumstances in which it


would not intrude on the right of the State to allocate

powers between itself and the localities so that this


statute -- so that this interpretation would have an


effect in some other instance?


MR. FELDMAN:  The other -- I can't imagine cases


-- and I'm not aware that any have come up in the cases


that have addressed the -- the question presented here --


where there are some other restriction that a State has


passed that has nothing to do with political subdivisions. 


And the question might arise whether a political


subdivision could challenge that -- that provision of


State law as well as a private party.


And -- but, however, since the Court is in the


business here of construing the statute and the question


is what is the meaning of the word any entity, I think 

under the Gregory rule, that -- that term has to exclude


political subdivisions.  And if it excludes it here, I


think it -- there's no --


QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, do we need to apply the


clear statement rule of Gregory v. Ashcroft for you to


prevail?


MR. FELDMAN:  I think it's our understanding --


it's our understanding that the rule would apply here.  I


guess the rule applies for the reasons I've already given,


which is this is an intrusion on State sovereignty.  If


that were not the case, the question would be whether a

general term like the term, any entity, is whether that


would just naturally be construed to extend so far or


whether it wouldn't. 


QUESTION:  Exactly.


MR. FELDMAN:  And I would say that it raises the


question that I was -- the -- the problem that I was


referring to before in responding to Justice Stevens,


which is State -- the application of 253(a) would depend


on the form in which a State chooses to give or not give


its power to its political subdivisions.  If it was a


State -- a home rule State where the cities have all the


powers except what's expressly denied them, then a State


that tried to pull back the power to provide


telecommunications -- that would be preempted.  In another


State --


QUESTION:  Are those home rule States


established in that fashion by the State constitutions?


MR. FELDMAN:  I think so sometimes. 


QUESTION:  In which case the language of section


253(a) which says no State or local statute or regulation


or other State or local legal requirement may prohibit or


have the effect of prohibiting.  I'm not sure that -- that


would reach a constitutional question. 


MR. FELDMAN:  It would at least be a difficult


question to try to figure out whether there is still

something that prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting


rather than something which just never granted the


authority before.  You could consider a political


subdivision of a State that's a special purpose water


district or fire prevention district that just doesn't


have the authority, was never intended to have the


authority, and nothing in State law suggests that it


should have the authority to provide telecommunications. 


It would be hard to find something that should be


preempted in that case.


QUESTION:  Suppose you didn't give that very


broad meaning to any entity, but you included State


entities that had been in the business and were otherwise


authorized by State law to go into this business and then 

the State changes its law and without having a section (b)


requirement, because you have loads of power under section


(b), so we assume the entity meets section (b)'s test, but


it passes another law which says, by the way, the


municipality can't go into it.  And previously they had. 


So -- so we're not -- we're -- we're talking about only


entities that have proved themselves fit, willing, and


able to offer the -- the -- to offer the business. 


MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I don't --


QUESTION:  Now, why -- why would that not be


included?

 MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I don't think it -- because I


-- I think that there is -- it's very difficult to imagine


that Congress intended that the -- the scope of this


statute should turn on the exact historical steps --


QUESTION:  No, no.


MR. FELDMAN:  -- that they once had or --


QUESTION:  But what we want -- we want -- we


have implicitly there and it would be necessary in the


State case but not in the private entity case an entity


that is fit, willing, and able.  And -- and an entity that


is fit, willing, and able can include a municipality.  So


what this statute is after is the State passing a new law


changing the status of an entity that was previously fit,


willing, and able. 


MR. FELDMAN:  But I guess what I was responding


to was it's not -- the -- the definition of what a


political subdivision is fit, willing, and able to do is


something that -- it is a creature of State law.  It's


defined by State law, by the State laws that have --


QUESTION:  That -- that's correct, but it's


defined by State regulatory law in respect to those


entities at least that have previously offered the


business. 


MR. FELDMAN:  I think there's actually very few


-- before 1996, I think there were very few -- and I'm not

aware of examples.  There may be a few in the amicus


briefs.  There are very, very few entities in this country


of these political subdivisions that offered


telecommunications services.  This is a question that has


only arisen --


QUESTION:  You see, in other words, but your


argument here is coming down to the difficulty of trying


to draw the distinction I'm suggesting.


MR. FELDMAN:  I think that -- I think part of my


argument is the difficulty of drawing that distinction,


but the most important part of it is that this is an


intrusion into a State's understanding of its government


and what it wants to do with its authority.  And where a


State --


QUESTION:  If the -- if the statute were clear,


if it said public -- it said any entity, public or private


-- but you're -- you're making an argument now that seems


to say no matter how clear this was, there would still be


a vulnerability.


MR. FELDMAN:  No.  I don't -- I don't think so. 


I think there would be interpretive problems that would


arise in the statute if it had said -- specified any


public -- any governmental entity or something like that


that really would have clearly referred to States and


political subdivisions.

 QUESTION:  Well, wouldn't -- wouldn't any --


MR. FELDMAN:  That would have been --


QUESTION:  -- any entity, public or private,


wouldn't that do? 


MR. FELDMAN:  I think it's likely that that


would do.  The problem here is that any entity is just the


kind of general term without the -- the reference to


public or private or without specific references to State


governments and political subdivisions.  It's just the


kind of general term that this Court referred to in Raygor


and said that where there's a clear statement rule, that


kind of general term is not sufficient to overcome it. 


And here, there's nothing in the statute that suggests


that Congress thought about, considered, and intended to 

put into question the issue of State sovereignty that


would be -- that -- the intrusion on State sovereignty


that would be raised by construing 253(a) the way the


court of appeals did. 


Beyond the statute itself, in the legislative


history there's -- there is a -- the committee report


repeatedly refers to the private sector deployment of


advanced telecommunications as what the bill is designed


to achieve.  Not only that, the floor debates -- they're


cited in, I think, Southwestern Bell's reply brief -- show


also people consistently referring to the private sector

development of advanced telecommunications.


QUESTION:  May I ask you --


QUESTION:  Isn't it also the case --


QUESTION:  May I ask you this one more sort of


general question?  As I understand your theory, you read


the statute as an anti-monopoly statute.  No State shall


grant any exclusive privilege.  Isn't that -- you say


that's really what it does.  And my question is if that


were the purpose, why wouldn't they write it that way that


no State shall grant a monopoly or grant exclusive


privilege?


MR. FELDMAN:  It actually is broader than that. 


There is another provision which says -- I don't remember


the number -- which says that there can't be exclusive 

franchises.  This is intended to get at laws not only that


would by terms give an exclusive franchise or keep a


particular company out of the telecommunications business,


but also that would have the effect of doing that by


imposing high taxes on one category of -- of participants


rather than on another category.  There -- there's the --


in fact, in the Texas case that came before this, the


Federal Communications Commission found a couple of


provisions of Texas law preempted because they did just


that.


And the statute was designed -- it is an anti-

monopoly law, but it is a little bit broader than just


granting exclusive franchises.  It's also favoring one --


at one -- one company or one class of company or the


incumbent telephone company over other new entrants into


the field.


Respondents cite the -- Lead-Deadwood case as


the closest that they can come to this, and I'd just like


to point out that that case has a dramatically different


question than the one here.  In that case, there was no


question of the Federal Government giving authority to


local -- to political subdivisions that the State itself


had not -- had not given.  That case would be much closer


to this case if, for example, the State there had said we


don't want our political subdivisions to be providing 

education because we do that at the State level, and then


the political subdivision had taken the Federal money that


was at issue there and said we want to open up a local


university or something.  At least that would have


presented the question that's presented here of an


intrusion of that sort on State sovereignty, but that


wasn't before the Court there and therefore the Court


didn't apply a clear statement rule.


QUESTION:  What is the United States' position


about utilities, public utilities, electric companies?


MR. FELDMAN:  I'm not sure what you mean.  If

you mean by public utilities companies that are in the


business --


QUESTION:  To enter this business. 


MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, they certainly can. 


Privately owned companies that are in the utility


business --


QUESTION:  Suppose it -- suppose it's mixed


ownership, city and private.


MR. FELDMAN:  The Federal Communications


Commission's position is if, under State law, it's treated


as a private entity, the fact that stock, some or even all


of the stock, is owned by the political subdivision


wouldn't be -- it would still be an entity.  It would be


-- if it's treated under State law as a private company. 

In this case, the FCC looked at Missouri law and


determined, I think, correctly -- it hasn't been


challenged here -- that this is simply a law that prevents


political subdivisions as political subdivisions from


providing telecommunications services, and therefore,


since it's really operating on the political subdivision


itself and not on some other corporation, it's not


preempted.


I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Feldman.


Mr. Molteni, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MOLTENI


ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER NIXON


MR. MOLTENI:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:


The Eighth Circuit interprets entity to include


political subdivisions of the States, and that would mean


that Congress has -- it would have the effect of Congress


giving Missouri's political subdivisions authority that


the -- the very State that created them has withheld.  And


that would intrude drastically on the structure of State


government. 


A general language term like entity is too broad


to meet the Gregory test because it doesn't clearly and


unmistakably include State subdivisions.  If -- if the


general term entity, without a contextual compass, as it


appears in 253(a), satisfies the clear and unmistakable


test, then clear and unmistakable really has little


meaning.


But that standard is important to the States


because it gives the States some notice and opportunity to


react to proposed legislation that may intrude on State


sovereignty, and it requires Congress to be clear in the


wording that it uses and to demonstrate cognizance of the


impact of legislation on State sovereignty.


QUESTION:  Why isn't any entity clear?  I mean,

what --


MR. MOLTENI:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  What do they have to say to make any


-- any entity clear?  Paren, and we really mean it?


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Or it has to say any entity


whatsoever?  Would that be clear?


MR. MOLTENI:  Justice Scalia, there are no magic


words, and we're not asserting that there are magic words


that need to be there.  There has to be some terminology


within the statute that -- that demonstrates that Congress


was cognizant it intended to intrude on State government. 


There are other instances -- and I think Southwestern


Bell's brief does a nice job pointing out that entity is 

used 600-and-some times in various statutes.  It's used


multiple times even in the Telecommunications Act,


oftentimes with a modifier, sometimes without, and


oftentimes with a definition, and sometimes the definition


is one -- it includes just a business context, and


sometimes the definition is one that includes government


and public and State, private, political --


QUESTION:  But it's perfectly clear that this


statute does intrude substantially on the -- on the


State's ability to regulate.  Just even if it just does


what you say, it's a significant impairment of the State's

impact commerce.

Gregory v. Ashcroft case that Congress has to use more


than the general language.  It has to be clear and


unmistakable.


And, Justice Stevens, in -- in the -- the


Leadwood case that -- that Mr. Feldman brought up, your --


the dissent that -- that you wrote affirms some of the


principles that -- that we've cited in our brief regarding


Hunter and -- and the City of Trenton case that the States 

control the -- the creations that they have, that they've


made, all their political subdivisions, and -- and that is


-- is something that this Court has always honored.


QUESTION:  You're saying that it's one thing for


the Federal Government to supersede State regulation


substantively, but another thing to say -- to tell the


State not only do we do that, but we're going to change


the relationship you have with your local subdivisions.


MR. MOLTENI:  That's exactly right, Mr. Chief


Justice.  That's exactly right.


QUESTION:  Suppose they -- they did -- is it

totally Ashcroft you're relying on?  Gregory v. Ashcroft?


The -- suppose you looked at the statute as


saying it doesn't prohibit States from enacting all kinds


of laws that have the effect of prohibiting people to


enter the business.  Tax laws, for example, might leave


them without money to do it.  It's only talking about


specific laws aimed at saying you can't enter.  And if


it's aimed at specific laws saying you can't enter this


business, then couldn't you say where a State's entity


otherwise would have the authority to enter, then the


State cannot pass a law that says in those circumstances


you cannot enter telecommunications such as municipality


as well as private company? 


Now, what's wrong with that interpretation? 

What I'm doing is I'm trying to deal with what I thought


of myself and they confirm is the major objection that


this can't be administered once we start down the path I'm


just starting down.


MR. MOLTENI:  Justice Breyer, I think it would


create an anomalous situation where if a State's political


subdivisions had been providing telecommunications prior


to 1996, they would be treated differently under the --


under 253(a).


QUESTION:  No, no.  It would be -- the question


would be whether they had the authority to do it.  If they

had the authority to do it, then the State -- what it


could not do is it could not pass a law which aims at


primarily -- aims at primarily their authority to enter


telecommunications.  They could do all kinds of other


things including removing authority as long as it were


general, and then there would be middle cases where the


authority, you see, is --


MR. MOLTENI:  But I -- I still think, Justice


Breyer, that what that does is it make -- it divides the


States into two categories and makes the Federal statute


treat the States in two different ways so that if a State


had granted authority prior to 1996, the -- they -- they


may never -- that State is never allowed to change its


mind about --


QUESTION:  It's a one-way ratchet.


MR. MOLTENI:  -- about the scope of authority


that it grants its own political subdivisions.


QUESTION:  I -- I suppose it would also allow


States to adopt a -- a system of chartering corporations


which charters the corporations according to various


categories, mining, manufacturing, and it just does not


happen to name the category of telecommunications.  And


that would not be touched by -- by this type of an


interpretation enabling the State to create a monopoly --


well, to -- to exclude any -- any telecommunication

company.


MR. MOLTENI:  Justice Scalia, I believe that I


agree with you, although I think the more and more we talk


about what States authorize and don't authorize their


political subdivisions do -- to do, the more and more that


becomes really the -- a State issue and -- and really what


I -- what I would call an intramural issue that would --


that would be a matter litigated between the States and


their political subdivisions at the State court level. 


And what -- what I really think this case is about is an


application of 253(a) that, because of the general


language that -- that Congress used, won't be presumed and


cannot meet the clear and unmistakable standard in Gregory


to -- to allow or at least have the effect of -- of


Congress' intruding into the structure of State


government. 


QUESTION:  So suppose that a State says that no


political subdivision in this State shall have the


telecommunications facility that does interactive


television unless the carrier that it contracts with pays


the city a fee of $1 million.  Could the State do that?


MR. MOLTENI:  I believe --


QUESTION:  And you'd say -- in other words, it's


conditioning the ability of its subdivisions to engage in


this by demanding that it extract certain financial

consideration, and suppose that this is prohibitive.


MR. MOLTENI:  If -- if the State were addressing


that in terms -- through the private sector, I don't think


there would be -- I'm not sure I understand exactly where


your question is going, Justice Kennedy.  But the -- could


-- the State can't create barriers to entry to private


sector competitors.


QUESTION:  Well, suppose -- suppose --


MR. MOLTENI:  That's clearly preempted by the


Commerce Clause and -- and it's prevented specifically by


253(a). 


And I think what -- what that derives from, if


one looks at the purpose of the Federal Telecommunications


Act of 1996 and you look at the -- the history of what was 

going on, huge swatches of the country were provided


service by regional Bell operating companies and they were


granted the exclusive franchise in -- in areas.  And the


whole purpose of the '96 act was to accelerate private


sector deployment and -- and to -- to take these -- these


swatches of territory that regional Bell operating


companies maintained monopolies on and encourage private


sector deployment and people would come in and utilize


either those -- the -- the facilities that -- that were


provided -- that -- that exist that the regional Bell


operating companies had or unbundle network elements or to

-- to resell and -- and hopefully even the encouragement


of -- of building their own facilities base.


But that's all -- that all ends up being a red


herring discussion in terms of the clear language of


253(a) because 253(a) uses those general terms.


Now, the FCC's reading of entity won't bar


States from entering commercial phone business through


their -- through their political subdivisions because the


FCC's reading allows that States who want to go into the


phone business -- they'll be able to do that.  But States


like Missouri that want their political subdivisions


focused on core missions will be able to make that choice


if this Court allows the FCC's reading.


QUESTION: 


Do we know how many States allow 

their municipalities to enter this business? 


MR. MOLTENI:  How many States allow their own --


QUESTION:  Yes.  In other words, you're arguing


for a position it's up to the State.  They can let the


municipalities enter or not if they choose.  So in -- in


fact, what has happened across the country?


MR. MOLTENI:  Justice Ginsburg, I -- I do not


know that.  I have not surveyed which States allow their


political subdivisions to -- to enter the commercial phone


business and -- and which, like Missouri, have made that


choice to have -- made the choice to have their -- their

political subdivisions focus on their core missions.


Another problem that's created with the


respondents' reading of -- of entity is that it literally


means the State cannot regulate itself, and that -- that


creates an anomaly and -- and it doesn't make a lot of


linguistic sense or a lot of public policy sense.


The clear and unmistakable standard requires


more of Congress than this use of general language and


where there is doubt, States are entitled to the benefit


of that doubt.


If the Court has no further questions, Missouri


would respectfully request that the Court reverse the


Eighth Circuit and preserve the ability of the State of


Missouri to determine the functions of its own political 

subdivisions.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Molteni.


Mr. Strauss, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. STRAUSS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Our position in this case is straightforward and


I can state it very simply.  Gregory against Ashcroft


applies in circumstances where the statutory language is


ambiguous.  The Court has said that three times, including


24

in Gregory itself.  And the language of 253(a), any


entity, is not ambiguous.  It's not -- it's not as if


Congress had said, for example, any corporation, which


might leave some doubt whether Congress meant only private


corporations and not municipal corporations.


QUESTION:  But it doesn't mean any fish, for


example.  I mean, there are a lot of things it doesn't


mean.


MR. STRAUSS:  I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't -- I


guess it doesn't mean any fish, Justice Breyer, but of the


-- I think it has a very broad meaning.  I think it means


any entity and --


QUESTION:  When you -- when you say the statute


has to be ambiguous, the Gregory rule as put forth in the 

opinion is that there has to be a clear statement covering


the Federal -- Federal aspect of the thing.  And it seems


to me that that cuts away from the idea it has to be


ambiguous.


MR. STRAUSS:  What the Court -- the Court said


in Gregory that the statute has to be ambiguous and it


reiterated that in Salinas and more recently in Yeskey.


QUESTION:  It depends on what you mean by -- by


ambiguous.  What -- what -- the -- the language in Gregory


was -- was employees, wasn't it?


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, the unambiguous language in

Gregory was employee.  The ambiguous language was at the


policymaking level.  In Gregory itself -- it's a -- it's


an important point, Justice Scalia.  In Gregory itself,


the Court thought it was unambiguous that employee, State


employee, included State judges.  Now, it seems to me


linguistically to say that State employee includes State


judges is more of a stretch than saying any entity


includes local governments, but that's what --


QUESTION:  In your view does --


QUESTION:  Of course, you're -- you're into


State already.  I mean, the -- the State versus non-State


was not at issue in Gregory.  It was just how far into the


State you go.  I mean, it -- the whole thing applied to


State -- State employees, but not at the policymaking 

level.


What about Atascadero?  The -- the language


there was any recipient of Federal assistance.


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes.  Atascadero, Justice Scalia,


I think the Court has applied a different, stronger, much


stronger, form of a clear statement rule in the State


sovereign immunity cases where it has required specificity


in the Court's words.


QUESTION:  I think there are various levels of


-- of clear statement rules.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, I think the -- the best

illustration of that is the contrast between the Court's


decision in Raygor and the Court's decision in Jinks which


have the advantage of focusing on exactly the same


statutory language, any claim asserted in a supplemental


jurisdiction statute.  In Raygor, the issue was whether


that language overrode State sovereign immunity, and the


Court said no.  In Jinks, the question was whether that


language overrode a State's decision to immunize its


subdivisions, and the Court said, yes, it did.  The same


language.


Jinks is the case like this.  In fact, Jinks is


more of an intrusion because the Congress was taking away


a power that the State wanted to confer and the locality


wanted to have, and the Court just very unanimously and 

with no difficulty said Congress can do that with the


language, any claim asserted.  Raygor was a State


sovereign immunity question.  The Court analyzed it


differently.


And I think that makes the point that the kind


of rigor the Court expected in cases like Atascadero does


not apply in Gregory cases.  In Gregory cases, if it's


unambiguous, that's the end of the case.


QUESTION:  Does the word, any entity, cover the


State itself?


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes, I think it covers the State

itself.


QUESTION:  So if the Governor is about to sign a


contract to -- to allow the State to enter into


communications facilities and the legislature instructs


him not to, that statute is void?


MR. STRAUSS:  No, that statute is not void,


Justice Kennedy.  I think that statute -- analytically


that situation is exactly the same as if a board of


directors of a private corporation decided not to go into


the telecommunications business and the CEO defied it. 


And the solution is the State can say under our neutral


principles of corporate governance, the CEO can't do that


not because the corporation is not an entity.


QUESTION: 


Why don't neutral principles of 

corporate governance apply to the relations between the


State and its subdivisions?


MR. STRAUSS:  They --


QUESTION:  Suppose there's a constitutional


provision. 


MR. STRAUSS:  They absolutely do if they are


truly neutral principles.  If it's a provision of State


law that says, for example, subdivisions may not engage in


any commercial activity and there's no argument that


that's just a subterfuge to keep them out of


telecommunications, it's a truly neutral provision, States

can absolutely enforce that. 


QUESTION:  But you say that it can't be made


precise to telecommunications.


MR. STRAUSS:  That's right.


QUESTION:  That was my example in the State


hypothetical, in the first hypothetical. 


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, the -- what's -- what's


operating there is the general rule that Governors have to


do what the State legislature tells them to do.


QUESTION:  Well, here it was operating as a


general rule that subdivisions have to do what the State


tells them to.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, when this --


QUESTION: 


I don't see why the general rule 

applies in one instance and not the other, given your


definition of entity.


MR. STRAUSS:  Because in the -- in the case like


this one, what the State has done is to enact a specific,


targeted rule not competitively neutral -- that issue is,


strictly speaking, not before the Court yet -- a targeted


rule that keeps an entity out of the telecommunications


business.  And a municipality is an entity in the same way


that a private firm is an entity.  Congress' language was


any entity.  That language is simply not --


QUESTION:  Yes, but Raygor had any entity too

and we said that was not conclusive there.


MR. STRAUSS:  Raygor said any claim.  That's


right.  That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.  But Raygor was a


case decided in the shadow of State sovereign immunity. 


The Court said a constitutional doubt was created by


principles of State sovereign immunity. 


As I -- as I said to Justice Scalia, Jinks


interpreted exactly the same language, any claim, to be


sufficient to allow Congress to deprive local governments


of an immunity that States wanted to grant them.


QUESTION:  Well, that was not the only


difference. 


QUESTION:  No.


QUESTION: 


I mean, there were other factors in 

Jinks besides -- besides just the language, any claim.


QUESTION:  And also the fact that sovereign


immunity had never extended -- a State Eleventh Amendment


immunity had never -- had never been extended to counties.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, that's of course right, Mr.


Chief Justice.  And in fact, that is the reason I want to


take exception with the picture painted by petitioners


that what -- our position here would lead to some


dramatic, unprecedented intrusion on State authority.


It's actually quite familiar for Federal law to


interfere, quote/unquote, with the relations between State

and local governments.  Section 1983 imposes liability on


local governments. 


QUESTION:  But those are all under the


Fourteenth Amendment where the Thirteenth -- Fourteenth


Amendment altered the Federal balance with reference to


those.  That's not what's involved here.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, I understand that the


Fourteenth Amendment has special significance for purposes


of State sovereign immunity.  I've never known the Court


to say that the Fourteenth Amendment has special


significance for purposes of Gregory against Ashcroft.  I


don't -- I don't think that -- that is a -- a --


QUESTION:  If -- if for purposes of -- will you


assume with me -- and I may be the only one who thinks 

this.  But I think when you use words like any entity or


the word any, that there's an implicit scope, and since I


think there's an implicit scope, I'm trying to define that


scope.  So I don't want to -- I mean, it's not going to


help me for you to say, well, it's clear because I don't


think it's clear. 


But at that point, I now want to -- to find out


whether -- explore what you said that, well, if we did


apply this to the States and their municipalities, all we


would really be doing is targeting laws. 


Now, I did my best to pose some questions along

those lines, but I was met with the answer which strikes


me as a pretty good answer.  There's just no way to do


what you're suggesting.  It's going to be a nightmare. 


Justice Scalia suggested one reason it was a nightmare. 


And I'd add that in the case of private companies, this


statute is designed to give the private company the right


to enter or the right to quit.  Once you apply it to a


municipal entity, it has the right to enter, but it could


never quit.  Now, that would be bizarre.


MR. STRAUSS:  No. 


QUESTION:  So given the -- the sovereign


immunity -- you know, the sovereign -- all -- all the


things we've been talking about in general, given the


difficulty of drawing a line, which seems virtually 

impossible or very hard, and given the one-way ratchet I


just described, it can't be that Congress intended to


include municipal entities within the scope of the word,


any entity.  What -- what is your -- that's -- I'm trying


to get to the merits.


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes.


QUESTION:  What's your response to that?


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes.  I don't agree that there's a


one-way ratchet at all, Justice Breyer.  I think the --


the purpose of 253(a) is to eliminate barriers to entry. 


It's not to force anyone, private or governmental, to go

into the telecommunications business or stay in the


telecommunications business.  And if a -- if a local


government unit decides of its own accord to enter and


then decides of its own accord to leave, it is not


prohibited anything.


QUESTION:  The State -- the State cannot tell it


not to enter.


MR. STRAUSS:  The State cannot tell it not to


enter by a targeted, non-competitively neutral provision. 


QUESTION:  I don't understand.  Why does it


matter whether it's targeted or not?  Suppose it lists


counties can enter into the following commercial


businesses.  It lists seven or eight.  It does not list


telecommunications. 


MR. STRAUSS:  It -- the reason why it's targeted


-- targeted is what I'm using to embrace the notion stated


in 253(b) which preserves an enormous realm of regulatory


authority to the States.  States may enact competitively


neutral regulations that satisfy certain other criteria. 


And that's an important part of this picture because if


you had 253(a) in isolation, that would -- that would


certainly be draconian.  That would certainly be a -- a


remarkable --


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what's your answer to


the hypothetical I give you?  Is that targeted or not?

 MR. STRAUSS:  Well, I think that would be -- if


it -- if it specified certain commercial activities but


not others, I think that would be a difficult question. 


The question would be is that a gerrymander --


QUESTION:  That's why I asked it.  I mean --


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, the question -- the question


would be a 253(b) question for the FTC in the first -- FCC


in the first instance.


QUESTION:  Well, it had nothing to do with


whether it's competitively neutral.  It's competitively


neutral.  Nobody can enter except these fields.  I mean --


MR. STRAUSS:  If it -- if it were a gerrymander


designed to keep -- really just designed to keep entities


out of telecommunications, it would be unacceptable. 

QUESTION:  So we're going to have to get into


inquiring into whether State legislatures -- well, of


course -- of course, they didn't want it.  It was designed


to keep them out of telecommunications because it said


these are the only fields you can get into.


MR. STRAUSS:  That's -- that --


QUESTION:  If your question is whether it was


designed to keep them out of telecommunications, the


answer is unquestionably yes.


MR. STRAUSS:  This -- I agree --


QUESTION:  But -- but if you say it's okay if

they not only keep them out of telecommunications, but


they keep them out of a lot of other stuff as well, does


that make it okay?


MR. STRAUSS:  This is the question that would


have to come up when the FCC applied 253(b) to a public or


a private entity --


QUESTION:  But why should we --


MR. STRAUSS:  -- public or private.


QUESTION:  Why should we interpret a statute in


that awkward way, that the FCC has to make this kind of


factual inquiry in every case?


MR. STRAUSS:  I think the FCC is in that


business with respect to private entities anyway.  A


State --


QUESTION:  What is the -- I don't even


understand what the factual inquiry is.  What is it --


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, the inquiry --


QUESTION:  -- that the FCC would be looking for?


MR. STRAUSS:  The inquiry -- it's 253(b).  It


says States may enact measures that are competitively


neutral and necessary to promote certain public


objectives.  That's a savings clause.  It's not --


QUESTION:  So the FCC is going to decide what is


necessary to promote --


MR. STRAUSS:  That's --

 QUESTION:  -- Missouri's public objectives?


MR. STRAUSS:  That is the business -- that is


unquestionably the business Congress put the FCC in with


respect to private entities.  There is no disagreement


about that.


QUESTION:  I see the answer to that part, which


is you're saying they have to do it anyway, and I


understand that.  Whether -- I'm not sure I agree, but I


understand it.


What about the part that it's a one-way ratchet? 


And there I think that local governments unlike local


private businesses act through regulation, at least


normally.  And so the statute talks about a requirement, a


local requirement or a local regulation, and therefore, a 

State, State A, that does not permit its municipalities to


go into the business, then passes a statute that does


permit it, then the local council passes a regulation that


says we'll do it, which is now a requirement, and when


either tries to repeal either, they run right straight


into your -- to this statute forbidding it as you


interpret it.  And now, that's why I say it's a one-way


ratchet in respect to municipalities, but not a one-way


ratchet in respect to private businesses. 


MR. STRAUSS:  The reason it's not a one-way


ratchet, Justice Breyer, I think turns on the word

prohibit.  This isn't -- the statute 253(a) says State and


local regulations that prohibit the entry.  If -- if I


decide not to go skiing, I've not prohibited myself from


going skiing.  I've simply made a decision not to do


something.  If a local government decides not to enter the


telecommunications business, it hasn't prohibited itself. 


It simply made a decision. 


QUESTION:  But the State could not repeal the


statute.


MR. STRAUSS:  The State could not repeal the


statute unless it were part of a competitively neutral


reorganization of local government or something like that. 


Then it could repeal it, but it couldn't enter a targeted


repeal of it without running afoul -- it seems to me 

without running afoul --


QUESTION:  Why -- why would Congress design such


a strange system where -- where the municipality can get


in and then get out, but the State can't allow the


municipality to get in and then decide, no, we want to


allow them to get out? 


MR. STRAUSS:  I --


QUESTION:  It's just bizarre.


MR. STRAUSS:  I think it applies -- I think for


these purposes, municipal corporations and private


corporations are simply on a par as, of course, they were

for large parts of our history.  That's why municipalities


don't have many immunities.  And Congress, for these


purposes, simply saw municipal corporations as another


source -- implicitly saw -- and the words, any entity,


implicit in that sense, in the -- in the ordinary meaning


of those words -- saw them as another source of


competition.


QUESTION:  Just so I understand you, a State can


-- can grant certain powers to municipalities, does not


have to grant them the power to enter into -- into


telecommunications activity.  Right?


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes.  Yes, that's right.


QUESTION:  It does not have to grant them that


power.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, the -- the restraint is the


competitively neutral language which will ordinarily allow


municipalities to say -- the States to say, look, here's


what you can do and here's what you can't do --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. STRAUSS:  -- provided they aren't acting in


a way that is competitively non-neutral with respect to


telecommunications.


QUESTION:  Right, but -- but once they have let


them get into telecommunications, it's -- it's only the


municipality that can decide to get out of it.

 MR. STRAUSS:  No.  The State could repeal the


authority if it does it, again, in a competitively neutral


way.  If a State decided, for example, to abolish all


units of local government or if a State decides to say,


okay, we are assigning special functions to municipal


governments. 


QUESTION:  Okay, but -- but the municipality


itself can say we're going to get out of


telecommunications.


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  The State cannot say no -- no


municipality shall do telecommunications.


MR. STRAUSS:  That's right.  The municipality


can decide for itself because then it's not prohibiting 

anyone from doing anything.  It's simply making a


decision. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Strauss, may I go back and ask a


variant on Justice Breyer's question, assuming that there


is some implicit limitation on -- on the scope of any


entity?  And it relates to what, if I have my facts


straight, is the -- is the drafting history in this case,


and I'd like you to tell me whether I have got the facts


straight because I didn't look them up myself.  I just got


this out of the briefs.  And if so, what you think the


significance is.

 As I understand it, at least the Senate version


of the original bill had a provision in it that


affirmative -- expressly provided that any existing


utility, whatever its object of service, could go into the


telecommunications business.  And this, as -- as you point


out at one point in your brief, this would be -- this


would be good for your argument because a lot of those


utilities are municipal utilities.


As I understand it, in the -- in the conference


committee, that language was, in fact, removed entirely,


and subsequent to its removal in the conference committee


report, there were references to any private entity being


able to go into the telecommunications business but not


the old, pre-conference committee references to -- to any 

-- any public as well as private entity.


That suggests to me, the -- the combination of


the drafting change and the conference committee report,


that the implicit scope they were getting at was an


implicit scope that says any entity is a reference to


private, not public.


What -- are my facts straight, and if so, what


-- what's your response to that argument? 


MR. STRAUSS:  Two points, Justice Souter. 


First, I think it is common ground that Congress did


envision utilities as among the any entities.  And the --

the likely reason Congress didn't spell that out was that


it was already included in the notion any entity, and


Congress didn't want to begin spelling out specifics and


run --


QUESTION:  So you say the -- the excision was a


redundancy excision.


MR. STRAUSS:  Yes, that's right.  And I think


there is no dispute that not only that utilities are among


entities, but that Congress really saw utilities as a


primary source of -- of competition.


QUESTION:  Okay.  The answer to that I think is


in -- in part a response to something in your brief.  You


mentioned that the original House and the original Senate


reports were speaking, among others, expressly of -- of 

public entities.  As I understand it -- and again, I


didn't look myself.  I just got this from -- from one of


the briefs.  As I understand it, the conference committee


report -- after this excision, which is arguably just a


redundancy excision, the conference committee report


started using the adjective private entities rather than


public entities as being subject to this kind of universal


preemption.  Doesn't that nix the theory that it was


merely a redundancy excision?


MR. STRAUSS:  The conference committee report, I


believe, Justice Souter, used the word private to describe

-- in describing the sort of competition it believed would


be brought about.  That passage from the conference


committee report was then incorporated almost verbatim in


the preamble to the statute, but the word private was left


out when it was transferred to the statute so that the


word private that does occur prominently in the conference


committee report -- I agree with that -- dropped out of


the statute, which simply talks about encouraging


competition.


QUESTION:  Okay.  What we're left with, it seems


to me, is -- is at least -- maybe let's call it tension


between the conference committee report and the preamble


language which was then inserted.  And isn't that a


perfect situation to provide -- to -- to apply a Gregory 

kind of rule, saying when we're not sure what they meant,


we want them to spell it out more clearly before we


conclude that they, in effect, are -- are limiting the --


the power of a -- of a State to determine what its


municipalities can do?  Isn't this a good situation for a


Gregory rule?


MR. STRAUSS:  I think the ambiguity to which


Gregory refers -- I mean, I don't think.  I mean, I think


it is clear the ambiguities to which Gregory refers is


ambiguity in the statutory language. 


QUESTION:  I -- I think so too.

 MR. STRAUSS:  And --


QUESTION:  And -- and maybe what I'm saying is


we -- we ought to -- those of us who would look into the


-- the legislative history, as I would, maybe ought to


take advantage of a slightly broader Gregory rule.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, the -- the case I think that


would stand in the way more than any other perhaps --


well, many would I think, but the clearest example I can


think of is Yeskey where the -- the question in Yeskey


whether the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act,


applied to inmates of State prisons.  The Court assumed


that prisons were special and that the Gregory rule


applied to legislation that assertedly reached prisons.


The Court also assumed that Congress never 

specifically contemplated that prison inmates would be


covered, and it said, nonetheless, unanimously that if the


language -- the language is something like State


instrumentalities -- if the language included prisons,


Gregory was satisfied.


QUESTION:  Isn't the difference, though -- and I


-- I see your argument.  But isn't the difference that in


that case we didn't have anything in the history either of


the drafting or of the legislative consideration of the


statute that suggested that there really was an -- an


argument each way as -- as to whether they -- they were --

they were intending to -- to cover the -- the prisoners. 


They simply didn't deal with -- with that situation at


all, and they used absolute kind of -- of language. 


Here, there is an argument to be made because


the drafting changed.  The drafting certainly could have


significance for -- for public utilities.  There is a


tension between the -- the conference committee report and


the preamble.  In other words, we've -- we've got a -- a


question sort of affirmatively raised by the history of


the drafting and enactment of the statute, whereas there


was simply silence in the Yeskey situation.


MR. STRAUSS:  Justice Souter, I guess the


difficulty I'd have with that approach in general would be


it has to be common for there to be this sort of


uncertainty in legislative history with feints in a


certain direction and withdrawals for reasons that are


difficult to -- to fathom.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I grant you that, but when


-- when the -- when the issue relates to the kind of State


sovereignty issue that -- that Gregory addresses, that's a


good reason for having a Gregory rule.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, but as to the legislative


history, I think that sort of uncertainty is going to be


easy to generate, and what we do have here -- in addition


to any entity, what we do have here, not just in the

legislative history, but on the face of the statute, is,


as I said, agreement I think all around that utilities are


prominent among the entities that Congress envisioned.  I


think that's completely clear.


QUESTION:  But would you also say that the


legislative history makes it pretty clear that there's a


distinction in meaning between the term private entity on


the one hand and the term entity on the other hand, and


the statute used the term entity?


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, that's true, Justice


Stevens.  Of course, they could have said private entity


had they meant that.  That's not -- I mean, our argument


is any entity means any entity.


QUESTION:  So what does -- what does --


QUESTION:  Is there any argument for putting --


leaving this up to the commission?  That is, can it be


done?  Because I can see a complex interpretation that may


be workable that you're suggesting and may be helpful


competitively, frankly.  And I also can see some good


arguments against, assuming Congress intended that complex


interpretation.  But under those circumstances, maybe


Congress purposely leaves it somewhat ambiguous permitting


the commission to go one way or the other, and although


you've lost it in the commission so far, maybe in the


future, the commission would say, well, we think we want

to Chevronize this, in other words. 


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, I think -- I think that --


QUESTION:  What do you think about that?


MR. STRAUSS:  I think that is the scheme


although not under 253(a).  What the commission -- we know


the commission's views with unusual clarity here.  What


the commission said is we think we've got to say the


statute is not preempted.


But as far as the purposes of the -- of the act


go, this is a terrible State law.  All the purposes the


State wants to be accomplished can be accomplished in less


restrictive ways.  The commission has said that over and


over again as emphatically as it can.


And the way to Chevronize, Justice Breyer, to 

use your term, is by saying that these -- that


municipalities are entities, but that these admittedly


somewhat difficult issues about what special problems do


municipalities pose, those should be handled under 253(b),


which is what Congress had in mind.  That's -- of course,


the States can enact laws so that there can be licensing


requirements and basic fitness requirements and various


kinds of regulation --


QUESTION:  You say -- you say that that's -- I


-- I could -- I could understand that there's no ambiguity


if you simply say any entity means any entity.  But -- but

to say that the statute -- but you're not willing to say


that it says that.  You're not willing to say that -- that


the State cannot prohibit its -- its counties from


entering into commercial activities.  That would certainly


have the effect, which is all this requires -- have the


effect of prohibiting the ability of counties to provide


interstate or intrastate -- you're not willing to say


that.  You -- you insist that we derive this very subtle


distinction between the State initially granting it and


then taking it away or the county taking it away itself. 


I don't think that that is unambiguously within the


statute at all.


What's -- what the unambiguous choices are are


that the States are not included or that the States are


included, and that means that -- that the States cannot


exclude counties or, for that matter, even departments of


the State government itself from entering into the


telecommunications business.  That would be unambiguous. 


But if you're not willing to embrace that, it seems to me


you are arguing that the statute is ambiguous.


MR. STRAUSS:  As -- as to 253(a), Justice


Scalia, I am absolutely embracing that.  I am absolutely


embracing the notion -- and maybe I disagree with Justice


Breyer about this -- that any entity means any entity, and


I will go down the line with that.

 The reason that doesn't lead to absurd results


like the maverick Governor entering the telecommunications


business against the will of the legislature is because of


253(b).  Now, 253(b) is filled with ambiguities and


complexities and -- and problems that the commission will


have to take the first crack at. 


QUESTION:  -- impact upon (a).  You -- you can't


use (b) to explain (a) and then say, oh, yes, (b) is


ambiguous.


MR. STRAUSS:  I --


QUESTION:  If you're using an ambiguous (b) to


explain (a), (a) itself is ambiguous. 


MR. STRAUSS:  (b) does not explain (a).  (a) has


a very -- I agree with you, Justice Scalia.  It has a very


clear meaning.  Any entity means any entity, and if -- it


-- it would trivialize Gregory to say that Congress has to


say, and we mean any entity whatsoever.  Congress has to


come up with a -- a definition.  Any entity means any


entity.


In answer to the charge that that produces


absurd results, I say no.  Congress left a broad scope for


State regulation, broad enough not only to deal with


absurdities, but broad enough so that these claims about


incursions on State sovereignty are, I think, grossly


overstated.

 I mean, let me draw the comparison to Gregory


directly.  In Gregory, Congress passed an anti-


discrimination law, an age discrimination law.  The claim


was that that law required States to give their judges --


their judges life tenure, a major structural issue.  And


the Court said, well, if they had stopped at employees,


maybe they would be giving judges life tenure, but they


said employees at the policymaking level and that's just


too ambiguous for us to think Congress was doing such a


dramatic thing to the structure of State government. 


This is nothing like that.  This -- this statute


simply says that among the universe of entrants that we


want in this robust, wide-open, newly competitive field of


telecommunications, if municipal corporations, true to 

their roots as corporations, want to get into this


business, the States can't keep them out except if they're


doing the kinds of regulation that States can reasonably


do to private and public corporations alike.  That seems


to me not only a coherent reading of the statute, not only


one that is consistent with what everyone agrees is the


very dramatic pro-competitive turn that the 1996


Telecommunications Act took, but also one that really is


not a significant incursion on State sovereignty,


certainly not an unprecedented incursion on State


sovereignty.  When decisions of this Court have held

QUESTION:  It has nothing to do with their


authorities, all of those instances you mentioned.  It has


nothing to do with their authority. 


MR. STRAUSS:  I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.  With


their? 


QUESTION:  Authority under State law.


MR. STRAUSS:  Well, it has to in a sense -- I


agree with you, Justice Scalia, it doesn't.  In a sense,


those are more intrusive because what we have here are


local government bodies who say we want to do this in


order to serve the needs of our citizens.  We don't have a


situation in which Congress is thwarting the will of both


the States and the localities.  We have a situation in


which localities want to do this, in some cases


desperately want to do this, believe that Congress, when

that Congress gave them the power to do it, subject of


course to reasonable regulation by the State, only to find

supposedly designed to ensure that decisions -- that


government decisions are made at a level responsive to the


people -- Gregory against Ashcroft is thrown up as an


obstacle to their doing what they think is needed to serve


their citizens' interests. 


And given what seems to me to be the unambiguous


language of section 253(a) and the very limited


circumscribed focused nature of what Congress has done in


this circumstance, it seems to me to be an unwarranted


conclusion for the -- for the commission to reach.


If the Court has no further questions. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Strauss. 


MR. STRAUSS:  Thank you.

Mr. Feldman, you have 2 minutes 

remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS


MR. FELDMAN:  I'd like to contrast this case


with the Yeskey case, which came up during Mr. Strauss'


argument.  In the Yeskey case, the Americans with


Disabilities Act referred to public entities, I think, and


then it defined them as including any department of the


State.  Once -- that meant that in that act, Congress had


specifically considered that it was going to intrude


deeply, as Justice Scalia said, in State government, and

it had made the decisions of how to do it and the whole --


in fact, title II of the act is designed to -- to tailor


that, exactly how Congress wanted to.


In this statute, there's no indication that


Congress crossed that initial dividing line and wanted --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Strauss points to


subsection (b) of the statute as indicating Congress did


contemplate giving some leeway.


MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, Congress did contemplate


giving some leeway to the States when it was competitively


neutral, but the question of what competitive neutrality


means in this context is not an easy one. 


And -- and I'd like to add that if Congress had


had to take the -- do what it did in Yeskey and -- and 

decide yes, we do want this to apply to the States, it


might have occurred to Congress that they were going to


have to think about exactly what that means, applying a


statute like this to State governments that grant their


political subdivisions different kinds of powers in


different kinds of ways.  Congress didn't -- never made


that first choice that it consciously wanted to intrude on


State -- State sovereignty the way the Eighth Circuit


held, and therefore it never answered those other


questions. 


QUESTION:  What is the rationale for saying a


52

municipal utility, a wholly owned electric company, wholly


owned by the city, that's okay?  That doesn't matter --


the State can't stop that from going into the


telecommunications, but it can stop the municipal


corporation.


MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I mean, that isn't at issue


in this case, but the FCC's rationale is that insofar as


under State law you have a thing that is treated just like


a private corporation, it's -- it's an entity.  That's


exactly who Congress was clearly and directly and most


importantly targeting this law at.  It's -- it's where the


-- if it's a municipally owned utility that is really


treated like the political subdivision of the State, as


they are in Missouri, then that would be different because 

that would raise these other questions, and Congress had


never made the decision that it wants to intrude on --


really in an unprecedented way, on the authority of the


political subdivisions.  States decide to give --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Feldman.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
