 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER P. BURKE 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. BURKE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

 In 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act. 

It made a policy decision to limit judicial discretion 

on a case-by-case basis in the area of reasonable and 

necessary expenses.  It did so by creating a formula 

that entailed an aggregate set amount of expenses for an 

16 

individual. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 Now, Congress could have created this from 

scratch.  It could have used an arbitrary figure.  But 

instead, there were figures that the IRS already had, 

based on Census Bureau statistics, that said nationwide, 

in a certain area, an individual would spend this much a 

month on average. 

 In the case of Mr. Ransom, that's 

24 

approximately 2500 a month.  Forgetting about how it's 

25

divided up, if I had 100 people come in and answer the

following five questions the same way Mr. Ransom did, 

and that's age, location, household size, gross income, 

and if you have a vehicle, how many, they would all get 

a $2500 standard aggregate deduction, which works out to 

$150,000 over a 5-year period. 

 Now, the crux of this is whether or not 

courts are allowed to dig in and cut out pieces of the 

standard aggregate amount. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is that the crux of it? 

Congress made reference to the local standards, right? 

 MR. BURKE:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And were the -- was the 

commentary in the Collection Financial Standards in 

existence at the time when Congress enacted this 

provision? 

 MR. BURKE:  There was a Collection Financial 

Analysis that was in place, and it was noted in 1998 as 

a prior version of the bill that ultimately wasn't 

passed.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And that explains what the 

IRS understands the local standards to mean; isn't that 

right? 

 MR. BURKE:  I would disagree with that.  I 

24 

would say -- well, it would -- it would explain what the 

25

IRS means, but that's where I would end it, because the 

4

IRS standards are used to collect taxes.  They are 

discretionary.  They -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand that, but 

4 

Congress decided to make reference to the local 

5

7

8

9

standards in this bankruptcy provision, didn't it? 

 MR. BURKE:  Standards. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes. 

 MR. BURKE:  It didn't go beyond that. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And this -- and at the time 

10

when it did that, there was official IRS commentary 

11 

regarding the meaning of those standards, correct? 

12

 MR. BURKE:  For the IRS to use in collecting 

13 

taxes. 

14

15

16 

17 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And your argument is that 

Congress intended to adopt the standards promulgated by 

the IRS, but not the IRS's interpretation of the 

standards. 

 MR. BURKE:  Correct, not their methodology 

19 

or interpretation.

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Doesn't the chart say 

21 

"ownership costs"? 

22

23

 MR. BURKE:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you would read that 

24 

to mean non-costs as well?  I mean, if the -- if the 

25

table is called ownership costs, then why not use the 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

IRS's definition of what costs are, and that definition 

says, what, loan payments and lease payments? 

 MR. BURKE:  Because you -- we have to look 

4 

at it as a standard aggregate.  And what I mean by that 

5

6 

7 

8 

9

10

11 

12 

13

is -- okay, the Bankruptcy Code doesn't define ownership 

costs.  And ownership costs could be the replacement 

value.  It could be buying a new vehicle.  It could be 

the costs associated with making payments on a vehicle. 

 What that -- that average number is, in this 

case, $471, is a nationwide figure that somebody would 

spend on average in a month.  It doesn't mean that any 

one individual spends that amount. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Burke, isn't it -­

14 

isn't it the case that, even on the other side's 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21

22 

23 

24

interpretation of it, it doesn't come down to actual 

costs anyway?  Isn't it the case, or do I misunderstand 

it, that so long as there is one payment, you get the 

entire deduction? 

 MR. BURKE:  That's their position, or even 

$1. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even one payment of $1, you 

get the entire deduction.  So to argue this case as 

though it's a question of whether you actually expend 

the money that you're getting the credit for is 

simply -- is simply false.  You don't do that under 

6

either side's interpretation, right?

 (Laughter.) 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Burke, before you 

respond to that question, isn't it so that in the event 

that Justice Scalia just proposed, the trustee could 

propose an amendment to the plan to reflect that that 

cost is no longer being incurred? 

 MR. BURKE:  The cost has never been 

12 

incurred.  That's the point.  And -­

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  My question is:  In the 

14 

situation that Justice Scalia proposed, it's not 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23

automatic that the $471 gets deducted because there 

could be proposed an amendment of the plan to reflect 

that that -- there's no longer any expense for 

ownership. 

 MR. BURKE:  In the situation where there is 

a dollar, of course, an amendment can be made.  But see 

the -- the dollar doesn't show up in the means test. 

The means test is the aggregate -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it isn't -- it isn't 

24 

automatic that because there's one payment, then 

25

forever, the rest of the 5 years, he gets to deduct the

 MR. BURKE:  That's what the lower court

said.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  What -- what 

happens under the tax law?  Do they make an adjustment 

6 

under the tax law as well? 

7

 MR. BURKE:  Of course -- under the tax law, 

8 

you get a standard deduction. 

9

11 

12 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  A standard -­

MR. BURKE:  No different than here.  Nobody 

goes behind the scenes and says, hey, what is that 

standard deduction? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  So that they -­

14 

what is suggested is that you look at it and apply the

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

IRS's approach as to whether you get into the chart, but 

then you don't use the IRS's approach when the trustee 

takes you out of the chart.  Is that what you think is 

the law? 

 MR. BURKE:  No, that's not what I think is 

the law.  What I'm saying is Congress has given, in this 

case, an individual like Jason Ransom $150,000 over 5 

years to spend.  They are not saying whether he actually 

spends it in any one category. 

 For instance, the car ownership might be -­

equate to $28,000 over 5 years.  Rent might be 1,000. 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company

That's 60,000 over 5 years.  Congress did not say go 

back and make sure Mr. Ransom is spending every dollar. 

These are averages across the nation.  And when it comes 

to a car ownership expense, we're not saying spend $471. 

Oh, you have no payment?  You didn't spend anything for 

6 

5 years? 

7

8 

9 

 No.  What it's saying is, over 5 years, I 

have a cost associated with owning that vehicle, whether 

it's a loan or lease payment, whether it's replacing the 

10

vehicle, whether it's major repairs, on average, across 

11 

the country.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You do.  You do, but the 

difficulty that I -- I don't get the answer to 

Justice Ginsburg's first question.

 Of course you have all kinds of costs 

dealing with ownership, but what the IRS says, what it 

says in the statute, is you are supposed to take the 

applicable costs from IRS.  And what it has on page 5a 

is it has something called "ownership costs."

 MR. BURKE:  Correct. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And it defines those as 

22 

$471. 

23

24

25

 MR. BURKE:  Correct. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And then on 3a, where it 

says what ownership costs are, it says the

transportation standards consist of nationwide figures 

for monthly loan or lease payments, referred to as 

ownership costs.  So when I read that, I said ownership 

costs means monthly loan or lease payments, nothing 

else. 

 Now, you have all kinds of other things. 

It's just these words "ownership costs" don't refer to 

those other things, because of that definition given 

right there.  That's what I thought Justice Ginsburg was 

initially asking. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, I was. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And I -- and how -- how do 

you get out of that what I think of as very, very clear 

language which says what these standards refer to?

 MR. BURKE:  Because the standards refer to 

16 

the numbers.  It's a chart. 

17

18 

19 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but it doesn't -- for 

example, suppose you buy a dozen apples every month, and 

they cost you $48 extra.  You're not going to say the 

ownership costs refer to the apples, even if you 

21 

decorate the car with them. 

22

23

24

25

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. BURKE:  What -- what -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, ownership costs 

refers to lease and loan payments.  Nothing else.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the language we're 

dealing with, Mr. Burke?  Do you want to quote the 

language to us? 

 Nobody's quoted the language.  What does it 

say is applicable? 

 MR. BURKE:  What the statute says is the 

applicable -- you shall get, mandatory, the applicable 

amounts specified based on where a debtor resides -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  The -- the 

applicable amounts specified where? 

 MR. BURKE:  In the national local standards. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Read the text of the 

statute, would you, please, for me?  I couldn't even get 

it from your brief.  You had to refer me back to the 

petition.  Why isn't in an appendix to your brief or 

printed in the beginning of your brief, instead of 

kicking me back to dig out your petition? 

 MR. BURKE:  "The debtor's monthly expenses 

19 

shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts 

20

21

specified under the national local standards." 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Amount specified under" 

22 

the standard. 

23

 MR. BURKE:  Specific amount, "applicable" 

24 

modifies "amounts specified."

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Applicable amounts

 MR. BURKE:  Correct, based on where a debtor

individual has to have a debt on a car to get this

deduction -- there's two ways:  One -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Look at the local standard, 

which is on page 8 of the appendix to your brief, right? 

And all it says is "Ownership Costs," "First Car," 

"$471."  That's the relevant text, isn't it? 

 MR. BURKE:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if a person leases a 

13 

car?  Do you think they get ownership costs? 

14

15

16

 MR. BURKE:  Yes, because they get the cost 

whether they owe on it or not. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But they don't own the car, 

17 

so how can they get ownership costs? 

18

 MR. BURKE:  There's a different definition.

"Ownership" doesn't mean -- it can mean possession.

 MR. BURKE:  No.  The Collection Financial

definition that somebody who leases something owns it? 

 MR. BURKE:  I don't.  I'm not sure they do

own it.

it.  It's based on having the item.  It's costs 

associated with having the item, whether it's paid off 

or not. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If somebody rents an 

apartment, do they own the apartment? 

 MR. BURKE:  Probably under ownership, their 

possession is some type of an ownership.  It may be just 

possessory. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there something wrong 

with the IRS saying what they mean?  It says ownership 

costs means monthly loan or lease payments.  Now, is 

there something -­

 MR. BURKE:  No, for the collection of taxes, 

there is not.  But if you're going to use -- start 

digging into the manual, you might as well bring it all 

into 707(b), and, as we discussed earlier, there was 

language that said the collection financial analysis 

should be brought in, but that was deleted in the final 

version. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why not just -- it says 

you are supposed to look at the form; it says ownership 

costs.  So the only thing you'd look at the IRS for 

is -- the manual -- is to define ownership costs.  And 

they say ownership costs means those two things. 

 MR. BURKE:  Well, I don't -- there's no 

reason to limit it.  If you're going to -- the text 

doesn't say -- it says national local standards.  It 

doesn't discriminate or give disparate treatment to that 

one item.  If you're going to give it to one item, then 

it can be pulled in, and it should be -- the same 

treatment should be given to all items, and we should 

21 

have to prove some type of a -­

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't follow that.  If 

the simple thing is to just -- what does the word 

"costs" mean?  And then you look to the IRS manual, and 

it tells you that "costs" means loan or lease payments.

 MR. BURKE:  To collect taxes, that's how 

they defined it.  But in the statute it says you get 

"local standard amounts specified."  It does not stretch 

it and say "under the IRS's interpretation."  That 

language was taken out.  And if we were to use the IRS's 

interpretation, here's the whole problem:  It's 

discretionary.  It goes up and down.  It's based on an 

IRS revenue agent.  It -- let me give you a separate 

example.  Nobody -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Burke, if we could stay 

with this.  The $471 is derived by looking at the 

average loan or lease payments nationwide.  Then, in 

addition to that, we know that the IRS has a separate 

category for operating costs that is meant to reflect 

costs of having a car that are not your loan and lease 

payments.  So, between those two things, why wouldn't we 

say that ownership costs means your loan and lease 

payments, but operating costs means your other costs of 

having a car, and that you get the operating costs if 

you have a car but don't make loan and lease payments, 

and you get the ownership costs if you do make loan and 

lease payments? 

 MR. BURKE:  Because to reach that, you have 

24 

to go into the Internal Revenue Manual.  It's not in the 

25

statute that says you have to owe on it to get it.  And

if you go into the Internal Revenue Manual -- let's look 

at operating expenses.  What it says, in collecting 

taxes -- and it's in the Joint Appendix at pages 83 

through 88.  But what it says, when it comes to local 

national other expenses, an internal revenue agent has 

discretion.  You only get these expenses -- this is the 

overall idea -- if they produce income or if it's for 

health and welfare. 

 And so, when we look at the Joint Appendix 

page 88, section B, under the local standard 

transportation expenses, when it talks about operating 

costs, which is something you just mentioned, it says 

you only get transportation expenses that are used to 

produce income or the health and welfare of an 

individual and their family. 

 Plus, the fact that you own a car, the IRS 

under its discretion can take away the operating costs 

if it's on four cinder blocks in your backyard.  You're 

not incurring fuel costs, mileage costs; you are not 

probably paying registration or any of those other 

operating costs.  The IRS agent, under their manual, can 

take away that expense. 

 So, why stop and say, well, we're just going 

24 

to look at the ownership costs?  And all they're saying 

25

here is if you owe on it, you get it; if you don't owe,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Burke, the -- it's 

unusual to allow a deduction for the purpose of 

calculating disposable income although you don't have 

any expense.  I understand how you get to that 

conclusion with respect to car ownership.  Is there any 

other provision that in -- in calculating disposable 

income, you are allowed a deduction for an expense that 

you don't incur?

expenses.  Is there any other one that works this way? 

It doesn't matter whether you have the expense, in fact. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  For example, Mr. Burke, what 

would happen if you didn't actually have any 

out-of-pocket medical costs?  Could you still claim a 

deduction for out-of-pocket medical costs?

 MR. BURKE:  I'm saying you get all the

deductions, whether you owe on it or not.  Is there a 

specific one besides the car ownership that says you 

have to owe on it?  No.  But my point is -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that the general view 

of the courts?  Is the answer that you just gave 

supported uniformly by the courts that have looked at 

this? 

 MR. BURKE:  There's about 60 published

cases.  They are split almost 50-50, actually more -­

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Even -- in other words, 

11 

even on this point, they are split? 

12

 MR. BURKE:  This is one line that they have 

13 

looked at in the cases.  Basically -­

14

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what 

you're saying.  He asked, are they split 50-50 on the 

16 

point that is before us here?  Yes or no? 

17

18

 MR. BURKE:  Yes, they're about 50-50. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do they apply -- do the 

19 

courts apply the housing and utilities listed amount 

20

whether or not you pay for a house or not, whether or 

21 

not you rent? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. BURKE:  There's two published cases I'm 

aware of, and both allowed it.  One, somebody had 

military housing; one, the house was paid off.  Both 

courts said you get it under the local standards.  But 

18
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

the IRS manual would not give that to you, because under 

the local standards the IRS manual says you get the 

specific amount or your actual payment, whatever is 

less.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, once again, Mr. 

Burke, this is -- I don't know why you don't point this 

out.  This is not the difference between your position 

and the position of the other side.  You get the 

deduction for the other side as well, whether or not you 

are making the payment.  Now, maybe it can be adjusted 

by the trustee, but as far as the statute is concerned, 

so long as you make one payment of $1, under their 

theory you're entitled to claim the deduction; isn't 

that right?

 MR. BURKE:  That's correct. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My question, incidentally, 

about courts was not with reference to the car expense. 

It was with reference to the hypothetical or to the 

issue proposed by one of my colleagues, that said, what 

if you don't -- Justice Kagan -- suppose you don't have 

the medical expense.  And the answer -- and your -- and 

I wanted to know if your answer is supported uniformly 

by the courts that have looked at this, or if there is 

also a split on that point?

much money on food, so he gets the standard deduction.

reason of the Internal Revenue Service -­

reason of the Bankruptcy Code itself?

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. BURKE:  It's by reason of the Bankruptcy 

Code that refers to the standards, and the standards 

specifically say you have one car, no cars, and you get 

a public transportation, or two cars; pick the one.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's in the chart -­

 MR. BURKE:  It's in the chart. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that you claim -- okay. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if you own a car, but 

1

it's completely inoperable and it has no value?  You buy

it for a dollar.  It's a junk car, and you're planning 

possibly to restore it at some point.  Do you get the 

deduction then? 

 MR. BURKE:  Based on a strict reading of the 

14 

code, you get it.

 Now, would the IRS allow it?  Again, that's 

a discretionary standard, but any time you have an 

objective test, there's going to be line-drawing and 

perceived unfairness on the outskirts. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And would your answer be 

the same if the allowance was set, the decree was made, 

and -- and the debtor then went out and bought the 

junker to put in his driveway just in order to get the 

400-plus dollars a month, or would that be deemed an 

evasion of the law that could be addressed by the 

Bankruptcy Court?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What is -- we've got about 

half the courts in the country agreeing with you.  And 

so you've read all those arguments, and what in your 

opinion is the best one on the point, again, where I am 

stuck, which is Justice Ginsburg's original point?  I 

mean, I can think of millions of examples.  You have a 

form that says -- the employer says entertainment 

expenses.  Then it defines entertainment expenses as 

food and transport, and they leave out movies, you know. 

Or you could have vacation expenses, and vacation 

expenses are defined as transport and hotel, and they 

leave out meals.  And here we have a definition of 

ownership expenses, and they say leasing and loaning, 

and they leave out other forms of ownership. 

 MR. BURKE:  Because -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, the argument is, well, 

that's what they mean by it, so that's what applicable. 

Now, what's the best argument against that in those 

50 cases?  Why is it trying -- why to try to get an 

22

expense which isn't loan or lease?  Have you any more 

right to it than if you tried to get an expense to my 

totally irrelevant apples?  I mean, it doesn't fit 

within the applicable definition.  What's the answer?

you look at the form -- the means test is a form.

deduct; is that their approach?  Because we -- you say

attaches to?  Do we use a State common law definition or 

something?  How have they done it?

bunch of variables.  It's not in the Bankruptcy Code.

major repairs; it could be -­

a form that comes off the Department of Justice Website 

which administers the U.S. Trustee's program and that's 

their litigation position. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Burke, if the table 

said loan and lease costs, you wouldn't have a case?  If 

it said -- instead of ownership costs, if it said loan 

and lease costs, then you would sit down and you would 

say I'm not entitled to that deduction? 

 MR. BURKE:  No.  I would say an individual 

who owns a car, whether they owe or not, gets the 

deduction because it's part of this aggregate standard.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Housing. 

 MS. MAYNARD:  Right.  So housing and car 

costs are part of the local standards.  Food, clothing, 

house cleaning supplies, those are part of the national 

standards.  The -- in our view, the text that goes along 

with -- accompanies the tables, which is not the 

Internal Revenue Manual -- it's just the pages reprinted 

at 1a to 3a of our brief.  The Collection Financial 

Standards, the prefatory explanation for what the tables 

mean.  In our view, that is -- goes along with -­

incorporated into the national local standards. 

 The national standards, Justice Sotomayor, 

are allowed, as long as you have under the calculations 

-- as explained in the standards, under the national 

standards, a debtor would receive the allowance in the 

table as long as they have any such expense, so 

regardless of amount.  However, if they have no such 

expense, then they are taken out by the statutory 

language in the means test, which says that the standard 

must be applicable to the debtor.  And -­

though they're not incurring it? 

 MS. MAYNARD:  If they are -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And there are things 

like, you can pay up, you know, have the grocery deliver 

your food every month and you can pay in advance, and if 

you're paid up, you still get the full food expense that 

is allowed?

 MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor.  I think if, 

over the 60-month period looking forward, you know, that 

you're going to -- you've already paid up for your food 

for the next 60 months and you're not going to incur any 

additional food expenses, no, then in that situation the 

standard would be inapplicable to you.  You would be

for this reason, which is that the national standards 

are food, clothing, house cleaning supplies, things that 

you expect every debtor to have.  You don't see much 

litigation about those expenses.  The local standards, 

however, operate differently.  In our view -- and our 

view's different from the government's, Justice Scalia. 

In our view, under the local standards and the way that 

they apply as explained in the Collection Financial 

Standards, is that the debtor is allowed their actual 

expense for the local standard or the amount in the 

table, whichever is less.  So in the hypothetical -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where does it say that? 

 MS. MAYNARD:  In our -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The debtor's monthly 

expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly 

expense amounts specified under the national and local 

standards.  So the national and local standards have 

amounts listed.  Where does it say you take only the 

actual, not the national or local standard?

 MS. MAYNARD:  I read that text, Your 

Honor -- again, the Court doesn't need to decide this 

maximum cap issue to decide this case, because the 

Petitioner has no expense whatsoever, and so it's not 

applicable to him. 

 But in our view, Justice Sotomayor -- in our 

view, you get it from the language of the statute that 

says the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts 

specified under the national standards and local 

standards.  And the way that we understand the national 

and local standards to work is, if you look at page -­

it's explained on page 1a of the petition to our brief, 

the red brief.  Maximum allowance -- it's the third 

paragraph down:  "Maximum allowances for housing and 

utilities and transportation, known as the Local 

Standards, vary by location.  Unlike the National 

Standards, the taxpayer is allowed the amount actually 

spent or the standard, whichever is less." 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's -- but that's 

not what the provision at issue here says.  It says you 

use the amount specified under the national standards, 

and you use actual for everything else.  That's what the 

statute said.  So now you're trying to move the actual 

into the first half of the text?

 MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor, that's not how

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why would you even

is that only actual expenses are -- are what you can 

claim, you wouldn't need the first half. 

 MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, you would, Your Honor, 

because what the -- what the statute's purpose here is 

-- I mean, I think it's helpful to step back. 

 Chapter 13 sends one to chapter 7's means 

test for the purpose of calculating the amounts 

reasonably necessary for the maintenance and support of 

the debtor.  And Congress chose to import the -- the 

methodology of the national standards and local 

standards as a way both to set the categories of 

expenses that debtors could receive payments for, and, 

with the case of the national and local standards, to 

set the amounts.  They were worried about capping upper 

discretion because Congress -- it's quite clear from the 

text and the legislative history -- was concerned about 

above-median-income debtors taking luxurious expense 

21 

amounts. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what you would have 

the statute read is:  The debtor's monthly expenses 

shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts 

specified, as a -- as a maximum.  You would have to add 

31

"maximum" somewhere there. 

Official 

2

3 

4 

5

8

 MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor, because the 

amount under the national standards, as the national 

standards operate, is the -- is an allowance, not an 

actual, and the amount under the local standards, as 

they operate, is the amount actually spent or the amount 

in the table, whichever is less.  And, again -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- your

position penalizes debtors who pay their expenses in

12 

13 

14 

15

16

advance, who don't incur additional debt to pay for 

things like their car.  I would have thought the 

Bankruptcy Code would think that's a good thing, that 

they're not incurring debt that they can't afford to pay 

off, but instead, to the extent they can, they're paying 

expenses in advance.  Why should somebody who does that 

be in a worse position than somebody -- than somebody 

who takes out a loan they can't afford to pay back? 

 MS. MAYNARD:  Money is fungible, Your Honor, 

19 

so to the extent the debtor has incurred expenses before 

20

21 

22 

23

going into bankruptcy instead of, as here, paying off 

this more than $85,000 in credit card debt, shouldn't be

credit card debt, and so he has a salary of $50,000, and 

he has a credit card debt of $85,000, and he owns a 

2-year car -- 2-year-old car outright.  He should not be 

able to deduct, as a measure of his reasonably necessary 

expenses for his maintenance and support over the next 

50 months, $28,000 that he doesn't need for a car 

payment that he doesn't make.

is that every debtor has to go to the Bankruptcy Court 

and show what their monthly food bills have been over 

what period of time, how much their personal supplies 

have been over what period of time?  How can you 

calculate forward what they are going to spend on a 

monthly basis for each of those items?  Isn't that the 

reason the tables are used, so that you don't have to do 

that? 

 MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, Your Honor, and in the 

national standards, which all the items you just list 

are national standards, under the national standards you 

don't do the actuals.  On page 1a, it explains: 

"Allowances for food, clothing and other items, known as 

the National Standards, apply nationwide except for 

Alaska and Hawaii....  Taxpayers are allowed the total 

National Standards amount for their family size and 

income level, without questioning amounts actually 

spent." 

 For -- yes, for those hard-to-calculate 

items, you do -- our position is you do get the amounts 

in the chart.  For local standards -- the local 

standards, however, which include home, mortgage, lease 

expenses, utilities, and transportation, which include 

both ownership costs and operating costs, you get the 

actual or whichever is less.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I must say your position is 

more logical than the position that you read in some of 

the instructions applicable to the -- to the chart 

that's referred to in the Bankruptcy Code, but not 

others.  I mean, it seems to me, if you're going to read 

in the requirement that have to have made a lease 

payment, you should also read in the requirement that 

you're referring to now, which would mean your deduction 

is limited by the -- by the amount of your lease 

payment. 

 I don't see why -- is there any reason why 

12 

one would read in the other one and not read in yours? 

13

 MS. MAYNARD:  Not in our view, Your Honor, 

14 

because in our view the chart is -- is ambiguous about 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

what the number stands for.  And so in the national 

standards, the text, the prefatory text, explains that 

the amount is an allowance if you have the expense.  In 

the local standards, the prefatory text explains that 

the amount operates as a cap.

 But the important point for this case, Your 

Honor, is that you don't have to decide anything about 

the national standards because Petitioner is left at the 

statutory door.  He has no applicable monthly expense 

amount for operating -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Maynard, what would 

35
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1

3 

4 

5

happen if the debtor had a car that was 200,000 miles 

old -- 200,000 miles, and it was going to break down, 

you know, within the next 5 years?  Would the debtor 

then be able to take the deduction?

 MS. MAYNARD:  If the debtor owns the car 

outright at the time they file for bankruptcy, they 

would not get the deduction. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Even though if you look 

9 

ahead, if you project forward, it's pretty clear that 

10

11

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

the debtor is going to have to incur those expenses? 

 MS. MAYNARD:  They would not get the 

deduction under this calculation.  However, under this 

Court's decision in Lanning, when one goes to project 

the disposable income, it's conceivable that the debtor 

could prove that it's known or virtually certain that 

they will need a new car and that that could be 

accounted for. 

 But -- but also the Bankruptcy Code in 1329 

19 

allows for modification of a plan, and so when the time 

20

arises that their car conks out and they need a new car, 

21 

they can move to modify their plan.  I think it's -­

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the modification works 

for chapter 13, but it doesn't work for chapter 7; is 

that right?

 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, they make that statement

in their reply brief, Your Honor, but I'm not sure 

exactly what they mean by that, because in chapter 7 

this test is being used for a very different purpose. 

It's the gateway; it's a presumptive test for abuse. 

And so, again, our reading makes perfect sense in that 

context because what you want to know is, does this 

debtor actually have moneys it can prepay its creditors, 

should it be -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The -- sorry.  Are you

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Go ahead. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why don't you finish 

answering the question? 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Finish, yes. 

 MS. MAYNARD:  So, in chapter 7, once you -­

if you decide it's presumptively --- not presumptively 

abusive, and you stay in chapter 7, then chapter 7 is a 

liquidation.  There's no ongoing plan.  So I -- all of 

your nonexempt assets are liquidated, your creditors are 

paid off, and then you are discharged.  If 3 years from 

now your car conks out, you're just like you and me; you 

are not in bankruptcy, you just -- you try to make do.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I think it is -- well, I'm

trying to work out what was his point.  And I don't 

blame him for this.  But trying to figure it out, he 

says look:  This whole thing was written for a different 

purpose than the IRS, and if we start reading all those 

things from the beginning into the tables, we're really 

going to get into a mess.  For example, we are going to 

give people deductions when they have lease payments, 

even though they're not owners when they have lease 

payments.  The company owns -- not even an ownership 

10

expense, but it does say use the lease payment.  And 

11 

then it has all these other things. 

12

13

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 So forget it; do a simple thing.  It says 

ownership expense.  You go to the registry of motor 

vehicles and you say, is Smith the owner?  And they'll 

tell you, yes or no.  And if the answer is yes, he 

deducts $471.  Sometimes that's too little; sometimes 

that's too much.  But once we depart from that, we're 

really in a nightmare of trying to figure out what all 

these things mean that were written for other purposes. 

So, what do you say to that? 

 MS. MAYNARD:  I say, Justice Breyer, that 

there's nothing in the statute or the legislative 

history that suggests this was meant to be an overall 

budget for above-median-income debtors.  This was about 

capping upper discretion and limiting the expenses 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

available as reasonably necessary expenses for 

above-median-income debtors. 

 And I think that point is made perfectly 

4 

clear by the fact that if you can compare it to what

happens now to a below-median-income debtor, a 

below-median-income debtor in the same situation as 

Petitioner, who owns his car outright, would be allowed 

no amount as an expense for his vehicle, because he 

doesn't have an actual expense that's reasonably 

necessary. 

 And I think that the 2005 Congress would 

think it was a senseless result, as they argue here, 

that Petitioner gets $471, above-median-income debtor, 

the very class of debtors with whom Congress was 

concerned in the 2005 amendments, to shield from his 

creditors over the life of the plan when he has no 

comparable expense. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think that -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What we are talking about 

is a paradigm of someone -- we're comparing someone who 

has a $470-a-month car payment and he gets -- and he 

gets the deduction.  Why is that, in light of the second 

sentence -- let's see, the third sentence of the 

statute, which says, "Notwithstanding any other 

provision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the

debtor shall not include any payments for debts."  I 

mean, that would be the car company. 

 And has -- has that point been litigated? 

 MS. MAYNARD:  That -- that sentence is 

somewhat of a conundrum, Your Honor, and I think that 

the Court doesn't need to decide the meaning here, 

because whatever it does, it doesn't get Petitioner 

within the Romanette ii calculation -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No -- no, but it would -­

MS. MAYNARD:  -- because he has no payment. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It would eliminate the 

anomaly that -- one of the principal anomalies.  There 

are many anomalies in each position.  It would eliminate 

one of the principal asymmetries that seems to concern 

the counsel and the Court. 

 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, my understanding of that 

17 

provision is that it serves two purposes. 

18

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That it? 

 MS. MAYNARD:  Serves two purposes.  The 

first is that it makes clear -- in the back of our 

brief, we have the other necessary expenses from the 

IRM.  And on -- near the back, page 25a, two of the 

categories of other necessary expenses are secured or 

legally perfected debts and unsecured debts.

 So I think the -- the otherwise -- the

"notwithstanding" sentence makes clear that Romanette ii 

should not capture those other unsecured debts and 

secured debts, that it's the very purpose of this whole 

calculation to figure out how much money you have to pay 

those things. 

 The second purpose the sentence serves is to 

make sure that there is no double-counting, because 

Romanette iii, the very next provision in the means 

test, allows the debtor to claim monthly payments for 

secured debts.  Now, many car loans are probably secured 

debts, and in our view if you actually have a car loan 

-- now, remember again, he neither has a car loan, nor a 

car lease payment, nor any kind of ownership payment. 

 But if -- if one actually did have a car 

loan that was secured by the car, which I think is the 

vast majority of car loans, in our view the debtor 

expenses nothing for that under Romanette ii, and only 

the actual amount of that debt under Romanette iii. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the -- the 

general position was you get either the actual payment 

21 

or the 471, of whichever is higher. 

22

23

 MS. MAYNARD:  Whichever is less. 

 I think that -- that's my understanding of 

24 

how the local standards work, Your Honor.  I think, 

25

then, as a practical matter, that really will end up

only applying to car leases with respect to 

transportation ownership costs, because I think that the 

"notwithstanding" sentence removes secured car loans 

from Romanette ii and has them calculated under 

Romanette iii, where there is no comparable cap. 

 And the -- but -- but the point at issue in 

this case doesn't involve the interaction between 

Romanette ii and Romanette iii, because no matter how 

those two things interact, when the debtor has no 

payment whatsoever, he ought not to be able to claim any 

car ownership costs, because what we're trying to figure 

out is what amounts does he reasonably need for his 

maintenance and support?  And this question is a very 

important question.  This scenario happens a lot.

 In the 2007 study that U.S. Trustees did is 

-- at Congress's request to which Petitioner cites in 

his reply brief, the average overpayment of a debtor in 

claiming this transportation ownership expense was $335, 

which is a lot when you're talking about the standard in 

the chart being 471.  There are many debtors who are 

getting this expense either above their amount or when 

they have no such expense at all, and so even if the 

Court doesn't resolve these other issues that are 

implicated by this case, the decision here is a simple 

one, which is:  This debtor has no applicable monthly 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1

3

expense amount for transportation ownership costs, and 

he shouldn't be allowed to expense any amount for that. 

 If there are no further questions, the 

4 

Respondent requests the Court would affirm the judgment

below. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

 Ms. Saharsky. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY, 

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING RESPONDENT 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

12 

please the Court: 

13

 The only question this Court needs to 

14 

resolve in this case is whether the vehicle ownership 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

expense is applicable to Petitioner.  The answer is no. 

 The ownership cost is for loan and lease 

payments, the cost to acquiring the vehicle, and he just 

doesn't have any payments of that type.  To allow him to 

pretend that he does would create absurd results.  He'd 

be able to shield approximately $28,000 from his 

unsecured creditors, and he'd be better off than lower 

income chapter 13 debtors.  And we just don't think that 

that's a result that Congress intended.  We don't think 

it -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And if he paid -­

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- excuse me, 

2 

Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If he paid a dollar, 

4 

he would be able to shield $27,999, and you're 

5

6

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

comfortable with that result? 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, that goes to the 

question of whether the amount in the table is the 

amount to be used or a cap on actual expenses.  In our 

view, it is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I understood 

your brief to say it was the amount -- you get the whole 

amount, not simply as a cap. 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  That's right.  Now, of 

14 

course, we haven't seen -- the executive office for 

15

16 

17 

18

U.S. Trustees has not seen any $1 payments.  It doesn't 

know of any such commercially available payments.  It 

suspects the payments would be -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If the point of the 

19 

$1, counsel, is to lead to the extreme hypothetical that 

20

21 

22 

23

would flesh out your position, what if it were $10,000 

and the amount would give him $30,000?  The trustees 

have probably seen loans like that. 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  What I'm saying, Your Honor, 

24 

is that there are many circumstances in which an expense 

25

amount is a standard amount, but you still need to make 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

a threshold showing that it's applicable to you. 

2

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

 And if I could give the Court one example: 

When an individual does his Federal income tax forms, 

you can take a deduction for your dependents, but you 

can't just take a deduction for any child you have.  You 

have to take a deduction -- you can take a deduction if 

the person lives at home with you for more than 1 year 

and have you a certain amount of expenses to support 

them, and that is a standard deduction that you get on 

10

your tax forms.  The IRS doesn't ask everyone to figure 

11 

out their actual costs. 

12

13 

14 

15

16

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 It is the case in real life that there are 

allowance amounts that are average amounts that are 

given to people once they meet the criteria.  And that's 

what we are saying happens here. 

 Now, that is, again, only a disagreement as 

to what you do with people who actually have vehicle 

ownership expenses. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why aren't -- why isn't one 

of the criteria the -- the provision that says maximum 

allowances for housing and utilities and transportation, 

known as the local standards, vary by location, and 

unlike the national standards, the taxpayer is allowed 

the amount actually spent or the standard, whichever is 

less?  Why doesn't that apply?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, because, Your Honor, in 

that case it's the IRS commentary we are referring to 

that's on page 1a of the red brief appendix. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  And that -- what that's 

referring to is -- it says the amount actually spent or 

the standard.  And that's distinguishing between the 

amount that's actually spent or the standard, which is 

the standard -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  -- amount in the table. 

12 

Right. 

13

 And of course, we look to what -- the text 

14 

that Congress enacted in the Bankruptcy Code, and that 

15

16 

17 

18

says that the debtor's monthly expenses shall be the 

debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts specified 

under the national standards and local standards. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not applicable.  It's 

19 

not applicable if, in fact, you haven't spent that much. 

20

Just as you claim it's not applicable if you have no 

21 

payment at all. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think that it is -- it 

would further Congress's purposes to say that you 

have to -- that you look to the actual costs that the 

debtor has.  But we just don't think the text goes that

far, because it says that if the expense amounts -- the 

category is applicable to the debtor, that then you use 

the expense amounts specified under the table.  But -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but the -- but the 

gravamen of Justice Scalia's question is:  Why are you 

running away from 1a, which is what Respondent's counsel 

relied on?  And if that were clearly relevant to this 

statute, it would seem to me to answer the question. 

 Are you saying we -- we don't look at this 

because it's just simply an interpretation; it's not a 

regulation?  What is -- what is -- in your view, what 

effect do we give to this language that Justice Scalia 

quoted?  Nothing at all? 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  It would not be relevant in 

the bankruptcy context, in our view, and the reason is 

because the -- the statutory text refers to the 

standards.  And in our view, you can look to the IRS 

commentary to see what the standards mean, what their 

scope is, as Justice Breyer was discussing with his 

apples hypothetical. 

 But this additional language is guidance to 

IRS agents in tax delinquency cases about how to collect 

taxes.  As Petitioners -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we -- suppose we 

think the word "applicable" is ambiguous and difficult 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4

5

6 

7 

8

to construe.  Do we then look at this language at 1a, or 

do you say it's irrelevant in all instance -- in all 

respects? 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  You -- Your Honor, you could 

look at this language, but we think that it reflects not 

the standards, but what -- how the IRS uses the 

standards in individual cases of tax delinquency. 

 To the extent that the IRS is defining what 

9 

the standards are, what the scope of the standards are 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

-- for example, that ownership costs are loan and lease 

payments -- of course, we would think that you would 

look to that, but this additional guidance to IRS agents 

we don't think is what Congress meant when it said 

"expense amounts specified under the standards."

 But we do think that the text could be read 

16 

the way you suggest. 

17

18 

19 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So then you would be 

comfortable with a person who owns a house outright, who 

only pays $100 in utilities, taking the full amount of 

the housing and utilities allowable living expenses 

21 

because that's the amount specified? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, the housing and 

utilities expenses have been broken out into a mortgage 

and rent component and a utilities component.  So in 

that circumstance, we would say the individual only is

allowed the utilities component, but it would be the 

allowance amount that is specified.  It would not be his 

actual amount. 

 But, again, this is a question that was not 

considered by the courts below.  In fact, the bankruptcy 

appellate panel said it is -- in footnote 20 of its 

brief, said this question is not in this case; it's not 

before us whether you use the amounts in the table or 

whether you use the actual amounts.  And we don't think 

-­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Saharsky, I 

should -- I should probably know this, but if you do 

have amounts that are excluded from the disposable 

income because of car ownership, in other words, you 

actually have, from -- in your point of view, expenses, 

do they have to go to the -- pay off the car loan or are 

they available for everybody?  All the creditors? 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  They're not available for the 

19 

creditors.  The idea behind this calculation is that 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

there, of course, are secured debts that have priority, 

and then this calculation is used to figure out how much 

money is left to pay unsecured creditors.  And the idea 

is that the debtor has certain expenses, that he needs 

to keep money for himself so he can continue with the 

everyday business of life.  For example, the car 

49

ownership payment is designed to ensure that a vehicle 

can still use and have access to a car, and if someone 

has a loan or lease payment, they need to be able to 

continue making that payment in bankruptcy, but if they 

don't have any such payment, then they don't have this 

6 

need for this additional fund because -­

he decide of the amount that would otherwise go for the 

10

car payment that he's going to pay some of that for the 

11 

food expenses? 

12

13

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, certainly the 

Bankruptcy Court doesn't scrutinize, you know, what 

happens to that regard.  What it's just trying to do is 

figure out the disposable income that is available to 

16 

pay unsecured creditors, that the debtor doesn't need.

 And I should just note with respect to this 

question of whether there is an overall budget that the 

debtor is allowed, you know, that's certainly not the 

case in any of the other provisions that follow this 

applicable monthly standards and local standards.  You 

have the actual other necessary expenses, actual 

continuation of taking care of chronically ill family 

members.  And Petitioner himself acknowledges that he 

has to show that he has a car.  So it's not the case 

50

that every debtor is just getting some set amount of 

money to do what they will with.  Congress has 

referenced the standards.  The standards break this out 

into certain expenses.  It says just take the applicable 

ones.  And we just don't think it makes sense to

interpret "applicable" in that circumstance to -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Saharsky, could you 

explain to me the government's position on when a debtor 

with loan and lease payments gets to deduct them under 

Romanette ii?  In other words, this goes back to Justice 

Kennedy's question, the notwithstanding clause and 

whether the notwithstanding clause effectively excludes 

all loan and lease payments from Romanette ii? 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  It does not have that effect, 

Your Honor.  What it does is to take out the actual debt 

payments that are part of the other necessary 

expenses -- these are on page 25a of the red brief -­

that counsel on our side mentioned.  These are other 

necessary expenses that are actual debt payments, and 

the local and national standards are expense amounts. 

We don't think that Congress defined those to be debt 

payments. 

 So the function of the payments for debts 

24 

language, we agree with Respondent's counsel, would be 

25

twofold.  First, it would excise the other necessary

expenses that actually are debt payments, which makes 

complete sense.  You know, one of them is an unsecured 

debt payment, and you wouldn't want to consider that one 

of your expenses because the whole point of the 

calculation is to figure out how much money you have 

left to pay unsecured debts.  And then the other 

function that it serves is in Romanette iii because you 

were getting secured debt payments there to not 

double-count them in Romanette ii.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, in other words, the 

loan and lease payments don't count as debt for purposes 

of the notwithstanding clause; they count as expense 

amounts? 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  We say that those are expense 

amounts that are specified.  They're not payments for 

debts.  I should note, because Justice Kennedy asked 

this question, that this was not something that was 

relied upon by the courts below.  I don't believe that 

there's any definitive court of appeals opinion that 

goes through in detail what that provision is designed 

to do.  So I would urge this Court that it need not 

resolve it in this case and instead do what the court of 

appeals did, which is to say that, just looking at the 

plain text, the word "applicable" means not everybody 

can get these amounts in the national and local 

52

standards, and it needs to be someone who actually has 

those payment amounts.  The whole point of this part of 

this statute is to figure out what money is available to 

pay unsecured creditors, and it's payments that need to 

be made for expenses that matter.  It's not whether the 

6 

individual debtor has a car.

 I also note, just because it came up earlier 

and is a very important point, that to the extent that 

the Court only wants to look at the tables to figure out 

what are ownership costs, are they loan and lease 

payments, just looking at the title of the table, 

Ownership Costs, you need to have costs.  Looking at the 

fact that there are two different ones -- there's 

ownership costs as opposed to operating costs -- makes 

clear that some of the things that Petitioner suggests 

16 

might be ownership costs are, in fact, operating costs.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

 Mr. Burke, have you 4 minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER P. BURKE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. BURKE:  Thank you. 

 The means test knows when to say "actual" 

when it wants to say "actual."  It didn't say "actual" 

in this case; it said "applicable."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Burke, would you

explain one facet of this case to me?  Given the 

deduction, the $471 deduction, disposable -- projected 

disposable income comes down to $210? 

 MR. BURKE:  Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  As opposed to -- it would 

6 

be 600 some dollars if you didn't count the $471? 

7

 MR. BURKE:  Correct. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though the

disposable income figure was $210, the debtor was

willing -- the debtor proposed paying $500.  Why did the 

debtor come up with a $500 figure when projected 

disposable income without the car ownership would be -­

if he gets the car ownership, would only be $210? 

 MR. BURKE:  This is exactly why our view of 

the law works.  The means test is a minimum amount. 

It's a bottom-line quick figure based on standard 

deductions.  It was $200 based on our calculation if 

he's given his deductions based on age, location, et 

cetera.

 We then go back to I and J, and J, which is 

on page 44 of the Joint Appendix, is his current 

expenses.  And if we look at line 13A, there is no 

vehicle payment.  He's not taking $471.  He took his 

income and expense.  The bottom line was 500.  He knew 

he had to pay at least 200.  He's willing to pay the 

54
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

500.  He's not getting a $471 deduction because there is 

no car payment on his Schedule J. 

 And if we look at the formula that way, the 

4 

means test is a general form to give standard 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

deductions, to give us a quick bottom line, and the 

debtor is either going to pay that amount or more based 

on his income and expense, and he would pay more if he 

really didn't have that expense.  So if he didn't have a 

rent expense of $1,000 a month, it would show up on 

Schedule J that he didn't have 1,000, so his payment 

would go to $1,500 a month.  That's the good faith 

that's involved in this case. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It would have to go to 

14 

1,500 a month, or he, out of the goodness of his heart, 

15

16

would decide to pay that amount? 

 MR. BURKE:  He's going to have to pay an 

17 

amount of at least $200. 

18

19

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 

 MR. BURKE:  It would be hard to confirm a 

case if he doesn't pay somewhere in that range. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Fine.  So why -- why would 

we assume that he -- I don't know -- your client is an 

extraordinarily generous fellow.  I don't think most 

people, when they go through bankruptcy, are going to 

cough up any more than they have to.

 MR. BURKE:  It's the only way for the form 

and the law to work.  The means test is a bottom-line 

number.  If you don't have one of those expenses, it 

shows up on Schedule J, and it gives you a number.  If 

it's higher, we think you should probably pay it or in 

that range.  If it's lower, Congress isn't saying you 

get away with it; it says you get out of chapter 13 if 

you're not going to pay this amount.  So the formula is 

just to come up with a bottom line.  Nobody is shielding 

10

anything. 

It's all black and white on his current 

11 

expenses. 

If he doesn't have it -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that the
 

Bankruptcy Code provision freezes the -- the national 

and local standards to some degree or completely as they 

existed at the time when the statute was enacted? 

 MR. BURKE:  At the time the debtor files, 

those numbers are frozen. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But the IRS can change -­

otherwise, they can -- going forward, they can 

completely change the national and local standards? 

 MR. BURKE:  The numbers, but not the 

structure.  They can do anything they want when they're

collecting taxes, but the numbers -- and I think the 

numbers change on an annual basis.
