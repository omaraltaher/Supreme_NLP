 (11:08 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-869, Ysursa v. Pocatello Education 
Association.

 Mr. Smith.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLAY R. SMITH
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SMITH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case is narrowed to a single, but from 

the Petitioner's perspective a critical, dispute over 
the scope of internal State sovereignty:  whether the 
First Amendment trumps the otherwise existing authority 
of the Idaho legislature to direct political 
subdivisions of the State to take an action, here 
restricting access to their payroll systems, that the 
subdivisions could take independently without violating 
the Amendment.

 The genesis of this dispute is Idaho Code 
Section 44-2004(2), which was adopted in 2003.  That 
provision prohibits State and local government public 
employers from deducting amounts for political 
activities from the payroll checks due to their 
employees and remitting those amounts to third parties.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Didn't the statute also 

prohibit private employers from doing that?

 MR. SMITH:  As construed by the district 

court, it did.  The base legislation in this, the 
Voluntary Contribution Act, excluded from application an 
employee -- an employer subject to the two major labor 
-- Federal labor relations statutes, the NLRA and the 
RLA.

 But there was obviously a group of 

employers, private employers, in -- who were not engaged 
in commerce, as well as the agricultural sector.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And you concede the 

statute was unconstitutional as applied to them?

 MR. SMITH:  The district court concluded 

that the -- yes, Your Honor, we did.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And you agree with that 

conclusion?

 MR. SMITH:  We do.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And what is the difference 

between the private employer and the county agency?

 MR. SMITH:  Well, the principal difference 

is that one is a private employer -- that is to say, 
engaging in private speech -- while the public employer 
is a -- is a subdivision of the State of Idaho, subject, 
we would argue, to the plenary control, pursuant to the

Idaho Constitution, of the Idaho legislature.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think Justice 

      

Stevens's question highlights for me one of the 
confusing parts of this case.  You sort of paired off a 
number of the people who would otherwise be covered, and 
you are left with the county employees. 
If you 
had started with the county employees, is this how you 
would have gone about telling them they can't do this? 
I mean the county employers.  Would you have passed a 
law saying that the county employers are not allowed to 
have this checkoff?  If you think they are part of the 
State, I guess you could have just written them a letter 
and say don't do this, right?

 MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, in a word, the 
answer is no.  I don't believe we, referring to the 
Petitioners in this case, could have written the -- the 
political subdivisions of a State to direct them to take 
an action unless there was a legislative basis for doing 
so.

 In this instance, the -- the legislature 
concluded that it wanted all public employers, among 
others, to not allow access to their payroll systems.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do I understand that the 

counties, if they elected to, could decide not to -- not 
to do the checkoff?

MR. SMITH:  Prior to the adoption of the 

statute in 2003, yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And so why should counties 
be different from -- from -- I'm still puzzled about why 
counties -- county employers are different from private 
employers in terms of the State interest in preventing 
the checkoff.

 MR. SMITH:  Well, there is a fundamental 
difference, Your Honor.  And -- and it rests in the 
notion that the State has no interest in the -- in 
private employers' determination to be involved or not 
involved in political matters.  The State legislature, 
however, has a very concrete interest in avoiding either 
the reality or the appearance --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you -- if you think of 
the case as a principal-agent case so that the principal 
can direct the agent as to what to do, the agent being 
the county, then it seems to me that the unions might 
still have an argument that this is an unconstitutional 
condition.

 I've been looking for ways to examine this 

case.  The public forum doesn't really work for me. 
Subsidy doesn't really work for me.  It seems to me to 
be an unconstitutional-condition case.  At least that's 
the argument.

That doesn't mean you necessarily can't 
prevail.  But suppose the State told the city:  You 
can't have a parade that you sponsor for this particular 
cause.  That would raise an unconstitutional-conditions 
argument; wouldn't it?

 MR. SMITH:  It might, Your Honor, but that 

situation, of course, is not the situation presented 
here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why isn't it?  And I say 
that because I think that follows on Justice Stevens's 
line of questioning.  I didn't mean to interrupt him, 
but it seems to me that is consistent with what he is 
asking.

 MR. SMITH:  Because the statute at issue 
here, Justice Kennedy, speaks across the board to a 
specific kind of conduct, political activities.  It does 
so in the a viewpoint-neutral fashion.  To prohibit a 
particular parade might well raise viewpoint 
non-neutrality issues.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, because the 

State couldn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You stand up and say that 

this isn't viewpoint -- that this is -- that this is 
viewpoint-based.  Isn't it where the union --
aren't they right about that?

MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, they are incorrect 

about that.  The district court concluded that the 
statute is viewpoint-neutral.  Indeed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But does it get at any 

speech other than union speech?  I mean you say, yes, it 
is content-based, but it's viewpoint neutral.  But it 
seems that what is banned by the statute is union 
speech.  Is any other organization affected?  Does the 
ban affect any other organization?  Isn't it simply 
union speech that's at stake?

 MR. SMITH:  The answer is no.  It -- the --

the statute just -- does not just affect union speech by 
its literal terms.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, in practice, is 

there any other application?

 MR. SMITH:  Well, there is no evidence in 
the record, Your Honor, as to any other entity who is 
affected by the statute.  But that is hardly -- that's 
hardly remarkable, given the fact that the plaintiffs in 
the litigation are six labor organizations.  I should 
add that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are there -- are there in 
counties some charitable drives that occur annually and 
that permit employees to donate to those charities 
through deductions from their wages?

MR. SMITH:  There are, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And would they presumably 
be covered by this?  United Fund drives, so-called, my 
-- my recollection is that usually the contributions to 
that simply come out of -- are deducted from the wages. 
And if they existed in the counties, presumably they 
would have been covered.  But we don't know if they 
would.

 MR. SMITH:  Well, to the extent that the --

the contribution was for political activities --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, it's only political 

activities?

 MR. SMITH:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.  Well, none of those 

would allow that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But if in fact there is a 
charity, which charity in Idaho is a charity that makes 
all of its contributions to help support right-to-work 
laws.  All right.  So that charity goes and says, could 
you -- we'd like a payroll deduction.  Can they get it, 
or not?

 MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, again, it depends. 

I -- I don't know the answer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't know.  Okay.  So, 
then, we do know this.  We do know -- what I'm wondering

is:  Isn't this case, to me, quite confused about 
something fairly simple?  The question would be:  Look, 
one, do you or do you not in Idaho allow anybody to have 
payroll deductions for anything?  And I take it your 
answer to that question is:  Yes, we do allow some 
payroll deductions for some things.  Okay?

 So then we look at this one, and it says: 

No payroll deductions for union activities that are 
political.  All right?  Now, you either do have or you 
do not have a justification for that difference.  If you 
have a reasonable, or whatever the sufficient test is, 
justification for the difference, you win.  And if you 
don't, you lose.  And, indeed, whether you are the State 
or the county could have to do with the plausibility of 
the justification.

 Here we are, end of case, traditional.  You 

just -- you didn't argue it that way, I guess, below. 
What's wrong with that?

 MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, in fact, we argued 
below that there was no constitutional right of access 
to the payroll system for purposes of making political 
contributions.  And let me reiterate at this --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There certainly, I would 
think, would be a problem if the right-to-work people 
can get there.  And you are not going to let the unions

get there.  But I don't know the facts.  So shouldn't we 
just send this case back and say:  Please look at what 
the situation is?  If they have to treat some people one 
way, some people another, bad; if they don't, everybody 
is treated alike for good reason, probably okay.

 MR. SMITH:  Well, the -- I would suggest 
that a remand for that purpose would be futile.  The 
district court, as I said before, concluded that the 
statute is viewpoint neutral.  And let me stress that 
the term "political activities" does not -- is not 
defined with reference to unions or speech by other 
entities that might be controlled by unions.

 It addresses political contributions for 

electoral matters, independent expenditures, and 
expenditures to political parties.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would -- would they include 

contributions to an organization that makes 
contributions to political parties --
MR. SMITH:  Yes, to the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- such as a right-to 

work-organization?

 MR. SMITH:  To the extent that the -- the 

organization is, for example, a political action 
committee, it would.

question for a moment.  Had the legislature intended 
44-2004(2) to apply only to unions, they would have --
it would have been engaging in a redundancy because 
under another provision of the same legislation, 
44-2603(1)(b)(iv), which appears at petition appendix 
70, the Idaho legislature proscribed amounts being --
amounts -- required all amounts to be paid -- paid to a 
separate segregated fund which was established pursuant 
to the legislation that was invalidated by the district 
court, required those kinds of contributions to be made 
directly by the employee and not through -- or not by 
the employee's employer.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does the State give some 
particular favor to unions?  I mean, does it allow --
what -- what is the situation?  Can you be forced to 
contribute to the union even though you're not a union 
member?

 MR. SMITH:  No, Your Honor.  The --

44-2004(2) is part of the Idaho Right to Work Act, which 
was adopted in the mid 1980s.  It allows amounts to be 
deducted through payroll checkoffs for union dues.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But unions do have a 

special prerogative which -- which no other 
organizations, as far as you're aware, have in the 
State, which is to have money deducted from people's

 MR. SMITH:  That's -- that's correct.  The 

payrolls?

--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No other 

organization other than the Federal, State and local 
governments.

 MR. SMITH:  True.  But let -- let me -- let 

me continue with my response to Justice Scalia's 
question.

 The special prerogative that, for example, 
the Pocatello Education Association or the firefighters 
union has is the ability to engage in collective 
bargaining pursuant to State statute as the exclusive 
bargaining representative of, for example, the Pocatello 
School District's teachers.

 That exclusivity which is granted to a 
limited number of -- of -- in fact, two areas under 
Colorado -- excuse me -- under Idaho law, namely, 
firefighters and teachers, is the extraordinary benefit 
that unions have.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  The point of my 

question is it doesn't seem to be terribly 
discriminatory if indeed the only organizations in the 
State that are given the right, whether by Federal or 
State law, to deduct, private organizations, given the

right to deduct from the salary a municipal or private 
employer pays.  It doesn't seem to me particularly 
discriminatory to say that, moreover, in making those 
deductions, no part of it will be given for political 
activities.  I mean you're only addressing a narrow 
class, but it's a narrow class that has a special 
benefit.

 MR. SMITH:  Well, I would agree that -- that 
unions have, and particularly these -- particularly the 
Respondents have a special benefit.  But again, I go 
back to the basic point that 2004(2) addresses all 
public employers or public employees and is not limited 
to political activity contributions.  That might be, for 
example, as the situation is here, to a union-sponsored 
political action -- political action committee.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask a question 
about, say, an attempt to deduct contributions to a 
charity like the United Fund?  Do counties have a choice 
to either do that or not do it, or does State law 
require them to accept such requests?

 MR. SMITH:  Local governments have 

discretion.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  They have discretion to do 

that?

 MR. SMITH:  That's correct. 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  With respect to the union 

situation, the statute takes away that discretion.

 MR. SMITH:  With respect --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  And the question is why is 

there -- why is there a State interest in taking away 
that discretion for unions, but not as to charities.

 MR. SMITH:  Well, it takes away that 

discretion with respect to any third party who might 
receive amounts for political activities.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  For political activities. 

But what is -- what is the reason for differentiating 
political activities from charities?

 MR. SMITH:  The reason, as we articulate in 
our brief, is the desire to avoid either the appearance 
or the reality of public employer involvement in, in 
this instance, electoral politics.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I see.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are there other 

areas in which the State exercises the authority you're 
asserting here with respect to county employers, telling 
them what they can and can't do?

 MR. SMITH:  Outside the area of elections, 

not with respect to payroll deductions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean more 

generally.  Your assertion is that this is part of the

State, and therefore, as I gather, it's conceded on the 
other side, this is acceptable with respect to State 
employees but not other public employers.  Are there 
other areas in which you act like the counties are part 
of the State?

 MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, the -- the county --

counties in Idaho and I suppose in most States act as 
political subdivisions of the State.  And whatever 
authority they have or don't have derives, if not 
exclusively, virtually exclusively from State law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm looking for --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  Please.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm looking for a 

specific example.  I mean, maybe counties or 
municipalities, you know, contract for trash collection 
or water services and maybe the State tells them, look, 
you've got to deal with these people, you've got to do 
it by open bidding, whatever.

 MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, let me go back to 

the election context for a moment to try to address that 
question.  Prior to its amendments pursuant to the 
legislation at hand, Idaho Code Section 67-6605, which 
is part of Idaho's election campaign finance and 
reporting statute or general statutes, allowed payroll 
deductions to be made for contributions to political

committees.  In that sense, it allowed counties, as well 
as other public employers, to make deductions of the 
kind at issue today.

 Now, that authority was rescinded by virtue 
of the amendment to 2004(2).  The point simply is that 
if necessary, we -- we could describe in detail various 
kinds of -- of requirements that exist with respect to 
counties or school districts or cities.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's --

since I asked the question, I think it's necessary.  So 
what's the best example where the State exercises 
control over what the counties would otherwise have 
discretion to do?  You mentioned school districts.  Is 
that -- is that an area?

 MR. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor, for example, 

with respect to -- take open meetings, for example, take 
public records, for example.  Those are general kinds of 
statutes that impose requirements on all levels of State 
government.  So, for example, with respect to open 
meetings, the Idaho law requires essentially all 
meetings, except for certain exclusions, to be open to 
the public.  In that sense, it's akin to the Wisconsin 
statute.

engage in political activity?

 MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, it does, but not --

not in connection with their public employment 
activities.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know -- I don't 

know what that means.

 MR. SMITH:  It means that there is no 

prohibition under State law, for example, for a public 
employee to engage in political activity.  If -- but our 
statute in Idaho applies actually only to State 
employees.  It doesn't govern those kinds of activities 
by local government.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's interesting.  Why 

not?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The general proposition 

that underlies your argument that the local entities are 
creatures of State law and they cannot receive Federal 
powers from the Federal Government when the States 
object, is that -- is that an acceptable proposition?

 MR. SMITH:  It would be an acceptable 
proposition to the extent that Federal law doesn't 
pre-empt State law, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.
 MR. SMITH:  In this instance, we would argue 
that the First Amendment does not interpose some kind of

barrier to essentially vulcanize local government from

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There is -- there is a 
case out of the Ninth Circuit, and it was affirmed by 
this Court on a procedural point, but not on a -- not on 
the merits -- out of the neighboring State of 
Washington, where the State says a locality cannot build 
a dam more than 25 feet high.  The locality then gets a 
license from the Federal Power Commission, and the State 
said, well, you still don't have this authority.  And 
the Ninth Circuit said you do.  The Federal power then 
supersedes.

 Would you agree that that case is valid?
 MR. SMITH:  Depending on -- on the facts, I 
-- I would agree that it is certainly possible for the 
State law to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because there the local 
entity has powers greater than what the State wants to 
give it, even over the State's objection.

 MR. SMITH:  Well, but -- but, Your Honor, 

that is, I think, beyond cavil; that is to say that 
Federal law --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I didn't hear 

you.  You think that's what?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Really, if the State can 

-- can opt not to do something, it can't tell its 
subdivisions, we don't want you to do it, either?  And 
the subdivision can then go to the -- directly to the 
Federal Government and say, please let us do this, even 
if the State would be free to reject it on its own?
 MR. SMITH:  Well, it -- it depends on --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that that 

is the argument you should be making here.

 MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, perhaps it was  --
it was an argument that we don't have to make in this 
instance.  Needless to say, by virtue of the Supremacy 
Clause, there may be instances where Federal law --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought your whole 

argument was that the counties are simply 
instrumentalities of the State, and the State has full 
power over them.  It chooses to delegate to them 
autonomy, but it holds the control rein.  And now you're 
saying no, that the Federal Government can give the 
State local-unit authority that the State, itself, 
chooses not to give.  And you say that's beyond cavil. 
I really don't understand your argument.

 MR. SMITH:  It is beyond cavil if the 

Federal law, in fact, supersedes State law.  There may 
be issues --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That depends -- I 

mean the whole case turns on -- and the response to 
Justice Kennedy, I think, would be -- if the Federal 
Government is simply saying you can do it if you want, 
that's one thing.  If the Federal Government is saying 
you must do it because it's covered by the Federal Power 
Act, or whatever, that's different.

 If it's just a grant of permission, I would 

suppose the State can say, well, fine, it's okay with 
the Feds, but you can't do it because we don't want you 
to.

 MR. SMITH:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And don't -- don't you 

suffer from -- doesn't your position suffer from a -- a 
more serious problem that doesn't even implicate the 
pre-emption doctrine?  And that is, as I understand your 
argument, the -- the local governments are creatures of 
the State.  Their powers are the powers that the State 
gives them by statute, as -- as you were pointing out.
 The same thing is true for corporations. 

Corporations are creatures of the State.  They have the 
powers, and only the powers, that the State gives to 
them.  It -- it seems to me, going back to Justice 
Stevens's initial question, that I don't see where the 
distinction lies between the -- in effect, the position

of the local-government units and corporations, and --
and between the local-government units and the 
corporations.  And it seems to me that that's a problem 
for you quite apart from any application of Federal law.
 MR. SMITH:  I disagree, Justice Souter.  The 

-- as I stated in response to Justice Stevens, the 
difference is a central one.  That is to say, a 
corporation is a private entity with -- with distinct 
rights under the First Amendment.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it has distinct 

rights under the First Amendment if State law creates a 
corporate form of -- of -- of business organization. 
And the -- the -- when -- when it comes into existence, 
it then does acquire some rights under the national 
Constitution.  But if in the first instance it's a 
creature of State law, its powers, generally speaking, 
are the powers that State law gives it.  And that is --
that same proposition is true of counties and towns and 
-- and other sub-State governmental units.

 MR. SMITH:  I disagree to the extent that 
there is any attempt to equate a private corporation 
with essentially an agent or an arm of the State such as 
a county, which has been delegated governmental 
functions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  Then -- then it

seems to me that your argument is not that State law 
controls what it may do and defines its powers.  Your 
argument, it seems to me, has to rest upon the fact that 
what it is doing is a public, as opposed to a private, 
function.  And that's the extent of the argument.  Isn't 
that true?

 MR. SMITH:  Well, that is -- certainly is 
the distinction between a private corporation and, for 
example, a county.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That's the only distinction 

that you can maintain.  You can't maintain the 
distinction based upon the superiority of State law in 
defining the -- the extent of the governmental unit's 
powers and so on, because that is just as true of a 
corporation.  So your distinction has simply got to be a 
distinction based on the nature of the function that is 
being performed.

 MR. SMITH:  And -- and the very nature of 

the entity, itself, Your Honor.  A county --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What -- what do you mean by 

the "nature of" --

MR. SMITH:  A county or school district 

performs functions assigned to it by the State 
legislature to carry out the function, to carry out 
activities that are public in nature.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, it's doing -- it's 

doing a governmental job.

 MR. SMITH:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  We understand what that is, 

so I understand that point.

 MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, I -- I can only 

repeat that the distinction between the private 
corporation and the -- and a political subdivision of 
the State is that, in fact, one is an entity created by 
the legislature for the very purpose of carrying out 
State governmental functions.  That -- that, I think, is 
entirely consistent with the position argued throughout 
this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  But -- it -- it is, 

but I mean when you say, as I think you are now saying, 
the -- the law for the State to be the law for the 
subdivision because they are both governmental, the 
counter-argument is, in fact, there are resemblances to 
private organizations, too.  And those resemblances are, 
in effect, their creation and definition by State law; 
their enjoyment of the powers, and only those powers, 
which State law gives them; so that, in fact, there 
is -- there is not only an analogy with the State 
government, there is an analogy with private 
corporations, too.  And the question is why should we

choose one analogy rather than the other analogy?
 MR. SMITH:  And Your Honor, I think I 

responded.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You don't think that under 

our Federal system, the States have greater powers 
deciding how they are going to organize themselves than 
they have with respect to the regulation of artificial 
private entities that they choose to permit under State 
law?

 MR. SMITH:  Yes.  States -- of course States 

do have that authority.

you a minute for rebuttal --

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. COLLINS:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 This case turns on three points.  First, the 

statute at issue is a content-based restriction on 
speech which is therefore presumptively invalid, 
requires heightened scrutiny, which Petitioners

acknowledge they have not satisfied, unless one of the 
exceptions to heightened scrutiny is applicable here, 
those being exceptions which as the Court has explained 
in R.A.V. and Davenport, are limited to circumstances 
where there is no real risk of viewpoint suppression.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Collins, suppose -- I 

gather Idaho doesn't have it, but suppose Idaho wanted a 
Hatch Act similar to the Federal Hatch Act that 
prohibits Federal employees from engaging in political 
activity, and suppose it decided that not only should 
the State employees at the capital not engage in 
political activities, but it's a problem for any 
governmental employee to do that; they ought to be 
neutral and we don't want patronage to be passed out on 
the basis of whether they are campaigning for one party 
or another, and we don't want them to be coerced into 
campaigning for one party or another.  Now, I assume 
that such a law would violate the First Amendment if it 
were extended to all employers.  Saying no -- no company 
employee, no private employee can engage in political 
activity would surely violate the First Amendment. 
Would it violate the First Amendment if it was extended? 
Certainly, it doesn't when it's applied to State 
employees because there are a lot of State Hatch Acts. 
And you're saying it would violate the First Amendment

as applied to county and municipal employees?

 MR. COLLINS:  Not at all, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not?
 MR. COLLINS:  We don't take that position at 

all, because, as the Court has indicated in Letter 
Carriers and Broadrick and other cases, there is a 
compelling interest in a statute which says that 
government employees -- and it could be State or local 
-- will not be performing their jobs as servants of 
politics.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying -- you're 
analogizing these to private entities.  That's your 
whole point.

 MR. COLLINS:  That's not our point.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is not a creature of 

the State.  You're saying what the First Amendment -- as 
the First Amendment applies to private individuals, so 
it applies here.  This is regulation by the State, 
rather than the State's control of State government.
 MR. COLLINS:  We are saying that, Your 
Honor, because the only defense that the State can 
possibly offer here to this content discrimination is 
the forum notion that the State has introduced.  In the 
case of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now --

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. COLLINS:  It's not a forum analysis.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me just establish something at 
the outset.  You had conceded below, and I thought I saw 
this in your brief as well, that as to the State of 
Idaho, its determination not to allow the deductibility 
is permissible.

 MR. COLLINS:  That's correct, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  So, we begin 

with the proposition that a State may do this if it 
chooses; i.e., this -- refused on its own to have the 
payroll deduction.

 MR. COLLINS:  Yes.  And the reason for that 
is that, under Regan and Finley and Rust and the other 
cases, the State has perfect freedom to decide not to 
devote its own resources and expenditure.  But 
interestingly and very much on point here --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if -- and if a State 
had a system in which all payroll deductions were -- by 
local entities -- were routinely controlled by the 
State, the State did all the pay roles for the local 
entities, then it -- in that case the nondeductibility 
would also be permitted, I take it.

 MR. COLLINS:  Yes, Your Honor, and let me 

explain because those are two -- the answer to both 
questions is "yes" but for two very different reasons.

The answer to the second question is that our contention 
is not that the State is never a proprietor and never 
entitled to the kind of deference that goes with the 
proprietor when it's dealing with local government 
programs.  As the Court noted in the Council of 
Greenberg case, a government can become a proprietor 
with respect to property or programs it doesn't actually 
own.  Our point is quite simply that the State has not 
done that here.  That's why, if the State had done it, 
if the State said we are going to dictate the nature of 
payroll deduction systems for and local governments, the 
State could do that, and it would be then --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did you have any 

doubt how they would?  I mean, they passed a law 
dictating that with respect to everybody.  And then it's 
pared down by litigation and concessions.  So, we don't 
have any real question of what the State is wanting to 
do here.  It's --

MR. COLLINS:  What I'm suggesting, Mr. Chief 

Justice, is that since we are beginning with a 
content-based restriction -- and I do want to emphasize 
it's a law here which says that for all employers --
public, private, or State -- the only expenditure you 
can't make through payroll deduction is for political 
activities, and also the only resource of an employer

that can't be used for any kind of political activity is 
payroll deduction, this being in a statute targeted at 
employee support of union activity.  So, we have a 
content-based restriction, and the question is:  Can it 
come within an exception to the heightened scrutiny that 
Petitioners acknowledge they can't satisfy?

 But when I'm suggesting that the State could 

come within reduced scrutiny if it were actually 
managing the payroll system, I'm referring to situations 
like Council of Greenburg, where the government with 
respect to a particular kind of facility or program 
says, we don't own it, but we -- it's an integral part 
of a system that we are managing, establishing, not just 
saying -- not just to say all we care about is one kind 
of speech we don't want to go on there.  If the 
government says we have -- we want to be the manager, 
the operator of a particular kind of local government 
operation, the State is free to do that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, if the State wants 

to, it's because it can exercise a heavy hand and 
control its local units, but if it wants to give the 
local units discretion, then it has to leave it to the 
local units whether or not they want to enact such a 
ban.  That's your position?

 MR. COLLINS:  No.  It's not a question of

whether the State has the power to regulate.  The 
question is if the State regulation is in the form of a 
content-based restriction on speech, can it elude 
heightened scrutiny?  And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  My question really is, if 

you look at this at the most basic level, we have two 
important concessions.  You don't question the 
constitutionality of the ban as to State employees.  And 
the other side doesn't question that it is 
unconstitutional as to private employees.  So here we 
have State local employees.  Do we bracket them with 
with State employees or with private employees as 
essential --

MR. COLLINS:  Your Honor, functionally 

that's the question, but I think analytically we don't 
see it that way because the question is, as we see it, 
is the State, with regard to this challenged statute in 
its application to the local governments, acting in a 
capacity that entitles it to be free from the normal 
First Amendment scrutiny that it acknowledges it would 
fail--
free from that scrutiny as to its own employees is 
because of the cases that say the government doesn't 
have to spend its money.

and that's where our point is.  The reason it is

where you are, that I've always had a hard time not for 
lack of trying.  I don't understand what the word 
"content-based" means, and I know it's all over the law, 
but I've never understood it and maybe since you're 
relying on it 15 times you can explain it.  And the 
thing I don't understand it about is it seems to me 
government engages in thousands of different kinds of 
activity, and there isn't some special test.  When they 
say that in the jury room, the jury room is there for 
juries; it's not to show movies of Steven Spielberg. 
And there isn't some special test when you say the 
purpose of the biology class is to teach biology, and we 
don't want people coming in here teaching some other 
thing.  I don't understand what this special test called 
"content-based" is, and that's rather a deep 
misunderstanding on my part, but since you're depending 
on it, why don't you take 30 seconds or 45 seconds to 
see if you can help me?

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, Justice Breyer, the --
the concept of content discrimination may blur on some 
edges, but one thing that the Court has been clear on is 
that when a government says speech -- one form of speech 
will not be allowed and that will be political speech, 
that is treated as requiring heightened scrutiny.  And I 
should say --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't -- for example, 

in biology class, the school board says:  You know, 
biology teacher, I want you to teach biology; I don't 
want you to teach politics.  And then there is some 
special scrutiny about how the biology teacher is to 
teach or -- but they say just face it.  The jury room is 
for juries.  It's not for politics.  All that is subject 
to some special First Amendment test?

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, first of all, Your 

Honor, all of those would pass muster either because --
JUSTICE BREYER:  They might.  They might. 

But you know a lot of them, you know you could show 
movies in jury rooms in the evening and people might 
find it much better.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. COLLINS:  They would pass muster either 

because they are within exceptions to heightened 
scrutiny -- because not all content distinctions require 
heightened scrutiny -- or they would pass muster even 
under heightened scrutiny.  But one kind of content 
distinction that the Court consistently has indicated 
requires heightened scrutiny is in -- well, in Burson, a 
majority court at least, you can talk about anything you 
want near the polling place but not politics.  That was 
content.  Consolidated Edison -- you can talk about

anything -- billing envelopes but not controversial 
issues.  Davenport, very recently -- from fees that 
individuals are required to pay to you -- and in this 
case we are not talking about any compelled fees -- but 
with compelled fees, you can use them for anything you 
want but not politics.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Since we are in 

confessional mode, I've never understood forum analysis. 
I don't understand how --

(Laughter.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- how you can say 

that this payroll deduction system is some kind of a 
forum.  A forum is, you know, the corner at Hyde Park or 
something.  This is -- this is something that 
governmental entities and private entities do, and they 
can either exclude this type of activity or they can't. 
And the problem with the forum analysis is it's all or 
nothing.  I mean -- and both parties seem to agree:  If 
it's a State forum, you could do it; if it's a private 
forum or if it's an open forum, you can't.  That's not 
how we usually analyze these things.

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, two points in response 
to that, Mr. Chief Justice.  First, we are not the ones 
who say that this must be looked at under forum 
analysis.  We'd be quite happy, and I think the most

sensible way actually to approach the case is that this 
is a content distinction, and it's presumptively 
invalid, and there is no sufficient justification.

 The other side says wait a minute; there is 

a line of cases that says that when there is a forum 
involved of the government, and the government is 
restricting speech in that forum, there can be an 
exception to heightened scrutiny.  In Davenport --

JUSTICE ALITO:  You say there is a 
sufficient -- presumably you concede there is a 
sufficient justification for this content-based 
restriction as to State employees.

 MR. COLLINS:  What we say as the State 

employees, Justice Alito, is that if falls under the 
Regan-Findley line of cases; that you don't even get to 
a First Amendment scrutiny because it's under the 
doctrine that when the government says we won't spend 
our money on something, that's not an infringement of 
speech in the first place.  And interestingly --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So if there is State money 

involved in these payroll systems that would be 
sufficient?

 MR. COLLINS:  If the State said you can't 
use our money for payroll deductions of this kind then 
it would arguably be into that category.  But I think

what's important to recognize --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't there -- isn't 
there some State tax money that goes to fund local 
units?  I mean, you say here there are State taxpayers' 
funds involved; therefore the State doesn't have to pay 
for what it doesn't want to buy.  But are there State 
funds that fund local government entities?

 MR. SMITH:  There is State funding, but the 
reason, I believe, why the Respondents -- excuse me the 
Petitioners -- have conceded that the subsidization case 
law does not apply to this statute in its application to 
the local governments, is that what the subsidization 
cases are talking about -- cases like Regan, Rust, 
Findley -- are situations where we'll say the State is 
involved in developing a program which it will pay for, 
and it says because we are paying for that, our 
priorities are to be honored.

 The government in this instance, it's been 
conceded, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, there is 
no actual subsidization to the payroll systems.  In 
effect the State says we have some money we give to our 
local governments -- by no means, all revenue, but they 
get some money.  But we -- the State does not set the 
kinds of budget priorities that are protected by the 
Regan line of cases.  Specifically, the State in effect

says that as far as payroll systems and in fact as far 
as most employment matters and most administrative 
matters are concerned, here's some money for you, local 
government.  The only thing we say about it is don't use 
it for political payroll deductions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but another way of 
looking at it is to say in each of these instances --
whether we are talking about the State taxing in order 
to perform functions at the State level or whether the 
State is authorizing taxation for functions for 
functions to be performed at the local level -- in all 
of these instances, the State is in the position to say 
not that it is sort of our money, but to say it is 
public money.  And our decision is that public money 
will not be used to -- by a public entity to underwrite 
political activity.

 And why isn't the State in exactly the same 
position in making that judgment, whether it's talking 
about money that goes directly into the State coffer or 
public tax money that happens to be going into a -- a 
town coffer?

 MR. COLLINS:  Because, Your Honor, I think 

the courts never applied the Regan subsidization 
analysis in that kind of --

why shouldn't --

MR. COLLINS:  It shouldn't --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why shouldn't we, on the 
theory that what is important is not which particular 
coffer the penny goes into, but the fact that it is 
public money, i.e., money being raised from taxpayers 
under a statute passed by the State authorizing 
taxation; and it is going to -- and its justification 
for taxation is the performance of public functions. 
And if the State can say it is not a proper public 
function when the money is being filtered through our 
particular treasury, why isn't it equally valid for the 
State legislature to say that when the money is being 
filtered through a local treasury?

 MR. COLLINS:  For the following reason, I 
think, Justice Souter.  That -- the doctrine that says 
when a government is refusing to subsidize something 
there is no violation in the first place in the First 
Amendment, and therefore except in the rarest, rarest of 
cases -- the rarest of cases there can be no First 
Amendment claim; that's very powerful medicine and it 
turns on the notion that -- somewhat alike but different 
from in detail the proprietor concept -- but it turns on 
the notion that the government is making judgments about 
how its money is going to be used.  It decides what it

wants its money to be used for, and we are going to 
honor that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but what you're saying 

is, I -- you're saying in effect that I -- that you 
reject my -- my hypothetical assumption here, that what 
we ought to regard as the proper characterization of the 
money is not "our" State money, but public money raised 
under a system of public taxation; and you're saying you 
should not go -- you should not characterize the funds 
that way.

 Of course that's your position --
MR. COLLINS:  No, I --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- because if you do 

characterize the funds that way, it seems to me you're 
in trouble.

 MR. COLLINS:  Now --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But why shouldn't I 

characterize them that way?

 MR. COLLINS:  The -- even characterizing --

even characterizing it that way, the reason that I think 
the analysis breaks down as to applying subsidization 
law, is that the subsidization law doctrine, 
subsidization doctrine -- Regan and those cases -- as 
the Court has explained it, it is to protect the 
prerogatives of the government that is making decisions

about how it wants particular programs to be operated.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  The State -- the State 

legislature is making a decision as to how it wants the 
-- the programs which comprise local government to be 
operated.

 MR. SMITH:  But the difference, Your Honor, 

in all of the other cases one could look at Regan and 
the like, there is a program where the government is 
involved in its manifold details.  The government 
determines the purpose of the program; it has an 
overriding interest in the program; and it says in the 
course of that, in the course of dealing with this 
program, we don't want government money to be used for 
the following things.

 If you -- if that were extended to say that 

there will be essentially no First Amendment claim 
whenever the government says as to some program that it 
has no other involvement and that it has no other 
interest in, we don't want the following speech, and 
over here we don't have the following speech --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, but the point in the 
case that you concede that the government may make that 
choice is that the government is subsidizing it by the 
activity which the government is refusing to perform. 
So it's not nearly a case of saying there shall be this

kind of speech and not that kind of speech.  In each 
instance there is a decision being made in my 
hypothetical that the government will not subsidize that 
kind of activity, that kind of speech, by using public 
money.

 MR. COLLINS:  But the difference for First 
Amendment analysis, I would submit, Your Honor, and the 
reason why I think the subsidization doctrine has been 
confined in the areas it's been confined, is when we are 
talking in this case, for example, about the State, the 
State determines whether it's going to have a payroll 
deduction system.  It determines whether it's going to 
allow deductions for charities; whether it's going to 
allow deductions for this that and the other.  It 
determines who -- who's going to administer the program, 
how expensive it's going to be, all of those things. 
Its money is going into that program and it is as to 
that program making all of these decisions about how its 
money is going to be spent.  That is -- and if the 
course of that it says we don't want this one, this 
element as part of it just as we do want charitable, we 
don't want political; maybe we don't want charitable 
either -- it is a different situation in items of basic 
First Amendment analysis, I believe, if you have a 
government that's saying we don't care anything about

government payroll systems.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Collins, may I 

interrupt you and ask you the converse of the question I 
asked your opponent?

 He conceded that it was unconstitutionally 
what you call it, content discrimination -- whatever --
to have the deduction from the private sector, but the 
counties were different; and he justified the counties 
on the ground that the State's interest in avoiding 
taking a position with regard to union matters justifies 
it.  But that's the only justification for the -- it's 
not the administrative justification -- this statute 
wasn't enacted to save the government administrative 
expenses.  The purpose of the statute is perfectly 
clear, and I'm surprised that you concede that it's 
constitutional as applied to the State government, when 
there's no evidence whatsoever that it serves the 
purpose that everybody is talking about.

 MR. COLLINS:  Your Honor, we conceded that 
reluctantly under the view that where the question is 
whether the State -- our claim against the State would 
say we are -- we are going to require the State to start 
devoting money that it doesn't want to spend as we -- we 
have chosen given the force of cases like Regan, not to 
make that contention, but to accept the ruling that the

State's refusal to spend money on its own programs is in 
a different category.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But this is not a case 

involving a State's decision not to spend the time and 
energy to do payroll deductions because they do them for 
everybody else.  It's simply based on the reason for the 
payroll deduction, which is, in your view, an 
impermissible reason.  Is that not correct.

 MR. COLLINS:  That's correct, Your Honor. 
And if it were clear that as to what kinds of reasons 
are considered impermissible under subsidization --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  How can it not be clear? 

It enacted a general statute that had the same 
justification throughout the State.  And now you're 
justifying on the ground it doesn't apply to all their 
other government activities because they allow payroll 
deductions.

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, in Davenport, Your 
Honor, the Court did indicate that a statute that 
applies to public and private, even though it's a 
unitary statute, you have to analyze it separately in 
the two contexts.

 But our point, though -- I think the point 

that is being lost, we don't see this as a question 
about what can the State do with respect to its own

operations as such and what can it do with respect to 
local government operations.  We see it as a case that 
asks the question whether a content distinction directed 
at certain kinds of political activities that would 
normally require heightened scrutiny gets the pass from 
that scrutiny because it's in a "forum"?

 And we -- our position is quite simply that 

if the State were, in fact, managing these local 
government payroll systems, which it would have a 
perfect right to do, that then it could avail itself of 
that analysis, but because it doesn't, it cannot.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I see your argument.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the State at the 
State level says this is a contentious area, we want to 
stay out of it.  We are going to be neutral.  We are 
simply not allowing payroll deduction for right to work 
clauses, for union clauses.  We don't want this.  If the 
State can say that, and your concession indicates to me 
that it can, then why can't it tell its subdivisions you 
have to be efficient, we don't want arguments from one 
city to the next city about payroll deduction that's 
going to consume the time of the city council's, the 
time of the citizens, we want to take this off the table 
for you just the way we've taken it off the table for 
us?

MR. COLLINS:  Because I think the difference 
here, Your Honor, as I understand the case law, is that 
when the State is simply saying we choose not to spend 
our own money on this activity, it does not have the 
same burden of explaining why it's made that choice that 
it has when it reaches out and says, and by the way, we 
don't want local government or even private government 
--

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course, that's 

the interest.  This is a very strong Federal interest in 
allowing the States to organize their governmental 
systems the way they choose.  Our gun control 
registration case, where we said the Federal Government 
cannot tell the counties that it has certain duties for 
gun control.

 MR. COLLINS:  And we have no quarrel at all 
with that notion.  Our position in no way dictates, in 
no way has the First Amendment dictating how a State is 
going to structure its government.  It simply says, 
look, we begin with the proposition that normally this 
restriction on public speech would be heightened to 
public scrutiny.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I -- I'm not sure 
that's right.  I'm not sure the State isn't saying we 
want to determine how our government is structured in

this respect.

 MR. COLLINS:  If the -- if the State wants 

to have a uniform law for itself -- for public 
employer -- employees, its own employees and local 
government employees because of some unitary interest 
that the State wants to pursue, there is nothing wrong 
with the state pursuing that objective.  But when it 
does it through restricting political speech, it has to 
either satisfy heightened scrutiny or come within one of 
the exceptions.

 And the distinction -- maybe I can put it 
this way, Justice Kennedy.  The reason why for First 
Amendment scrutiny analysis, there is a sharp 
distinction in this case between what the State's 
treatment of its own employees and the State treatment 
of local governments is -- I think it's basically 
threefold.

 That, first, when the State says, we don't 
choose to allow certain speech in our own forum, it is 
simply declining to facilitate speech that couldn't take 
place without an affirmative grant.  When it says to 
local governments, who in the state of nature can allow 
whatever they want in the way of speech, when it says 
that there we will not allow these kinds of deductions, 
it's blocking speech that would take place but for the

government's intervention.  And so --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'll read Russo again, but 

I didn't think Pocatello, Idaho, was part of the state 
of major.

 MR. COLLINS:  I just meant that no -- it's 
this simple, Justice Kennedy, and the point I'm trying 
to make is that for someone to get access to 
political -- to a payroll deduction system of the State 
government, it needs an affirmative grant from the 
State.  To have access to the use of payroll deduction 
from local governments, it doesn't need an affirmative 
grant from the State.  It simply needs the State not to 
interfere and reject the local government.

 So it's -- it's a different kind of action. 
But equally important, the basis for the kind of relaxed 
scrutiny that the -- that the Petitioners have argued 
for, the forum cases like Cornelius, et cetera, those 
are all situations where a government, that is, that has 
established and managed a facility is determining on a 
day-to-day basis what's the purpose of our program, what 
are we going to allow --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you help me with 

this?  Would you object if we analyzed this as a 
constitutional condition case?  I don't know that you 
would prevail or not.  But it -- the forum analysis

doesn't seem to me to quite fit.

 MR. COLLINS:  It's fine with me, but if you 
analyze it in any way that says that heightened scrutiny 
is applicable and there is no exception --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why is that?
 (Laughter.)
 MR. COLLINS -- the problem with 

constitutional condition -- if it were a condition on 
the local governments, then it's not really --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you saying -- is it 
your view that heightened scrutiny applies whenever a 
government tells any group that wants to raise money for 
political purposes in any way they want involving the 
government that it can't?

 MR. COLLINS:  No, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Okay.  I thought the 

answer would be no.

 Then, will you try to say in a sentence or 

two if the answer is it heightened scrutiny doesn't 
apply to any kind of an effort to raise money for 
political purposes where they say to the government you 
got to help me, when does it apply and when doesn't it?

 MR. COLLINS:  The -- well, there are 

exceptions to heightened scrutiny where the government 
is acting as a proprietor.  There are exceptions to

heightened scrutiny where the government --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But then you are making --

say it always applies except in a few little exceptions. 
I mean I know there is one for government speech and so 
forth.  But you're saying whenever the government tells 
a person you can't, for example, go to the city hall and 
raise money, you can't do it in the jury room, you can't 
raise money here, you can't raise money there, dah, dah, 
dah, or you can't speak there, you can't -- it's always 
heightened scrutiny?

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, if the government is 
allowing other speech it would be heightened scrutiny.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  You cannot -- you have to 

use heightened scrutiny when the FDA, for example -- you 
know, the case I wrote in -- the FDA says you cannot 
advertise on a label for a drug.  We don't want 
advertising.  We don't want advertising on the label. 
That's heightened scrutiny.

 MR. COLLINS:  It -- if it's -- if it's 
commercial speech, it might fall under a different 
standard.  It would easily pass it is the point.  I 
mean, this is no question that a lot of situations 
easily pass heightened scrutiny, and a lot of 
circumstances are an exception.  And the problem in this 
case is that the Petitioner's sole submission --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And regulation of 

government employees is the same?

 MR. COLLINS:  It basically would trigger 

the -- the heightened scrutiny except where the 
government is involved.  When the government is involved 
in managing employees in just as when it's managing a 
forum, there -- there could be a different analysis.

 But the problem -- where the shoe doesn't 
fit the Petitioner's are trying to put on this case is 
Petitioner's concede everything there is to concede 
about this case and then say but it's just like 
Cornelius, and it's just the government deciding what to 
do with its own programs.  And our point is quite simply 
that unlike every case where the court has applied 
relaxed scrutiny in a proprietary situation, this is a 
case where the government does not play any role with 
respect to the -- to limit the speech.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why are you -- why 

are you focusing on heightened scrutiny?  We have a 
whole series of cases about employee speech Darcetti and 
Pickering where it's quite different than heightened 
scrutiny, and here we are talking about the employees 
being able to deduct checkoffs from their paycheck for 
political speech?

Mr. Chief Justice?  It's correct that where a law is 
based on employee behavior, that other kinds of scrutiny 
can be involved.  Darcetti is, obviously if it's speech 
in your capacity of doing your job.

 But the Hatch Act cases, letter carriers use 
the Pickering balance.  That's not a mere reasonableness 
test by a long shot.  That's a comparison as in the 
NT -- National Treasury Employees honoraria case, same 
situation, a balancing test between the harm that's 
perceived from allowing the speech and the benefits of 
the speech to the individual.

 So, there can be that separate analysis, 
which if it were applied here, the State would also 
fail.  The State, it says it only prevails under a 
reasonableness test.  But none of those are near 
reasonableness analyses.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

Two, Respondents' theory of government with 
respect to the legislature having to speak in some kind 
of specific term, we would suggest, ignores -- would ask 
this Court to create entirely new case law.  But it also 
ignores in this situation the fact that the Idaho 
legislature contributes in 2006-2007 about half of the 
funds used by school districts in the State.  And over 
80 percent of those funds that go into what is known as 
a general maintenance and operations fund from which 
salary compensation is paid.
