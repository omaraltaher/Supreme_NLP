ORAL  ARGUMENT  BY  GREGORY  G.  KATSAS 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  Second  Circuit  extended  civil  RICO  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  involving  foreign  injuries,  foreign  enterprises, 

 

 

 

 

 

and  foreign  patterns  of  racketeering.  Its  holding  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  for  two  reasons:  First,  RICO's  private  civil 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  of  action  does  not  provide  redress  for  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injuries;  and  second,  RICO's  substantive  prohibitions  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  reach  the  infiltration  and  corruption  of  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprises. 

            

As  to  the  first  point,  Respondents  have  now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abandoned  any  allegation  of  domestic  injury.  That  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fatal  to  their  case  because  Section  1964(c),  the  private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  of  action  in  RICO,  is  limited  to  domestic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injuries.  Two  related  and  mutually  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  ­­ if  the  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  ­­ the  statute  doesn't  say  "domestic  injury,"  does

it? 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  The  statute  ­­ statute  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"injury,"  Justice  Ginsburg,  by  application  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  against  extraterritoriality.  Injury  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

focus  of  Section  1964(c),  and  therefore,  injury  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  to  domestic  application  absent  a  clear 

   

 

 

 

 

indication  to  the  contrary. 

 

 

 

            

That  is  a  straightforward  application  of 

   

 

 

 

this  Court's  decision  in  Morrison,  which  says  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identify  the  focus  of  the  provision  before  you,  and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit  it  to  domestic  application  unless  Congress  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  you're  making  a 

  

 

 

 

 

distinction  between  RICO  when  the  government  is  using  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  prosecutorial  tool  ­­ tool,  and  RICO  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Yes.  Yes.  We  are  making  a 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

distinction  between  Section  1962,  which  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying  criminal  prohibition,  and  Section  1964(c), 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  the  private  civil  right  of  action.  Different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  and  statutes  can  have  different  foci,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Morrison  itself  made  clear  in  separately  analyzing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  30  and  Section  10(b)  of  the  '34  Securities  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  here  the  difference  between  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  prohibition  and  the  private  right  of  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  clear  from  this  Court's  private  right  of  action

jurisprudence  over  the  last  30  or  40  years  which  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  the  decision  to  prohibit  certain  underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  is  fundamentally  different  from  the  decision  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  a  private  right  of  action  for  violation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  law. 

 

            

That's  why  Section  1964(c)  has  a  different 

   

 

 

 

 

focus.  You  don't  automatically  assume  that  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  criminalized  the  conduct,  it  intended  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  right  of  action  to  follow  along  to  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Katsas,  can  I  ask  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

question  that  ­­ this  is  an  analytical  question,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  at  all  an  argument  that  your  result  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong,  but  I  ­­ I  guess  I'm  confused  by  what  you  said 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  and  what  you  say  in  the  briefs  that  this  is  a  matter 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  looking  to  the  focus  of  the  statute,  because  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  of  Morrison  is  that  this  whole  focus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry  came  in  at  the  second  step  of  the  analysis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  other  words,  once  the  Court  had  decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  presumption  against  extraterritoriality  had  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  rebutted,  then  there  was  an  additional  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  had  been  made  like,  oh,  this  really  does  involve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  conduct.  And  so  the  Court  used  this  focus  test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  decide  whether  it  was  the  domestic  conduct  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritorial  conduct  that  was  the  focus  of  the

statute.  But  that  doesn't  seem  to  answer  the  question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  presumption  is  rebutted  at  all,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  seem  to  answer  the  question  that  I  think  you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  get  at,  and  it's  an  important  question,  as  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  we  look  at  that  presumption  question  section  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section  or  for  the  statute  as  a  whole. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  I  think  the  ­­ the  rule  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

emerges  from  Morrison  is  that  what  ­­ what  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  is  the  statutory  focus.  Morrison  is  Section 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10(b),  and  there  were  two  choices.  There's  the  element 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  deception,  and  there's  the  element  of  the  securities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction.  And  it's  foreign  transaction,  domestic 

  

 

 

 

 

deception.  And  the  Court  says  no  ­­ no  clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indication. 

            

Congress  can  obviously  provide  for  or 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibit  extraterritorial  application  if  they  do  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly.  If  they  don't  do  that  clearly  and  ­­ and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  is  going  to  operate,  you  have  to  figure  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  focus  of  the  statute  is  one  element  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.  And  they  said  the  focus  is  the  transaction  and, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  that  is  what  has  to  be  domestic,  and  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  transaction  in  Morrison  was  foreign,  the  application 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  statute  was  impermissibly  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  ­­ I  guess  I  just  would 

    

   

   

 

 

have  thought  that  the  question  is  whether  these  are

whole  is  even  if,  you  know,  one  could  ­­ if  one  could

MR.  KATSAS:  There  ­­ there  will  always  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  ­­ if  you  have  related  provisions,  there  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  be  a  question  of  whether  the  ­­ the  focus  of  one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

element  in  a  statute  carries  over  to  the  other. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  case  on  the  ­­ on  the  question  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury,  the  issue  before  you  is  whether  Section  1964(c), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  private  right  of  action,  has  its  own  focus  or

Kagan  is  talking  about,  Appendix  B  of  the  government's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief,  1837  U.S.C.  37(b),  jurisdiction  over  acts  of

Now,  that  ­­ I  can  understand  why  they  would

RICO  unless  they  wanted  somebody  who  was  hurt  to  be  able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  damages? 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Well,  the  person  ­­ the  person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  was  hurt  ­­ as  to  the  injury  part  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  injury  is  to  somebody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  foreign  airport. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  The  person  ­­ the  person  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffers  injury  from  violation  of  that  Act  can't  recover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  RICO,  because  RICO  is  limited  to  recovery  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business  or  property.  Pursuant  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Look,  business  is  hurt. 

  

 

 

 

 

They  blew  up  an  airport  in  ­­ in  Tasmania.  Okay?  So  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  I  guess  that  blowing  up  an  airport  there  could  hurt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody.  But  my  question  is,  what  was  it  doing  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RICO,  if  in  fact  Congress  doesn't  intend  a  foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  hurt  to  be  able  to  get  damages?  It's  already  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime. 

            

            

MR.  KATSAS:  RICO  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  my  ­­ and  maybe  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  wrong  example.  Think  of  ­­ they  have  a  list  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  50. 

 

            

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  So  some  of  them,  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  ask  this  question  to:  What's  it  doing  in  RICO

unless  they  want  somebody  to  get  damages? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  It  ­­ there  are  something  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  order  of  200  predicate  statutes  that  are  in  RICO. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  Solicitor  General's  appendix  has  ­­ cites  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  of  them,  which  have  extraterritorial  application. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All  but  seven  of  those  statutes  have  domestic,  as  well 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  extraterritorial  application,  including  the  one  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  read. 

 

            

When  you  look  at  the  government's  appendix, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  many  of  those  statutes  do  is  they  take  a  statute, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  has  domestic  application,  and  then  there's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  that  extends  it  extraterritorially.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

what's  quoted  in  the  government's  brief  is  the  extension 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  extraterritorial  application. 

 

 

            

So  I  think  what  your  question  goes  to  is, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  what  about  the  ­­ what  about  statutes  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively  extraterritorial?  There  are  seven  of  them. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Only  ­­ only  one  of  them  out  of  the  200  RICO  predicates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  specifically  mentioned  in  RICO  as  one  statute  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  should  apply. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  So  your  point 

  

  

 

 

 

granted  is  one  word  ­­ three  words.  Your  answer  to  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  four  words:  It  was  an  accident. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

That's 

the  answer. 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  No.  I'm  not  saying  it  was  an

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  then,  if  it  was  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  accident  ­­ I  mean,  explain  to  me  the  same  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  want  to  repeat  the  same  question  five  times.

MR.  KATSAS:  All  ­­ all  but  ­­ the  vast 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Listen,  let's  look  at  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ones  that  were  not,  that  are  the  seven,  or  if  you  want, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  three.  Why  would  a  human  being  ­­ now  you've  got  my 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Why  is  it  in  RICO  if  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  want  damages? 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Let's  ­­ let's  talk  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  that  I  mentioned.  It's  18  U.S.C.  2260,  that  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

addresses  child  ­­ child  pornography  offenses  abroad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  an  intent  to  import  into  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  provision  has  perfectly  meaningful 

 

 

 

 

application  for  people  who  suffer  ­­ people  who  suffer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  injuries,  and  for  United  States  enterprises  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  racketeers  who  could  use  domestic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprises  to  violate  that  provision. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  even  if  I  were  wrong  about  that,  Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  I  don't  think  you  would  use  the  one  provision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  200  as  the  basis  for  saying  that  the  ­­ the

statute  that  on  it  ­­ in  the  heartland  of  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application  will  do  lots  and  lots  and  lots  of  meaningful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  when  it's  applied  to  domestic  injuries. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  related  point,  this  isn't  just  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption  against  extraterritoriality.  We  also  have 

  

 

 

 

 

the  background  common  law  rule  that  causes  of  action  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redress  private  injuries  are  governed  by  the  law  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place  of  the  injury.  Here  we  have  only  foreign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injuries.  Congress  legislates  against  the  background 

  

 

 

 

 

common  law  rule,  and  just  as  the  cause  of  action  in  RICO 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picks  up  background  common  law  rules,  approximate  cause, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  too  it  picks  up  this  lex  loci  delicti  rule,  again 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absent  some  clear  indication  to  the  contrary. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  you  look  for  a  clear  indication  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  question  of  injury,  not  only  don't  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  a  clear  indication  of  the  contrary,  you  find  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  findings  in  RICO  a  ­­ a  repeated  and  specific 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  exclusive  focus  on  the  domestic  effects  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racketeering. 

            

Congress  has  identified  its  concern.  It  is

racketeering.  Certainly  no  clear  indication  to  extend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  cause  of  action  to  foreign  harms.

all  these  amendments  that  happened  after  9/11  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  seemed  focus  on  foreign  conduct,  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organization,  foreign  harm? 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  There's  ­­ there  is  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

amendment  that  is  cited,  it's  the  Patriot  Act,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  one  thing  to  RICO.  It  expands  the  list  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate  statutes  to  include  one  provision.  It's  2230 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ 2332b(g)(5)(B).  It's  a  reference  to  that  statute. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

When  you  go  to  that  statute,  it's  a  list.  The  list  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  or  so  terrorism­related  predicate  crimes.  58  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  crimes  have  domestic  application. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  possibly  they  have 

  

 

 

 

 

some  domestic  application.  But  if  you  ask,  but  why  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  pass  this  amendment  at  this  particular  moment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  time,  what  was  ­­ I  mean,  recognizing  that  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  hard  to  figure  out  what  was  in  people's  heads, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  don't  you  think  that  what  was  in  Congress's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heads  at  that  moment  in  time  was  foreign  terrorist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

organizations  committing  terrorist  conduct  on  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

soil? 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  We  ­­ we  don't  know  for  sure. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll  give  you  another  possibility,  which  is  what  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  in  mind  was  the  September  11  attacks,  which  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  acts  of  racketeering.  When  they  incorporated 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  list  that  I  mentioned,  the  very  first  statute  on

even  as  to  that. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KATSAS:  I'm  sorry? 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  at  least  suggests 

  

 

 

 

 

foreign  organizations.

explains  the  incorporation  of  the  ­­ of  the  predicates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relative  to  the  events  of  September  11,  but  in  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

event,  with  respect,  I  don't  think  that's  the  right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  because  where  the  presumption  applies,  either

discussing,  or  on  the  question  of  enterprise  versus

identify  the  focus  and  then  you  need  a  clear  indication 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  statute  to  the  contrary.

MR.  KATSAS:  I  think  the  ­­ the  underlying 

    

 

 

 

 

 

acts  would  be  criminally  prosecuted  and  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punished  very  severely.  RICO  ­­ if  I  understand  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical,  the  organization  is  foreign.  In  our  view, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

RICO  doesn't  cover  that.  Here's  ­­ here's  why. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Either  civilly  or 

  

 

 

 

criminally? 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Correct,  because  now  if  I'm  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  turning  to  Section  1962.  Our  position  is  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focus  is  on  the  enterprise.  And  I  understand  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  to  be  a  foreign  enterprise  doing  a  lot  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

very  bad  things. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  doing  bad  things  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.  citizens.  It's  the  example  the  ­­ the  section  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  that  a  crime  is  2332(a)(1). 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  And  ­­ and  2332(a)(1)  would  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutable  by  the  government.  And  the  people  who  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  bad  things  probably  would  face  the  death 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  it  ­­ so  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

saying  only  the  act  itself  you  can't  superimpose  RICO, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  has  been  a  whole  pattern  of  these. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

They've  cut  of  a  hundred  heads.

enterprise,  that's  right,  and  here's  why. 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Because  you 

 

­­ you  have  to  evaluate  that  hypothetical  in  the  context 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  RICO.  The  hypothetical  is  designed  to  make  it  hard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  me  to  make  it  seem  as  though  the  enterprise  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad  actor. 

 

            

But  under  Section  1962(c),  the  enterprise  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  victim  of  the  corrupting  conduct.  Even  in  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical,  the  enterprise  is  legally  distinct  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  ­­ person  is  the  defendant  ­­ the  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  the  corrupting.  Moreover,  the  hypothetical  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

described,  the  pattern  itself  is  not  actionable  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RICO. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  ­­ Judge  Lynch,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ in  his  opinion  on  the  en  banc,  he  said,  "Any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  that  suggests  the  operatives  of  a  foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

enterprise  can't  be  held  accountable  under  RICO  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pattern  of  predicate"  ­­ "a  pattern  of  predicate  crimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  violate  Federal  statutes"  ­­

 

 

 

 

  

"Federal  statutes 

 

that  have  an  express  extraterritorial  reach  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

astonish  the  Congress  that  made  such  violations  RICO 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicates." 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Because  the  focus  of 

  

 

 

 

 

Section  1962  is  the  enterprise,  and  under  Morrison  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprise  has  to  be  domestic,  absent  a  clear  indication 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  contrary.

All  of  those  predicate  crimes  are  addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  underlying  criminal  statutes.  RICO  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prohibit  the  pattern.  What  it  prohibits  is  infiltration 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  corruption  of  the  enterprise. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Think  about  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  mean,  the  whole  point  of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

RICO  is  that  it  does  both.  It  says  "a  pattern  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct,"  and  it  links  that  pattern  of  conduct  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprise.  And  it  seems  to  be,  you  know,  a  little  bit 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  fool's  errand  to  decide  which  the  focus  is,  when  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  RICO  is  clearly  something  that  melds  the  two  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  there  is  a  pattern  of  conduct  and  it  relates  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

various  kinds  of  ways  to  an  enterprise. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Perhaps,  but  you  could  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  the  same  thing  about  Morrison,  under  which  you  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  deception  and  a  securities  transaction  in  order  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  Section  10(b)  violation.  So  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  the  fact  that  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

things  can  be  separated  doesn't  mean  that  everything  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  separated.  And  the  question  is,  how  is  it  possible 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  understand  RICO  except  as  something  in  which  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  are  intermelded,  and  at  the  very  least  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  is  not  prior  to  the  other  or  more  important  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.

MR.  KATSAS:  Congress  has  ­­ Congress  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

told  you  in  the  statutory  findings  what  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned  about.  It  is  infiltration  and  corruption  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  enterprises.  Consistent  with  that  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

structure  of  Section  1962,  three  different  provisions; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  each  of  them,  the  enterprise  ­­ the  enterprise  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim  of  the  corruption.  It's  not  the  person  doing  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corrupting. 

            

It's  particularly  obvious  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

Sections  1962(a)  and  1962(b),  right?  The  racketeer  uses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeds  to  invest  in  an  enterprise.  Enterprise  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victim.  That's  the  object  of  Congress's  concern.  Even 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

with  regard  to  1964(c),  the  typical  case  they  have  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind  is  infiltration  and  corruption  of  a  domestic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

enterprise,  straight  out  of  the  findings. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  you  would  ­­ you  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  ­­ I  mean,  the  ­­ another  example  doesn't  say  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ the  ­­ the  Sicilian  Mafia  commits  a  series  of  violent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  in  the  United  States  that  would  violate  RICO  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed  by  a  New  York­based  Mafia  family.  But  ­­ so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  New  York­based  Mafia  family,  RICO  applies. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sicilian­based  does  the  very  same  act;  doesn't  apply.

MR.  KATSAS:  The  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That  is  your  position, 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  KATSAS:  That's  right.  The  ­­ the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

right? 

            

concern  about  the  crimes  is  addressed  by  other  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  criminalize  the  conduct.  When  the  Sicilian  Mafia 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

commits  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  not  the  pattern. 

  

 

 

 

 

It's  just  that  the  statute  gets  at  after  the  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance.  RICO  says  when  you  have  a  pattern,  things  are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  lot  tougher  for  you. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  So  it  says  ­­ says  when  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  pattern,  that  impacts  an  enterprise. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  I  could  just  get  on  the  table  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  the  1964(c)  issue  with  regard  to  domestic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enterprises.  The  paradigmatic  case  that  Congress  has  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind,  the  racketeers  infiltrate  the  union,  use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racketeering  proceeds  to  take  it  over  ­­ that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1964(a)  violation  ­­ and  then  they  use  the  union  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad  things,  to  extort  money  from  its  members  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever.  That's  a  case  in  which  the  union  is  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

vehicle  for  racketeering,  but  it's  not  the  racketeer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  the  victim  of  criminal  conduct.  The  conducting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  affairs  of  the  union  in  that  way  is  an  example  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corrupting  conduct.

I'd  ­­ I'd  like  to  just  get  one  more  thought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  table  on  the  injury  point  before  I  sit  down, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  this  Court's  decision  in  Empagran,  where  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  the  presumption  and  related  principles  of  comity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  case  involving  a  ­­ foreign  injuries  caused  by 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

primarily  foreign  conduct.  And  you  said  it  would  be  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable  to  do  that  as  to  violate  customary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international  law.  That  is  exactly  what  we  have  here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  you  look  at  the  complaint,  the  underlying  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Respondents  say  injured  them  are  a  series  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  transactions,  and  you  can  resolve  this  case

prosecutions  and  RICO  civil  actions. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  as  some  of  those  questions  have  pointed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out,  there  are  a  number  of  predicates  that  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated  into  RICO,  into  the  definition  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racketeering  activity,  that  have  extraterritorial 

 

 

 

 

applications.  Some  of  them  have  solely  extraterritorial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

applications.  And  that  is  a  clear  indication  that  RICO 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

itself  extends  extraterritorially  to  the  extent  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicates  that  are  alleged  in  the  case  do.  And  that  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

true  both  of  the  pattern  itself,  the  conduct  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes,  and  also  of  the  enterprise.  And  you  can  see 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  if  you  look  at  the  kinds  of  predicates  that  we  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  here. 

 

 

            

As  was  observed  earlier,  many  of  them  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated  into  RICO  after  9/11.  Many  of  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  terrorist  conduct.  And  the  natural  way  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  the  provisions  would  operate  and  Congress  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  understood  this  is  that  they  would  have  swept  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activities  by  foreign  enterprises  as  well  as  the  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  itself.  We've  given  a  number  of  examples  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

those  kinds  of  provisions  in  our  brief:  The  killing  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  U.S.  national  abroad,  taking  U.S.  hostages  abroad, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shooting  at  aircraft  with  U.S.  citizens  abroad  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

missile  systems. 

 

            

There  is  another  example  that  is,  I  think,  a

very  clear  one,  that  is  Section  2339D,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receiving  military­type  training  from  a  foreign 

   

 

 

 

terrorist  organization.  Although  I  suppose  it  is 

   

  

 

 

 

possible  that  somebody  could  go  and  receive  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

training  in  connection  with  their  activities  with  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  enterprise,  the  very  natural  operation  of  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  is  going  to  be  that  they  are  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carrying  out  the  affairs  of  a  foreign  enterprise  ­­ in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  a  very  foreign  terrorist  organization  ­­ that  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding  the  military­type  training  and  has  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

training  camps. 

 

            

And  so  we  think  that  it's  clear  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  has  ­­ that  Section  1962  has  extraterritorial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicability,  both  with  respect  to  the  foreign  pattern 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  conduct  and  with  respect  to  the  enterprise,  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent  that  a  predicate  with  extraterritorial 

   

 

 

 

applicability  is  implicated. 

 

 

            

I've  heard  Petitioners  talk  about  two 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  why  they  think  that  might  not  be  true,  both  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  I  think  are  incorrect.  One  is  that  the  government 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  just  prosecute  the  underlying  crimes  themselves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  not  use  RICO,  and  the  other  is  that  ­­ well,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations  in  which  you  have  some  people  in  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States,  you  could  kind  of  break  them  off  and  call  them  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic  enterprise.  And  I  don't  think  either  of  those

is  a  workable  approach  to  Section  1962. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  just  prosecuting  the 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying  crimes,  of  course  the  very  point  of  RICO  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  thought,  where  there  were  patterns  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious  crimes,  that  just  prosecuting  the  crime  itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  a  strong  enough  tool  for  the  government,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  important  for  the  government  to  have  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  advantages  that  RICO  confirms  in  order  to  root 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  the  things  that  are  causing  these  patterns  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  RICO  imposes,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me,  as  we've  even  observed  in  the  domestic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context,  far  more  significant  ­­ the  impact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

internationally  could  be  far  more  significant  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution  simply  of  the  underlying  offenses.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  provides  the  government  with  extremely  strong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutorial  reach  and  penalties,  far  beyond  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  elements  do.  And  I'm  wondering  why  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  cause  us  to  be  more  concerned  with  respect  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  comity  interests  that  are  at  stake  when  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  extraterritorial  applicability. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well,  I  think,  as  this 

   

  

 

 

 

Court  observed  in  Empagran,  when  you're  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  1962  or  something  like  Section  1962,  where  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  that  is  choosing  whether  to  prosecute  or

whether  to  bring  a  civil  action,  the  government  has  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability,  it  has  the  incentive,  to  take  those  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns  into  account  and  to  regulate  itself,  either  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  constrained  in  bringing  that  kind  of  action  where  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  cause  some  comity  concerns,  or  to  deal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government­to­government  with  another  government,  to  try 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  sure  that  those  comity  concerns  are  smoothed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over.  It's  on  the  private  side,  under  Section  1964(c), 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  have  private  parties  bringing  treble  damages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions,  that  the  concerns  about  comity,  I  think,  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  greater,  because  private  parties  don't  have  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  ability  or  incentive  to  regulate.  When  they  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bringing  actions,  they  are  trying  to  get  their  treble 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  I  thought  this  was 

   

  

 

 

 

the  same  question,  but  I'm  elaborating  a  bit  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  both  for  you  and  Mr.  Frederick's  reading. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  thought  the  answer  to  my  first  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  that  the  government  just  wanted  the  forfeiture 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  ­­ that's  why  it  put  them  in  ­­ or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  provisions  ­­ that's  why  it  put  these  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  in  ­­ and  you  say,  that's  right.  You  say,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  want  the  damages  to  extend  abroad.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  position. 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Yes.  That's  correct.

laundering  ­­ the  EU  countries,  at  least  three,  were  in

to  have  their  legal  departments  over  in  Germany  look  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  actual  effect  would  be  of  the  damages?  Or  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  the  EU  that  bore  total  responsibility  for  this  matter

Germany  or  some  other  place?  I  mean,  how  did  it  work? 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well,  to  my  knowledge,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  have  those  consultations,  although  I  understand 

   

 

 

 

 

that  the  EU  informed  the  Justice  Department  before  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed  the  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  did  it  consult  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  three?  You  see  where  I'm  going,  and  I'd  like  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best  answer  ­­

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well,  I  think  that  this  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a  very  unusual  case  where  you  have  foreign  sovereigns  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  private  RICO  plaintiffs.  I  think  that  won't  usually 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  true.  And  the  rule  that  we  are  coming  in  here  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advance  is  going  to  be  the  rule  for  the  usual  case,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well  as  the  unusual  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  although  it  may  be  that,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  EU  has  special  views  about  comity  concerns  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it's  the  plaintiff,  in  the  usual  case  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff  is  going  to  be  a  private  party,  and  it's  going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  a  situation  in  which  the  conduct  and  the  injury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

took  place  somewhere  else.  And  the  country  where  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  and  that  injury  took  place  may  very  well  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  own  interest  in  regulating,  may  not  be  appreciative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  plaintiffs  being  able  to  come  to  the  United  States  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  remedies  here,  particularly  treble  damages  remedies, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which,  as  this  Court  pointed  out  in  Empagran,  is

something  that  often  causes  foreign  countries  a  great 

   

 

 

 

 

 

deal  of  consternation  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That's  ­­ why  isn't  forum 

  

 

 

 

 

 

non  conveniens  the  answer  to  that?  If  ­­ if  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  is,  where  should  ­­ who  should  provide  a  remedy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  this  conduct,  and  if  it's  ­­ really  is  centered  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  other  state,  a  forum  non  conveniens  motion  should 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  ­­ should  be  made  to  dismiss  the  action,  because  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  far  more  appropriate  forum  abroad. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  This  Court  suggested  in 

  

 

 

 

 

Empagran  that  going  case­by­case  with  this  kinds  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  kinds  of  comity  concerns  was  too  burdensome  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too  difficult  for  courts,  and  it  would  be  better  to  make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  blanket  judgment  about  the  comity  concerns  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  cause  of  action  as  a  whole.  And  here,  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course,  we're  talking  not  only  about  what  court  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  in,  but  what  law  is  going  to  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  courts  in  the  United  States  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  closed  to  RICO  plaintiffs  if  they  can't  bring  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  claim  for  treble  damages  under  Section  1964(c). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  may  be  other  kinds  of  claims  that  they  can  bring. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  is  a  question  about  whether,  under  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

particular  Federal  statute,  there  is  a  recovery  that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

­­ that's  permissible.  And  ­­

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Well,  all  ­­ I  was  just 

   

  

 

 

 

 

going  to  say  that  in  addition  to  comity  concerns,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  there  are  other  things  that  point  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direction  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  then,  can  I  interrupt 

   

  

 

 

 

and  talk  about  your  comity  concerns,  because  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  them.  I  mean,  they  seem  very  important.  But 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

once  you  say  that  the  presumption  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritorial  is  rebutted,  on  both  the  pattern  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

racketeering  and  the  enterprise,  once  you  say  that,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawing  the  line  where  you  draw  it  seems  to  be  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policyish.  There  doesn't  seem  to  be  a  whole  lot  of  law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behind  it.  So  I  want  to  give  you  an  opportunity  to  make 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  as  law­like  as  you  can,  drawing  the  line  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  GOLDENBERG:  Sure.  There  are  a  number 

   

  

  

 

 

of  things,  I  think.  One  is  that  just  on  the  face  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions,  you  can  see  that  Section  1964(c)  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co­extensive  with  ­­ with  Section  1962.  Congress  chose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  provide  for  recovery  only  for  injury  to  business  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property,  not  for  personal  injury,  even  though  many  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  predicates  might  be  likely  to  cause  personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury. 

            

In  addition  to  that,  I  think  you  have  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

comity  concerns,  which  are  an  important  underpinning  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  presumption  against  extraterritoriality.  And  as

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  DAVID  C.  FREDERICK 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice,  and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  European  Union  and  26  of  its  Member 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  brought  this  case  in  the  United  States  against  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  corporation  for  the  actions  it  committed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  United  States  and  from  the  United  States,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  effects  in  Europe.  This  was  a  completely  logical 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  natural  place  for  this  case  to  be  brought  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  is  that?  Why  is  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

so,  Mr.  Frederick?  Isn't  it  rather  strange  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

countries  in  Europe,  Member  States  of  the  European 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Union,  are  suing  in  the  courts  of  the  United  States  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injuries  sustained  to  their  business  interests  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Europe?  Why  didn't  they  just  sue  in  their  own  courts? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  first,  the  fact  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

RJR  has  no  subsidiary  in  Europe  raised  a  question  of

personal  jurisdiction  that  would  have  affected  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceability  of  judgments.  And  you  had  an  issue  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  had  26  Member  States  that  were  being  affected,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  logical  place  for  them  in  working  together  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  United  States  court. 

 

 

 

 

            

For  precisely  the  reason  that  when  the  legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisor  in  1982  testified  after  this  Court's  Pfizer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  about  the  applicability  and  reciprocity  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  foreign  countries  come  to  United  States  courts, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legal  advisor  testified  that  the  United  States  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  cases  in  over  50  jurisdictions  around  the  world. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well  ­­ well,  are  you  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ the  law  of  personal  jurisdiction  in  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Member  States  of  the  European  Union  is  similar  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  the  United  States,  that  they  would  not  ­­ under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  laws,  they  would  say  they  do  not  have  personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  over  RJR? 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Justice  Alito,  what  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

saying  is  that  it  varies  among  the  Member  States.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  do  know  is  the  defendant,  the  evidence,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses  are  here  in  the  United  States,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegation  is  that  they  violated  U.S.  law.  And  it  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  kind  of  action  that  the  United  States  has

MR.  FREDERICK:  Thank  you  for  asking  me  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  We  presented  information  to  the  U.S. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

officials  before  the  suit  was  filed,  and  were  told  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  U.S.  would  be  neutral  as  to  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Furthermore,  I  can  tell  you  that  in  20  years 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  practicing  before  this  Court,  this  is  the  single  most

The  victim  is  an  American;  the  defendant  is  an  American, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  perpetrator;  there  is  effect  on  U.S.  interests;  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  conduct  that  occurs  in  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Every  one  of  those  four  components  tracks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  an  important  principle  of  international  law.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritoriality  principle,  the  nationality 

 

 

 

principle,  the  passive  protective  personality  principle, 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  protective  personality. 

 

 

 

            

So  these  issues  are  things  that  Congress  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering  and  was  aware  of  when  it  made  the  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  extend  these  crimes  extraterritorially  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  if  ­­ if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  ­­ it  posed  a  domestic

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  If  you  prevail,  and  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  case  with  mostly  foreign  conduct  and  foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

injuries,  and  if  personal  jurisdiction  and  forum  non 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveniens  are  satisfied,  then  these  actions  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  under  RICO  in  foreign  courts,  correct?

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  In  foreign  courts. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  FREDERICK:  Well,  not  under  RICO.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

don't  think  that  a  foreign  government  or  foreign  country 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  using  the  law  ­­

suit  in  English  court  and  invoke  RICO. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Not  that  I'm  aware  of. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Why  not? 

  

 

 

MR.  FREDERICK:  Because  I'm  not  aware 

  

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  the  English  courts  would  apply  RICO  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  I  have  no  brief  to  defend,  Justice  Kennedy,  in 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  respect. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  you're  saying  it 

  

 

 

 

 

applies  extraterritorially. 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  No,  what  ­­ what  it  does, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy,  and  this  is  why  it's  actually  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  go  through  statute  by  statute  all  of  the  provisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Solicitor  General's  appendix,  and  we've  got  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

binder  that's  got  every  single  one  of  them,  and  you  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask  me  about  every  one. 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress  imposed  a  domestic  proof 

   

 

 

requirement  as  to  every  extension  of  extraterritoriality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  those  crimes.  The  victim  had  to  be  an  American.

The  defendant  had  to  be  an  American.  Conduct  had  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occur  in  the  United  States  or  there  had  to  be  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  interest  of  the  United  States  that  was  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stake.  If  those  four  elements  were  not  required  or  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  statute,  then  it  would  not  track  with  the

respect  through  comity  the  regulations  of  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emanating  from  the  shores  of  that  country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  thought  the  victim 

    

 

 

 

 

here  was  the  European  Community. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  It  is,  but  the  Defendant  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  American  and  conduct  was  occurring  here  in  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States.  And  if  you  look  at  the  money  laundering 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  Mr.  Chief  Justice  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  I  just 

    

  

 

 

 

thought  earlier  you  were  citing  it.  You  said  the  victim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  One  of  those  four  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Oh,  it's  just  one. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  All  I'm  saying  is  one  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four.  Here  we  have  two  of  them.  If  you  look  at  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  laundering  statute,  conduct  occurred  in  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  and  the  defendant  was  in  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national.  And  so  international  law  is  satisfied. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Comity  principles  are  satisfied.

In  those  cases,  like  the  Alien  Tort  Statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  did  not  have  a  cause  of  action  that  had  been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafted  by  Congress  and  so,  therefore,  you  did  not  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  legislative  determination  of  the  effect  on  comity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  internationally,  you're  left  with  a  situation 

   

 

 

 

 

where  you  had  judge­made  law,  and  this  Court,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriately,  followed  the  guidance  and  advice  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  nations  which  said,  be  careful  how  far  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extend  judge­made  law. 

 

 

            

There  is  a  different  principle  at  stake  when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  considered  legislative  judgment  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

limitation  on  that  extraterritorial  impact  is  one  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  a  very  clear  tie  to  the  United  States. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You  ­­ you  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

easily  ­­ you  can  easily  envision  situations  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private  parties  prosecuting  RICO  actions  for  ­­ against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

European  entities  might  implicate  serious  comity 

 

 

 

 

 

concerns  whether  the  racketeering  enterprise  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State­owned  actor  or  an  ­­ an  entity  that's  strongly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supported  by  the  ­­ the  government.  And  in  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations,  how  would  comity  concerns  of  the  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  be  taken  into  account  in  the  private  treble 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages  action?

a  lot  of  them.

racketeering  activity  that  goes  to  the  illegal

MR.  FREDERICK:  Yes. 

  

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So,  I  mean,  what

otherwise  legitimate  enterprise. 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  But,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  that  if  you  look  at  each  one  of  the  acts  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  incorporated  and  has  an  extraterritorial  component, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  direct  tie  to  the  United  States,  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  have  to  be  unindictable  under  Federal  or  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

So  with  respect,  I  think  what  you're 

   

 

 

 

 

hypothesizing  is  a  situation  that  would  be  a  null  set, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  that's  where  these  crimes  are  occurring  in  Europe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  European  member  State  laws,  and  somehow  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  a  tie  in  to  RICO,  that  wouldn't  be  possible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  a  plain  reading  of  the  RICO  statute. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Because  it's  only  the 

  

 

 

 

 

statute  that  has  the  extraterritorial  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritoriality  built  into  them. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Most  statutes  that  are  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  that  are  punishable  under  RICO  will  have  ­­ will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  the  extraterritorial  provision  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying  statute. 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  correct.  There  are 

  

  

 

 

 

roughly  three­quarters  of  the  statutes  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated  into  RICO  that  do  not  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritorial  effect,  and  those  would  not  be  subject

to  a  RICO  case  that  would  have  extraterritorial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

consequences. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Candidly,  is  ­­ why  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  EU  suing  here?  Does  it  have  something  to  do  with  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  else  having  a  treble  damage  provision  like  RICO? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  Actually,  treble  damages  are 

  

 

 

 

 

not  at  all  the  reason  why  this  case  was  brought  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States.  And,  in  fact,  if  you  want  me  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stipulate  that  we  will  not  accept  treble  damages,  I've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  authorized  by  my  clients  to  say  that  that  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we  are  seeking  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

What  we  are  seeking  here  is  a  situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where  an  American  company  is  operating  through  largely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illegal  cutouts  and  middlemen  and  organized  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operators  in  Europe  and  in  the  Mediterranean  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violating  and  affecting  European  enterprises. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  complaint  in  this  case,  which  is  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detailed  with  respect  to  the  introduction  of  cigarettes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  and  marketed  in  the  United  States  are  targeted  to

countries  and  into  Europe  through  organized  crime  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  cartel  operators.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Unless  there  is  something  to

understanding  of  ­­ of  the  law  of  a  lot  of  the  European

MR.  FREDERICK:  Justice  Alito,  if  ­­ if  the

If  I  could  turn  to  the  injury  question,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

RICO  statute  incorporated  language  of  the  Clayton  Act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which,  before  1970,  had  been  construed  to  permit  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  to  come  into  the  United  States  and  obtain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  damages  as  a  result  of  U.S.  violations  by  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company  in  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  Continental  Ore  case,  which  was  decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  this  Court  in  1962,  is  directly  on  point.  That  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holds  that  injury  suffered  by  Canadian  entities  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  in  and  come  into  the  United  States  and  get  damages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  result  of  the  violation  of  the  Clayton  Act. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  Pfizer,  the  government  of  India,  coupled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  governments  in  Iran  and  the  Philippines,  came  to

question  that  ­­ can  you,  when  ­­ when  you  sue  ­­ the  EU

And  what  the  crime  is,  is  money  laundering,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  laundering  took  place  in  Belgium,  and  you  win. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now,  can  you  go  to  Belgium  and  get  the  damages?  You

see? 

            

There  are  six  Belgium  banks.  They  are  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accused.  They  are  unindicted  co­conspirators. 

  

 

 

 

And  under  this  ­­ does  this  statute  allow  a  ­­ the  EU  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  to  Philadelphia,  find  RJR,  accuse  them  of  money 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laundering  with  unindicted  co­conspirators  in  Brussels, 

 

 

 

 

 

get  damages,  and  then  go  to  Brussels  and  collect  them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  other  banks? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  I  ­­ I  would  assume  that  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Belgium  courts  ­­ and  I'm  not  going  to  profess  to  be  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert  on  the  enforceability  of  judgments  in  Belgium, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer,  and  so  I  give  you  that  answer. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  do  they  get  a  judgment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

against  the  foreign  bank? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  To  get  a  ­­ well,  presuming 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  there  was  personal  jurisdiction  in  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States,  assume  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  The  EU  ­­ the  jurisdiction 

  

 

 

 

 

 

only  against  RJR  unindicted  co­conspirators  or  helpers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever. 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  I  ­­ I  don't  know  the  answer 

    

   

 

 

 

 

to  your  question. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  think  they  are  worried 

    

 

 

 

 

about  something  like  this.  I  think  that's  what  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  Department  is  worried  about.

MR.  FREDERICK:  Here  is  the  answer,  though.
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  answer  is  that  if  those  Belgium  banks  are  in  a
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy  with  RJR,  it  surely  cannot  be  the  case  that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.  law  does  not  cover  RJR.
 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  there  is  a  question  about  the
 

   

 

 

 

 

enforceability  of  a  judgment  against  the  Belgium  banks,
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

presumably  the  Belgium  banks  will  make  that  argument,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  will  claim  in  Belgium  that  ­­ that  somehow  a
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit  prosecuted  in  the  United  States  in  which  they  were
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

co­conspirators  is  somehow  not  going  to  cover  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity. 

            

Our  point  is  that  it  can't  be  the  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where,  for  centuries,  the  United  States  courts  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open  to  allow  foreign  plaintiffs  to  come  in  alleging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury  caused  by  U.S.  actors  under  U.S.  law,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow  we're  going  to  read  the  Morrison  principle  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  of  constricting  the  available  remedies.  Nothing  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Morrison  suggests  that  you  would  do  that  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritorial  slicing  and  dicing, 
 

 

 

 

where 
 

once  you  had 

 

 

concluded  that  the  underlying  action 
 

 

 

 

 

here 
 

was  one  that 

 

 

observed  and  respected  international 
 

 

 

 

norms 
 

and  went  to 

 

 

extraterritorial  lengths  provided  in 
 

 

 

 

this 
 

case,  that 

 

there  is  a  tie  to  the  United  States. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

  

And 
 

whatever 

remedies  are  available  are  available. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  after  Pfizer,  a  number  of 
 

   

 

 

 

U.S.  companies

were  concerned  about  it,  and  they  went  to  Congress  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  asked  Congress  to  restrict  it.  And  the  hearings 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  have  laid  out  in  our  brief  ­­ and  this  is  page 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45,  note  11  ­­ goes  into  the  legislative  history  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  And  the  State  Department,  Justice  Breyer,  took 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  the  opposite  position,  because  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department  said,  reciprocity  demands  that  we  be  allowed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  go  into  other  nations'  courts  and  the  availability  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  courts  for  foreign  nations  to  come  in  for  violations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  U.S.  And  if  you  look  at  footnote  13,  which  is  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  55,  the  State  Department  testified  to  Congress  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States  had  brought  more  than  50  actions  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nations  around  the  world. 

 

 

 

            

So  the  idea  about  comity  is  one  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respectfully,  is  a  decision  that  is  made  by  Congress, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  is  not  for  the  executive  branch  to  change  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  for  the  purpose  of  trying  to  snuff  out  a  remedy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  otherwise  would  be  available  to  a  foreign 

   

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  Mr.  ­­ Mr.  Frederick, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  understand  that  argument  with  respect  to  what's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  remedial  provision  of  a  statute.  But  this  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

something  a  little  bit  more  than  that,  right?  Because 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute  also  ­­ this  provision  also  includes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  elements  that  don't  apply  except  in  the

civil  suit  for  damages.  Isn't  that  right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

difference? 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  That's  true. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  why  doesn't  that  make  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FREDERICK:  It  could.  And,  Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

Kagan,  if  you  were  to  decide  that  the  three  verbs  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  1962(a),  (b)  and  (c),  which  are  influencing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buying,  or  investing  in,  had  to  have  a  domestic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

component,  we  still  would  satisfy  that,  because  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations  in  the  complaint  are  that  RJR  from  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate  headquarters  in  New  York  and  Winston­Salem  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaging  in  those  conducts  to  effect  and  corrupt  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  enterprise,  or  the  domestic  enterprise,  as  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  with  Brown  &  Williamson. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  if  we  look  just  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1964(c)  and  apply  the  Morrison  analysis  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straightforward  way,  would  that  analysis  work  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way?  There  isn't  any  reference  in  1964(c)  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritorial  application.  And  where  would  be  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

focus  of  1964(c)?  Would  it  be  the  injury  to  business  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

property? 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  So,  Justice  Alito,  I  would 

   

  

 

 

 

have  two  responses.  '64,  1964,  incorporates  directly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

1962.  So  there  is  a  direct  reference  to  the  definition 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  "racketeering"  that  has  the  some  46  predicate  acts

that  have  a  clearly  textual  extraterritorial  effect.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I  think  that  by  incorporation,  you  would  interpret  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  way. 

 

            

And  the  second  thing  is  that  when  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used  that  language  in  1964,  it  was  tracking  the  Clayton 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act.  And  the  Clayton  Act  had  a  ­­ a  predetermined  and 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

pre­understood  meaning  as  to  what  those  words  meant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  at  that  time,  RICO  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  an  extraterritorial  application,  would  it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  No.  My  position  is  that  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

­­ the  extraterritorial  application  has  gotten  stronger 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  time,  but  if  you  were  to  adopt  the  normal  canon  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction,  which  is  that  when  Congress  adopts  words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  statute,  they  carry  with  it  the  meaning  that  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  given  those  words.  The  same  words  are  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clayton  Act  as  they  were  adopted  in  1970,  and  as  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan  pointed  out,  the  case  has  only  become  stronger 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  Money  Laundering  and  post­PATRIOT  Act  additions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  predicate  acts. 

 

 

 

            

But  the  third  answer  I  would  give  you, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito,  is  that  even  in  Morrison  itself,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  opinion  says  once  we  have  found  there  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraterritorial  application,  it's  not  for  us  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  that  there  are  different  provisions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  have  that.  And  that's  essentially  the

argument  that  is  being  made  as  to  take  an  extension  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Morrison  beyond  where  the  Court  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  there  is  a  problem  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  Clayton  Act,  even  at  this  time.  It's  been  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nightmare  for  foreign  countries,  and  there  has  always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  controversy  around  it.  And  there  were  cases  called 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tamburlaine  and  others  which,  you  know,  led  ­­ led  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  kind  of  thing  that  the  SG  has  described  in  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief.  So  the  Clayton  Act  is  helpful  in  one  respect, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  not  helpful  in  the  other  respect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FREDERICK:  And  my  answer  is,  Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

has  addressed  some  of  those  concerns  in  the  antitrust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area  with  various  amendments  that  affect  ­­ that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  go  to  conduct. 

 

 

 

            

And  classically,  what  Congress  is  getting  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  conduct,  not  remedy.  But  in  the  conduct  area,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  has  done  in  one  of  the  antitrust  amendments  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Sherman  Act  was  to  say,  we  are  only  going  to  affect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  conduct  if  it  has  a  domestic  effect,  but  it  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  a  focus  on  conduct  and  not  on  remedy.  Congress  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  well­equipped  to  deal  with  this  issue  should  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed  that  ­­ there  to  be  a  concern,  but  Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  I  would  point  out  that  it  would  be  odd  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppose  that  Congress  is  intending  to  turn  the  United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  into  a  place  where  criminal  activities  could

occur  from  the  United  States  that  was  affecting  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closest  allies  and  there  was  nothing  those  allies  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  about  it  by  going  into  the  United  States  and  trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  vindicate  and  ­­ and  seek  redress  for  those  harms. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  would  be  a  very,  very  stark  departure  from  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country's  long  history  of  having  respect  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  a  remedy  for  foreigners  who  are  harmed  by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions  of  the  United  States  and  its  citizens. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  I  could  just  address  the  ­­ I  think  I've 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

addressed  the  Empagran  question,  because  that's  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  that  was  affected.  And  if  I  could  just  note 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  PATRIOT  Act  ­­ footnote  10  of  our  brief  points 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  that  then­Senator  John  Kerry,  now  Secretary  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State,  was  very  conscious  of  the  effect  that  this  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  on  foreign  nations  and  foreign  litigants.  And  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  PATRIOT  Act  extended  certain  of  these  predicate  acts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  RICO,  he  stated  on  the  floor  ­­ we  cited  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  in  our  brief  ­­ the  reason  for  doing  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  give  foreign  nations  that  had  been  affected  and  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  treaty  allies  an  opportunity  to  come  and  seek 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redress  in  our  courts. 

 

 

 

            

The  last  point  is  that  Mr.  Katsas  noted  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice­of­law  principle,  where  there  is  a  foreign  injury 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  there  is  a  decision  to  apply  foreign  law,  and  he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  why  shouldn't  that  apply  here?  That  only  applies

where  there  is  a  conflict  between  the  laws  that  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  here  ­­ we  are  asserting  that  there  is  a  U.S. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  violation  by  a  U.S.  company  for  actions  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  committed  in  part  in  the  United  States.  There's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  to  apply  a  choice  of  law,  because  you  have  a

asserting  a  violation  of  U.S.  domestic  law. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

In  every  instance  where  Congress  made  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  to  apply  RICO  extraterritorially,  it  imposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  domestic  proof  requirements.  That  is  the

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  GREGORY  G.  KATSAS 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KATSAS:  Justice  Breyer,  you  asked  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

government's  positions. 

 

            

The  United  States  is  the  party  that  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

live  with  the  consequences  of  your  decision  one  way  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other.  They  are  telling  you  here  that  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comity  problem  with  respect  ­­ there  is  no  inconsistency 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  what  they  said  before.  In  Empagran,  they  told  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  thing:  That  providing  remedies  for  foreign

injuries  caused  by  largely  foreign  conduct  would  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem. 

            

The  EU  is  here  as  a  party  in  this  case,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  a  look  at  what  they  said  in  many  other  cases  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  in  the  more  detached  position:  As  an  amicus 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  OBB,  in  Kiobel,  in  Sosa,  and  most  importantly,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Empagran  itself,  which  is  the  case  involving  foreign 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injuries  caused  by  largely  foreign  conduct.  They  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  case  there  would  be  a  huge  comity  problem  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extending  American  law. 

 

 

            

With  regard  to  comity,  Justice  Kagan,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked  is  it  ­­ is  it  too  policy­ish.  It's  not  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  all  of  these  background  presumptions  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles.  I  spoke  about  the  presumption  against 

    

 

 

 

 

extraterritoriality  and  about  the  common  law  background 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule  of  lex  loci  delicti. 

 

 

 

 

              

A  third  principle  is  the  Charming  Betsy 

 

 

 

 

 

canon,  that  you  construe  Federal  statutes  not  to  violate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international  law  absent  a  very  clear  statement  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary,  and  that's  what  we  have  here,  because  Empagran 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  that  applying  U.S.  law  to  provide  redress  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  injuries  caused  by  largely  foreign  conduct  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  unreasonable,  and  therefore,  a  violation  of  customary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

international  law. 

 

            

You  also  ask  why  draw  the  line  at  injury?

Once  you  established  the  underlying,  the  underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate  applies  extraterritorially. 

 

 

            

First  reason  is  that  the  decision  to  create 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  private  right  of  action  is  ­­ is  different  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  to  criminalize  the  conduct.  The  money 

  

 

 

 

 

 

laundering  statute  applies  extraterritorially,  but 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  private  right  of  action  for  people  injured  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  laundry. 

 

            

The  second  reason  is  that  Empagran  applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  principle  to  the  question  of  injury,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  does  so  with  regard  to  the  very  antitrust 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  that  were  in  effect  pre­1982,  in  effect  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RICO  was  enacted  to  say  there's  this  category  of  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  foreign  injury  where  the  government  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecute  but  the  private  party  cannot  bring  an  action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  civil  redress. 

 

 

            

And  that's  an  important  distinction 

 

 

 

 

precisely  because  private  parties  are  not  constrained  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutorial  discretion.  It  is  aggressive  to  apply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

American  criminal  law,  but  at  least  the  government  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Justice  Department  has  to  talk  to  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department  and  take  into  account  any  comity  concerns, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  problems  that  particular  prosecutions  might  bring. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  not  the  case  with  respect  to  private  plaintiffs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Go  ahead.

MR.  KATSAS:  Mr.  Frederick  said  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

underlying  predicates  here  track  international  law. 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  true  to  ­­ in  the  sense  that  they  are  written  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  consistent  with  Section  402  of  the  third  restatement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Foreign  Relations,  but  there  is  an  independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  that  the  application  in  a  particular  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

must  be  reasonable  under  Section  403.  That  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  that  you  invoked  in  Empagran.  That  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  ­­ that  is  the  problem  with  this  case  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Finally,  Mr.  Frederick  said  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

involves  United  States  conduct.  Petitioners  are  four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

transactions  removed  from  the  original  problem  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Europe,  and  two  transactions  removed  from  the  cigarette 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sales.  All  of  ­­ all  of  those  involve  European 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions.  And  Reynolds'  alleged  conduct  involves 

  

 

 

 

 

transactions  in  Europe,  Central  and  South  America. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted. 

 

 

 

            

(Whereupon,  at  12:16  p.m.,  the  case  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above­entitled  matter  was  submitted.)
